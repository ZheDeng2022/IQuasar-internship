  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity are major problems and their complications such as cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus pose great burdens on healthcare systems. There is&#xD;
      accumulating evidence to support obesity being a chronic inflammatory disorder mediated in&#xD;
      part by the expansion of adipose (fat) tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to adipocytes (fat cells), adipose tissue contains a whole range of other cell&#xD;
      types including some immune (white blood) cells. The relative proportions of immune cell&#xD;
      subpopulations and interactions between the different cell types within adipose tissue may be&#xD;
      important in the development of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research by the investigators has suggested that there may be important differences&#xD;
      in the activation status of certain immune cells located in adipose tissue with increased&#xD;
      overweight and the production of leptin - an appetite regulating hormone. Properties of&#xD;
      adipose tissue and inflammatory cells located within it may therefore be sensitive to changes&#xD;
      in our nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to investigate changes in T cell activation in adipose&#xD;
      tissue alongside other immunometabolic properties before and after a short period of dieting&#xD;
      compared to changes in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include males aged between 35-55 years old who meet the criteria for&#xD;
      inclusion. After taking some preliminary measurements and monitoring of normal daily&#xD;
      activities, participants will reduce their calorie intake to 50 % of their normal&#xD;
      intake/requirements for 3 consecutive days and will attend 1 session of Laboratory testing&#xD;
      before and 1 after this period which will take place in the Physiology Laboratories at the&#xD;
      University of Bath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped that investigating immunometabolic responses within adipose tissue following an&#xD;
      acute nutritional challenge will help lead to a better understanding of the development of&#xD;
      diseases associated with being overweight and ultimately help in the development of more&#xD;
      effective methods for prevention and treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to investigate whether the immunometabolic properties of adipose&#xD;
      tissue and the inflammatory cells located within it can be modified by short term changes in&#xD;
      nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following advertisement of the study, interested potential participants will be asked to&#xD;
      contact the Chief Investigator for further information via email/telephone correspondence.&#xD;
      There will be an initial assessment of eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion criteria and,&#xD;
      if these requirements are met, the potential participant will be invited to a meeting to&#xD;
      further discuss the trial. After they have read the participant information sheet and seen&#xD;
      the flowchart outlining the timeline for the study, if they would like to take part, they&#xD;
      will be asked to sign a consent form. Dates will then be scheduled for some preliminary&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements, 1 week of diet and physical activity monitoring and 3 days of&#xD;
      calorie restriction with trial dates either side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary testing will include anthropometric measurements of height, weight, waist and hip&#xD;
      circumferences, sagittal waist height and blood pressure. Participants will also have their&#xD;
      body composition precisely assessed using a dual energy X-ray absorptiometer (DEXA). These&#xD;
      measurements will take place at the University of Bath Physiology Laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of energy balance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 1 week, participants will be fitted with a physical activity monitor (Actiheartâ„¢) and&#xD;
      asked to record a corresponding diary of their physical activity during this period to aid&#xD;
      its interpretation and allow a more accurate calculation of average daily activity energy&#xD;
      expenditure. Participants will also be asked to record their food and drink intake during&#xD;
      this period so their corresponding energy intake during this period can be analysed and thus&#xD;
      their 'energy balance' can be estimated. Participants should not make any conscious changes&#xD;
      to their normal lifestyle habits/routines during this period. This analysis will then be used&#xD;
      to write a 'diet prescription' for the 3 days to ensure the participant will receive 50 % of&#xD;
      their 'normal' calorie intake using foods they would normally consume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main trial day 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 2 days prior to the first main trial day, participants should refrain from performing&#xD;
      any strenuous physical activity. In the 24 hours prior, participants should also refrain from&#xD;
      consuming any alcohol or caffeine. Participants should arrive at the Physiology Resting&#xD;
      Laboratory in the morning following a 10 hour fast (approximately 8 am) where blood pressure&#xD;
      will be measured and a saliva sample collected. A cannula will be inserted into a forearm&#xD;
      vein and baseline blood sample(s) taken for analysis of metabolic/inflammatory markers and&#xD;
      isolation of T cells. A fat sample will also be obtained using a needle aspiration technique.&#xD;
      The participant will then be asked to consume a glucose drink consisting of 75 g anhydrous&#xD;
      glucose (113 mL Polycal and 87 mL of water) and a cannula blood sample taken every 15 minutes&#xD;
      for the following 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention - 3 day calorie restriction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the following 3 days, participants will be instructed to consume a diet calculated to be&#xD;
      50% of their 'normal' energy intake by reducing the proportions of the normal diet consumed.&#xD;
      No strenuous physical activity should be performed by the participant for the last 2 days of&#xD;
      this 3 day period and on the final day of this intervention, no caffeine or alcohol should be&#xD;
      consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main trial day 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following day after the 3 days of calorie restriction, participants will arrive at the&#xD;
      laboratory at the same time as on main trial day 1 (to minimise variation in timing of sample&#xD;
      collection) and will undergo exactly the same procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the trial whole blood will be analysed for white blood cell count. Plasma and&#xD;
      serum samples will be extracted from the whole blood via centrifugation and stored at -80&#xD;
      degrees C. Monocytes and T lymphocytes (populations of white blood cells) will also be&#xD;
      isolated from whole blood and stored to later assess changes in their proportions and&#xD;
      activation following the calorie restriction period. In each fat sample, separate portions of&#xD;
      either adipose tissue or adipocytes (isolated from the other cells within the adipose tissue&#xD;
      using a digestion method) will be cultured and media collected for later investigations. The&#xD;
      remaining cells from the adipose tissue (SVF) will also be stored for later analysis of cell&#xD;
      populations and their activation using flow cytometry, and expression/secretion analysis.&#xD;
      mRNA expression will also be examined in adipose tissue.&#xD;
