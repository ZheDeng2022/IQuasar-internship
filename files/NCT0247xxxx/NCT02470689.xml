  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidermolysis bullosa simplex type Dowling-Meara (EBS-DM) is one of the most severe subtypes&#xD;
      of EBS. Blisters and erosions of the skin and mucous membranes upon minor trauma are the&#xD;
      consequence of dominantly inherited mutations in either the keratin 5 (K5) or keratin 14&#xD;
      (K14) gene, which encode proteins constituting the intermediate filament (IF) network in&#xD;
      basal keratinocytes . Autosomal dominant mutations lead to a conformational change and an&#xD;
      increased self-aggregation of the protein. Upon stress, aggregates present in the periphery&#xD;
      of the cytoplasm, subsequently leading to the disintegration and collapse of the IF network.&#xD;
      Clinically, patients suffer from blistering of the skin and mucous membranes upon minor&#xD;
      trauma, resulting in an impaired life quality due to pain and pruritus . In vitro studies on&#xD;
      Dowling-Meara keratinocytes revealed a significant upregulation of the pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß). Apart from paracrine effects of IL-1ß upon wounding (e.g.&#xD;
      attraction of lymphocytes, activation of dermal fibroblasts), IL-1ß also activates&#xD;
      keratinocytes via the cjun N-terminal kinase (JNK) stress pathway. The activation of this&#xD;
      pathway leads to the activation of a number of transcription factors and the enhanced&#xD;
      transcription of a number of genes, like matrix metalloproteinases, kallikreins, but also&#xD;
      IL-1ß itself and K14 . Interestingly, this state of activation is constitutive and was also&#xD;
      found in keratinocytes from non-lesional sites. It seems that the upregulation of IL-1ß and&#xD;
      K14 in the presence of dominant Dowling-Meara mutations, results in a positive feedback loop,&#xD;
      potentially aggravating the EBS-DM phenotype. This was strongly corroborated by the fact that&#xD;
      when impairing IL1ß signaling, using IL-1ß neutralizing antibody (IL-1Ab) or the small&#xD;
      molecule diacerein, expression levels of IL-1ß and K14 decreased and keratinocytes were much&#xD;
      less susceptible to heat shock in vitro . Furthermore, activation levels of JNK widely&#xD;
      correlated with expression levels of K14 and IL-1ß. (Wally V et al, 2013). These findings led&#xD;
      to the hypothesis that blocking IL-1ß will also lead to an amelioration of the EBSDM&#xD;
      phenotype in effected patients. Based on previous in vitro findings diacerein was chosen to&#xD;
      be topically applied in a pilot study with five patients suffering from EBS-DM. In that study&#xD;
      , each participant received 1% diacerein-cream for one armpit, and placebo for the other&#xD;
      (randomized withdrawal). The number of blisters was reduced significantly (left: -78%; right:&#xD;
      -66% of baseline) within two weeks and remained significantly below the initial level even&#xD;
      during withdrawal in four patients. These findings pointed to a relevant effect of diacerein&#xD;
      and provide important information for our confirmative study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diacerein is a component of the rhubarb root, which is reported to block the release of&#xD;
      active IL-1b by inhibiting plasma membrane-bound IL-1 converting enzyme . Diacerien is&#xD;
      already approved for systemic application in osteoarthritis . In general, small molecules&#xD;
      (SM) are low molecular weight compounds with biological functions that can influence&#xD;
      molecular processes. They allow a symptomatic treatment, offering a short-term benefit for&#xD;
      patients in terms of an amelioration of the phenotype. Although this kind of treatment does&#xD;
      not correct genetic alterations, it can still be highly beneficial by damping down disease&#xD;
      symptoms, thereby increasing life quality and minimizing secondary manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to emphasize that besides dressings, there are currently no other treatments,&#xD;
      therefore, investigators do not prevent an accepted treatment for the patient and there is no&#xD;
      risk for the participant. The treatment will be given only to the armpits although the&#xD;
      disease can involve other areas, so stopping dressings in the armpits during the study does&#xD;
      not risk the patient. Should there be any deterioration of the patient, whether it is related&#xD;
      to the treatment with diacerein or not, investigators will stop the use of diacerein.&#xD;
