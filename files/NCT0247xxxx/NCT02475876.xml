    <textblock>
      Developmental changes in physiology during childhood influence drug dosing. Failure to&#xD;
      account for these changes leads to improper dosing, which is associated with decreased drug&#xD;
      efficacy and safety in children. Population physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)&#xD;
      modeling offers the opportunity to predict optimal drug dosing based on physiologic&#xD;
      parameters adjusted for developmental changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PBPK models are mathematical constructs that incorporate physiologic processes with drug&#xD;
      characteristics and genetic variances to characterize the dose-exposure relationship across&#xD;
      the age continuum. These models integrate drug-specific (e.g., metabolism, protein binding)&#xD;
      and systems-specific (e.g., organ size, blood flow) information to predict the effect of&#xD;
      different factors (e.g., age, genetic variants, disease) on drug exposure. By accounting for&#xD;
      these factors and using data from clinical trials to confirm the modeling, PBPK models can&#xD;
      reduce the number of children needed for clinical trials while maximizing dose-based efficacy&#xD;
      and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will evaluate a platform to prospectively validate population PBPK models in&#xD;
      children. The study drugs, clindamycin and Bactrim (aka TMP-SMX), are ideal candidates to&#xD;
      evaluate population PBPK models in children due to their differing physico-chemical&#xD;
      properties and elimination pathways. In addition, a trial of clindamycin and TMP-SMX has&#xD;
      broad clinical applicability, as both drugs are among the most commonly used agents to treat&#xD;
      gram-positive infections in infants and children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a PK and safety study in infants and children requiring prophylaxis of, or treatment&#xD;
      for confirmed or suspected infection with clindamycin or TMP-SMX. Each subject will be&#xD;
      involved in the study for up to 33 days (3 days of therapy, 30 days for serious adverse event&#xD;
      monitoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline/pre-dose assessment - After the parent or legally authorized representative has&#xD;
      signed the IRB-approved informed consent form and after it has been determined that the&#xD;
      subject satisfies all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, the following evaluations will be&#xD;
      recorded in the CRF:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subject demographics including sex, date of birth, race, and ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For infants â‰¤12 months of age: gestational age (GA) and body weight at birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Active medical history (from admission note in medical record)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Concomitant medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. For subjects receiving study drugs per standard of care, record the last 6 doses of&#xD;
           clindamycin or TMP-SMX received prior to study drug administration (date, time, route of&#xD;
           administration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Targeted physical examination, including weight and length/height&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Laboratory determinations within 48 hours prior to enrollment if performed per local&#xD;
           standard of care. If serum creatinine was not collected as standard of care, it will be&#xD;
           collected for this study to confirm eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Microbiology determinations within 48 hours prior to enrollment if performed per local&#xD;
           standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment assessments/procedures (Day 1-3) - The following assessments will be conducted each&#xD;
      day while the subject is on study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Date, time, route, site of administration, dose, and formulation of each study drug dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Concomitant medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PK sampling (blood and urine) with date, time, and site of collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Genetic sampling (once)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Laboratory determinations if performed per standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Microbiologic determinations if performed per standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Serum sample for determination of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein concentration for subjects&#xD;
           enrolled in the clindamycin arm only. Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein concentration will be&#xD;
           measured in one of the plasma PK samples. A separate blood sample is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Study drug-related adverse events AEs and SAEs If available, record laboratory&#xD;
           determinations daily; if several laboratory determinations are available for the same&#xD;
           day, record test results closest to administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK SAMPLING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma pharmacokinetics sampling scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clindamycin: Sample collection windows are relative to the start of the infusion for IV&#xD;
      clindamycin, except for the first post-infusion sample, which is relative to the end of the&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three plasma PK samples will be collected around the first dose according to the following&#xD;
      sampling windows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0-10 minutes after the end of the first dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2-4 hours after the start of the first dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt;30 minutes prior to second dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four plasma PK samples will be collected any time after dose 6 according to the following&#xD;
      sampling windows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0-10 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2-4 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt;30 minutes prior to next scheduled dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      While treatment with IV clindamycin is necessary for inclusion in the clindamycin arm of the&#xD;
      study, subjects may transition from IV to oral clindamycin and be eligible for PK sample&#xD;
      collection during the oral phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMP-SMX: Sample collection windows are relative to the administration of oral TMP-SMX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three plasma PK samples will be collected around the first dose according to the following&#xD;
      sampling windows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1-3 hours after the end of the first dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-8 hours after the start of the first dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt;30 minutes prior to second dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four plasma PK samples will be collected any time after dose 6 according to the following&#xD;
      sampling windows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1-3 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-8 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt;30 minutes prior to next scheduled dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine PK samples - Urine PK samples are not required for a subject to complete the study. If&#xD;
      possible, every effort should be made to collect urine PK samples according to the following&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clindamycin IV: One urine sample will be collected as timed aliquots of all urine excreted&#xD;
      during one of the following intervals after dose 6:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0-2 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2-4 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4-8 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMP-SMX: One urine sample will be collected as timed aliquots of all urine excreted during&#xD;
      one of the following intervals after dose 6:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0-3 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3-6 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-9 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  9-12 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opportunistic PK samples - Opportunistic samples of bone, skin, and synovial fluid will also&#xD;
      be collected if obtained per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling for genotyping - All blood pellets left over after centrifugation of each plasma PK&#xD;
      samples will be collected and combined into one whole blood pellet sample per subject. This&#xD;
      combined whole blood pellet will be sent for genetic analysis of single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms in the CYP3A family and CYP2C9 genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug will be included in the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat (ITT) population used for the safety analysis. All subjects who provide at&#xD;
      least 1 evaluable PK sample will be included in the PK analysis. Descriptive statistics such&#xD;
      as number of observations, mean, median, standard deviation, standard error, minimum, and&#xD;
      maximum will be presented for continuous variables (such as age, weight, etc.). Other&#xD;
      descriptive statistics such as counts, proportions, and/or percentages will be presented to&#xD;
      summarize discrete variables (such as race, sex, etc.). All descriptive analyses will be&#xD;
      presented by appropriate treatment group (ITT or per-protocol) and overall. A detailed&#xD;
      description of statistical methods and secondary analyses will be prepared and presented in&#xD;
      the statistical analysis plan prior to data lock for final analyses.&#xD;
