  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuraxial analgesia (most commonly continuous epidural or combined spinal epidural) is the&#xD;
      most effective modality available for pain relief during labor. Accidental dural puncture&#xD;
      (ADP) with a large bore epidural needle and the resulting post-dural puncture headache (PDPH)&#xD;
      is one of the most significant sources of anesthesia-related morbidity in parturients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidural blood patch (EBP) is the gold standard for treatment of PDPH, and although almost&#xD;
      always effective, can result in another ADP, as well as low back pain and lower extremity&#xD;
      pain. For this reason, effective measures to prevent PDPH when ADP occurs would be highly&#xD;
      valuable. One small study in which 50 women were randomly allocated to receive 2 epidural&#xD;
      injections of morphine or saline, demonstrated a beneficial effect of epidural morphine in&#xD;
      decreasing the incidence of PDPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine the efficacy of 2 doses of neuraxial (either epidural (EPID) or&#xD;
      intrathecal) preservative-free morphine (PFM) to prevent headache after ADP in parturients.&#xD;

      This will be a prospective, randomized, double blind clinical trial. Subjects will be ASA I&#xD;
      and II women (per American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System&#xD;
      or ASA) aged 18 years and older, who are known to have had ADP with an epidural needle during&#xD;
      placement of neuraxial labor analgesia, and have either an intrathecal catheter or epidural&#xD;
      catheter in situ. Patients will be randomized to either receive PFM or placebo (sterile&#xD;
      normal saline (NS or SAL)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with an epidural catheter, the group &quot;EPID PFM&quot; will receive 3 mg (6 ml) of PFM,&#xD;
      followed by 3 ml of sterile normal saline to be administered through the epidural catheter.&#xD;
      The placebo group, &quot;EPID NS&quot;, will receive 6 ml of sterile normal saline via the epidural&#xD;
      catheter followed by another 3 ml NS. For patients with an intrathecal catheter, the group,&#xD;
      &quot;IT PFM&quot; will receive 200 micrograms (mcg) (0.4 ml) of preservative-free morphine, followed&#xD;
      by a flush of the catheter with 2 ml of sterile saline. The placebo group will receive 0.4 ml&#xD;
      and then 2 ml of sterile normal saline through the intrathecal catheter. Sixteen to 24 hours&#xD;
      after receiving the first study drug, patients in all groups will be visited by an&#xD;
      investigator, and then daily thereafter during the hospital admission. They will be evaluated&#xD;
      for the presence of headache, analgesia requirements, need for EBP and the severity of opioid&#xD;
      side effects. As long as the patient is afebrile, has not been experiencing severe opioid&#xD;
      side effects and the catheter is in place and intact, the patient will then receive the&#xD;
      identical study drug (for a total of two doses). The epidural/intrathecal catheter will be&#xD;
      removed immediately after the second administration of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge, the patient will be followed up once daily by telephone for up to a minimum&#xD;
      of 5 days after receiving the last dose of the study drug if they remain headache free, and&#xD;
      for a minimum of 3 days after resolution of PDPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective randomized double blind clinical trial. The primary outcome will&#xD;
      be the incidence of PDPH at 48 hours after ADP. The primary outcome of the trial is the&#xD;
      incidence of PDPH at 48 hours after ADP. We will consider a difference in incidence of PDPH&#xD;
      between the placebo and treatment groups of 25 % to be significant, based on the findings of&#xD;
      Al Metwalli et al. (Anaesthesia. 2008; 63(8):847-50), and the meta-analysis by Heesen et al.&#xD;
      (Int J Obstet Anesth. 2013 ; 22(1):26-30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimates of PDPH rate after ADP range from 50 to 85%. Our rate at CUMC for the past several&#xD;
      years is 66% (OB Anesthesia Division QA data). For calculation of our sample size, we&#xD;
      determined that an absolute 25% decrease in PDPH would be clinically significant (i.e., 66%&#xD;
      to ~40%). For a power of 90% and an alpha of 0.05, this requires 83 subjects per group (2&#xD;
      epidural groups compared to each other, 2 spinal groups compared to each other). We are not&#xD;
      specifically powering this for comparison of the spinal to the epidural groups, although we&#xD;
      will likely be able to do so. We therefore, aim to recruit 100 subjects per group (for a&#xD;
      total of 400 across all centers) assuming 10-15% of subjects may be lost because of&#xD;
      inadvertent withdrawal of the catheter, subject withdrawal, or lost to follow up after&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is intended to be a multicenter study involving 5 academic tertiary hospitals, having&#xD;
      &gt;2,000 vaginal deliveries per year. Since the rate of accidental dural puncture is between 1&#xD;
      and 2%, we estimate we should be able to recruit 100 subjects per year. Categorical data&#xD;
      (presence or absence of dural puncture headache, need for epidural blood patch) will be&#xD;
      analyzed using Chi-square analysis.&#xD;
