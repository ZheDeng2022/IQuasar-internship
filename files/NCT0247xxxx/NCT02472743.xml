  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digital (finger) ulcers are common in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and causes much&#xD;
      pain and affects how patients use their hands. Our current treatments for digital ulcers are&#xD;
      often not effective and have may have significant side effects (because they increase blood&#xD;
      flow to the ulcer to try and help healing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Light-based treatment has been successfully used to treat chronic diabetic, pressure and&#xD;
      venous ulcers. The investigators wish to investigate whether light-based treatment is a safe&#xD;
      and effective treatment for digital ulcers in patients with SSc.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study design This is an open pilot study: all participants will receive the light-based&#xD;
      treatment (visits 1-6 inclusive). Ten participants with at least one digital ulcer (more than&#xD;
      one digital ulcer may be assessed in the study if located on the same hand) will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of sample size There are no pilot data to inform a power calculation. Paired&#xD;
      measurements on 10 participants gives 90% power to detect a clinically meaningful change in&#xD;
      VAS of 2 points at the 5% significance level, provided that the observed standard deviation&#xD;
      in paired differences is 1.7 or less. If the observed standard deviation is 2.0, this sample&#xD;
      size gives 80% power to detect such a change at the stated significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits schedule Participants will attend a total of 8 study visits over two months.&#xD;
      Light treatment will be administered twice weekly for three weeks (i.e. the first 6 study&#xD;
      visits only). Follow-up visits will be at 1 month (visit 7) and 2 months (visit 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation Participants will be asked to abstain from caffeine-containing drinks and from&#xD;
      smoking for at least 4 hours prior to study. Sterile gauze and/or water may be used by the&#xD;
      investigators (using gloves) to clean the surface of the wound of any debris that could&#xD;
      potentially interfere with the light-based treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of the light-based device to the digital ulcer Both the participant and&#xD;
      investigators will wear appropriate safety goggles (as advised by Medical Physics at Salford&#xD;
      Royal NHS Foundation Trust [SRFT]) at all times whilst the light-based device is in&#xD;
      operation. The participant will place their hand within the treatment area of the light-based&#xD;
      device (total treatment area approximately 15cm2), aiming to centralise the digital ulcer/s&#xD;
      to the centre of the treatment region. The device will be controlled by a custom-built&#xD;
      computer interface. At each study visit, the device will undergo a period of (automatic)&#xD;
      calibration before use. All three wavelengths (red, infrared and blue) will be delivered&#xD;
      simultaneously in combination, with the fluence of the device set at [3J/cm2] (treatment&#xD;
      duration approximately 10 to 15 minutes). Performance data on the light-based treatment&#xD;
      (including the total dose delivered and the performance of the LEDs will be recorded. In the&#xD;
      event of catastrophic failure of the device (e.g. failure of multiple LEDs), the device will&#xD;
      automatically shut down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant and investigator assessment of feasibility Participant and the investigators&#xD;
      opinion of the feasibility of light-based treatment will be recorded (at the end of the first&#xD;
      and last treatment study visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant and investigator assessment of tolerability Participant and investigator opinion&#xD;
      of the tolerability of light-based treatment will be recorded (at the end of the first and&#xD;
      last treatment study visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant and investigator opinion Participant and investigator global assessments of the&#xD;
      digital ulcer will be performed on a visual analogue scale (0-10, 10 being most severe) at&#xD;
      each study visit. A clinical photograph (see immediately below) will be independently scored&#xD;
      at a later date by another investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Photography The Clinical Photography department at SRFT will take a photograph of&#xD;
      the digital ulcer/s at the end of each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-frequency ultrasound (HFUS) Will be performed immediately by the investigator after the&#xD;
      light-treatment has been delivered and at the follow up visits. The investigator will perform&#xD;
      two 'scans' along the short and long axis of the ulcer and use these to make measurements&#xD;
      (basal and superficial width/length and volume).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser Doppler imaging (LDI) Will be performed by the investigator immediately before and&#xD;
      directly after treatment (at the digital ulcer site and the corresponding contralateral arm&#xD;
      position) at all visits to measure ulcer perfusion.&#xD;
