      The aim of this study is to measure plasma levels of essential vitamins, trace elements and&#xD;
      amino acids in critically ill patients with severe AKI. In patients who are treated with&#xD;
      continuous renal replacement therapy, we plan to evaluate whether there are any additional&#xD;
      losses of nutrients into the filtrate.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) have a high risk of dying,&#xD;
      especially if renal replacement therapy (RRT) is needed. It remains uncertain whether&#xD;
      essential trace elements, vitamins and amino acids are lost during RRT in sufficient amounts&#xD;
      to result in clinically significant deficiencies. At present, nutrition guidelines for&#xD;
      patients with AKI on RRT do not account for any potential losses of micronutrients across the&#xD;
      filter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically ill patients with AKI have inadequate plasma nutrient levels. If continuous renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy (CRRT) is required, there are additional losses of essential nutrients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To serially measure plasma levels of essential vitamins, trace elements and amino acids in&#xD;
      critically ill patients with severe AKI and to evaluate whether there are any additional&#xD;
      losses into the filtrate during CRRT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform serial measurements of plasma levels of selenium, zinc, copper, iron, vitamins B1,&#xD;
      B6, B12, C and D, folic acid and essential amino acids in all patients with severe AKI and to&#xD;
      measure any losses of the same nutrients in the filtrate in a cohort of patients on CRRT for&#xD;
      &gt;24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      level 3 critically ill adult patients with severe AKI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 patients of whom 20 patients are treated with CRRT for &gt;24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      observational non-interventional study in at least 2 large tertiary care centres in the&#xD;
      United Kingdom&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: difference in plasma concentrations of essential trace elements and vitamins&#xD;
      between patients with and without CRRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: a) concentrations of trace elements, vitamins and amino acids in filtrate&#xD;
      in patients on CRRT; b) differences in filtrate losses between patients on CRRT â‰¤30ml/kg/hr&#xD;
      versus &gt;30ml/kg/hr.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of baseline plasma Selenium, Zinc, Copper, iron, Vitamins B1, B6, B12, C and D,&#xD;
      folic acid and essential amino acids levels and repeat serial measurement of the same panel&#xD;
      of nutrients in all patients for up to 6 days with additional concomitant measurement of&#xD;
      nutrient levels in filtrate in cohort of patients on CRRT. In addition, daily measurement of&#xD;
      serum electrolytes, liver profile, serum albumin and c-reactive protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recording of the following potential confounders: type of nutrition, dose of CRRT, type of&#xD;
      membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of the change in plasma nutrient levels over 6 days, and between baseline and&#xD;
      24 - 144 hours after initiation of CRRT. The estimates will be used to inform the design of&#xD;
      an intervention study exploring the value of nutrient supplementation.&#xD;
