      The study is a prospective, observational study evaluating the utility of endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound or MRI for the identification of preneoplastic and neoplastic pancreatic lesions&#xD;
      in patients at high risk for pancreatic cancer, specifically those with BRCA1/2, ATM, or&#xD;
      PALB2 mutations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) has emerged as a critical component in the imaging, staging, and&#xD;
      diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Not only can EUS delineate a mass utilizing sonography&#xD;
      through the wall of the stomach or duodenum, but it also can obtain diagnostic fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration of suspicious lesions. Especially in patients with incomplete visualization of a&#xD;
      mass on cross-sectional imaging, EUS can provide valuable anatomic information prior to&#xD;
      surgical exploration. While several studies have demonstrated that EUS has high sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity in diagnosing pancreatic masses, head-to-head comparisons with established&#xD;
      modalities like CT have been often methodologically flawed. In a meta-analysis, it was found&#xD;
      that of 4 studies that assessed resectability, 2 showed no difference and 1 favored each&#xD;
      modality. As such, estimates of accuracy for assessing preoperative resectability have also&#xD;
      ranged in several studies from 63-93%. As such it has been recognized as an accepted modality&#xD;
      for the evaluation of potential pancreatic malignany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While screening in the general population is not feasible given the low incidence of PDAC,&#xD;
      screening in high risk cohorts may allow for early detection of resectable, and potentially&#xD;
      curable tumors. Clinical outcome of patients with smaller, non-metastasized tumors have a&#xD;
      significantly improved 5-year survival. Generally the current recommendation is that patients&#xD;
      who are first degree relatives of patients with PDAC from a familial PDAC kindred with at&#xD;
      least 2 affected first-degree relatives, patients with Peutz-Jegher's syndrome, and patients&#xD;
      with CDKN2A/BRCA1/BRCA2/ATM/PALB2/Lynch mutations with a first or second degree relative with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer would qualify for screening in the context of the CAPS5 trial. However,&#xD;
      very recent evidence in a large Canadian study of pancreatic cancer patients demonstrated&#xD;
      germline carrier status for BRCA1/2, and ATM in their cohort was associated with first degree&#xD;
      relatives with breast and colorectal cancer but not pancreatic cancer, suggesting that we may&#xD;
      have to re-evaluate criteria for pancreatic cancer screening in this population. Thus, the&#xD;
      risk of pancreatic cancer development in this cohort of patients would not be addressed by&#xD;
      the CAPS5 protocol, but would uniquely be addressed in our proposed study. In terms of&#xD;
      modality, interval, and age to start/stop, there remains debate but generally annual EUS/MRI&#xD;
      has been utilized. Therefore, amongst patients with increased risk of pancreatic cancer, like&#xD;
      those with BRCA1/2, ATM, or PALB2 mutations, the successful identification of early&#xD;
      neoplastic/preneoplastic lesions of the pancreas would allow for timely intervention and&#xD;
      improved survival in this cohort and thus would be of high clinical relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus we propose to utilize the unique cohort of increased risk patients followed at the&#xD;
      University of Pennsylvania, to identify patients with BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, or PALB2 mutations,&#xD;
      regardless of family history of pancreatic cancer, and enroll them on an annual prospective&#xD;
      pancreatic screening program. The hypothesis is that through early screening interventions,&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality from this under-recognized malignancy in this high-risk patient&#xD;
      population will be reduced.&#xD;
