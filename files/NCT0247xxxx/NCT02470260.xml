  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and their related conditions, adiposity and insulin&#xD;
      resistance, are more prevalent in minorities Northern Manhattan compared to the general&#xD;
      population of the United States. Despite knowledge of the main biologic determinants of these&#xD;
      conditions (high caloric intake and sedentarism) the prevalence of these conditions continue&#xD;
      to increase. In addition, these conditions can cause mental health problems including&#xD;
      increased depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment. Thus, the investigators decided to&#xD;
      conduct a community based study of middle aged Hispanic men and women aged 50 to 64 years at&#xD;
      baseline in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Document the prevalence and incidence, of pre-diabetes, diabetes, overweight, obesity,&#xD;
           and associated conditions (e.g. dyslipidemia, hypertension).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study how social determinants of health (SDOH) affect these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study the consequences of these conditions on aging and mental health outcomes,&#xD;
           including cognitive impairment.&#xD;

      DESIGN OVERVIEW: the Northern Manhattan Study of Metabolism and Mind (NOMEM) is a&#xD;
      longitudinal cohort study of middle aged Hispanics. Recruitment of the initial cohort of 600&#xD;
      participants was completed between January of 2012 and December of 2013. Our total target&#xD;
      sample size is 1000 participants. Participants are followed every 2 years. Participants are&#xD;
      self-identified Hispanic men and women aged 50 to 65 years. The sampling frame is the&#xD;
      community of Northern Manhattan in New York City.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo phlebotomy, measurement of vital signs and anthropometric measures,&#xD;
      interviews of medical history, cognitive assessments, and interviews of social determinants&#xD;
      of health and mental and physical conditions. Assessments take between 2 and 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VARIABLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glycemia and diabetes status: glycemia is measured with HbA1c. Diabetes is defined by&#xD;
           clinical history or by HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, following 2010 ADA criteria. Pre-diabetes is&#xD;
           determined following ADA 2010 criteria (HbA1c 5.7 to 6.4%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  APOE genotyping: The 3 APOE alleles will be genotyped, ε2, ε3, and ε4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body Mass Index (BMI). Standing height is measured using a stadiometer calibrated in cm.&#xD;
           Body weight is measured using a balance beam scale calibrated in kg. With the&#xD;
           participant standing, measurements are taken to the nearest 0.1 kg of weight with a&#xD;
           balance scale and height without shoes to nearest 0.5 cm, to calculate BMI&#xD;
           (weight/height2). (use: covariate, ancillary studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic variables: We collect date of birth, sex, years and education, racial group,&#xD;
           and country of origin (following the 2010 census format for Hispanics) (use:&#xD;
           covariates).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression: We measure depression and depressive symptoms using the PHQ9 and the PROMIS&#xD;
           depression scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High sensitivity CRP: Measured using ELISA (Diagnostic systems laboratories, INC,&#xD;
           Webster, Texas). The assay sensitivity is 1.6 ng/ml, the inter-assay CV is 11.7%, and&#xD;
           the intra-assay CV is 4.6%. This assay can be conducted in serum or plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipids: total cholesterol (TC), HDL. TC and HDL are measured using enzymatic&#xD;
           colorimetric methods (Vitros; Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history.This includes vascular disease, cancer, and smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medications: We will record medications, vitamins, and over the counter products (use:&#xD;
           covariate, ancillary studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting blood pressure (BP): BP will be measured using an automated oscillometric&#xD;
           device; 3 measurements are obtained at 1-minute intervals in a seated position after 5&#xD;
           minutes of rest. The average of the 2nd and 3rd measurements will be recorded as the BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Waist and hip circumference: Waist circumference is measured at the level of the&#xD;
           umbilicus. Hip circumference is measured at the level of maximal protrusion of the&#xD;
           gluteal muscles. Waist-hip ratio is calculated as the ratio of waist circumference to&#xD;
           hip circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive battery:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  WAIS-R Similarities. This Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised subtest has&#xD;
                good norms and is a standard portion of a dementia evaluation. The items have been&#xD;
                translated into Spanish and a scoring guide has been developed. Age-Scaled scores&#xD;
                will be used. [Max. Score=19; Time=5 min] Non-Verbal Similarities. The Identities&#xD;
                and Oddities subtest of the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale is used to assess&#xD;
                nonverbal abstract reasoning. [Max. Score=16; Time=2 min]&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Color Trails Test Color Trails 1 is a test of sustained visual attention,&#xD;
                psychomotor speed, and simple sequencing and involves connecting circles containing&#xD;
                the numbers 1 through 25 in order as quickly as possible. Color Trails 2 also&#xD;
                involves connecting circles containing the numbers 1 through 25 in order as quickly&#xD;
                as possible, but the examinee must shift between pink and yellow colored circles.&#xD;
                Like Part 1, Color Trails 2 assesses visual attention and psychomotor speed but&#xD;
                also requires a higher level of executive functioning skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Verbal Fluency: Controlled Word Association Test. The patient is given 1 min to&#xD;
                name as many words beginning with a particular letter as s/he can. Norms and&#xD;
                frequency counts exist for this test in Spanish as well as English. Three&#xD;
                categories, Animals, Food, and Clothing are administered to assess category naming.&#xD;
                [Time=7 min]&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Selective Reminding Test (SRT) is a standard tool in the assessment of verbal&#xD;
                memory and dementia and has been used as a sensitive longitudinal measure of&#xD;
                changes in memory function. The SRTwas translated into Spanish using words of&#xD;
                similar frequency to those in the standard test versions. Subjects are given 6&#xD;
                trials to learn a list of 12 unrelated words. After each attempt at recalling the&#xD;
                list, the subject is reminded only of the words that were not recalled and then&#xD;
                must attempt to recall the entire list. To assess short-term memory, 2 measures are&#xD;
                used: total recall (max. score=72) and retrieval from long-term storage (max.&#xD;
                score=72). To assess long-term recall, delayed recall is assessed 15 minutes after&#xD;
                completing the SRT (max. score=12); recognition of words not recalled is then&#xD;
                tested using multiple choice arrays (max. score=12). [Time (not including 15 min.&#xD;
                delay interval, during which other tests are administered) =15 min].&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The orientation items from the modified Mini-Mental State Examination are used to&#xD;
                assess orientation to time and place. These items are sensitive to dementing&#xD;
                changes in our normative samples. [Max. Score=10; Time to administer=2 min]&#xD;
