  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blinded multi-institutional randomized controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Arista hemostatic matrix powder (AristaÂ® AH, C. R. Bard, Inc. Davol,&#xD;
      Warwick, RI) in reducing drainage output in anterolateral thigh (ALT) free flap donor sites.&#xD;
      Increased drainage from donor sites can lead to seroma formation with possible secondary&#xD;
      infection, delayed hospital discharge, and additional home care needs for drain care. Arista&#xD;
      is an inert plant based absorbable surgical hemostatic powder that can be easily applied to&#xD;
      broad surgical fields to reduce bleeding and seroma rates. Therefore, its application to free&#xD;
      flap donor sites may bear significant potential benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: The main hypothesis of the study is that the use of Arista in anterolateral&#xD;
      thigh (ALT) free flap donor sites prior to closure will reduce postoperative drain outputs&#xD;
      and time to drain removal compared to ALT donor sites closed without Arista.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: This study will also evaluate the secondary hypotheses that Arista will&#xD;
      reduce postoperative ALT donor site seromas and patient hospital length of stay.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Free tissue transfer is a commonly performed procedure, especially at tertiary care&#xD;
      hospitals. In free tissue transfer, &quot;spare tissue&quot; from one area of the body (donor site) is&#xD;
      re-implanted to an area that is need of reconstruction (defect site). When relocated, the&#xD;
      &quot;spare tissue&quot; is given vitality and blood supply at its new location by microscopically&#xD;
      sewing and connecting its feeding artery and vein to an artery and vein in or near the defect&#xD;
      site. Hence, this operation is referred to as &quot;microvascular free tissue transfer&quot; or &quot;free&#xD;
      flap&quot;. Defect sites most commonly result from tumor or cancer removal and trauma related&#xD;
      injuries. Free flaps are frequently used to reconstruct breast tissue after mastectomy, head&#xD;
      and neck cancer resections, extremity injuries, and chronically infected wounds. The&#xD;
      indications, utilization, and expertise in free flap surgery continue to grow, providing&#xD;
      patients with enhanced outcomes of otherwise difficult cancers and wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since its original description in 1984 the ALT microvascular free flap has become an&#xD;
      increasingly integral part of head and neck reconstructive surgery.1, 2 ALT free flaps have&#xD;
      been shown to be a reliable method for several reconstructive procedures with minimal donor&#xD;
      site morbidity.2-4 The ALT free flap is composed of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fat of the&#xD;
      anterolateral thigh. The blood supply to this area is from the lateral circumflex femoral&#xD;
      artery and vein. These vessels along with the tissues of the anterolateral thigh are&#xD;
      carefully dissected and removed as a single unit to be re-implanted in a different part of&#xD;
      the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple options exist for soft tissue free flap donor sites similar to the ALT. However, a&#xD;
      distinct advantage of the ALT free flap over others is the minimal donor site morbidity that&#xD;
      the patient undergoes. Patients are able to fully ambulate and function after the surgery,&#xD;
      and are left with only a well-healed scar line. Despite its many advantages, postoperative&#xD;
      fluid collections continue to be problematic in the ALT donor site. Studies have reported&#xD;
      seroma rates in ALT donor sites as high as 5% although this likely underestimates the true&#xD;
      incidence of clinically significant postoperative fluid collections and wound complications&#xD;
      in this patient population.2 ALT free flaps require a large amount of tissue dissection and&#xD;
      removal, creating a large potential space in the lateral thigh that often requires prolonged&#xD;
      postoperative suction drainage and pressure dressings in efforts to minimize fluid&#xD;
      accumulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research in optimal postoperative management for the ALT donor site is lacking. Current&#xD;
      management without the use of Arista often requires a surgical drain for 7-14 days, which can&#xD;
      delay patient discharge and expose patients to increased risk of postoperative wound&#xD;
      infections. There is a paucity of data on methods to reduce ALT donor site drain output and&#xD;
      seromas. Surgeons often use a combination of closed suction surgical drains and pressure&#xD;
      dressings to try and reduce the amount of fluid collection in the thigh donor sites. Although&#xD;
      this does provide some advantage, if these techniques are required for a prolonged time,&#xD;
      unnecessary hospital stay and patient morbidity are attained. According the Healthcare Cost&#xD;
      and Utilization Project, an average inpatient hospitalization in 2009 cost $2,000 per day,&#xD;
      and is increasing.5 If the use of a single bottle of Arista could reduce just 1 hospital day&#xD;
      per patient it could save at least $80,000 dollars a year at our department alone. Further,&#xD;
      the associated morbidity and health care costs of potential seroma or infected seroma&#xD;
      complications may be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating improved methods to reduce postoperative&#xD;
      drainage from ALT donor sites could provide critical information on how to best serve our&#xD;
      patients, eliminate unnecessary hospital stay, and reduce overall cost. Once studied in a&#xD;
      controlled single flap environment, these methods could be then expanded to other or all free&#xD;
      flap donor sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the manufacturer, Arista uses Microporous Polysaccharide Hemospheres (MPH)&#xD;
      technology to catalyze the clotting cascade and effectively dehydrate tissue to initiate&#xD;
      hemostasis in broad areas. Major advantages of Arista are that it has been shown to be safe&#xD;
      and effective across multiple surgical disciplines, is completely absorbed in 24-48 hours,&#xD;
      and contains no human or animal components.6-8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sindwani et al. was the first to report effectiveness and safety of Arista as a hemostatic&#xD;
      agent in otolaryngology demonstrating its application in controlling postoperative bleeding&#xD;
      after endoscopic sinus surgery.8 Zhang et al. demonstrated success rate of 100% in the&#xD;
      prevention of seromas in patients undergoing resection of malignant tumors in multiple&#xD;
      locations, including the lower extremity.7 Arista was recently shown to be useful in reducing&#xD;
      postoperative chest tube output and hemostasis time in patients undergoing cardiothoracic&#xD;
      surgery.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      These previous works support the idea that Arista could be effective in reducing&#xD;
      postoperative fluid collection and drainage time in free flap donor sites. However, this&#xD;
      would be a new application of Arista with wide applicability that has not been previously&#xD;
      described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Research Rationale and Possible Influence On Clinical Practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reconstructive surgery has evolved in a recent era of increased attention to patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and cost savings. The ALT free flap has been proven to be highly successful;&#xD;
      however, optimal management of the donor site postoperatively is an area in need of&#xD;
      additional gains via research. Decreasing free flap donor site drain output and earlier drain&#xD;
      removal could improve the quality of life of our patients, significantly decrease the cost of&#xD;
      their care, and potentially decrease drain-associated infections. If this study were to&#xD;
      demonstrate Arista to reduce postoperative donor site drainage and seroma rates and/or a&#xD;
      decrease in hospital length of stay resulting from early surgical drain removal, it could&#xD;
      dramatically affect the way we take care of our patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to critically evaluate current clinical practice paradigms to better&#xD;
      understand the influence of Arista use in free flap donor sites. A prospective,&#xD;
      multi-institutional, randomized, controlled, single-blinded trial is the clearest methodology&#xD;
      to evaluate the possible benefits of Arista. Additionally, study in the ALT free flap alone,&#xD;
      a single and commonly performed free flap, limits bias and confounding variables. No clinical&#xD;
      trial of this level has been performed on this topic; thus, our proposal is novel and the&#xD;
      findings of the study are potentially important.&#xD;
