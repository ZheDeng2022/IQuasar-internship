    <textblock>
      Exposure to life threatening, traumatic and stress inducing events in general is an&#xD;
      inevitable part of military combat service . Among individuals exposed to a traumatic event,&#xD;
      approximately 85-90 % will develop a stress response from which they will recover without&#xD;
      need for any medical intervention whatsoever. However, roughly 10-15 % will continue to&#xD;
      suffer from post-traumatic symptoms along with depression or anxiety disorders1, . The&#xD;
      prominent symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), consists of reliving the event&#xD;
      via invasive and painful memories that include: images, thoughts or feelings, night terrors,&#xD;
      and extreme emotional distress that arise when exposure to external or internal cues similar&#xD;
      to or symbolizing aspects of the traumatic event. Following this distress, behavioral&#xD;
      avoidance of situations that trigger unpleasant memories may develop. Such mental stress may&#xD;
      lead to avoidance of social situations and hinder normal daily functioning in a variety of&#xD;
      contexts2. The question arises as to what distinguishes between those who are exposed to a&#xD;
      traumatic event and recover spontaneously and those who fail to resume daily life and develop&#xD;
      PTSD. Attempts to find personality and environmental risk factors for the development of PTSD&#xD;
      have yet to yield any unequivocal conclusions. This has lead the scientific community to look&#xD;
      for neuro-physical risk factors as well . Furthermore, evidence that early diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of the disorder helps reduce the severity of post-trauma symptoms -stresses the&#xD;
      need for the accurate localization of neurological risk factors and new immediate and/or&#xD;
      preventative interventions. The aim of the present project is to develop a brain oriented&#xD;
      training method for early preventive interventions of PTSD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most significant disadvantage of the current EEG-NF method is the low spatial resolution&#xD;
      of the EEG, which does not allow for the localization of site activity within deep brain&#xD;
      regions known to be associated with the development of PTSD, such as the amygdala, the&#xD;
      hippocampus, and the mPFC. The aim of the present project is to overcome this drawback by&#xD;
      integrating EEG and fMRI imaging methods, such that the patient will receive real-time&#xD;
      feedback regarding the activation of emotional target areas located deep within the brain.&#xD;
      FMRI is based on the measurement of metabolic changes following electrical activity in the&#xD;
      brain, thus non-invasively representing the neuronal activity of various brain regions when&#xD;
      performing emotional and/or cognitive tasks. fMRI has high spatial resolution, and in&#xD;
      contrast to EEG - it allows for the localization of regions deep within the brain, such as&#xD;
      those related to trauma responses within the limbic system and prefrontal cortex. Recently,&#xD;
      real-time fMRI (rt fMRI) has been used to train subjects to modulate activity within deep&#xD;
      brain regions , . Some studies have even shown that subjects can be trained to regulate&#xD;
      activity within a network of regions including the mPFC and limbic regions, resulting in a&#xD;
      positive effect on patients suffering from chronic pain and depression . Moreover, it has&#xD;
      also been found that via real-time fMRI feedback subjects can be trained to regulate activity&#xD;
      within networks that have been linked to emotional regulation; a skill critical for dealing&#xD;
      with traumatic events . The major disadvantage of this method is that fMRI tests are&#xD;
      expensive and inconvenient for the patient, and the MRI machine required for this method are&#xD;
      stationary and not easily accessible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To combine the advantages of both methods the investigators performed simultaneous testing of&#xD;
      both EEG and fMRI. Using special algorithms, with high reliability, the investigators studied&#xD;
      the electrical signals that represent activity related to emotional regulation within deep&#xD;
      brain regions . This combination allowed for a significant improvement in the spatial&#xD;
      resolution of the EEG device and added significant temporal information taken from the fMRI&#xD;
      signal. The combined recording of EEG and fMRI with advanced computational methods, such as&#xD;
      cross correlation and machine learning, provide significant improvement in the attribution of&#xD;
      EEG signal localization, which until now could not be achieved with adequate reliability. In&#xD;
      other words, the EEG pattern of activity reliably represents activation of deep limbic&#xD;
      regions providing an &quot;electrical fingerprint&quot; (EFP) of these areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the investigators developed an innovative treatment protocol in which subjects&#xD;
      are asked to control either visual or auditory stimuli, determined by feedback from the&#xD;
      brain, based on the extent of the EFP . In a pilot study on a group of civilians the&#xD;
      investigators showed that subjects successfully learned to modify their electrical brain&#xD;
      signal based on the EFP . In an additional study, simultaneous recordings of EEG and fMRI&#xD;
      showed that success was indeed related to changes in activity within deep brain regions&#xD;
      involved in emotional regulation; such as the mPFC and hippocampus. Furthermore, our results&#xD;
      indicate that following training to volitionally regulate the EFP via EEG-NF, participants&#xD;
      exhibited improved emotion regulation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for current study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the EFP model and the NF literature in the treatment of PTSD this study aims to&#xD;
      examine the efficiency of an fMRI-guided-EEG-protocol for self-regulation through NF for&#xD;
      reducing stress vulnerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assign two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      experimental group: EFP neurofeedback control groups: Sham neurofeedback In order to assess&#xD;
      the efficiency of the NF protocol as a preventative intervention for PTSD, the investigators&#xD;
      plan to compare this treatment outcomes to those of a placebo sham protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examine the efficiency of NF in reducing stress vulnerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examine the efficiency of amygdala targeted Neurofeedback (NF) in reducing stress symptoms&#xD;
      among individuals who were recently exposed to a traumatic event. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized parallel design, with 2 groups: EFP-NF (n=35), Sham-NF (n=35)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve 40 participants with PTSD symptoms between the ages of 18-40, who will&#xD;
      be divided randomly into 2 groups (experimental group, control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve 70 individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the ER and trauma clinic at TASMC. The hospital will&#xD;
      provide our research team with daily lists of the individuals who arrived at the ER over the&#xD;
      past 24 hours, screened for possible trauma related incidents. Our team will then contact the&#xD;
      potential subjects over the phone and will request informed consent to conduct a phone&#xD;
      interview to assess the presence of acute stress symptoms. A brief description of the study&#xD;
      will be provided. If the individual agrees and is found suitable for further participation&#xD;
      they will be invited to the trauma clinic at TASMC where a trained clinical psychologist will&#xD;
      conduct a comprehensive PTSD evaluation. The trauma clinic at TASMC will also refer suitable&#xD;
      patients from within their database for participation in our study. All subjects referred by&#xD;
      the trauma clinic will undergo identical procedures for obtaining informed consent and&#xD;
      subsequent clinical evaluation as those described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 2 groups. The experimental group will receive EEG-NF sessions targeted&#xD;
      on the amygdalae and the control group will Sham-NF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain area/s of interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The regions of interest will include the limbic system and more specifically the Amygdala,&#xD;
      hippocampus ventral striatum, as well as cortical areas associated with emotional regulation&#xD;
      (such as dorso-lateral PFC and dorso and ventro-medial PFC cingulated cortex and insula).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre treatment phase Day 1 Participants will undergo a psychiatric evaluation (using SCID),&#xD;
      and medication monitoring. Participants will also be asked to fill in demographic and&#xD;
      psychological questionnaires assessing emotion regulation abilities (ERQ), state anxiety and&#xD;
      traits (STAI), and questionnaires measuring symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression (CAPS,&#xD;
      PCL, BDI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2 All Participants will undergo a brain-imaging scan to characterize brain network&#xD;
      responses associated with emotional arousal and regulation. Participants will be scanned for&#xD;
      functional and structural MRI which will include ROI localizer for the NF, resting state,&#xD;
      emotional conflict task, facial recognition task reward task and DTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research staff will explain the course of the MRI testing to the participant, and will&#xD;
      enter with the subject into the mock simulator to verify that he is lying on his back&#xD;
      properly and feels comfortable. During testing the patient will be presented with visual and&#xD;
      auditory stimuli, as well as short video clips. Auditory presentation: stimuli will be heard&#xD;
      via MRI-compatible headphones. Visual displays: the subject will view the stimuli through a&#xD;
      mirror and projected onto a screen in the magnet room. In between sessions the patient will&#xD;
      be given time to rest. Participants will be asked to avoid moving as much as possible during&#xD;
      the scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of testing, from subject arrival to departure, will take approximately&#xD;
      90-180 minutes (20-30 minutes to fill out forms and undergo training, 30 minutes for&#xD;
      explanations and a break, and 60 minutes of imaging). Participants will remain in the MRI for&#xD;
      about 60 minutes, and under no circumstances will remain longer than 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training phase The duration of the training phase will be 4 weeks. At this point participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to either the EFP-NF or T/A-NF groups. Both the EFP-NF and the&#xD;
      T/A-NF groups will receive 1-2 sessions per week for a total of 6 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During training sessions, participants will train to develop skills for regulating brain&#xD;
      activity using auditory or visual feedback. Each session will last an hour, including EEG Cap&#xD;
      placement and filling state questionnaires. The participant will be seated comfortably in&#xD;
      front of a computer screen. A staff member will explain the goal of the meeting to the&#xD;
      participant, introduce the equipment to be used, and describe the course of the meeting.&#xD;
      Following the above explanations, the staff member will place the EEG cap on the&#xD;
      participant's head and will ensure that the participant feels comfortable. The EEG -&#xD;
      Neurofeedback practice will consist of five-minute segments repeated for up to 30 minutes.&#xD;
      During each practice segment the participant will be asked to modify any visual or auditory&#xD;
      media that provides feedback on the degree of successful brain training. For example, during&#xD;
      visual feedback the participants will be asked to lower the speed of a skateboard presented&#xD;
      on the computer screen or alternatively, during auditory feedback to reduce the level of&#xD;
      music audible through headphones placed on their ears. After every two practice segments, the&#xD;
      duration of each practice will increase such that the two first steps will be very short&#xD;
      (about 5 minutes each) and the last two the longest (about 10 minutes each); a total of six&#xD;
      steps every trial over a total of approximately 45 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post treatment phase This phase will take place 3-5 days after the end of the training phase.&#xD;
      Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will undergo a second psychological evaluation (CAPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete the same questionnaires as in the pre treatment phase (BDI,&#xD;
           ERQ, STAI, PCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2 • All Participants will be scanned for functional and structural MRI which will include&#xD;
      ROI localizer, resting state, DTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up phase Day 1-5&#xD;
&#xD;
      • All participants will receive 2 maintenance sessions (EFP-NF or T/A-NF)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will undergo a third psychological evaluation (CAPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete the same questionnaires as in the previous phases (BDI, ERQ,&#xD;
           STAI, PCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will assist participants filling in the electronic questionnaires and will&#xD;
      conduct the non electronic ones (these would be later transcribed to excel sheets by research&#xD;
      assistants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will run the MRI scans and the NF sessions (all the rt-fMRI NF and some of the&#xD;
      EFP-NF), together with two to five research assistants. The contact with the participants&#xD;
      will be by E-mail and phone. The research assistants will monitor participation. The&#xD;
      participants will receive a reminder (by phone and or email) one day prior to each session.&#xD;
