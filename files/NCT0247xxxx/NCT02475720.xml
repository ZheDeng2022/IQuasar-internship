      According to the recent report using EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI), there is all&#xD;
      over survival of the EGFR gene mutation-positive NSCLC in a tendency to extension. However,&#xD;
      the real situation and the reason are not clarified.This observational study collects the&#xD;
      data of EGFR gene mutation-positive NSCLC approximately 2,000 from the medical record of&#xD;
      approximately 20 facilities in Japan and observes the treatment reality of EGFR gene&#xD;
      mutation-positive NSCLC.&#xD;

      Study Site(s), number of subjects and countries planned Approximately 2000, Advanced Non&#xD;
      Small Cell Lung cancer (aNSCLC) patients who fulfil the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      recruited by 10 to 20 investigational sites in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total planned Study period Estimated date of first subject in June , 2015 Estimated date of&#xD;
      last subject in November , 2015 Estimated date of data base lock December, 2015 Estimated&#xD;
      date of first subject in for investigation of survival January, 2016 Estimated date of last&#xD;
      subject in for investigation of survival March, 2016 Estimated date of data base lock for&#xD;
      investigation of survival March, 2016&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medicinal Products (type, dose, mode of administration) and concomitant medication Not&#xD;
      applicable Study Rationale As its benefits in EGFR mutation-positive patients have been&#xD;
      reported, EGFR-TKI is now recommended by guidelines as standard first-line therapy for EGFR&#xD;
      mutation-positive patients. Back then when concomitant use of platinum medication and&#xD;
      3rd-generation cytocidal drug was the standard therapy, treatment was of very poor prognosis,&#xD;
      8 to 10 months in terms of median overall survival, and a 1-year survival rate of 30% to 35%.&#xD;
      Then, gefitinib was approved in July 2002. Takano et al. reported that survival among&#xD;
      patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer has been getting longer after&#xD;
      approval of gefitinib. The overall survival of patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer was 27.7 months in gefitinib group of Study North East Japan (NEJ) 002&#xD;
      reported by Inoue et al. in 2013, 34.8 months in gefitinib group of Study West Japan Oncology&#xD;
      Group (WJOG) 3405 reported by Yoshioka et al. in 2014, 36.3 months in patients receiving&#xD;
      erlotinib in Study Japan Oncology (JO) 22903 reported by Katakami et al. in 2014, and 46.9&#xD;
      months in afatinib group and 35.8 months in chemotherapy group of the Japanese subset in&#xD;
      Study Lux-Lung3 reported by Kato. According to recent reports, overall survival tends to be&#xD;
      prolonging, but the actual situation and the reason for such tendency has not been revealed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, we planned the present study, which clarify the prognosis, patient characteristics and&#xD;
      treatment regimen of the patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC to provide useful&#xD;
      information in order to promote individualized therapy for the patients with EGFR mutation&#xD;
      positive NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives The primary objective of this study is intended to reveal the&#xD;
      characteristics of and reality of the treatment and survival among patients with EGFR&#xD;
      mutation-positive advanced/recurrent non-small cell lung cancer. The primary objective,&#xD;
      secondary objective and exploratory objective of the study are as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To estimate overall survival of the patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate overall survival by patient background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate overall survival by treatment sequence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To calculate treatment time and exposure rate by treatment category (Sum of all&#xD;
           treatment time for the patients with each treatment category/Sum of all treatment time&#xD;
           for all patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate efficacy of Gefitinib treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore any factors for which an impact on prognosis among patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the relationship between treatment sequences and prognosis among patients&#xD;
           Study Design This is a domestic, multicenter, retrospective and non-interventional&#xD;
           diagnostic study. The data for the subjects with EGFR mutation-positive&#xD;
           advanced/recurrent NSCLC will be collected at least 2000 cases from 10 to 20 sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target subject population The patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced/recurrent&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey items&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient characteristics i) Date of NSCLC diagnosis ii) Gender (Male/Female) iii) Age at&#xD;
           the time of diagnosis iv) Histological type (adenocarcinoma/squamous cell&#xD;
           carcinoma/large cell carcinoma/others) v) Clinical staging at the initial diagnosis&#xD;
           (IIIB /IV, post-operative relapse) vi) Performance Status(PS) (0/1/2/3/4), *Eastern&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Survival status as of the end of December 2014, date of death or date of last follow-up&#xD;
           of survival. A death with disease progression should be noted in Electronic Data Capture&#xD;
           (EDC), but not be reported as serious adverse events unless the disease progression is&#xD;
           greater than anticipated in the natural course of the disease. Survival status as of the&#xD;
           end of December 2015, date of last follow-up of survival will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
