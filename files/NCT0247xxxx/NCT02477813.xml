      It is a single-arm, open label clinical trial. Patients affected by relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      small-cell lung cancer patients with MGMT promoter methylation are included in this study;&#xD;
      they will be treated with oral Temozolomide 200 mg/m2 die for 5 consecutive days every 28&#xD;
      days. Treatment will be continued until tumor progression, intolerable toxicity or patient&#xD;
      refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Minimax Simon 2-stage design will be used. - First stage: 9 patients If 1 or less responses&#xD;
      will be observed, the trial will be ended.- Second stage: other 10 patients (for a total of&#xD;
      19 subjects enrolled) If 5 or less responses will be observed in 19 patients, the treatment&#xD;
      will not be considered active, while if 6 or more responses will be observed, the treatment&#xD;
      will be considered sufficiently active to warrant further testing. Since the rate of&#xD;
      methylation ranges from 20 to 48% the number of patients to be screened should be between 40&#xD;
      and 95.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the overall response rate [ORR = CR + PR]; the&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to determine the time to Progression (TTP), the overall Survival&#xD;
      (OS), the toxicity and the correlation between response Rate (RR) and the level of MGMT&#xD;
      promoter methylation and/or base excision repair (BER) genes alterations.&#xD;

      This is a single-arm, open-label, phase II study. Patients must have histologically or&#xD;
      cytologically confirmed small cell lung cancer (SCLC), both limited or extensive disease,&#xD;
      relapsed after one or two prior chemotherapy regimens MGMT promoter methylation status will&#xD;
      be evaluated on a histological tissue sample (after patient signature of a specific informed&#xD;
      consent form for this biological evaluation) using Pyrosequencing technique and the main 10&#xD;
      CpG islands of MGMT promoter will be studied. Only patients with MGMT promoter methylation&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the clinical trial. To be eligible patients may have received 1 or 2&#xD;
      prior chemotherapeutic regimens. Patients with brain metastases may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be informed about the palliative nature of the treatment . Patients will be&#xD;
      treated with oral Temozolomide 200 mg/m2/die for 5 consecutive days .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be repeated every 28 days and continued until disease progression, intolerable&#xD;
      toxicity or patient refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response to chemotherapy will be monitored every three cycles by CT scan of the chest and the&#xD;
      abdomen and computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging of the whole brain.&#xD;
      Response to treatment will be evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of progressive disease (PD) the patients will discontinue treatment. In case of&#xD;
      stable disease (SD), partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) patients continue&#xD;
      treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or patient refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of treatment, if disease progression will not occur, patients will be evaluated&#xD;
      every 3 months by CT scan of the chest and the abdomen and CT scan or RM of the whole brain&#xD;
      until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned follow-up visits will continue until disease progression and patients will be&#xD;
      monitored for survival and toxicity .&#xD;
