    <measure>Bacterial Elimination Rate (BER) in the CDI and EI Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>CDI group: screening, Day 4 and Day 11 (end of treatment), EI group: screening, Day 4 and Day 8 (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Judged according to the assessment criteria for the bacterial strain isolated as the causative pathogen based on the data from the microbiological examination. Analysis was performed by disease group and by dose, and by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of OPS-2071 for each of the causative strains (Enterotoxigenic E. coli, Enteroaggregative E. coli, Campylobacter sp., C. jejuni, S. aureus, K. oxytoca, and C. perfringens for the EI group). Data were shown as all strains total.&#xD;
Concerning microbiological outcome by causative strain, bacteria elimination rate (BER) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. The BER was the proportion of causative strains assessed as either &quot;Excellent&quot; or &quot;Good&quot; except for those assessed as &quot;unknown/indeterminate&quot;.</description>

    <description>The time from the start of dosing until the first formed stool (except in cases where liquid or unformed stools recurred) was evaluated as time to resolution of diarrhea. If formed stool has not been observed, then the subject will be handled as missing data.</description>

    <time_frame>CDI group: screening, Day 4, Day 11 (end of treatment) and Day 38, EI group: screening, Day 4 and Day 8 (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Under each disease group, he improvement of clinical symptoms (i.e. presence of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting) were assessed.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects with bacterial enteritis were divided into 2 groups, a Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) group for subjects with bacterial enteritis associated with C. difficile infection and an enteric infection (EI) group for subjects with bacterial enteritis for which the causative pathogen was Salmonella, Campylobacter, or pathogenic E. coli. Only one dosage (100 mg) of OPS-2071 was administered to CDI subjects and 3 dosages (100, 50, and 200 mg) were administered to EI subjects.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Bacterial Elimination Rate (BER) in the CDI and EI Groups</title>
        <description>Judged according to the assessment criteria for the bacterial strain isolated as the causative pathogen based on the data from the microbiological examination. Analysis was performed by disease group and by dose, and by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of OPS-2071 for each of the causative strains (Enterotoxigenic E. coli, Enteroaggregative E. coli, Campylobacter sp., C. jejuni, S. aureus, K. oxytoca, and C. perfringens for the EI group). Data were shown as all strains total.&#xD;
Concerning microbiological outcome by causative strain, bacteria elimination rate (BER) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. The BER was the proportion of causative strains assessed as either &quot;Excellent&quot; or &quot;Good&quot; except for those assessed as &quot;unknown/indeterminate&quot;.</description>
