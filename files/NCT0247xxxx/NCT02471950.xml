    <textblock>
      There is no clinical way of assessing the depth of anaesthesia while patients are on the&#xD;
      heart-lung machine. A new method of measuring the depth of anaesthesia using brainwaves&#xD;
      called the Bispectral index (BIS) has been developed and its use in cardiac surgery is now&#xD;
      widespread. However BIS is also altered by patients body temperature. As cooling is common&#xD;
      during heart surgery the use of BIS to measure the depth of anaesthesia during heart-lung&#xD;
      bypass remains controversial. This study aims to find out what depth of anaesthesia is&#xD;
      produced according to BIS during heart lung bypass using a standard anaesthetic technique&#xD;
      that utilises the anaesthetic isoflurane.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There is no clinical way of assessing patients' depth of anaesthesia on the heart-lung&#xD;
      machine. For this reason, the amount of volatile anaesthetic agent like isoflurane, that is&#xD;
      administered has traditionally been determined by anaesthetists' clinical experience.&#xD;
      Recently, a device that assesses depth of anaesthesia by analysing the electrical brain waves&#xD;
      called the Bispectral index (BIS) has been introduced. The study aims to determine whether&#xD;
      the level of anaesthesia produced by isoflurane using the traditional approach is more than&#xD;
      required simply to maintain unconsciousness according to BIS. In addition, the study will&#xD;
      determine whether the concentration of isoflurane in exhaust gases from the heart-lung&#xD;
      machine can be used as an estimate arterial blood concentration and so, depth of anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit patients who are scheduled for heart surgery using a heart-lung&#xD;
      machine. Patients will be anaesthetised using a long established balanced technique including&#xD;
      the administration of isoflurane 2.5% whilst supported on the heart-lung machine.&#xD;
      Measurements of exhaust gas concentration of isoflurane from the heart-lung machine and level&#xD;
      of BIS will be recorded at three time points. Simultaneously, three arterial blood samples&#xD;
      will be taken and the isoflurane concentration measured in these samples. The BIS levels will&#xD;
      be averaged and the proportion of patients with a BIS below 40 (lower limit of normal) will&#xD;
      be calculated. Concentrations of isoflurane in the exhaust gas of the heart-lung machine will&#xD;
      be compared with blood concentrations of isoflurane and the both concentrations will be&#xD;
      compared with the level of BIS to establish whether they can be used to assess depth of&#xD;
      anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this study finds that a large proportion of patients have more than adequate levels of&#xD;
      anaesthesia, then future studies could explore whether administering lower concentrations of&#xD;
      isoflurane improves outcome whilst maintaining anaesthesia.&#xD;
