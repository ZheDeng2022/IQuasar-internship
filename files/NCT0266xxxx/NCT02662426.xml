      Study Objectives This study wishes to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lingdancao granules&#xD;
      for the treatment of seasonal influenza (including seasonal influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 type,&#xD;
      the new influenza A (H1N1) or influenza B) and an economic analysis on drugs in an&#xD;
      evidence-based clinical trial with Oseltamivir phosphate Capsules and placebo as contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Trial registration This clinical study is a multicentered, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, double control trial that testes drugs and placebo. Non-inferiority (vs.&#xD;
      positive control) and superiority (vs. placebo control) trials are conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After clinical ethics approval and before the participants' randomly enrolment, the research&#xD;
      plan is registered both in clinicaltrials.gov and in the center of Chinese clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 Designed case number of participants The study is designed to enroll 360 411 cases of&#xD;
      patients (male and female) suffering seasonal influenza (including seasonal influenza type&#xD;
      A/H1N1 and A/H3N2, the new influenza A (H1N1) or influenza B) aged 14-65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO) for influenza-like illnesses (ILIs)&#xD;
      are used as the basis for influenza surveillance. If a patient presents with an acute cough&#xD;
      and fever, clinicians must be highly vigilant to test for infections caused by the influenza&#xD;
      virus. In general, the rate of ILI cases that lead to a clinical diagnosis of influenza&#xD;
      infection is about 18-80%, which is higher than other clinical diagnoses, e.g. acute&#xD;
      infections of the upper respiratory tract. Therefore adult ILI patients are selected for&#xD;
      inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

                with no missing or wrong number, otherwise will be in violation of the design.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.4 Blinded study and evaluating time This study is a randomized blinded parallel&#xD;
           controlled clinical trial, designed by statistical professionals using computer&#xD;
           simulation for random scheme. The preparation of blind coding and treatment code is&#xD;

      must be used on the day of fever and last for five days continuously. In addition, in view of&#xD;
      the contagiousness of virus, take 2 days after prior symptoms disappear as the boundary, is&#xD;
      possible to continue medical treatment after the participants' symptoms disappear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participators who meet the inclusion criteria are given by the study drugs according to the&#xD;
      random number on the day when they are included into the study. And the first day using drugs&#xD;

      day. According to the time of the first medication, the last time for using drug will be on&#xD;
      the 5th or 6th day. If the first medication is after 17:00 on the first day, the next&#xD;
      meditation will be on the following morning. In this case, the last medication will be on the&#xD;
      morning of the 6th day. If the first medication is before 17:00 on the first day, the next&#xD;
      administration will be on the same day at night (before midnight). In this case, the last&#xD;

      drugs in their diary. According to the diary, researchers or co-researchers will evaluate&#xD;
      compliance of the participant on the basis of the following four grades in different stages&#xD;
      and record it in the case report after each follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1 Take medications according to rules. 7.2 Take medications mostly according to rules,&#xD;
      (80%-120% of the designed dose) 7.3 Take medications half of the time according to rules. 7.4&#xD;
      Almost with no medication (no more than half the time) Once the subject is not taking drugs&#xD;
      according to stipulations, reasons must be indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the particularity of influenza, doctors can keep the subjects hospitalized until&#xD;
      the fever is retreated according to specific conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;

           5th, 7th and 21st days after the first visit patients shall have follow-ups in person&#xD;
           while the rest by telephone. The time windows of follow-up 3rd, 5th, 7th days are +1&#xD;
           day, and for 21st day is +7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medications, other drugs and basic treatment should be given by the doctors or taken&#xD;
      according to the doctor's guidance; participants will receive a written guidance about the&#xD;
      daily usage of the drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants should report daily to researchers about the number of pills taken. In addition,&#xD;
      the researchers need to count the number of pills in the opened drug boxes, and the number of&#xD;
      unpacking boxes. After the test, all the rest of the study drug or placebo must be returned&#xD;
      to the clinical arbitrator together with boxes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Principles and standards of suspending After starting taking study drug, once any of the&#xD;
      following circumstances appear, the researchers or co-researchers must stop the treatment of&#xD;
      patients and take corresponding measures immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptom aggravating and cannot continue taking the drugs (diagnosis and treatment refer&#xD;
           to Diagnosis and Treatment of Influenza Manual (2011 edition))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events that cannot continue taking the drugs (including abnormal blood pressure,&#xD;
           pulse, laboratory values, and ECG with clinical significance)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other conditions that researchers or co-researchers think should terminate the treatment&#xD;
           Cause of suspending the study in advance should be recorded. Subjects suspended from the&#xD;
           study must complete all contents of follow-up7 (or ending examinations and tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Shedding and missing follow-ups After the beginning of the study's medication, once the&#xD;
      subjects drop out the study due to any of the following reasons, the researchers or&#xD;
      co-researchers must take the appropriate measures and investigate the result of the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants wish to quit the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the study, subjects stop the follow-up to the hospital for none-direct related&#xD;
           reasons, such as transferring to another hospital or address migration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Principles and standards for comprehensive stopping of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serious security problems in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study finds that the drugs' effect are so poor or even invalid, that should suspend the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Significant errors or important deviation appears in the clinical trial scheme, and it's&#xD;
           difficult to evaluate effect of the drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The sponsor required for an end (due to reasons of funds, management, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Revoked by the competent administrative department, etc.&#xD;
