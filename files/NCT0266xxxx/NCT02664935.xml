  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial consists of a series of parallel multi-centre single arm phase II trial arms, each&#xD;
      testing an experimental targeted drug in a population stratified by multiple pre-specified&#xD;
      actionable target putative biomarkers. The primary objective is to evaluate whether there is&#xD;
      a signal of activity in each drug-(putative)biomarker cohort separately. A Bayesian adaptive&#xD;
      design is adopted to achieve this objective and statistical details are given in the&#xD;
      Protocol.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is primarily an enrichment putative biomarker design, including patients who are&#xD;
      positive for at least one of the actionable targets included in the trial. Patients who are&#xD;
      positive for just one putative biomarker will receive the experimental targeted drug specific&#xD;
      for that putative biomarker. Putative biomarkers within each drug cohort have been chosen&#xD;
      such that in the majority of cases it is not expected that patients will be positive for two&#xD;
      or more putative biomarkers within the same drug. In the rare situation that patients are&#xD;
      positive for two or more putative biomarkers relevant across different drugs, treatment will&#xD;
      be allocated in accordance with the following strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All amplifications and rearrangements will be treated with targeted agent appropriate to&#xD;
           them irrespective of concomitant mutations. This will yield crucial predictive biomarker&#xD;
           information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For concomitant mutations decisions will be made by the Chief Investigator on a&#xD;
           case-by-case basis and based on close consideration of pathway preference and likely&#xD;
           dominance of one signal pathway over another together with any pre-clinical efficacy&#xD;
           studies that address the activity of the drugs in the presence of concomitant mutations.&#xD;
           A trumping strategy has been devised for this purpose.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Core inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented below. Additional inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
        criteria apply to each arm and are presented in the relevant arm supplements of the&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior anti-cancer treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who refuse any standard of care first line therapy, are eligible to&#xD;
                  receive National Lung Matrix Trial treatment as first line therapy, providing&#xD;
                  they explicitly consent to this effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have previously consented to and received standard of care first&#xD;
                  line therapy must have completed all standard of care therapy that the treating&#xD;
                  oncologist thinks is appropriate. As a minimum patients must have failed one or&#xD;
                  more lines of treatment (either radiological documentation of disease progression&#xD;
                  or due to toxicity). Patients whose disease has increased in size but is not&#xD;
                  classed as progressive disease as per RECIST criteria, will be eligible. Patients&#xD;
                  with no change at all in dimension of disease (i.e. true stability) after first&#xD;
                  line therapy will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have progressed after surgical resection and adjuvant therapy will&#xD;
                  be eligible for entry without the need for the administration of first line&#xD;
                  metastatic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients will also be eligible without the necessity for first line regimen if&#xD;
                  they have relapsed within 6 months of completion of definitive chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consented and provided an adequate specimen to adequately characterise the molecular&#xD;
             genotype of the tumour in the molecular pre-screening according to the molecular&#xD;
             exclusion rules (see Section 6.4 for definition of an adequate sample).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological or cytologically confirmed NSCLC stage III (not suitable for radical&#xD;
             radiotherapy or surgery) or stage IV. This includes patients who may have abnormal&#xD;
             histology, but IHC strongly support either squamous cell carcinoma (p63 positivity) or&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma (Thyroid transcription factor 1 [TTF1] positivity). If a physician and&#xD;
             pathologist are convinced after multi-disciplinary review that the patient has stage&#xD;
             III or IV NSCLC but where all the IHC is negative and the morphology does not&#xD;
             distinguish a specific sub-type, these patients will be eligible for non-histology&#xD;
             specific cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CT or MRI scan of head, chest and abdomen within 28 days of treatment demonstrating&#xD;
             measurable disease as per RECIST version 1.1 (see Appendix 1: Response Evaluation&#xD;
             Criteria in Solid Tumours Version 1.1). (The same imaging modality must be used&#xD;
             throughout treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate haematological function within 7 days of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Haemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hepatic function within 7 days of treatment in patients with no liver&#xD;
             metastasis (see arm specific entry criteria for adequate hepatic function in patients&#xD;
             with liver metastases).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). (Note that this will&#xD;
                  not apply to patients with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent&#xD;
                  hyperbilirubinemia that is predominantly unconjugated in the absence of evidence&#xD;
                  of haemolysis or hepatic pathology), who may be allowed inclusion at the&#xD;
                  discretion of the local Investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alanine transferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate transferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate renal function within 7 days of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance (CLcr) &gt;50 ml/min (measured or calculated by Cockcroft and&#xD;
                  Gault equation - see Appendix 4: Cockcroft Gault Formula - Creatinine Clearance).&#xD;
                  If calculated CLcr is &lt;50 ml/min a direct measurement of glomerular filtration&#xD;
                  rate (GFR) such as EDTA may be performed. If the value is &gt;50 ml/min the patient&#xD;
                  is eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females must agree to use adequate contraceptive measures (as defined in Section 6.3),&#xD;
             should not be breast feeding and must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of&#xD;
             dosing if of child-bearing potential or must have evidence of non-child-bearing&#xD;
             potential by fulfilling one of the following criteria at screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Post-menopausal defined as aged more than 50 years and amenorrhoeic for at least&#xD;
                  12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilisation by hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women aged under 50 years old would be consider postmenopausal if they have been&#xD;
                  amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatments and with luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone&#xD;
                  (FSH) levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific&#xD;
             procedures, sampling and analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nausea, vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease)&#xD;
             that would preclude adequate absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition hampering protocol&#xD;
             compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
