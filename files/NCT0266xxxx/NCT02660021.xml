    <textblock>
      Orthognathic surgery or corrective jaw surgery is indicated for conditions of the jaw and&#xD;
      face that are related to structure or growth malfunctioning, orthodontic problems, or&#xD;
      co-morbidities associated with skeletal disfigurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging is crucial in the assessment and treatment planning of orthognathic surgery patients.&#xD;
      Until recently, two-dimensional (2D) imaging, through cephalometry, was standard practice.&#xD;
      However, it showed several limitations. The introduction of the cone-beam computed tomography&#xD;
      (CBCT) enabling three-dimensional (3D) imaging has caused a paradigm shift. Though widespread&#xD;
      implementation in routine practice is not yet present. Our department is one of the pioneers&#xD;
      in the world of 3D virtual treatment planning for orthognathic surgery. The &quot;triple CBCT scan&#xD;
      procedure&quot; has been developed in-house and implemented already in 2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to develop a prospective database registering 3D treatment planning&#xD;
      data of all consecutive patients eligible for orthognathic surgery, performed by Prof.&#xD;
      Swennen. Patient demographics, detailed virtual 3D treatment planning parameters and&#xD;
      orthognathic surgery data are being collected during consecutive visits within the framework&#xD;
      of routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of a database registering 3D virtual treatment planning data of orthognathic&#xD;
      surgery, will provide more information about potential patient, virtual planning and surgical&#xD;
      factors influencing postoperative accuracy of jaw correction, long-term stability of the&#xD;
      jawbone, long-term condylar resorption, or soft tissue response. In general, it could provide&#xD;
      answers on research questions that have been examined in prior studies on 2D-imaging, but can&#xD;
      now be re-examined in case of 3D-imaging. Moreover, registration of those results could&#xD;
      function as a measurement of quality of care, or could be used for sample size calculation&#xD;
      for future large multicenter prospective trials.&#xD;
