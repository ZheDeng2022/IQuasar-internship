  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are more likely to experience postoperative&#xD;
      complications and impact significantly on healthcare resources. In the surgical population,&#xD;
      the type and volume of IV fluid administration may contribute to the worsening of&#xD;
      postoperative sleep apnea but the pathophysiological mechanisms have not been elucidated.&#xD;
      Recent research from general population suggests that intravenous (IV) fluid administration&#xD;
      worsens the severity of OSA by shifting of fluid from the legs to the neck thus increasing&#xD;
      neck size and causing airway collapse. In this novel study, our objective is to examine the&#xD;
      contribution of IV fluid administration and rostral fluid shift from the legs to the neck&#xD;
      thereby leading to worsening of sleep apnea following surgery. In this prospective&#xD;
      observational cohort study, 25 consecutive adult patients, requiring at least 2 days hospital&#xD;
      stay, will be recruited. Following informed consent, patients will undergo portable home&#xD;
      sleep study to determine the preoperative severity of sleep-disordered breathing. On the day&#xD;
      of surgery, leg, neck and total body fluid volumes will be recorded, and patients will&#xD;
      undergo general anesthetic. The results of this study will be used to design future clinical&#xD;
      trials evaluating methods to decrease postoperative OSA worsening, as well as decreasing&#xD;
      OSA-related postoperative complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep-related breathing disorder, associated with&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality. It is an independent risk-factor for post-operative&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory complications and increased perioperative utilization of health care&#xD;
      resources. In non-surgical patients, rostral fluid shift from the lower limbs to the neck has&#xD;
      been identified as a pathophysiologic mechanism to explain OSA severity based on gender,&#xD;
      increasing age, and in fluid-overload states. In this novel study, our objective is to&#xD;
      examine the contribution of fluid shift from the lower limbs to the neck thereby leading to&#xD;
      worsening of sleep apnea following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure the change in the leg, neck and total fluid volume from preoperative baseline to&#xD;
           the second postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the impact of the change in neck fluid volume on neck circumference and&#xD;
           postoperative AHI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to the patients with heart failure, renal failure and older men, we hypothesize the&#xD;
      rostral shift of fluid from the lower limbs to the neck occurs in the postoperative period&#xD;
      contributing to the postoperative worsening of OSA. In this study, we will perform serial&#xD;
      measurements of segmental and total body water shifts occurring after surgery, at various&#xD;
      time-points over two postoperative days. We will monitor indices such as the Apnea Hypopnea&#xD;
      index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) to examine changes in the severity of OSA.&#xD;
      Internal validity of our study will be made more robust by use of well-validated methods such&#xD;
      as BIA for fluid measurements and portable PSG for OSA severity.&#xD;

             will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with metal implants in lower limbs or spine, due to possible interference&#xD;
             with the leg impedance signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring urgent sleep physician referral (within four weeks) due to serious&#xD;
             medical conditions or safety critical-occupations according to the 2011 Canadian&#xD;
