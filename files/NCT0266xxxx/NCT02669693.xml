  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is aimed at determining whether the presence of oleuropein in olives (Olea&#xD;
      europaea L.) has any lowering effect on post-prandial blood glucose levels. Volunteers will&#xD;
      be required to consume commercially available olives together with white bread, and their&#xD;
      glycaemic response will be measured. The blood glucose response of bread will be determined&#xD;
      initially as a control/reference. Food samples and control will be consumed in random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent rise in the cases of Diabetes mellitus in both children and adults has raised a&#xD;
      concern for the need to proffer immediate solutions amongst scientists in the fields of&#xD;
      medicine food science and nutrition. One of the approaches of reducing postprandial&#xD;
      hyperglycaemia and high glucose spikes is to impede digestion and absorption of starch. This&#xD;
      is potentially achieved through the inhibition of the activities of starch digesting enzymes&#xD;
      namely alpha amylase and alpha glycosidase. There are currently some antidiabetic drugs such&#xD;
      as acarbose and miglitol which have been quite efficient in these inhibitory functions but&#xD;
      not without associated side effects and complications such as liver toxicity, etc, arising&#xD;
      from to long term usage of such drugs. It therefore becomes imperative for natural&#xD;
      substitutes from food sources to be explored as better alternatives. At the moment several&#xD;
      plant foods are under investigation as suitable alternatives, and olives appear to be quite&#xD;
      promising in this regard. There are quite a few studies that have reported the inhibitory&#xD;
      activities of olives oleuropein on alpha amylase in vitro but information on in vivo testing&#xD;
      is very scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the research outcome will be a gateway to the reduction and control of&#xD;
      the incidence of diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

      Prior to commencement of the study, potential volunteers will be given a clear, concise&#xD;
      Participant Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form by the investigator to read, complete&#xD;
      and sign in their own time. The investigator will answer all questions to the satisfaction of&#xD;
      the individual and will not influence the decision of taking part in the study. The&#xD;
      participants will be free to withdraw from the study at any point without providing a reason.&#xD;
      The written consent form will be signed and dated at least 2 days prior to enrolment in the&#xD;
      study by the volunteers and the Investigator. It will be photocopied and one copy will be&#xD;
      kept by the Investigator (for the study records) and one by the volunteer. Participation by&#xD;
      the volunteers is conditional upon receiving the written consent by the volunteer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates will be asked to complete a questionnaire in order to assess their suitability for&#xD;
      the study. The information pertains to their lifestyle and may be considered a sensitive&#xD;
      issue, however each volunteer will be assured of confidentiality and that participation is&#xD;
      entirely voluntary. The information on the questionnaire will include height, weight, gender,&#xD;
      age and relevant medical history. Confidentiality of all participants' information will be&#xD;
      maintained. Identification will be coded using random ID numbers that will be assigned on the&#xD;
      day of study. All data collected will be treated as confidential and stored securely in a&#xD;
      locked filing cabinet according to current University regulations. The linkage between&#xD;
      individual identity and ID number will be kept in written form only and stored in a locked&#xD;
      filling cabinet in a restricted access area, thus it will not be possible to identify&#xD;
      individual participants from the ID numbers. Data evaluation will only be performed using ID&#xD;
      numbers. In accordance with the University guidelines on the password protected M-drive of&#xD;
      the University server, anonymised data will be stored for at least 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood glucose will be measured after consumption of test meal/control using a commercially&#xD;
      available glucometer which is available to be bought by any member of the public and people&#xD;
      already use them on their own. It measures glucose concentrations immediately and meets the&#xD;
      accuracy requirement for the ISO 15197 standard. A drop of blood is enough and is obtained&#xD;
      from participants by means of a mild finger prick using a sterile puncture device designed&#xD;
      for this purpose for each time point. The finger prick protocol is the WHO/FAO 1998 glycaemic&#xD;
      index approved protocol. Nine (9) finger pricks will be needed (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120,&#xD;
      150 and 180minutes) will be needed per study session.&#xD;
