    <textblock>
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect&#xD;
      for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease:&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by&#xD;
      bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which&#xD;
      stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are&#xD;
      special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or&#xD;
      cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with&#xD;
      cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most&#xD;
      patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies to create a more&#xD;
      effective treatment. The treatment that is being researched is called autologous T lymphocyte&#xD;
      chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the CD30 antigen (ATLCAR.CD30)&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous studies, it has been shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will&#xD;
      increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. A gene is a unit of DNA. Genes&#xD;
      make up the chemical structure carrying the patient's genetic information that may determine&#xD;
      human characteristics (i.e., eye color, height and sex). The new gene that is put in the T&#xD;
      cells in this study makes a piece of an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody floats&#xD;
      around in the blood and can detect and stick to cancer cells called lymphoma cells because&#xD;
      they have a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30. Anti-CD30 antibodies have been&#xD;
      used to treat people with lymphoma, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.&#xD;
      For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in&#xD;
      the blood part of it is now joined to the T cells. Only the part of the antibody that sticks&#xD;
      to the lymphoma cells is attached to the T cells instead of the entire antibody. When an&#xD;
      antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD30&#xD;
      chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they do&#xD;
      not last very long in the body and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to determine a safe dose of the ATLCAR.CD30 cells that&#xD;
      can be given to subjects after undergoing an autologous transplant. This is the first step in&#xD;
      determining whether giving ATLCAR.CD30 cells to others with lymphoma in the future will help&#xD;
      them. The researchers also want to find out what side effects patients will have after they&#xD;
      receive the ATLCAR.CD30 cells post-transplant. This study will also look at other effects of&#xD;
      ATLCAR.CD30 cells, including their effect on your cancer and how long they will survive in&#xD;
      your body.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability and to estimate the MTD of ATLCAR.CD30 post&#xD;
           ASCT in patients with CD30+ lymphoma at high risk for relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the survival of ATLCAR.CD30 in vivo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate PFS after infusion of ATLCAR.CD30 post ASCT in patients with CD30+ lymphoma&#xD;
           at high risk for relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the overall survival after infusion of ATLCAR.CD30 post ASCT in patients&#xD;
           with CD30+ lymphoma at high risk for relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure patient-reported symptom, physical function, and health-related quality of&#xD;
           life at baseline and over time in patients treated with ATLCAR.CD30 cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toxicity will be classified and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's&#xD;
           Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.0) and CRS toxicity&#xD;
           will be graded according to the toxicity scale outlined in 11.6 (Appendix F: CRS&#xD;
           Toxicity Grading Scale and Management Guidelines). The MTD will be based on the rate of&#xD;
           dose-limiting toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary (Clinical) Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PFS is defined from day of ASCT to relapse (in subjects with a documented complete&#xD;
           response after ASCT) or progression (in subjects with documented stable disease or&#xD;
           partial response after ASCT), or death as a result of any cause as per the Revised&#xD;
           Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival will be measured from the date of administration of CAR.CD30 transduced&#xD;
           ATL to date of death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persistence of CAR.CD30 T cells in vivo will be determined by quantitative PCR and flow&#xD;
           cytometry in peripheral blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient reported symptoms will be measured using selected symptoms from the NCI&#xD;
           PRO-CTCAE. Patient-reported physical function will be measured using the PROMIS Physical&#xD;
           Function Score derived from the PROMIS Physical Function Short Form 20a v1.0.&#xD;
           Patient-reported health-related quality of life will be measured using the PROMIS Global&#xD;
           Health Score derived from the PROMIS Global Health Short Form v1.0-1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled to undergo an autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for treatment of&#xD;
      lymphoma will be approached for consent to screening and potential enrollment into LCCC1524.&#xD;
      Peripheral blood cells will be collected from consenting patients who meet eligibility for&#xD;
      cell procurement for creation of ATLCAR.CD30 cells prior to ASCT. The ASCT, including&#xD;
      mobilization and collection of PBSCs, administration of myeloablative therapy, reinfusion of&#xD;
      PBSCs and supportive care following transplant will be as per routine standard of care, and&#xD;
      not expected to be impacted by enrollment into LCCC1524. Post ASCT, patients who meet&#xD;
      eligibility criteria for treatment will receive one infusion of ATLCAR.CD30 cells once there&#xD;
      is evidence of hematologic recovery. Research personnel will keep track of any patients who&#xD;
      undergo procurement but do not undergo treatment with ATLCAR.CD30 cells, and the reason for&#xD;
      withholding treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell Procurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood, up to 300 mL total (in up to 3 collections) will be obtained for subjects&#xD;
      for cell procurement. In patients with low (CD3 count as assayed by flow cytometry less than&#xD;
      200/μl) T-cell count in the peripheral blood, a leukopheresis may be performed to isolate&#xD;
      sufficient T cells. The parameters for pheresis will be up to 2 blood volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For pediatric patients (patients under 18 years of age), the total amount of blood drawn will&#xD;
      not be more than 3 mL (less than 1 teaspoon per 2.2 lbs. that the child weighs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATLCAR.CD30 Cells Administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post ASCT, once the patient has started to experience hematologic recovery (defined as ANC&#xD;
      ≥500 cells/mm3 for 3 consecutive days, AND platelet count ≥25 cells/mm3 without transfusion&#xD;
      over the preceding 5 days, AND Hg ≥8g/dL without transfusion support over preceding 5 days),&#xD;
      ATLCAR.CD30 cells will be admnistered. This will generally occur between 14 and 20 days&#xD;
      following infusion of autologous stem cells following high-dose chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy in LCCC1524 involves just one infusion of ATLCAR.CD30 cells. Treatment with one&#xD;
      infusion will be administered unless:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient decides to withdraw from study treatment, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable&#xD;
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Follow-Up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for up to 15 years or until death, whichever occurs first. Patients&#xD;
      removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or&#xD;
      stabilization of the adverse event.&#xD;

    <description>Three dose levels of ATLCAR.CD30 cells will be evaluated. Using the modified continual reassessment method (CRM), initial cohort of size two will be enrolled at each dose level after that subjects are enrolled one at a time until a minimum of 12 patients is treated. Each patient will receive one injection according to the dosing schedules listed below. Investigators will start with the lowest cell dose (2X10^7 cells/m^2) given to patients in one of our previous trials employing CAR-T cells including the CD28 costimulatory endodomain, and investigators will escalate the cell dose to the highest cell dose (2X10^8/m^2) given in the same trial.&#xD;
Note: Initially, only adults will be enrolled during the dose escalation phase of the study. Once a dose level has been tested in at least 2 adults without the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), children may then be enrolled on that dose level according to the CRM.</description>
