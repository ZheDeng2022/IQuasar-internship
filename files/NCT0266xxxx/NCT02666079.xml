  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single arm, multi-centre study to evaluate the intra-operative&#xD;
      use of the LightPath® Imaging System for the assessment of tumour margin status compared to&#xD;
      hospital standard of care histopathology in wide local excision (WLE) for breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intraoperative 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) LightPath® Images will be used to inform&#xD;
      the surgeons about detectable residual cancer, in an attempt to achieve better guided cancer&#xD;
      surgery and complete tumour excision with clear WLE resection margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sites will use the local criteria considered standard of care to guide decisions to act&#xD;
      on positive margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the LightPath® arm the resection margin status of the WLE specimen, cavity shavings (if&#xD;
      any) and the metastatic status of axillary (sentinel) lymph nodes as measured with the&#xD;
      LightPath® Imaging System will be compared with histopathology results.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Female subjects with a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer scheduled to have wide local&#xD;
      excision (WLE) +/- sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)&#xD;
      will be screened and receive 18F-FDG plus LightPath® Image. Subjects will have standard of&#xD;
      care WLE. Extra cavity shaving due to positive 18F-FDG LightPath® Images is at the discretion&#xD;
      of the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive an intravenous injection of up to 5 MBq/kg, to a maximum 300&#xD;
      MegaBecquerel (MBq) of 18F-FDG prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following resection, the WLE specimen will be examined using the LightPath® Imaging System.&#xD;
      If the surgeons detect a positive signal they may perform cavity shavings of the resection&#xD;
      cavity area corresponding to the positive signal area (up to a maximum thickness of 10mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axillary SLNB will be performed according to local practice. At sites where 99mTc is used: In&#xD;
      the 18F-FDG + LightPath® a higher dose of up to 150 MBq technetium-99m (99mTc) nanocolloid is&#xD;
      necessary to avoid 18F-FDG masking the signal from 99mTc. Blue dye will be used according to&#xD;
      local practice at sites where it is considered standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) will be examined using the LightPath® Imaging System. Where&#xD;
      clinically indicated, ALND will be performed as per standard of care. At the time this&#xD;
      protocol was finalised, LightPath® data involved lymph nodes sufficient to support&#xD;
      recommendations were not available. For this reason, LightPath® Image results will not be&#xD;
      used to direct ALND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All LightPath® Images will be performed between 60 and 180 minutes post injection of 18F-FDG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WLE specimen, cavity shavings (where performed) and SLNs (where performed) will then&#xD;
      undergo standard of care histopathological analysis. Lymph nodes will also be examined&#xD;
      according to standard of care histopathological analysis. The results of the&#xD;
      histopathological analysis will then be correlated with the LightPath® Images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All staff in the operating room will wear badge dosimeters. Staff handling surgical specimens&#xD;
      in theatre will also wear ring dosimeters. Histopathology analyses should be delayed to allow&#xD;
      for radioactive decay of tissue samples to suitably low levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated at screening and enrolment into the study. Data will be collected&#xD;
      until the decision by the study site's MDT to recommend re-excision or mastectomy because of&#xD;
      a positive margin on histopathological analysis (approx. 1-6 weeks post surgery)&#xD;
