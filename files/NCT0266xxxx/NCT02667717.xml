      AlgoMIR project born thanks to a meeting between pain professionals and re-education staff.&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a program of learning with exercises by&#xD;
      mirror therapy, that could be easily shared with paramedic teams and easily adapted to&#xD;
      different handicaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have chosen to select patients with re-education of the upper extremity to&#xD;
      benefit from rehabilitation sessions either from physiotherapists present in their city, or&#xD;
      of functional rehabilitation hospital units.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Complex Regional Painful Syndromes (CRPS) called in the past aglodystrophia, are&#xD;
      characterized by the apparition of pain abnormally spread and intensive compared to the&#xD;
      initial causal factor. They are usually associated to negligence of the painful limb, and&#xD;
      avoidance movements that require care in rehabilitation that it is carried out in the&#xD;
      physiotherapist center or functional rehabilitation unit at hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, mirror therapy has been proposed to correct dysfunctions : patients have to realize&#xD;
      a movement with their two hands, observing the reflect of their healthy hand in a mirror,&#xD;
      while their painful hand is hidden behind the mirror. After a learning phase, patients have&#xD;
      to continue this kind of therapy independently.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this project is to compare analgesic effect at 8 and 16 weeks of a&#xD;
      therapy mirror re-education program associated to a usual care (M+R), and of a usual care&#xD;
      program (R).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second goal is to understand eventual difficulties met by the patients and improve efficacy&#xD;
      of the autonomous becoming of patients using mirror therapy.&#xD;
