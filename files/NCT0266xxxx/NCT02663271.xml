  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and deadliest primary malignant neoplasm of&#xD;
      the central nervous system in adults. Despite an aggressive multimodality treatment approach&#xD;
      including surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, overall survival remains poor.&#xD;
      Novocure has shown that when properly tuned, very low intensity, intermediate frequency&#xD;
      electric fields (TTFields) stunt the growth of tumor cells. The Optune system (NovoTTFTM&#xD;
      Therapy) is a portable battery operated device, which produces TTFields within the human body&#xD;
      by means of surface transducer arrays. The TTFields are applied to the patient by means of&#xD;
      surface transducer arrays that are electrically insulated, so that resistively coupled&#xD;
      electric currents are not delivered to the patient. Optune is currently FDA-approved as a&#xD;
      single modality treatment for recurrent GBM when both surgical and radiotherapy options have&#xD;
      been exhausted as well as combination with adjuvant temozolomide for newly diagnosed GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is being performed to determine whether or not TTFields combined with&#xD;
      pulsed bevacizumab treatment increases overall survival in patients with&#xD;
      bevacizumab-refractory GBM compared to historical controls treated with continuous&#xD;
      bevacizumab alone or in combination with other chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who have evidence of bevacizumab-refractory GBM will be eligible to participate in&#xD;
      this research study. Subjects will undergo 12 months of planned continuous treatment with&#xD;
      TTFields followed by pulsed bevacizumab treatment when there is evidence of further&#xD;
      progression per RANO, with the option of extending treatment up to a total of 24 months in&#xD;
      patients who have not progressed and/or have adequate performance status at the 12 month&#xD;
      mark. Pulsed bevacizumab dosing is defined by at least one cycle on and at least one cycle&#xD;
      off. A cycle is defined as 8 weeks in length. If after one cycle on, there is no evidence of&#xD;
      a repeat response; bevacizumab will be continued for one more cycle. If after two cycles on,&#xD;
      there is no repeat response; bevacizumab will be continued with or without other standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy until death. If after at least one cycle on, there is evidence of repeat&#xD;
      response, bevacizumab will be discontinued for at least one cycle or until progression is&#xD;
      noted again per RANO, whichever is later, at which time pulsed bevacizumab will be restarted&#xD;
      as outlined above. The investigators believe that this approach will produce peaks and&#xD;
      troughs in mitotic activities of glioma cells that render glioma cells more sensitive to the&#xD;
      antimitotic activity of Optune during peak growth rates, thus lowering disease burden and&#xD;
      increasing survival. In addition, the following will be performed: Bevacizumab will be given&#xD;
      at 10mg/kg IV every 2 weeks. Physical examination and quality of life (QoL) assessments will&#xD;
      be performed bi-monthly. Brain MRI will be performed every 2 months.&#xD;
