    <textblock>
      Background: At present pneumonia and malnutrition have become the leading causes of mortality&#xD;
      among &lt;5-year-old children in developing countries. World Health Organization standard&#xD;
      management of severe pneumonia and severe malnutrition requires hospitalization for&#xD;
      supportive care. As many developing countries including Bangladesh do not have enough&#xD;
      pediatric hospital beds to accommodate the demand for admission of all children with severe&#xD;
      pneumonia and malnutrition, Investigators developed alternative treatment option such as &quot;Day&#xD;
      Care Approach&quot;, for those children who cannot be hospitalized, but are too sick to be managed&#xD;
      in the community. After successful Day Care Approach of management of efficacy trials with&#xD;
      severe childhood pneumonia and severe malnutrition, the next step is to conduct an&#xD;
      effectiveness trial under &quot;real life&quot; condition, i.e. within the Health Systems of&#xD;
      Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burden: Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in developing countries, being&#xD;
      responsible for 1,368,000 (18%) of annual 7.6 million deaths, 95% occurring in developing&#xD;
      countries. Similarly, malnutrition is a major health problem with an estimated 1.7 &amp; 3.6&#xD;
      million children dying annually because of Severe Acute Malnutrition &amp; Moderate Acute&#xD;
      Malnutrition, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To assess &amp; implement the Day Care Approach of management of severe childhood&#xD;
      pneumonia with or without Moderate Acute Malnutrition and/or severe underweight into existing&#xD;
      Health Systems of Bangladesh as a safe &amp; cost effective alternative to Existing Treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted in Bangladesh by involving&#xD;
      16 clusters (Wards) in Dhaka &amp; 16 clusters (Unions) in rural areas that will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to intervention &amp; control arm. Children with severe pneumonia will be enrolled in&#xD;
      (i) Tikatuli, (ii) Circular Road, (iii) Dhamrai Upazilla of Dhaka, (iv) Karimganj Upazillas&#xD;
      to one of two management schemes: (i) Existing Treatment in control clusters or (ii) Day care&#xD;
      Approach in intervention clusters by involving Comprehensive Reproductive Health Centres in&#xD;
      urban and Health and Family Welfare Centres in rural areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary: clinical treatment failure by day 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
           (i) Treatment failure between day 7-14 in children who are well on day 6 (ii) Cost&#xD;
           effectiveness (iii) Referrals to hospitals (iv) Deaths&#xD;

      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess whether or not the Day care Approach for the management of severe childhood&#xD;
           pneumonia with or without moderate acute malnutrition and/or severe underweight&#xD;
           incorporated into the existing urban and rural Health Systems of Bangladesh is safe and&#xD;
           effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To implement the Day care Approach for the management of severe childhood pneumonia with&#xD;
           or without moderate acute malnutrition and/or underweight within the Health Systems of&#xD;
           Bangladesh as a cost effective alternative to the Existing Treatment of care for both&#xD;
           the Health Systems and the families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine and compare the cost effectiveness of the Day care Approach versus Existing&#xD;
           Treatment of care for the management of severe childhood pneumonia with or without&#xD;
           moderate acute malnutrition and/or severe underweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify and assess potential barriers and challenges during the whole implementation&#xD;
           process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background of the Project including Preliminary Observations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present and depending on clinical presentation, pneumonia is classified as severe&#xD;
      pneumonia, pneumonia, or no pneumonia, according to the recent guidelines by the World Health&#xD;
      Organization in 2013. Since pneumonia is the leading cause of death in &lt;5-year-old children,&#xD;
      interventions to promote the prevention and treatment of pneumonia are an essential part of&#xD;
      child survival efforts to achieve Millennium Development Goal 4. World Health Organization&#xD;
      standard management of severe pneumonia requires hospitalization for supportive treatment&#xD;
      including oxygen therapy for hypoxaemia, airway suctioning, fluid and nutritional management,&#xD;
      antibiotics, and careful monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most, if not all, developing countries including Bangladesh do not have enough hospitals, or&#xD;
      pediatric hospital beds to accommodate the demand for admission of all children with severe&#xD;
      pneumonia with or without malnutrition and other co-morbidity. In addition, mothers of ill&#xD;
      children have other childcare and household responsibilities that constrain their ability to&#xD;
      attend the child during hospitalization, which is often mandatory. Furthermore,&#xD;
      transportation, cost, long distance from the hospital, lack of adequate child-care at home,&#xD;
      or cultural perceptions represent additional huge limitations to hospitalization.&#xD;
      Hospitalization also may not be feasible due to inability of parents to stay in hospital for&#xD;
      the entire duration of illness. The sum total of all these common potential constraints lead&#xD;
      to failure of hospitalization of children with severe pneumonia and severe malnutrition with&#xD;
      or without additional co-morbidity. This inadequate availability and use of hospital beds&#xD;
      leading to failure of hospitalization of children with severe pneumonia and/or malnutrition&#xD;
      assuredly results in excess and unwanted deaths of children, who, with proper care, would&#xD;
      otherwise survive. Although Investigators do not have direct evidence (no data available)&#xD;
      that the bottleneck to pneumonia deaths in Bangladesh is lack of hospital beds mainly. But&#xD;
      Investigators know from experience that many children with severe pneumonia requiring&#xD;
      hospitalization are not hospitalized due to the lack of free pediatric beds, as observed&#xD;
      during the observational day care studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design A cluster randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted in urban Dhaka&#xD;
      and rural Bangladesh. The trial areas are pre-selected on the basis of infrastructure&#xD;
      (adequate space, water supply, electricity, and willingness for performing the study). In the&#xD;
      urban areas, 16 clusters equivalent to Wards (either whole or partial), with a population of&#xD;
      50,000 to 80,000 each and in the rural areas, another 16 clusters equivalent to Unions each&#xD;
      with about 20,000 to 30,000 inhabitants. Children with severe pneumonia, according to recent&#xD;
      World Health Organization criteria (2013) with or without malnutrition will be enrolled into&#xD;
      the study in urban Dhaka: (i) Tikatuli, Surjer Hashi Clinic, 12, K.M. Das Lane and (ii)&#xD;
      Circular Road Circular Road Surjer Hashi Clinic, New Circular Road; and rural Bangladesh:&#xD;
      (iii) Dhamrai Upazilla of Dhaka District, and (iv) Karimganj Upazilla of Kishoreganj District&#xD;
      to one of the two management schemes: (i) the Existing Treatment in the control clusters, or&#xD;
      (ii) the Day care Approach in the intervention clusters. Children with history of cough,&#xD;
      fever and difficult breathing suggestive of having severe pneumonia will be enrolled at&#xD;
      primary health facilities such as Primary Health Care Centres or Comprehensive Reproductive&#xD;
      Health Centres in the urban areas and Health and Family Welfare Centres or Community Clinics&#xD;
      in the rural areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study sites Urban: United States Agency for International Development -Department For&#xD;
      International Development support Non Government Organization Health Service Delivery Project&#xD;
      through Pathfinder run by the Population Services and Training Center and Concerned Women for&#xD;
      Family Development. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare contributes to urban health&#xD;
      care through the outpatient services offered through its secondary, tertiary and specialized&#xD;
      hospitals located in the urban settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rural: Health services in Bangladesh in the rural areas are mostly provided by the&#xD;
      Government's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), and&#xD;
      private providers. In the government sector, two community based workers - a family welfare&#xD;
      assistant and a health assistant - and a community clinic run by a community health care&#xD;
      provider serve a population of 6000 to 7000. Another first level outpatient clinic - e.g.&#xD;
      Union Health and Family Welfare Centres - serves a population of about 20,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and masking The trial field sites have been pre-selected on the basis of&#xD;
      infrastructure (adequate space, water supply, electricity and willingness for performing the&#xD;
      study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing Treatment (control) clusters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children in the control Existing Treatment clusters with pneumonia (not severe pneumonia)&#xD;
      with/without malnutrition will be identified by the Community Health Worker/Community Service&#xD;
      Providers in the urban areas or Field Research Assistants/Field Assistants in the rural&#xD;
      areas, or self-referred by the parents/caregivers to the Primary Health Care Centres (Vital&#xD;
      clinics)/Comprehensive Reproductive Health Centres (Ultra clinics) in the urban areas and&#xD;
      Community Clinics/Health and Family Welfare Centres in the rural areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up in the Existing Treatment control clusters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community Health Workers/Field Research Assistants/Field Assistants will perform the&#xD;
      follow-up visits at the clinics on days 2, child's home on day 3, and clinics on day 6 and&#xD;
      day 14 (window period + 1 day) in the Existing Treatment clusters of all four primary study&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of treatment failure in control areas children will be referred to hospital from Day&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day Care Approach (Intervention) clusters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, children of the intervention Day care Approach clusters with pneumonia (not severe&#xD;
      pneumonia) with or without malnutrition will be addressed in the same manner as the control&#xD;
      clusters, i.e. be identified by the Community Health Workers in the urban areas and Field&#xD;
      Research Assistants/Field Assistants in the rural areas. As with the children in the control&#xD;
      clusters at the 1st level care centres (Primary Health Care Centres/Comprehensive&#xD;
      Reproductive Health Centres in the urban areas and Community Clinics/Health and Family&#xD;
      Welfare Centres in the rural areas), the children will be assessed by the&#xD;
      Physicians/Pediatricians working at the Comprehensive Reproductive Health Centres in the&#xD;
      urban areas and by the Sub Assistant Community Medical Officers working at the Health and&#xD;
      Family Welfare Centres in the rural areas and finally evaluated by a trained study physician&#xD;
      and treated at home with oral antibiotics (syrup Amoxicillin 90 mg/kg three divided doses or&#xD;
      Co-trimoxazole 40 mg/kg two divided doses per day for 5 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with pneumonia (i.e., not severe pneumonia) who fail to the community level oral&#xD;
      Amoxicillin/Co-trimoxazole treatment for two days as well as those presenting with severe&#xD;
      pneumonia (self-referred or identified by Community Health Workers/Field Research&#xD;
      Assistants/Field Assistants) right from beginning will be assessed by the&#xD;
      Physicians/Pediatricians working at the Comprehensive Reproductive Health Centres in the&#xD;
      urban areas and by the Sub Assistant Community Medical Officers working at the Health and&#xD;
      Family Welfare Centres in the rural areas and finally evaluated by a trained study physician&#xD;
      and directly referred to the Comprehensive Reproductive Health Centres in the urban areas or&#xD;
      Health and Family Welfare Centres in the rural areas for Day care Approach of management. For&#xD;
      this purpose, the children will be admitted to a day-care section of the Comprehensive&#xD;
      Reproductive Health Centres in the urban areas from 08:30 to 17:00 hours and to a day-care&#xD;
      section of the Health and Family Welfare Centres in the rural areas from 08:30 to 15:00 hours&#xD;
      on all days of the week including weekends and public holidays, until fulfilling the criteria&#xD;
      for discharge (clinical end-points, defined as no hypoxemia, no fever, no fast breathing and&#xD;
      no tachycardia). Parents will bring their children to the Comprehensive Reproductive Health&#xD;
      Centres/Health and Family Welfare Centres at 8:30 hours in the morning every day and return&#xD;
      them back home at 15:00 hours in rural areas or 17:00 hours in urban areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up study up to 3 months after discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      After successful management of all enrolled study children belonging to all Existing&#xD;
      Treatment/Day care Approach clusters will be discharged from the Comprehensive Reproductive&#xD;
      Health Centres/Health and Family Welfare Centres. The study physicians will inform the&#xD;
      parents on the dates of follow-up visits for the next 3 months written down in the discharge&#xD;
      certificate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic Evaluation of Intervention Alternatives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness trial of severe pneumonia without/with Moderate Acute Malnutrition and or&#xD;
      severe underweight is planned to implement the Day care Approach of treatment into the urban&#xD;
      Comprehensive Reproductive Health Centres in Dhaka city or the rural Health and Family&#xD;
      Welfare Centres of Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost of intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention costs consist of the costs of providers and households.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost of provider Cost to household&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation and Outcome (Primary and Secondary) Variable(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cluster-randomized design for dichotomous outcomes with an equivalency design and the&#xD;
      explicit expectation that the results on primary outcomes would fall within the 95%&#xD;
      Confidence Intervals. Because the number of clusters is fixed at 8 clusters per site per year&#xD;
      including 4 control and 4 intervention and a power of 90%, coefficient of variation of 0.20,&#xD;
      and an alpha of 0.05. On the basis of these assumptions, 50 children with severe pneumonia&#xD;
      with or without malnutrition with or without severe under-weight per cluster per year will be&#xD;
      enrolled over 2.5 years, for an estimated 2000 patients in each study arm including 15%&#xD;
      drop-outs. 32 clusters will be needed in each study arm. Therefore, for a period of 2.5&#xD;
      years, a total of 4000 children can be easily recruited within the time frame from 4 primary&#xD;
      study sites. The estimated incidence of pneumonia is taken as 0.23 episode/ child/ year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary outcome variable will be the following (i) Clinical treatment failure by day&#xD;
           6 after enrollment (ii) Success rate of the Health System Day acre Approach plus&#xD;
           referral to hospital verses Existing Treatment plus referral to hospital)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary outcome variables will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Treatment failure or relapse between day 7 and day 14 in children who are well on day 6&#xD;
      (iv) Economic evaluation (cost-effective analyses) (v) Referrals to hospitals (vi) Deaths&#xD;
      (vii) Compliance to treatment (viii) Anthropometrical indices such as body weight,&#xD;
      length/height, Mid Upper Arm Circumference, Weight-for-Age (%), Weight-for-Height (%),&#xD;
      Height-for-Age (%) (ix) Morbidity, mortality, relapse and hospitalization during 3-months&#xD;
      follow-up after discharge from the study (x) Family/patient satisfaction&#xD;
