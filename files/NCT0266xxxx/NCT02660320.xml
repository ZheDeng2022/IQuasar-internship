      Principal objective: To compare the efficacy of laser-assisted dermabrasion + autologous&#xD;
      epidermal cells suspension grafting versus dermabrasion using micro-needling technique +&#xD;
      autologous epidermal cells suspension grafting and dermabrasion using micro-needling&#xD;
      technique + placebo suspension grafting in stable vitiligo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 10 patients with stable non-segmental vitiligo will be included in the ITT&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each patient, three separate test areas will be selected in the same part of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One area will be pre-treated with dermaroller and receive the hyaluronic acid suspension&#xD;
      alone and the two others will receive the epidermal cell suspension in hyaluronic acid after&#xD;
      pre-treatment either with dermaroller or laser-assisted dermabrasion, each patient being his&#xD;
      own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted phototherapy with excimer lamp (308 nMm) will be applied on all test areas 1 week&#xD;
      after cell grafting.&#xD;

      Condition Stable lesion of Vitiligo of adulthood&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Laser-assisted dermabrasion is the gold standard for preparing the grafting bed of&#xD;
      epidermal suspension but it requires a technical platform and a trained physician. Side&#xD;
      effects are not uncommon. We have demonstrated in an ex vivo study that micro-needles create&#xD;
      holes in the epidermis allowing cells to reach the lower layers of the epidermis. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the use of micro-needles could be an effective and easy technique for&#xD;
      preparing the grafting bed for epidermal suspensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Principal objective: To compare the efficacy of laser-assisted dermabrasion +&#xD;
      autologous epidermal cells suspension grafting versus dermabrasion using micro-needling&#xD;
      technique + autologous epidermal cells suspension grafting and dermabrasion using&#xD;
      micro-needling technique + placebo suspension grafting in stable vitiligo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate and compare the tolerability of the distinct procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the global satisfaction of patient and the willingness to reproduce the&#xD;
           procedure for treating other areas&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the contrast between treated skin and perilesional area&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Prospective, multicentre, randomized, controlled, blind assessor trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men and women aged over 18 years old with a diagnosis of non-segmental lesions that has&#xD;
           been stable over three months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The minimum distance between the normal pigmented skin and the test area should&#xD;
           preferably be at least 0.5 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For each patient the lesions are located on the same area (either chest, back, legs or&#xD;
           arms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The lesion area must be: 2cm2 &lt; lesion&lt;50cm2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment resistant areas (failure of at least one medical procedure topical tacrolimus&#xD;
           or topical steroids for 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of infected lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lesions stable for at least one year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Hypersensibility to local anaesthetics or one of the components of the&#xD;
      device (trypsin, hyaluronic acid)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indication against biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient with a history of melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positive serology (ongoing serious systemic disease, herpes, HIV, hepatitis B and C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of keloidal scars and presence of Koebner's phenomenon (type 1 and type 2b)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infected lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient with concomitant photosensitizing treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &lt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major deprived of their freedom by administrative or legal decision, or being the&#xD;
           subject of a legal protection measure, or out of state to express their consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant,delivering or lactating patients. For the women childbearing potential, a&#xD;
           urinary pregnancy test will be done and effective contraception will be expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions After inclusion visit, randomization will occur during visit 1, the day of the&#xD;
      surgery to determine which lesion will be treated by dermaroller+hyaluronic acid,&#xD;
      dermaroller+VITICELL® or laser-assisted dermabrasion+VITICELL®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dermabrasion procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three test areas will be selected on the same part of body. Each lesion will respectively&#xD;
      treated by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dermaroller + hyaluronic acid + phototherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dermaroller + VITICELL® + phototherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laser + VITICELL® + phototherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dermabrasion using laser:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prepare the graft recipient site, the upper layer of epidermis is removed by superficial&#xD;
      dermabrasion using Erbium or CO2 ablative laser. The test area is ready to receive suspension&#xD;
      cells when the dermis will appeared. The cells suspension will be applied on the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dermabrasion using dermaroller: The dermaroller is applied on the treated areas, this&#xD;
      dermabrasion technique is based on micro holes performed using 540 micro needles (200µm&#xD;
      depth) which should allow the penetration of the suspension cells or hyaluronic acid alone.&#xD;
      Twelve passages will be performed on the treated area in order to achieve 60% of coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VITICELL® treated area:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small sample of skin (biopsy) will be collected from the gluteal area. The biopsy will be&#xD;
      measured 4 cm2 (2x2cm) systematically. While the investigator is preparing the areas to be&#xD;
      treated, the skin will be placed into the VITICELL® kit by other heath professional. The&#xD;
      VITICELL® kit will transform the patient's collected skin into a cellular suspension. The&#xD;
      suspension of epidermal cells is then applied (100µL per cm2) onto the 2 selected&#xD;
      lesions/areas after dermabrasion with dermaroller or laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyaluronic acid with PBS treated area:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The suspension of hyaluronic acid is applied (100 µL/cm2) onto the selected lesion after&#xD;
      dermabrasion with dermaroller.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the surgery, the treated area and biopsy site will be covered with a dressing and&#xD;
      must be protected from direct sun and physical impact for a period of 6 -7days. After this&#xD;
      period the dressing will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phototherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phototherapy will begin a week after cells grafting and will be used 2 times a week for&#xD;
      all the treatment duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultraviolet (UV) spectrum has been used on test areas. These different wavelength will&#xD;
      promote melanogenesis and melanocyte proliferation on graft side.&#xD;
