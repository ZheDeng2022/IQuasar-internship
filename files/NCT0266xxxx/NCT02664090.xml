      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) commonly complicates acute illness in ICU. This&#xD;
      syndrome is associated with high morbidity and mortality. In management of ARDS patients,&#xD;
      lung protective ventilation and prone ventilation are key strategies which have shown&#xD;
      survival benefits in recent years. Prone positioning has been reported to have hemodynamic&#xD;
      disturbances like hypotension and arrhythmias. The literature till date is unclear with&#xD;
      regards to acute hemodynamic changes which can happen during initiation of prone ventilation&#xD;
      ,with a few studies suggesting decreasing cardiac output and a few increasing cardiac output.&#xD;
      In recent years, trans-esophageal Doppler (TED) has become one of important hemodynamic&#xD;
      assessment tool due to its minimal invasiveness, ease of use with its clinical utility&#xD;
      established by various studies both in operation theatres and intensive care units. In&#xD;

      Introduction and rationale of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) commonly complicates acute illness in intensive&#xD;
      care units (ICU). This syndrome is associated with high morbidity and mortality. In&#xD;
      management of ARDS patients, lung protective ventilation and prone ventilation are key&#xD;
      strategies which have shown survival benefits in recent years and now becomes standard part&#xD;
      of care in these patients. Prone positioning has been reported to have hemodynamic&#xD;
      disturbances like hypotension and arrhythmias. Prone ventilation can have different&#xD;
      cardiovascular effects with a few suggesting increased cardiac output and few decreased&#xD;
      cardiac output with unclear literature till date with one recent study suggesting that&#xD;
      patients who have preload reserve had increased cardiac output when compared to patients with&#xD;
      no preload reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ICU, hemodynamic monitoring is being done as a part of standard care of management in&#xD;
      critically ill patients. There are different modalities of continuous hemodynamic monitoring,&#xD;
      which help in timely assessment and appropriate interventions to optimize cardiac output to&#xD;
      maintain adequate organ perfusion in these critically ill patients. Cardiac output could be&#xD;
      assessed by thermo-dilution technique with pulmonary artery catheter, pulse contour analysis&#xD;
      of arterial waveform or echocardiography. In recent years, trans-esophageal Doppler (TED) has&#xD;
      become one of the standard hemodynamic assessment tool in ICU due to its minimal invasiveness&#xD;
      and easy to use. TED uses Doppler shift principle which is routinely used to measure cardiac&#xD;
      output in both trans-thoracic and trans-oesophageal echocardiography. The clinical utility of&#xD;
      TED, with the benefit of minimal invasiveness, in assessing hemodynamic perturbations in both&#xD;
      operation theatre and ICU has been established by various studies. Doppler measured cardiac&#xD;
      output showed high validity and clinical agreement with gold standard pulmonary artery&#xD;
      thermo-dilution technique, which is more invasive. Hemodynamic assessment in prone position&#xD;
      with TED has been studied intra-operatively with good correlation. In current study, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate acute hemodynamic effects of prone ventilation with TED in&#xD;
      patients of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work plan methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, observational study, to be conducted in 12 bedded ICU of&#xD;
      department of Critical Care Medicine, Sanjay Gandhi Institute of Postgraduate and Medical&#xD;
      Sciences, Lucknow. Patients with ARDS whose hemodynamic monitoring is being done by TED, and&#xD;
      planned for prone ventilation by treating physician's decision, will be screened for&#xD;
      inclusion in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent from patient's family member for inclusion in the study, demographic&#xD;
      data including age, sex, weight, height and ideal body weight (IBW) will be noted. All study&#xD;
      participants will have trans-thoracic echocardiography done before inclusion to exclude&#xD;
      conditions that can interfere with oesophageal doppler readings like aortic coarctation,&#xD;
      severe aortic stenosis, or severe aortic regurgitation. Hemodynamic monitoring with TED&#xD;
      (Cardio Q) in these patients will be decided and initiated by treating clinician. As a part&#xD;
      of standard treatment for ARDS, all patients will be receiving lung protective ventilation&#xD;
      strategies as per ARDS net protocol with appropriate sedation, and also these patients will&#xD;
      have relevant invasive and non-invasive vitals monitoring as per ICU protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After decision for prone ventilation by treating clinician and obtaining consent for&#xD;
      inclusion in this study, prior to any parameter measurement during study period, probe&#xD;
      position of TED will be verified to ensure optimal acquisition of maximum velocity signal.&#xD;
      Baseline hemodynamic and respiratory parameters (T1) will be noted in 45 degree head&#xD;
      elevation position. Second set (T2) of hemodynamic parameters will be noted after passive leg&#xD;
      raise test (PLR). Third set (T3) of hemodynamic parameters in supine position along with IAP&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ARDS patients will be proned as per ICU protocol, with protective measures for eyes,&#xD;
      extended arms, and using appropriate thoraco-pelvic supports for unloading the abdomen and&#xD;
      taking all other precautions required for prone positioning. After proning, transducers for&#xD;
      invasive monitoring will be re-zeroed relative to atmospheric pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourth set (T4) of parameters (hemodynamic) 5 minutes after prone ventilation will be noted.&#xD;
      While, fifth set (T5) of parameters (hemodynamic, respiratory and IAP) will be noted 10&#xD;
      minutes after prone ventilation. Subsequently, hemodynamic parameters will be noted at 20&#xD;
      minutes (T6) and the last set (T7) of parameters (hemodynamic and respiratory) will be noted&#xD;
      30 minutes after initiation of prone ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: Sample size was calculated by power analysis using PASS 2008&#xD;
      software, with difference in means of cardiac output of 0.6 litre/minute/meter2 between two&#xD;
      paired groups and with 95% confidence interval (CI) and 80% power of the study, 22 patients&#xD;
      will require. So, the investigators planned to include 25 patients for our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Demographic and clinical characteristics (ventilatory and hemodynamics) of&#xD;
      all included patients will be collected on structured proforma. ICU prognostication scores,&#xD;
      i.e., Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and Sequential Organ&#xD;
      Dysfunction Assessment (SOFA) will also be recorded. From baseline parameters noted before&#xD;
      turning the patient prone and after PLR, hemodynamic, ventilatory parameters at sequential&#xD;
      time intervals will be noted down until thirty minutes after initiation of prone ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Nil. All patients will be managed as per the ICU treating team's decision&#xD;
