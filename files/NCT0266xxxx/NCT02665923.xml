  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound imaging will be used to evaluate time for gastric emptying in healthy, fasting&#xD;
      newborns, and infants following feeding of clear liquids and/or milk (including breast or&#xD;
      formula).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves serial ultrasounds over several visits. Healthy newborns in the Newborn&#xD;
      Nursery will be recruited to conduct this study. The study will include a total of 50 healthy&#xD;
      newborns who will be given formula feeding of known volume, and then serial ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging of gastric antral volume will be performed until gastric emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study originally was designed to perform follow up of these newborns at two later time&#xD;
      intervals (between ages 4-6 months, and 9-12 months). The purpose of follow-up is to evaluate&#xD;
      whether there are age-related changes in gastric emptying. Due to the pause/suspension of&#xD;
      research activity during the pandemic, these follow up studies of the original newborn cohort&#xD;
      could not be completed. The protocol is thus revised as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit 30 4-6 months old and 30 9-12months old infants and perform gastric&#xD;
      emptying serial ultrasound to evaluate if there are age-related changes in gastric emptying.&#xD;
