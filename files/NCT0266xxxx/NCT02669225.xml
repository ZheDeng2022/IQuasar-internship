      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain activity creates waste products. The body s glymphatic system removes this waste,&#xD;
      especially during sleep. One brain waste product is amyloid-beta (Ab). It plays a role in&#xD;
      Alzheimer s disease. Researchers want to study the effect of sleep on Ab in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if sleep affects the amount of waste product removed from the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine&#xD;
      tests. They will answer questions about drug use, psychiatric history, and family history of&#xD;
      alcoholism or drug use. Participants will complete an MRI screening questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the clinic overnight two times. On one night they will sleep&#xD;
      through the night. On the other night they will be kept awake all night. These overnight&#xD;
      visits can happen in any order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear 2 activity monitors, on the wrist and the ankle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have positron emission tomography (PET) scans. A small amount of a&#xD;
      radioactive chemical will be injected through an intravenous (IV) catheter. Participants will&#xD;
      lie on a bed that slides into the scanner. A cap or a special mask may be placed on the&#xD;
      participant s head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The MRI scanner is a metal&#xD;
      cylinder in a strong magnetic field. Participants will lie on a table that slides into the&#xD;
      cylinder. A device called a coil will be placed over the head. Participants will do a task on&#xD;
      a computer screen in the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have tests of thinking, memory, and attention. They may be interviewed,&#xD;
      complete questionnaires, take pen-and-paper or computer tests, and perform simple actions.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess if there are differences in [18F]florbetaben uptake following the first 120 minutes&#xD;
      of its injection (reflecting amyloid-beta or Ab load and/or docked Ab) in subjects during&#xD;
      rested wakefulness (RW) after normal sleep compared to wakefulness after 24 hrs of sleep&#xD;
      deprivation (SD). Specifically, we hypothesize that during RW after a normal night s sleep&#xD;
      there will be less [18F]florbetaben binding measured as distribution volume ratios (DVR) in&#xD;
      precuneus relative to cerebellum (reflecting normal brain clearing of Ab overnight) when&#xD;
      compared to wakefulness after SD, which would interfere with Ab removal from the brain s&#xD;
      interstitial space. Though we will be measuring Ab in whole brain our analysis will focus in&#xD;
      precuneus since this is the brain region that shows the higher levels of Ab accumulation in&#xD;
      contrast to cerebellum where there is no accumulation of Ab. Therefore, overall Ab load in&#xD;
      precuneus (as reflected by [18F]florbetaben DVR) will be lower during RW compared to SD. MRI&#xD;
      and 1H-MRS will be used secondarily to assess if there are differences in connectivity,&#xD;
      function and neurochemistry in precuneus between RW and SD. Because the rate of CSF&#xD;
      production as well as Ab clearance from CSF differs as a function of age the current study&#xD;
      will also allow us to assess if the higher Ab brain levels reported in older than in younger&#xD;
      individuals reflect greater Ab clearance in younger than older individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups consisting of healthy young adults (18 - 40 years of age) and healthy older adults&#xD;
      (&gt;40 years of age). Males and females will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational study. We will complete testing in 15 healthy controls in each group for a&#xD;
      total of thirty subjects (n=30) to assess the brain uptake of [18F]florbetaben (scan done for&#xD;
      120 minutes following tracer injection). The order of the scans (RW vs SD will be&#xD;
      randomized). MRI scans will be obtained either before or after the PET scanning session done&#xD;
      following [18F]florbetaben injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uptake of [18F]florbetaben in the brain will be measured after RW and after SD. Primary&#xD;
      outcomes will be differences in uptake and clearance of [18F]florbetaben in precuneus&#xD;
      (reflecting A beta load and/or docked A beta) in subjects after SD compared to after RW as&#xD;
      measured with distribution volume ratios using cerebellum as reference region and that&#xD;
      clearance of Ab brain (difference between RW and SD) will be greater in younger than in older&#xD;
      participants . We hypothesize that Ab load in precuneus [18F]florbetaben DVR) will be higher&#xD;
      after SD than RW and that this difference will be larger for younger than older participants.&#xD;
      We also predict that older individuals will have higher brain accumulation of Ab than younger&#xD;
      ones. In addition we will assess differences in mean water diffusivity in brain, lactate&#xD;
      concentration, functional connectivity at rest and functional activation during an attention&#xD;
      task between RW and SD conditions. We predict lower fMRI signals in dorsal attention network&#xD;
      (DAN) during attention task, lower functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN),&#xD;
      and lower functional connectivity and mean diffusivity for SD than for RW. We further predict&#xD;
      higher concentration of lactate, a marker of anaerobic metabolism for SD than for RW. As&#xD;
      exploratory analysis we will also assess based on the scans obtained after RW if individuals&#xD;
      with higher brain Ab accumulation will have worse cognitive performance on neuropsychological&#xD;
      tests than those with low brain Ab.&#xD;
