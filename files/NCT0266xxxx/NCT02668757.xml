  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HeartHab study is a pilot trial in which coronary artery disease patients (n = 15-30) are&#xD;
      given the HeartHab application. The HeartHab application is a smarthphone based mobile&#xD;
      application that serves as a secondary prevention tool, to support cardiac patients after&#xD;
      their phase II cardiac rehabilitation program. During study period (4-6 weeks), participating&#xD;
      patients will be asked to use the application. HeartHab includes a module devoted to therapy&#xD;
      compliance, one to exercise training prescription and one to risk factor control. HeartHab&#xD;
      aims to motivate the patient to improve his/her self-management skills and hence decrease&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity (and mortality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motivational aspects and usability data will be collected during study period by means of app&#xD;
      logs and/or questionnaires/interviews.&#xD;
