  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy of a hydrothermally modified starch supplement (Superstarch made&#xD;
      byGeneration UCAN) vs isoenergetic placebo (glucose) on exercise performance, execution of&#xD;
      specific soccer skills, and on cognitive function during and following a simulated soccer&#xD;
      game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: To compare fat oxidation and carbohydrate oxidation (based on RER data) during the&#xD;
      game with Generation UCAN vs isoenergetic placebo (glucose).&#xD;

      This will be a double blind cross over study. There will be two treatments involved:&#xD;
      Superstarch and glucose (placebo). Participants and investigators will be blinded as an&#xD;
      individual not involved in the project will prepare and distribute the treatment (drinks)&#xD;
      according to a coding system that is kept confidential until the study is completed.&#xD;
      Participants will complete each treatment once and the treatment order will be systematically&#xD;
      rotated to avoid any order effect. Healthy men and women soccer players aged 18-35 yr will be&#xD;
      recruited. Participants will come to the lab on five different occasions to complete two&#xD;
      familiarization sessions, a baseline testing session, and two main trials. During the first&#xD;
      visit, the participants will be asked to complete a physical activity readiness questionnaire&#xD;
      (as approved previously; Par Q and a participant information form for personal and familial&#xD;
      health history to rule out any pathologies or health issues that may preclude them from&#xD;
      participating in the present study. Subsequently, the investigators will collect data for&#xD;
      VO2max, body composition and sprinting speed. In the second visit, participants will be&#xD;
      familiarized with the high intensity intermittent exercise protocol to be used during the&#xD;
      study days and will also be allowed to practice the cognitive and skill tests to be used (up&#xD;
      to 8 times in order to remove any learning effect that may influence the results). During the&#xD;
      third visit, baseline scores for the skill tests will be collected. Participants will perform&#xD;
      4 attempts (the first two will be for re-acclimation) and the last two will be recorded. The&#xD;
      remaining two visits will be the study days and will be separated by at least 1 week. The&#xD;
      order of treatments will be randomized to avoid any order effect. The night before study day,&#xD;
      participants will arrive at the laboratory at 19:00 h and will be fed a standardized meal&#xD;
      containing 2g/kg of carbohydrate (pasta and tomato sauce) and will not be allowed any food or&#xD;
      drink except water thereafter. On the study day, participants will arrive to the lab at 07:30&#xD;
      h following an overnight 12h fast and will have refrained from exercise, caffeine or alcohol&#xD;
      within the prior 24 hours. Baseline capillary blood lactate and blood glucose will be&#xD;
      obtained by fingerprick by a trained phlebotomist. In order to ensure the prevention of&#xD;
      infection and or contamination during sampling, standard sterile blood handling techniques&#xD;
      will be used including the use of new medical examination gloves, alcohol swabs, and&#xD;
      disposable sterile lancets. All blood-contaminated materials will be disposed of in a&#xD;
      hazardous material labeled disposal (or sharps) container, promptly after analysis.&#xD;
      Subsequently, baseline data for the cognitive tests will be collected. After collecting&#xD;
      baseline data, the corresponding treatment will be given and 30 minutes after, participants&#xD;
      will perform a standardized 10-minute warm-up, followed by the exercise session. The exercise&#xD;
      session consists of a 60- minute simulated soccer game divided into 4 x 15-minute blocks&#xD;
      exercising (running) at varying intensities that replicate the activity pattern of soccer&#xD;
      such as sprinting, jogging, cruising, walking etc. The proportion of time spent at each speed&#xD;
      will be allocated based on a time-motion analysis of professional soccer players observed by&#xD;
      Reilly and Thomas (1976) as indicated by Clarke et al (2008). During each 15-minute block,&#xD;
      cognitive function will be tested using the serial seven subtraction test and the Flanker&#xD;
      test. Also, expired gas samples will be collected during the last 4 min of each standardized&#xD;
      15-minute block to estimate carbohydrate and fat oxidation. A fingerprick blood lactate and&#xD;
      blood glucose sample will be collected at the end of each 15-minute block. Ratings of&#xD;
      perceived exertion will also be taken at the end of each block. Water will be available&#xD;
      ad-libitum during the first test day and will be quantified. The same amount of water will be&#xD;
      provided for the remaining trial. After completion of the 60-minute simulated soccer game, we&#xD;
      will test physical performance using a repeated sprint ability test comprised of twelve, 30m&#xD;
      sprints with 35sec of walking recovery between each sprint. Subsequently, technical skills&#xD;
      will be assessed using a battery test comprised of the Slalom Dribble test and the&#xD;
      Loughborough Soccer Passing Test (LSPT). The Slalom Dribble test is a skill test that&#xD;
      requires participants to dribble a soccer ball around a set obstacle course taking the least&#xD;
      amount of time possible whereas the LSPT is a test that requires participants to accurately&#xD;
      pass a soccer ball a set number of times towards coloured targets while negotiating a coned&#xD;
      area, as quickly as possible.&#xD;
