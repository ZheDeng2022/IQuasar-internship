  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to test two new radioactive drugs,&#xD;
      4-[18F]fluoro-meta-hydroxyphenethylguanidine ([18F]4F-MHPG) and&#xD;
      3-[18F]fluoro-para-hydroxyphenethylguanidine ([18F]3F-PHPG) in human subjects with congestive&#xD;
      heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations of these imaging agents will include their uptake in heart, lungs and liver,&#xD;
      their metabolic breakdown in blood, and their kinetics in the heart. Based on these studies,&#xD;
      the better of the two drugs will be chosen for further studies in patients with heart&#xD;
      disease. After the better compound is chosen, additional measures of its imaging properties,&#xD;
      metabolism and pharmacokinetics will be done in subjects with heart failure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The human heart contains many nerve fibers that are involved in controlling the heart's&#xD;
      pumping function. Several heart diseases have been shown to damage the nerves in the heart.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that damage to the heart nerves may be a cause of death in patients with&#xD;
      diseases like heart failure or diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two new radioactive drugs been developed at the University of Michigan for taking pictures of&#xD;
      the nerve fibers in the heart using a medical imaging method called positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These two drugs are 4-[18F]fluoro-meta-hydroxyphenethylguanidine ([18F]4F-MHPG) and&#xD;
      3-[18F]fluoro-para-hydroxyphenethylguanidine ([18F]3F-PHPG). Initial PET imaging studies in&#xD;
      normal human subjects (see NCT 02385877) have shown that [18F]4F-MHPG and [18F]3F-PHPG are&#xD;
      each able to provide a detailed regional map of the distribution of nerve fibers in the&#xD;
      heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 1 of this study, enrolled subjects with heart failure will undergo PET studies with&#xD;
      [18F]4F-MHPG and [18F]3F-PHPG to allow direct comparison of the imaging properties,&#xD;
      metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the two radioactive drugs in the same subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third PET scan with [13N]ammonia will be done to assess resting blood flow in different&#xD;
      areas of the heart. The results of these studies will be used to select the better of the two&#xD;
      tracers for further study in patients with heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 2 of the study, enrolled subjects with heart failure will undergo additional PET&#xD;
      evaluations of the imaging properties and kinetics of the cardiac nerve tracer selected in&#xD;
      Stage 1 (either [18F]4F-MHPG or [18F]3F-PHPG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Again, a PET scan with [13N]ammonia will also be performed to measure regional resting blood&#xD;
      flow. A third PET scan with [11C]meta-hydroxyephedrine ([11C]HED), an established cardiac&#xD;
      nerve tracer, will also be done to address research questions related to the mechanisms&#xD;
      involved in the retention of [18F]4F-MHPG and [18F]3F-PHPG inside the nerve of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all study stages, subjects will be assessed during the scan for heart rate, blood&#xD;
      pressure and oxygen saturation. Patients will be followed at 30 min, 24 hours and 30 hours&#xD;
      regarding any adverse events or serious adverse events they might have experienced. These&#xD;
      will be reported as required.&#xD;
