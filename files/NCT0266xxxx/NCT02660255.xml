  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, open-label, flexible dose study that will prospectively and&#xD;
      longitudinally assess the effect of Cannabidiol (CBD) therapy in patients with drug-resistant&#xD;
      epilepsies through a Physician Expanded Access Investigational New Drug protocol.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will test if Cannabidiol (CBD) therapy is safe in humans and reduces the number&#xD;
      and/or severity of seizures in patients with drug resistant epilepsy when taken in addition&#xD;
      to current anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible, subjects must:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have drug-resistant epilepsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  be between 1 and 60 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may participate for up to 2 years and may continue to receive the drug as available,&#xD;
      until the compassionate use is terminated or the drug becomes approved by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline, Screening and 2 phone calls&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 week drug titration (6 visits) and 5 phone calls&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 1 year and 9 month Treatment period (7 visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will come in for visits approximately every two weeks for the first three months and&#xD;
      then quarterly for the remainder of the study. Subjects' antiepileptic drug levels will be&#xD;
      tested to monitor for drug interactions. Lab assessments (CBC, CMP, urinalysis) will be&#xD;
      performed to monitor for changes in bone marrow, liver, and kidney function to ensure safe&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabidiol will be in the form of 100 mg/ml oral solution. Subjects will be given CBD to&#xD;
      take in addition to their current anti-epileptic drug (AED) regimen.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ages 1-60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient must have at least 4 clinically countable seizures per month. They must also&#xD;
             have prior concomitant video-EEG with evidence documenting a diagnosis of epilepsy.&#xD;
             Seizure history to include a documented history of generalized seizures (drop attacks,&#xD;
             atonic, tonic-clonic and/or myoclonic), focal seizures without loss of consciousness&#xD;
             with a motor component, focal seizures with loss of consciousness, or focal seizures&#xD;
             with secondary generalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Drug resistant epilepsy defined as a trial of at least four drugs, including one trial&#xD;
             of a combination of two concomitant drugs, without successful seizure control. Vagal&#xD;
             nerve stimulation, RNS deep brain stimulation, or the ketogenic diet can be considered&#xD;
             equivalent to a drug trial and documented evidence of drug and other therapeutic&#xD;
             failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Between 1-4 baseline anti-epileptic drugs at time of enrollment. Vagus nerve&#xD;
             stimulator (VNS), ketogenic diet and modified Atkins diet do not count toward this&#xD;
             limit and are not contraindicated for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject and family sign assent (if capable)/consent/research authorization and are&#xD;
             able to meet the study expectations for appointments for the duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. VNS, if in use must be on stable settings for a minimum of 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. If on ketogenic diet, must be on stable ratio for a minimum of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients or their caregivers must be able to consistently maintain a seizure diary for&#xD;
             at least 2 months prior to enrollment and during the course of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Must be Nebraska state resident.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Renal, hepatic, pancreatic, or hematologic dysfunction as evidenced by: values above&#xD;
             upper limits of normal for BUN/creatinine, or values twice the upper limit of normal&#xD;
             for serum transaminases (ALT/SGPT, AST/SGOT), values twice the upper limit of normal&#xD;
             for serum lipase and amylase, platelets &lt;80,000 /mcL, WBC&lt;3.0 103 /mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Less than 4 countable (non-countable seizures includes absence and myoclonic) seizures&#xD;
             per month&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Use of cannabis-related product within last 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active substance abuse/addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. CBD is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Female subjects who are&#xD;
             pregnant will be excluded from the study. If a female subject is able to become&#xD;
             pregnant, she will be given a urine pregnancy test before entry into the study. Female&#xD;
             subjects will be informed not to become pregnant while taking cannabidiol, and must&#xD;
             agree to an acceptable method of barrier contraception use during the study which&#xD;
             should include abstinence or a double barrier method for the duration of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Female subjects must tell the investigator and consult an obstetrician or&#xD;
             maternal-fetal specialist if they become pregnant during the study. If pregnancy&#xD;
             occurs, CBD will be stopped in the most clinically appropriate manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Allergy to CBD or any cannabinoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Unable to provide consent (and no LAR available)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Unable to comply with study visits/requirements.&#xD;
