  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anaesthesia (GA) is, according to many definitions, the greatest gift presented to&#xD;
      the medical art (S. B. Nuland). One of the aims of GA is to achieve the optimal depth of&#xD;
      anaesthesia and rapid emergence from general anaesthesia. In order to achieve this goal, it&#xD;
      is necessary to observe the clinical condition of the patient, and at the same time monitor&#xD;
      the patient's overall condition. With the currently available options of GA management (e.g.&#xD;
      use of intravenous anaesthetics, strong analgesics and modern volatile anaesthetics, in&#xD;
      combination with various methods of topical anaesthesia) the importance of methods measuring&#xD;
      the depth of GA increases. The depth of GA may be defined as a continuous progressive&#xD;
      decreasing of the central nervous system, together with a decreased reactivity to stimuli. In&#xD;
      the course of GA, perioperative awareness is detected in 0.1-0.2% of cases. Awakening during&#xD;
      a surgical procedure may result in significant psychological complications (e.g.&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder), and the patient may suffer from a serious long-time&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to prevent, or minimize the perioperative awareness, it is possible to utilize two&#xD;
      different methods of depth of anaesthesia monitoring. The options may be divided into two&#xD;
      basic groups: A/ The use of clinical monitoring and other methods (apart from CNS), and B/&#xD;
      Methods based on monitoring of the electrical activity of the brain. In the first group, it&#xD;
      is possible to list the following options: 1. clinical assessment (Evans's score), 2. skin&#xD;
      conductance, 3. isolated method of measurement at the forearm, 4. spontaneous superficial&#xD;
      electromyogram (SEMG), 5. lower oesophageal contractility, and 6. various hearth rate. The&#xD;
      possibilities of depth of GA monitoring using the scanning of electrical brain activity may&#xD;
      be further subdivided into two groups: a/ methods based on EEG, and b/ methods assessing&#xD;
      evoked potentials. In the group of methods based on EEG, the following devices may be used to&#xD;
      monitor the depth of GA in practice:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a/ BIS monitor, b/ E-Entropy, c/ Narcotrend, and d/ SedLine Sedation Monitor. In the second&#xD;
      group using evoked potentials it is possible to utilize monitors measuring electrical&#xD;
      activity in certain areas of the brain, in relation to stimulation of specific sensory nerve&#xD;
      pathways: a/ somatosensory, b/ visual, and c/ auditive evoked potentials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: The use of depth of general anaesthesia monitoring in children in the course&#xD;
      of a surgical procedure does not affect the number of post-operative complications related to&#xD;
      the depth of GA, does not shorten the period of emergence from GA, does not decrease the&#xD;
      amount of inhalation anaesthetics used, and does not decrease the amount of opioids used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim: To test, whether the administration of anaesthesia in children in the course of&#xD;
      a surgical procedure with the depth of general anaesthesia monitoring with the BIS monitor&#xD;
      results in a decrease in the number of complications related to inappropriate depth of GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim: To verify, whether the administration of anaesthesia in children in the course&#xD;
      of a surgical procedure with the depth of general anaesthesia monitoring with the BIS&#xD;
      monitor:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. results in a shortening of the emergence from general anaesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. results in a decrease in the amount of inhalation anaesthetic used&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. results in a decrease in the amount of analgesics used&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary aim: To verify, whether the administration of general anaesthesia in children in the&#xD;
      course of a surgical procedure with the depth of general anaesthesia monitoring with the BIS&#xD;
      monitor:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a/results in a decrease of early post-operative complications at the recovery room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure to achieve the study aims The study is a prospective, interventional study,&#xD;
      performed at the Anaesthesiology-Resuscitation Department of the University Hospital Ostrava.&#xD;
      The study has been approved by the Head of the Department, prof. Pavel Ševčík, MD, CSc.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital&#xD;
      Ostrava and is in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained for every paediatric patient, the Informed consent form has also&#xD;
      been approved by the Ethics Committee, and will be signed by both parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group will include paediatric patients at the age from 28 days to 15 years of age&#xD;
      (including), ASA I classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional arm of the study will be characterized by the BIS monitoring and management of&#xD;
      the hypnotic component of general anaesthesia towards the values of BIS 40-60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional arm of the study will be performed without the depth of anaesthesia monitoring&#xD;
      (however, the BIS value will be recorded by an independent participant), and management of&#xD;
      the hypnotic component of general anaesthesia according to MAC value appropriate for the age&#xD;
      of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study arm will include the total of 100 paediatric study subjects. Randomization will be&#xD;
      performed by the envelope method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of terms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BIS group: group of patients, in whom the hypnotic component of GA will be managed&#xD;
           towards the value of BIS 40-60.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-BIS group: group of patients, in whom the hypnotic component of GA will be managed&#xD;
           towards the MAC value appropriate for the age of the child. Depth of GA will be also&#xD;
           monitored with the BIS monitor, however, the BIS value will be unknown to the&#xD;
           investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Period of emergence from anaesthesia: time interval from the moment of setting the zero&#xD;
           concentration of inhalation anaesthetics on the vaporizer to the moment when the child&#xD;
           manifests the signs of complete awareness: spontaneous ventilation, spontaneous&#xD;
           motility, rising of the head, clasping of the hand, or crying.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consumption of inhalation anaesthetic: consumption of inhalation anaesthetic will be&#xD;
           measured in two follow-up time phases of GA:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Phase 1: from the moment when administration of the inhalation anaesthetic is&#xD;
                initiated to the moment when breathing passageways are secured (LM, OTI). This&#xD;
                phase of GA is characterized with a higher concentration of the inhalation&#xD;
                anaesthetic and standard flows: O2, AIR in proportion of 2:2 l/min,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Phase 2: continues after Phase 1, from the moment when breathing passageways are&#xD;
                secured to the moment, when the zero value is set on the vaporizer. This phase of&#xD;
                GA is characterized with gas flows: O2, AIR in proportion of 0.5:0.5 l/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consumption of analgesics: the amount of analgesics used during GA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early post-operative complications (assessed in the recovery room): the need of&#xD;
           re-intubation, need to apply antidotes, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, hyperalgesia (pain&#xD;
           assessment according to standard scales), vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergence from GA (Phase 3): continues after Phase 2, from the moment when the zero&#xD;
           value is set on the vaporizer to the moment of LM or intubation cannula removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.2. Protocol of GA management in the &quot;BIS group&quot;: BIS monitor will be used during the GA&#xD;
      monitoring, the BIS value will be known to the anaesthetist (investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GA induction (Phase 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. inhalation introduction (Sevorane, 02,AIR (flow 2:2 l/min)) or&#xD;
&#xD;

                iv.), or Mivacron (0.15-2mg/kg ),Tracrium (0.3-0.6mg/kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anaesthesia (Phase 2, Phase 3):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. hypnotic component: titration of Sevorane concentration, with the aim of achieving&#xD;
                the BIS values of 40-60%, bearing gas mixture: O2/AIR (in proportion of 1:1, with&#xD;
                0.5:0.5 flows)&#xD;
