  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open label placebo treatment has been tried for irritable bowel syndrome (Kaptchuk et al,&#xD;
      2010), where three weeks of open label placebo proved superior to a wait-listed control&#xD;
      group. Another pilot study demonstrated efficacy in treating children suffering from ADHD&#xD;
      with open label placebo treatment (Sandler &amp; Bodfish, 2007). Recent work has shown that&#xD;
      placebo openly given can have significant analgesic effects for acute migraines (Kam-Hansen&#xD;
      et al, 2014) and for experimentally-induced pain (Schafer at al, 2015). A preliminary attempt&#xD;
      to treat depression with open label placebo proved the feasibility of such a study, but was&#xD;
      too small and brief for conclusive results (Kelley et al, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We provide here the protocol for a study to assess the effect of open label placebo treatment&#xD;
      for depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      participants will be recruited through advertisements in the traditional and on-line press,&#xD;
      and via mental health care workers in local clinics. The psychiatrists in the study team will&#xD;
      also have the option to access to the waiting list of outpatient clinics at the Shalvata&#xD;
      Mental Health Center, and recruit patients (who's intake appointment in the outpatient clinic&#xD;
      is expected to take place in more than 2 months) to the study via phone or face to face in&#xD;
      the clinic. If a subject is already taking antidepressant treatment he can be recruited&#xD;
      immediately to the study. If a subject is not taking an antidepressant treatment, and in his&#xD;
      examination he is diagnosed with depression, the investigator will advice him to approach an&#xD;
      outpatient clinic and start taking antidepressant medication. If the subjects refuses to use&#xD;
      medications he will be recruited to the study medication-free.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be invited to participate in the study and the following wording will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;we invite you to participate in a novel mind-body study harnessing placebo effects for the&#xD;
      treatment of depression. In the study you will recieve, either immediately or following a&#xD;
      waiting period, placebo (inert) tablets. There will be no active component in the tablet, but&#xD;
      there is a good chance that it will alleviate some of the depressive symptoms. Furthermore,&#xD;
      recent scientific evidence suggests that placebo tablets can initiate healthy responses even&#xD;
      if a person knows they are placebos&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will provide signed informed consent. Each subject will receive a letter to&#xD;
      his personal physician or psychiatrist in the community/hospital. Additionally, the study&#xD;
      team will also contact the personal physician and inform him of the study. Subjects will&#xD;
      continue their psychiatric follow-up and treatment as usual during the whole period of the&#xD;
      study. If the study team recognized a suicidal deterioration the personal&#xD;
      physician/psychiatrist will be notified immediately via phone. If a subject is currently&#xD;
      without psychiatric follow-up, he will examined during the assessment points (every 2 weeks)&#xD;
      of the study protocol by one of the physicians of the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the first session, each participant will be randomized to one of two possible&#xD;
      interventions: either 8 weeks of open label placebo, or 4 weeks of waitlist followed by four&#xD;
      weeks of open label placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization procedure will be stratified to account for two groups of subjects: those&#xD;
      currently on a stable dose of medication, and those currently receiving no medication.&#xD;
      Therefore, each time a subject from one of these groups is randomized to one of the two&#xD;
      interventions (open label placebo or wait list), the next subject from the same group will be&#xD;
      assigned to the other intervention. By this method, we will obtain the same proportion of&#xD;
      medicated and unmedicated patients in each of the two intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first session, the participant positive expectation and commitment will be promoted by&#xD;
      discussing with the participant the following four points: (a) in research, placebos have&#xD;
      been found to be safe in terms of side-effects and roughly 80% as effective as&#xD;
      antidepressants; (b) recent research suggests that a patient can benefit from a placebo even&#xD;
      when he knows that he is taking a placebo; (c) placebos appear to promote automatic&#xD;
      self-healing processes, possibly through classical conditioning ; just taking tablets can&#xD;
      cause the release of neurotransmitters and activate specific regions of the brain related to&#xD;
      depression] (d) placebo-treated patients who adhere to the tablet regimen have better&#xD;
      outcomes, and therefore the placebos should be taken faithfully, and (e) positive&#xD;
      expectations enhance placebo effects, but it is perfectly normal to have doubts or disbelief&#xD;
      and won't interfere with the effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the first session, the researcher will open an envelope which will reveal to&#xD;
      researcher and participant to which group the latter has been randomized. Both treatment arm&#xD;
      and no-treatment control will have identical patient-provider interactions and be of equal&#xD;
      length. Those in the waitlist group will be encouraged to continue in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo will be a colored tablet. Each participant will be enjoined to take two capsules&#xD;
      in the morning, and two in the evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After four weeks, the placebo group will continue with a second four week period of placebo&#xD;
      treatment, and the waitlist group will start to receive 4 weeks of placebo treatment.&#xD;
