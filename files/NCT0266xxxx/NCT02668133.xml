  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Community based-intervention trials conducted among infants and young children in&#xD;
      low- and middle-income countries have found that zinc supplementation of young children (in&#xD;
      the form of liquid supplements or dispersible tablets) increases linear growth and weight&#xD;
      gain, and reduces the prevalence of diarrhea and respiratory infections, and lowers all-cause&#xD;
      mortality. Aside from supplements, additional dietary zinc can also be provided through&#xD;
      &quot;home-fortification&quot; of complementary foods with small-quantity lipid-based nutrient&#xD;
      supplements (SQ-LNS; 20g/d), which are typically formulated as a peanut-based paste enriched&#xD;
      with a vitamin and mineral complex containing 8 mg elemental zinc (as ZnSO4). However, the&#xD;
      efficacy of LNS as a delivery vehicle for preventive zinc supplementation remains uncertain.&#xD;
      Two recent studies, which provided LNS containing 4-10 mg Zn daily for 6-9 months found no&#xD;
      significant differences in plasma zinc concentrations at the end of the intervention period&#xD;
      compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This lack of response may be due to the reduced absorption of zinc when it is part of a&#xD;
      complex food matrix and provided with cereal-based meals; both SQ-LNS and cereal grains&#xD;
      contain moderate to high concentrations of phytate, the main dietary factor known to&#xD;
      substantially reduce zinc absorption. The addition of exogenous phytases is an efficacious&#xD;
      strategy to reduce the phytate content of foods, and increase the bioavailability of dietary&#xD;
      zinc; however, the efficacy of this approach has not yet been demonstrated for SQ-LNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The overall objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of adding exogenous&#xD;
      phytase to SQ-LNS by investigating intra-individual differences in the fractional absorption&#xD;
      of zinc (FAZ) among children who receive additional dietary zinc (8 mg/d) from SQ-LNS with or&#xD;
      without phytase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial approach: The study will be a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial,&#xD;
      designed to permit within-child comparisons of zinc absorption from SQ-LNS, with or without&#xD;
      exogenous phytase, by using the triple stable-isotope ratio tracer technique. The clinical&#xD;
      study will enroll 34 children between the ages of 18-23 months. The main outcome of interest&#xD;
      is the intra-individual difference in the FAZ from porridge-based meals containing SQ-LNS&#xD;
      with and without phytase. Up to an' additional 36 children will be enrolled in a pilot&#xD;
      feeding study to determine portion sizes of study meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial setting: Keneba, The Gambia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SQ-LNS (20g) used in this study will be provided by Nutriset, S.A.S. The exogenous&#xD;
      phytase (DSM phytase Tolerase 20000G) is derived from Aspergillus niger; phytase will be&#xD;
      added to the SQ-LNS during the production phase, and will be enzymatically active in vivo at&#xD;
      the time of consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feeding Protocol and Study Diet: The study diet for the 2day absorption study will consist of&#xD;
      the following: 1) Two stable-isotope labeled test meals per day (porridge made from locally&#xD;
      procured non-fermented cereal, mixed with 10 g of SQ-LNS), with children randomized to&#xD;
      receive either SQ-LNS with phytase or SQ-LNS without phytase on the first day and the&#xD;
      alternative product on the second; 2) One additional standardized meal per day (e.g. rice&#xD;
      with sauce); 3) Low-zinc, low-phytate food (e.g. bananas) consumed ad libitum if requested&#xD;
      (with the exception of 1 hour before and 2 hours after each test meal). Children will be fed&#xD;
      by their caregivers under supervision by a study fieldworker. The SQ-LNS product (without&#xD;
      phytase) will be provided to children twice per day for one day prior to the start of the&#xD;
      stable isotope absorption studies, in order to habituate children to the study diet and&#xD;
      location. Children will attend the study clinic daily for four days and will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study for a total of ten days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc absorption studies: The FAZ of zinc will be measured by a triple-isotope tracer ratio&#xD;
      technique, using orally administered extrinsic labels (Zn-67 and Zn-70) and intravenous&#xD;
      Zn-68. Urine samples, collected pre- and post-isotope administration (d 1, 5-9) will be&#xD;
      analyzed for zinc isotope ratios by ICP-MS. FAZ will be calculated based on the mean isotopic&#xD;
      ratios obtained from the enriched urine samples, and based on the tracer:tracee ratio method.&#xD;
      TAZ will be calculated by multiplying FAZ by total zinc intake from the test meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: The following information will be collected from each subject: brief medical&#xD;
      history; physical examination; weight and height; daily morbidity and pre-intervention blood&#xD;
      sampling for hemoglobin, complete blood count and plasma zinc concentration, malaria and&#xD;
      systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein and α-1-acid glycoprotein).&#xD;
