      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety for each cohort of patients on a fixed-dose combination pill of&#xD;
           capecitabine and cyclophosphamide administered at flat dose and with metronomic schedule&#xD;
           (defined as continuous daily treatment without interruption) in patients with metastatic&#xD;
           breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics (PKs) and bioavailability of the fixed-dose combination&#xD;
           pill of capecitabine and cyclophosphamide administered at different doses/regimens by&#xD;
           metronomic schedule in patients with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess antitumor activity of the fixed-dose combination pill of capecitabine and&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide administered at different doses/regimens by metronomic schedule in&#xD;
           patients with metastatic breast cancer given at 3 different doses and schedules (regimen&#xD;
           1=standard dose twice daily [BID], regimen 2=full dose once daily [OD], regimen 3=low&#xD;
           dose [OD])&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease Control Rate (DCR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall Response Rate (ORR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to Progression (TTP) using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
           (RECIST) criteria (version 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the compliance under treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe evolution of toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess safety all along patient's treatment.&#xD;

      Primary objective will be evaluated at 12 weeks. Patients who show evidence of efficacy will&#xD;
      be treated and followed-up until progression of the disease.&#xD;
