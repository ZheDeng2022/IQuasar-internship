      The purpose of this study is to provide confirmatory evidence of the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      two Dysport® doses (600 units [U] and 800 U), compared to placebo in reducing urinary&#xD;
      incontinence (UI) in adult subjects treated for neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) due to&#xD;
      spinal cord injury (SCI) or multiple sclerosis (MS).&#xD;

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Weekly Number of UI Episodes at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly number of UI episodes was measured using a 7-day bladder diary. Bladder diaries that contained data recorded on at least 5 days were included in the analysis. The least square (LS) mean of the change in weekly number of UI episodes at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With No Episodes of UI at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly number of UI episodes was measured using a 7-day bladder diary. Bladder diaries that contained data recorded on at least 5 days were included in the analysis. The number of subjects with no UI episodes at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was recorded. Percentage of subjects with no episodes of UI (≥100% Improvement) was calculated as: Total number of subjects with no weekly number of UI episodes at Week 6 / Total number of subjects with any number of UI events at Week 6.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With a UI Response at Improvement Levels ≥30%, ≥50%, and ≥75% at Week 6 of the DBPC Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly number of UI episodes was measured using a 7-day bladder diary. Bladder diaries that contained data recorded on at least 5 days were included in the analysis. The percentage of subjects showing an improvement of ≥30%, ≥50% and ≥75% was calculated as: Total number of subjects with UI response level &gt;=30% or &gt;=50% or &gt;=75% improvement at Week 6 / Total number of subjects with any UI response at Week 6.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Time Between Treatments</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of first treatment (baseline) to day of retreatment, up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of effect for time between treatments was calculated by: (the date of the first retreatment visit - date of first treatment administration in the DBPC cycle). The median number of days between treatments was determined and subjects with no retreatment were censored at the last visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Volume Per Void at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>The volume per void was measured during one 24-hour period of the 7-day bladder diary. The LS mean of the change in volume per void at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using a MMRM analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Maximum Cystometric Capacity (MCC) at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects included in the urodynamic subset (84.9% of randomised subjects) had a standardised urodynamic filling cystometry assessment at baseline (Screening) and again at Week 6 to determine the MCC. The LS mean of the change in MCC at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Maximum Detrusor Pressure (MDP) During Storage at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects included in the urodynamic subset (84.9% of randomised subjects) had a standardised urodynamic filling cystometry assessment at baseline (Screening) and again at Week 6 to determine the MDP. The LS mean of the change in MDP at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using an ANCOVA.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Volume at First Involuntary Detrusor Contraction (Vol@1stIDC) at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects included in the urodynamic subset (84.9% of randomised subjects) had a standardised urodynamic filling cystometry assessment at baseline (Screening) and again at Week 6 to determine the Vol@1stIDC which is the instilled volume when first IDC commences. Subjects who did not exhibit a post-treatment IDC at Week 6 had Vol@1stIDC imputed using the recorded corrected MCC volume at Week 6. The LS mean of the change in Vol@1stIDC at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using an ANCOVA.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With No Involuntary Detrusor Contraction (IDCs) During Storage at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects included in the urodynamic subset (84.9% of randomised subjects) had a standardised urodynamic filling cystometry assessment at baseline (Screening) and again at Week 6 to determine the occurrence of IDCs. The percentage of subjects without IDCs at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was recorded.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 258 subjects with urinary incontinence (UI) caused by neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) due to spinal cord injury (SCI) or multiple sclerosis (MS) were enrolled at 67 study sites worldwide. One of the 258 randomised subjects did not receive any treatment. The study was terminated early by the sponsor due to lack of recruitment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects were randomised to 1 of 4 sequences: A) placebo in a double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) cycle then Dysport® 600 Units (U) in subsequent double-blind cycles: B) placebo in DBPC cycle then Dysport® 800 U in subsequent cycles: C) Dysport® 600 U in all cycles: D) Dysport® 800 U in all cycles. The minimum retreatment interval was 12 weeks.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Subjects were administered placebo on Day 1 of the DBPC cycle. All study treatments were injected into the detrusor muscle via cystoscopy in a total volume of 15 millilitres (mL) divided into 30 injection points of 0.5 mL each. Subjects were followed-up by telephone at Week 1 and Week 4; and attended clinic visits at Week 2, Week 6 (primary study timepoint), and Week 12. Thereafter telephone visits were scheduled every 12 weeks until end of study, or until retreatment was required.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Weekly Number of UI Episodes at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</title>
        <description>The weekly number of UI episodes was measured using a 7-day bladder diary. Bladder diaries that contained data recorded on at least 5 days were included in the analysis.

        <title>Percentage of Subjects With No Involuntary Detrusor Contraction (IDCs) During Storage at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</title>
        <description>Subjects included in the urodynamic subset (84.9% of randomised subjects) had a standardised urodynamic filling cystometry assessment at baseline (Screening) and again at Week 6 to determine the occurrence of IDCs. The percentage of subjects without IDCs at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was recorded.</description>
