  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A reliably effective treatment model for anorexia nervosa is yet to emerge. Recent clinical&#xD;
      trials of psychological therapies over 20-30 sessions, have shown modest benefits. There is&#xD;
      therefore a need to test new treatments to find more effective treatments. Clinical trials of&#xD;
      Schema Therapy have shown low rates of dropout, which is often a problem in the treatment of&#xD;
      anorexia nervosa. Treatment with Schema Therapy, for significantly longer than 20-30&#xD;
      sessions, has been shown to be effective for other complex mental health problems.This pilot&#xD;
      study is therefore designed to pilot the use of individual Schema Therapy for people with&#xD;
      Anorexia Nervosa (iST-AN). This study is a case series pilot study. The study will answer the&#xD;
      principal research question: Does individual Schema mode Therapy, adapted for eating&#xD;
      disorders, have the potential to improve symptoms, quality of life and weight in people with&#xD;
      moderate-severe anorexia nervosa? It will also address secondary research questions: Can&#xD;
      people with moderate-severe anorexia nervosa be recruited to, and kept engaged in, a study of&#xD;
      iST-AN treatment? What is the ideal length of iST-AN treatment? What is the relationship&#xD;
      between self-criticism, body shame, or unhelpful psychological 'modes' and clinical outcome?&#xD;
      Fifteen people with moderate-severe Anorexia Nervosa will be recruited from referrals to a&#xD;
      specialist eating disorders outpatient service. The study will deliver 65 sessions of Schema&#xD;
      Therapy for anorexia nervosa (iST-AN), over a 24 month period, alongside any additional&#xD;
      medical or dietetic management required. Standard outcome measures will be collected at 6&#xD;
      month intervals. The research team have expertise in eating disorders research, schema&#xD;
      therapy for severe anorexia nervosa and are all members of the local clinical service. The&#xD;
      study will take place over a 3 year period.&#xD;

      Aims &amp; Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this pilot case series of individual Schema-mode Therapy for Anorexia Nervosa&#xD;
      (iST-AN) are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the potential efficacy of iST-AN treatment, including&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. exploring optimal length of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. refining the iST-AN treatment manual&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test recruitment and retention in iST-AN treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore hypotheses relating to self-criticism, body shame &amp; change in strength of&#xD;
           modes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that treatment with iST-AN will result in adequate recruitment and a high level&#xD;
      of retention in treatment. We hypothesise that treatment with iST-AN will result in&#xD;
      significant change in eating disorder symptoms, quality of life (QoL) and body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI). We hypothesise that improved symptoms, QoL and BMI will correlate with reduced&#xD;
      self-criticism, reduced body shame and reduced strength of maladaptive coping modes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Population &amp; Recruitment Our intention is to recruit a broadly representative&#xD;
      population of adults with moderate-severe, treatment resistant or co-morbid Anorexia Nervosa&#xD;
      (AN). Outpatients will be recruited from The Cullen Centre, Edinburgh, Scotland. Recruitment&#xD;
      will occur from routine referrals and we anticipate recruiting 10-15 cases over a 12 month&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 - Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient referred to the service who may fulfil the inclusion criteria, is eligible for&#xD;
      screening, including those on waiting lists at the start of the recruitment period. Every&#xD;
      patient identified for screening will be allocated a unique identification number prior to&#xD;
      screening, by the data manager. Screening will be carried out by the study therapist by&#xD;
      telephone or face-to-face, to supplement the referral information. This will be guided by the&#xD;
      study screening questionnaire. Self-report BMI, age, and history of previous schema therapy&#xD;
      treatment, will be established using the screening questionnaire. If screen positive, the&#xD;
      potential participant is offered an eligibility assessment appointment during the screening&#xD;
      call, and sent a patient information sheet about the study and schema therapy, along with a&#xD;
      letter confirming the assessment appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 - Eligibility and clinical assessment appointment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligibility assessment will be combined with a standard clinical assessment, carried out&#xD;
      by the study therapist and colleagues, according to local protocols. The study therapist will&#xD;
      complete the eligibility questionnaire and assessments. The Eating Disorders Examination&#xD;
      (edition 17.0D), the 5 diagnostic items, will be used to make valid DSM-V underweight eating&#xD;
      disorder diagnoses. The MINI structured diagnostic interview and the self-report Personality&#xD;
      Belief Questionnaire (PBQ) will be used to define co-morbidity for psychotic disorders,&#xD;
      alcohol or drug dependence or misuse, personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder,&#xD;
      other anxiety disorders and depressive disorders. A standard clinical assessment will screen&#xD;
      for possible learning disability or Autistic Spectrum Disorder. The potential participant is&#xD;
      given an opportunity at this appointment to ask any questions about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this appointment the eligibility information is reviewed. Participants are&#xD;
      contacted by phone within one week to offer entry to the study or advice regarding the local&#xD;
      treatment service if they are ineligible for the study or choose to not participate. This&#xD;
      will be confirmed by letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3 - Informed consent &amp; baseline assessments appointment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any further questions will be addressed at this appointment prior to obtaining informed&#xD;
      consent. Demographic and treatment history information will be gathered by the study&#xD;
      therapist using a bespoke study questionnaire. This includes assessment of: duration of&#xD;
      eating disorder; previous therapy for eating disorder; lowest ever BMI; relationship status;&#xD;
      employment status; and current medication. The participant will also be given time at this&#xD;
      appointment to complete the battery of baseline outcome questionnaires, with the therapist&#xD;
      available for clarification if required. The option of completing the questionnaires at home&#xD;
      will be available if preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Patients will be treated using a manualised but flexible treatment protocol.&#xD;
      Engaging people with anorexia nervosa in treatment is notoriously difficult. The value people&#xD;
      with anorexia nervosa attach to their disorder, combined with difficulties trusting others&#xD;
      and over-controlling behaviour, means that a flexible individualised treatment approach is&#xD;
      likely to enhance engagement. A 60 session protocol will be used over an 18 month period,&#xD;
      moving flexibly through five phases of treatment, guided by the psychological formulation:&#xD;
      phase 1 - assessment, engagement &amp; stabilisation; phase 2 - developing trust &amp; understanding;&#xD;
      phase 3 - developing awareness &amp; acceptance; phase 4 - testing change &amp; strengthening the&#xD;
      healthy mode; phase 5 - consolidating change. A follow-up period of 6 months, with 5 further&#xD;
      monthly sessions, will promote self-efficacy and further consolidate change. A total&#xD;
      treatment package of 65 sessions will be offered, over 24 months. Some therapy sessions will&#xD;
      be audio recorded for quality assurance and supervision purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and psychiatric risk management will continue as per local service protocols. Should&#xD;
      inpatient care be required, patients will be retained in the trial if an admission is limited&#xD;
      to less than 8 weeks, with admissions recorded for reporting in results. Patients who lose&#xD;
      capacity to consent to participation in the trial, who are admitted for longer than 8 weeks&#xD;
      or require use of the mental health act, will be withdrawn from the trial and further&#xD;
      treatment will be determined by local protocols. Treatment with medication and dietetic&#xD;
      treatment will continue as per local service protocols and recorded for reporting in results.&#xD;
      These measures will ensure any significant additional treatment beyond iST-AN is reported&#xD;
      clearly within our results and that no patient is denied any locally available adjunctive&#xD;
      treatment alongside the psychological therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Analysis An assistant psychologist from Edinburgh eating disorder&#xD;
      services will be the data manager, with the support of the Scottish Mental Health Research&#xD;
      Network (SMHRN). A unique identification number will be allocated sequentially to each&#xD;
      patient entering the screening process. All outcome measures will be collected at baseline,&#xD;
      6, 12, 18 and 24 months, with the exception of the SMI, to be collected at baseline and 24&#xD;
      months only, due to the length of this questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire packs will be provided electronically by the data manager, alongside a system&#xD;
      of reminders sent two weeks prior to the set data point. Participants will be encouraged to&#xD;
      complete questionnaires on paper at the clinic, but will have the option to complete these at&#xD;
      home or online at www.surveymonkey.com. The Treating clinicians will ensure completion of&#xD;
      outcome measures and passing this information to the data manager. The anonymised data with a&#xD;
      unique identification number, will be managed and stored on the password-secured IT systems&#xD;
      of the University of Edinburgh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will be conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 21&#xD;
      (SPSS v21). We will describe the numbers of patients screened, recruited and retained in&#xD;
      treatment. Using the intention to treat principle, repeated measure linear mixed-model&#xD;
      analyses (LMM) will be used to assess efficacy on each of our measures of outcome: symptoms,&#xD;
      weight gain and quality of life. The pattern of change will be examined to explore whether a&#xD;
      65 session treatment package appears too long or too short. We will also explore our&#xD;
      hypotheses that reduced self-criticism, reduced body shame and reduced strength of&#xD;
      maladaptive coping modes will be correlated with positive outcomes, using multivariate&#xD;
      analysis of variance (MANOVA).&#xD;
