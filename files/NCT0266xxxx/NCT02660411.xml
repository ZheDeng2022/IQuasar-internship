      Surgery is one of the major treatment methods for patients with malignant tumor. And, alone&#xD;
      with the ageing process, more and more elderly patients undergo surgery for malignant tumor.&#xD;
      Evidence emerges that choice of anesthetics, i.e., either inhalational or intravenous&#xD;
      anesthetics, may influence the outcome of elderly patients undergoing cancer surgery. From&#xD;
      the point of view of immune function after surgery and invasiveness of malignant tumor cells,&#xD;
      propofol intravenous anesthesia may be superior to inhalational anesthesia. However, the&#xD;
      clinical significance of these effects remains unclear. Retrospective studies indicated that&#xD;
      use of propofol intravenous anesthesia was associated higher long-term survival rate.&#xD;
      Prospective studies exploring the effect of anesthetic choice on long-term survival in cancer&#xD;
      surgery patients are urgently needed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 234.2 million major surgical procedures are undertaken every year&#xD;
      worldwide. Surgery is one of the major treatment methods for patients with malignant tumor.&#xD;
      And, alone with the ageing process, more and more elderly patients undergo surgery for&#xD;
      malignant tumor. However, evidence emerges that choice of anesthetics, i.e., either&#xD;
      inhalational or intravenous anesthetics, may influence the outcome of elderly patients&#xD;
      undergoing cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Effects of anesthetics on immune function after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of general anesthetics might influence human's immune function after surgery. An&#xD;
      international multicenter team (NCT00418457) investigated the effects of&#xD;
      propofol-paravertebral anesthesia vs sevoflurane-opioid anesthesia on the immune function in&#xD;
      patients after breast cancer surgery. In a small sample size (n = 32) randomized controlled&#xD;
      trail published in 2010, postoperative serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1&#xD;
      (protumorigenic cytokine) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-3/9 (associated with cancer&#xD;
      cell invasion and metastasis) were significantly lower (P = 0.003 and 0.011, respectively),&#xD;
      whereas that of IL-10 (antitumorigenic cytokines) was significantly higher in the propofol&#xD;
      group than in the sevoflurane group (P = 0.001). In another small sample size (n = 10)&#xD;
      randomized controlled trail published in 2014, serum obtained from patients who received&#xD;
      propofol anesthesia led to greater human donor natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity in vitro&#xD;
      when compared with serum from those who received sevoflurane anesthesia. In a recent small&#xD;
      sample size (n = 28) randomized controlled trial, the levels of NK and T helper cell&#xD;
      infiltration in breast cancer tissue were significantly higher in patients receiving propofol&#xD;
      anesthesia than those receiving sevoflurane anesthesia (P = 0.015 and 0.03, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar findings were reported in patients with other malignant tumors. In a small randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, 30 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer randomly received either&#xD;
      propofol or isoflurane anesthesia. The results showed that cluster of differentiation&#xD;
      (CD)4+CD28+ percentage (P &lt; 0.0001) and the ratio of interferon-gamma:interleukin-4 (P =&#xD;
      0.001) all increased significantly with propofol but no change with isoflurane anesthesia;&#xD;
      indicating that propofol promotes activation and differentiation of peripheral T-helper&#xD;
      cells. In another randomized controlled trial, 60 patients undergoing surgery for tongue&#xD;
      cancer surgery randomly received total propofol, mixed (propofol induction and sevoflurane&#xD;
      maintenance) anesthesia or total sevoflurane anesthesia. The results showed that the&#xD;
      percentages of CD3+, CD3+CD4+, and NK cells and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ were significantly&#xD;
      decreased in the two sevoflurane groups, but not in the total propofol group; suggesting that&#xD;
      propofol has less effects on cellular immune response than sevoflurane. There are also&#xD;
      studies that reported neutral results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above studies suggest that, when compared with inhalational anesthesia, propofol&#xD;
      intravenous anesthesia may have favorable effects on the immune function in patients after&#xD;
      cancer surgery. However, care must be taken when explaining these results: (1) the sample&#xD;
      sizes of the available studies were small; (2) the relationship between postoperative immune&#xD;
      function changes and long-term outcomes remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Effects of anesthetics on invasiveness of malignant tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of anesthetics on invasiveness of tumor cells were mainly tested in the&#xD;
      experimental studies, i.e., tumor cells were incubated with anesthetics in the in vitro&#xD;
      environment. In this aspect, propofol shows somewhat favorable effects. The results of Miao&#xD;
      et al. showed that propofol stimulation decreased the expression of MMP-2 and -9 and&#xD;
      subsequently decreased the invasive activity of human colon cancer cells, possibly via&#xD;
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) down-regulation mediated through the&#xD;
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptor. The study of Wang et al. reported that propofol&#xD;
      inhibited invasion and metastasis, and enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of ovarian&#xD;
      cancer cells, possibly by suppressing the Slug expression. Ecimovic et al. also reported that&#xD;
      propofol reduced migration in both estrogen receptor-positive and -negative breast cancer&#xD;
      cells, possibly by suppressing the Neuroepithelial Cell Transforming Gene 1 (NET1)&#xD;
      expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reported effects of various inhalational anesthetics are conflicting. Huang et al.&#xD;
      compared the effects of propofol and isoflurane on prostate cancer cells. The results showed&#xD;
      that propofol, at clinical relevant concentration, inhibited the activation of&#xD;
      hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha, and partially reduced cancer cell malignant&#xD;
      activities; whereas isoflurane raised HIF-1 alpha expression, and increased the probability&#xD;
      of proliferation and migration. The study of Benaonana et al. reported similar results, i.e.,&#xD;
      isoflurane up-regulated the expression of HIFs, and increased the growth and malignant&#xD;
      potential of renal cancer cells. On the other hand, sevoflurane and desflurane show opposite&#xD;
      effects. Multiple studies found that sevoflurane inhibited the proliferation and migration,&#xD;
      and induced apoptosis of lung cancer cells. Müller-Edenborn et al. also reported that&#xD;
      volatile anesthetics (sevoflurane and desflurane) reduced invasion of colorectal cancer cells&#xD;
      through down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, the clinical significance of anesthetics on the invasiveness of malignant tumors is&#xD;
      still lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Effect of anesthetics on long-term outcome after cancer surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in this aspect are very limited. In the study of Enlund et al., 2838 patients who&#xD;
      underwent breast cancer or colorectal cancer surgery were retrospectively analyzed, among&#xD;
      them 1935 received sevoflurane anesthesia and 903 propofol anesthesia. The 1-year and 5-year&#xD;
      survival rates were higher in propofol-anesthetized patients than in sevoflurane-anesthetized&#xD;
      ones (differences in overall survival rate were 4.7%, P = 0.004 and 5.6%, P &lt; 0.001,&#xD;
      respectively). However, the differences were not statistically significant after adjusting&#xD;
      for confounding factors. In a recent study, Wigmore et al. retrospectively investigated&#xD;
      11,395 patients after cancer surgery. After exclusions and propensity matching, 2,607&#xD;
      patients remained in each of the inhalational anesthesia group or total intravenous&#xD;
      anesthesia group. The results showed that, after a median follow-up duration of 2.66 years&#xD;
      (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.62-2.69), volatile inhalational anesthesia was associated&#xD;
      with a higher risk for death after both univariate (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.30-1.95) and&#xD;
      multivariable analysis (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.29-1.66).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in this aspect, long-term follow-up results of randomized controlled trials are&#xD;
      still lacking. Prospective studies exploring the effect of anesthetic choice on long-term&#xD;
      survival in cancer surgery patients are urgently needed.&#xD;
