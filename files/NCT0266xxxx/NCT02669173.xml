  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves participants with recurrent glioblastoma brain tumors (GBM). This means&#xD;
      that a participant's brain tumor has either returned after being treated by a previous&#xD;
      therapy, or has continued to progress despite being treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to provide proof of concept that suppression of MDSCs&#xD;
      (myeloid-derived suppressor cells) is feasible in patients with GBM. Rather than targeting&#xD;
      tumor cells or immune checkpoints, which has been the focus of recent therapeutic efforts,&#xD;
      direct targeting of MDSCs with low dose capecitabine has the potential to reverse the&#xD;
      immunosuppressed microenvironment of GBM and thereby reduce tumors&#xD;

      Primary Objective: To achieve a 20-fold MDSC reduction in the concentration of circulating&#xD;
      MDSCs after treatment with low dose capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the concentration of circulating MDSCs in patients with recurrent&#xD;
           glioblastoma after treatment with low dose capecitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the concentration of tissue MDSCs and T-regulatory cells in resected&#xD;
           glioblastoma after treatment with low dose capecitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the safety and toxicity of continuous low dose capecitabine with and&#xD;
           without standard dose bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain a signal for efficacy as measured by progression-free survival rate at 6 months&#xD;
