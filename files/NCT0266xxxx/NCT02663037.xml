      Background: The delivery of targeted, patient-centered care for a population with&#xD;
      heterogeneous healthcare needs while moderating costs is a key challenge in healthcare.&#xD;
      Segmentation of patient populations based on clinically distinguishing features and social&#xD;
      healthcare needs is currently a promising method for informing the organization of healthcare&#xD;
      supply to these needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: In this prospective cohort study, the investigators aim to assess the Simple Segmenting&#xD;
      Tool (SST) as a method of patient population segmentation in terms of its inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability, as well as convergent and predictive validity. We will also revise the tool&#xD;
      based on feedback from the validity studies should the need arises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that the SST is able to exhibit good inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability, convergent validity and predictive validity for adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Non-critical patients aged 55 and above presenting to the Emergency Department&#xD;
      will be screened with the SST. Raters will be paired in order to assess inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability. To test convergent validity, the LACE, SF-12, and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS)&#xD;
      will also be used. Finally, predictive validity will be assessed by evaluating adverse event&#xD;
      rates of patients in each SST category. Adverse events include all-cause mortality, length of&#xD;
      hospital stay, emergency department visit and unplanned hospital readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance to Health Services Delivery: This study will provide evidence supporting the use&#xD;
      of a standardized tool for evaluating the medical and social needs of patients at various&#xD;
      sites of care. Following which, tailored packages of healthcare services can then be&#xD;
      delivered in order to meet these needs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: In the context of a young population, Singapore has established a superb system&#xD;
      of care, focusing largely on acute hospitals and specialty services. This has addressed the&#xD;
      needs of a dominantly young population, which are usually acute and self-limited, associated&#xD;
      with asymptomatic risks, and occasionally relate to single disabling or life-limiting&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a population ages, the needs for health and related social services change as more and&#xD;
      more individuals shift into more complex stages, with multiple conditions, loss of&#xD;
      resilience, and late decline; addressing the needs associated with these stages is less&#xD;
      amenable to an acute care, disease-centric approach. The needs of an older population are in&#xD;
      some ways similar to those of a younger population (though generally of a greater likelihood&#xD;
      and degree); however, the elderly require different strategies for supporting them through&#xD;
      the later stages of their lives. For example:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For chronic asymptomatic risk factors, the elderly may be more or less benefited by&#xD;
           screening, definitive testing, and treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elders may be less likely to have their risk factors identified and successfully&#xD;
           managed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elders may have unidentified symptomatic, treatable conditions (e.g., cataract);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social issues, such as family support and social networks may have a dominant effect on&#xD;
           the introduction, use and success of medical interventions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elders experience a loss of resilience which may occur without anyone being aware, and&#xD;
           through self-reinforcement can lead to frank frailty (e.g., both as a phenotype and as a&#xD;
           physiological state of loss of reserve in multiple systems);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Though end of life issues are not unique to elders, supporting older people through the&#xD;
           late stages of life-limiting conditions presents distinctive features, which can require&#xD;
           a different set of services;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The high and increasing use of acute services by elderly; both in volume and in&#xD;
           proportion to their numbers) may point to opportunities to care for elders at complex&#xD;
           stages of health more effectively, humanely, and sustainably.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to validate the Simple Segmentation Tool (SST) as a method&#xD;
      of patient population segmentation in terms of inter-rater reliability, as well as convergent&#xD;
      validity and predictive validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the SST&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To address the expanding needs of the elderly, it is important to take a person-centric&#xD;
           approach , tailoring services to the individual. From a health system perspective, this&#xD;
           presents a challenge for at least two reasons. First, health system services have&#xD;
           focused on sites of care and thus one may miss opportunities to alleviate progression to&#xD;
           complex stages, with high morbidity and cost. Second, implementing excessively tailored&#xD;
           programs can be extremely expensive from a health system perspective, especially when&#xD;
           they are hospital-based.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To address the above challenges, the investigators propose a population segmentation&#xD;
           approach. This entails assigning categories of health and associated social features&#xD;
           that characterize &quot;packages&quot; of interventions that aim to alleviate progression to more&#xD;
           symptomatic/higher risk categories, and improve quality of life. This approach has been&#xD;
           advocated internationally (Hewner &amp; Seo, 2014; Van Der Laan, Van Offenbeek, Broekhuis, &amp;&#xD;
           J., 2014; Zhou, Wong, &amp; Li, 2014), following foundational work by Lynne et al (Lynn,&#xD;
           Straube, Bell, Jencks, &amp; Kambic, 2007). Population segmentation recognizes that while&#xD;
           there is wide diversity among people and individualized approaches to care,&#xD;
           understanding prototypical needs can be a powerful tool for purposes of planning and&#xD;
           evaluation of health and social services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Simple Segmentation Tool was designed to facilitate the segmentation of an ageing&#xD;
           Singapore population so as to facilitate the provision of cost-effective person-centric&#xD;
           care. Specifically, the tool facilitates the capture of meso-level medical needs and&#xD;
           complicating factors of a patient before classifying said patient into one of 7 medical&#xD;
           categories and one of 3 care complexity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A healthcare need in the context of the SST is defined as a potential to benefit from&#xD;
           healthcare whereupon benefit can be understood as a reduction in the probability of a&#xD;
           patient transitioning into a worse clinical state or experiencing an adverse clinical&#xD;
           outcome. Meanwhile, the type of needs that the SST captures are normative needs which&#xD;
           are needs of a patient as assessed by a clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The 7 medical global impressions of patient of the SST were adapted from the original 8&#xD;
           based on the &quot;Bridges to Health&quot; model by Joanne Lynn et al (Lynn et al., 2007) in order&#xD;
           to better suit our evaluation of an elderly population. Patients are classified into one&#xD;
           of the 7 health categories namely 1) Healthy, 2) Acutely ill but curable, 3) Chronic&#xD;
           conditions, asymptomatic, 4) Chronic conditions, stable, 5) Long course of decline, 6)&#xD;
           Limited reserve and serious exacerbation and 7) Short period of decline before dying;&#xD;
           that best characterizes their most salient clinical needs in the medium to long term&#xD;
           (months to years). With the exception of the category &quot;Acutely ill but curable&quot; all&#xD;
           patients should only be assigned into one category at any point in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The complicating factors section of the SST is designed to measure the degree of need in&#xD;
           8 different healthcare relevant characteristics. These characteristics were selected&#xD;
           based on their significance towards patient management at transitional points of care.&#xD;
           They are as follows: 1) functional assessment, 2) social support in case of need, 3)&#xD;
           hospital admissions in last 6 months, 4) disruptive behavioral issues, 5) polypharmacy,&#xD;
           6) organization of care, 7) activation in own care, and 8) skilled nursing type task&#xD;
           needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Decline in ADL function (Buurman, Parlevliet, Van Deelen, De Haan, &amp; De Rooij, 2010) and&#xD;
           recent unplanned hospital readmissions (L. W. &amp; C. K. W., 1999) are known to precede&#xD;
           unplanned hospital readmission. On the other hand, social support enhances an&#xD;
           individual's ability to cope with stressors, promotes health-seeking behavior, and also&#xD;
           provides basic healthcare services (Glanz, Rimer, &amp; Viswanath, 2008). Disruptive&#xD;
           behavioral issues are important to characterize as they can cause significant caregiver&#xD;
           stress (Ahn &amp; Horgas, 2013) . Complex medication management plans due to polypharmacy&#xD;
           (Cameli et al., 2012) or multiple healthcare provider confusion (Services, 2010) are&#xD;
           important to recognize so as to prevent iatrogenic harm to patient. Finally, the degree&#xD;
           of patient activation (Mosen et al., 2007) as well as successful management of geriatric&#xD;
           syndromes (Van Craen et al., 2010) if present are also important determinants of elderly&#xD;
           health.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Depending on the highest level of social healthcare need identified in the patient, the&#xD;
           following complexity category can then be assigned. For example, if the highest level of&#xD;
           social healthcare need identified is a 1 for Polypharmacy, the patient is thus deemed as&#xD;
           moderately complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Complexity can be understood as an &quot;interference with standard care&quot;(Peek, Baird, &amp;&#xD;
           Coleman, 2009). Increased complexity in a patient increases the probability of failure&#xD;
           of a medical intervention and hence needs to be recognized and mitigated in order to&#xD;
           improve clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The SST is designed for use in an outpatient setting. Clinicians trained in its use are&#xD;
           expected to first assess a patient as part of their routine clinical assessment before&#xD;
           using the SST to categorize the patient. By keeping the number of inputs required from&#xD;
           the clinician brief and succinct, it is hoped that utilization of the SST integrates&#xD;
           well with usual clinic operational flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Validation and Improvement of the SST&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the SST is a novel tool, it needs to be psychometrically validated before it can be used&#xD;
      to segment patient populations in various sites of provision of healthcare.There are various&#xD;
      benefits associated with successful validation of the tool in the proposed manner:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter-rater reliability: Validation would allow us to assess the interchangeability of&#xD;
      potential users of the tool in a heterogenous patient population (Gwet, 2010). If the&#xD;
      investigators are able to establish interchangeability of clinicians of different backgrounds&#xD;
      and experience such as senior doctors, nurses and even medical students, the investigators&#xD;
      may then be able to more easily operationalize the tool since more medical personnel will be&#xD;
      able to reliably administer it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Convergent validity: Validation would allow us to verify that two measures of constructs that&#xD;
      theoretically should be related, are in fact related (Trochim, 2006). Demonstration of&#xD;
      convergent validity when the SST is paired with widely accepted and validated pre-existing&#xD;
      tools will allow us to gain reasonable confidence in the ability of the tool to capture&#xD;
      similar constructs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictive validity: Validation that the SST can be used to predict future health status or&#xD;
      healthcare utilization patterns such as unplanned readmissions after discharge would increase&#xD;
      the SST's utility for shaping interventions that target high readmission risk individuals in&#xD;
      a bid to lower their risk of unplanned hospital readmissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of the validation studies, the SST can be further modified to make it&#xD;
      optimally robust before subsequent patient segmentation studies in the various sites of care.&#xD;
      For example, specific sections of the SST with low inter-rater reliability or convergent&#xD;
      validity can be modified to improve the tool's psychometric properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SST Benefit 1 - Identification of leverage points for intervention. Through cross-sectional&#xD;
      and longitudinal studies of patient profiles in terms of their medical and social healthcare&#xD;
      needs using the SST, areas that are characterized by high healthcare needs can be detected in&#xD;
      the various sites of care thus allowing for implementation of health service interventions in&#xD;
      order to better meet these healthcare needs. Furthermore, longitudinal studies would allow&#xD;
      for the determination of risk factors associated with increased transition rates from lower&#xD;
      to higher severity global impression of patient category thus also facilitating targeted&#xD;
      follow up intervention studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health service reorganization to better meet areas of high healthcare need would lead to&#xD;
      improved clinical outcomes through reduction in the probability of clinical complications. In&#xD;
      the context of an ageing population this would help keep more elderly healthy and functional&#xD;
      for a longer period of time thus reducing healthcare costs associated with exacerbation of&#xD;
      chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SST Benefit 2 - Greater accountability. Better identification of areas of healthcare need&#xD;
      allows for better comparison between needs and clinical infrastructure or services provided&#xD;
      so as to allow for greater accountability in the delivery of healthcare. Services which do&#xD;
      not meet identified needs can be scaled down so as to reduce healthcare costs. Resources both&#xD;
      financial and manpower alike can then be diverted towards areas of greater need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SST Benefit 3 - Packages of care. Understanding the common combinations of population medical&#xD;
      needs and complicating factors would allow for packages of care to be developed which are&#xD;
      designed for common prototypical patients and can be easily modified to suit individual&#xD;
      patients. Such an approach would allow for more effective resource planning and capitation&#xD;
      bundling purposes, as well as integrate the delivery of healthcare interventions for the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
