  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Norovirus (NoV) GI.1/GII.4&#xD;
      bivalent virus-like particle vaccine against moderate or severe acute gastroenteritis (AGE)&#xD;
      due to genotype-specific (GI.1 and GII.4) NoV strains.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vaccine being tested in this study is called NoV GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine&#xD;
      adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide. The norovirus vaccine is being tested to prevent AGE due&#xD;
      to genotype-specific (GI.1 and GII.4) norovirus strains in healthy participants recruited&#xD;
      from a US military training installation. This study will look at the illness rate of AGE&#xD;
      occurring &gt; 7 days after dosing due to genotype-specific (GI.1 or GII.4) NoV strains&#xD;
      represented in the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll between 2800 and 8700 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain&#xD;
      undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent&#xD;
      medical need):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Norovirus GI.1/GII.4 Bivalent VLP Vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo (dummy inactive solution) - this is a liquid that looks similar to the study&#xD;
           drug but has no active ingredient&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive one dose of study medication on Day 1 administered via&#xD;
      intramuscular injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States at select military locations.&#xD;
      The overall time to participate in this study is up to 45 days for participants in the navy&#xD;
      53 days for participants in the Air Force, and 72 days for participants in the marines.&#xD;
      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, including a final visit on the last day&#xD;
      of study participation (Day 45, 53 or 72) for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;

    <description>Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a sudden inflammation or swelling in the lining of the stomach causing diarrhea and vomiting. A norovirus AGE case was defined as meeting the work-up definition plus a norovirus positive stool sample or vomitus sample confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The severity of AGE was graded by the investigator as per CTCAE criteria. AGE occurring due to NoV strains excluding co-infection with Salmonella, Shigella or Campylobacter is reported. The Norovirus strains included: GI.1, GI.7a, GII.2 and GII.4.</description>

        <description>Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a sudden inflammation or swelling in the lining of the stomach causing diarrhea and vomiting. A norovirus AGE case was defined as meeting the work-up definition plus a norovirus positive stool sample or vomitus sample confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The severity of AGE was graded by the investigator as per CTCAE criteria. AGE occurring due to NoV strains excluding co-infection with Salmonella, Shigella or Campylobacter is reported. The Norovirus strains included: GI.1, GI.7a, GII.2 and GII.4.</description>

A norovirus AGE case was defined as meeting the work-up definition plus a norovirus positive stool sample or vomitus sample confirmed by RT-PCR. The severity of AGE was graded by the investigator as per CTCAE criteria. AGE occurring due to NoV strains including co-infection with Salmonella, Shigella or Campylobacter is reported.
