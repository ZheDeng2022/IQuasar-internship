  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label randomized and controlled clinical trial: This study was to compare the&#xD;
      anticancer efficacy and safety in the First-Line Treatment in patients with Advanced&#xD;
      Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer with Paclitaxel Micelles for Injection In combination with&#xD;
      Cisplatin versus Paclitaxel Injection Containing Cremophor EL(polyoxyethylenated castor oil)&#xD;
      In combination with Cisplatin in the way of an open-label, randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects were randomized in the Paclitaxel Micelles for Injection Group and the&#xD;
      Paclitaxel Injection Group by the proportion of 2:1. The centralized randomization method was&#xD;
      adopted in this trial. Since the study was a comparison of first-line treatment, the test for&#xD;
      superiority was adopted. The objective response rate was the primary indicator of efficacy in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel Micelles for Injection and Cisplatin was intravenously administrated. Three weeks&#xD;
      constituted one course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No pretreatment, including anti-allergic prevention and antiemetic prophylaxis, was required&#xD;
      for the patients before infusion of Paclitaxel Micelles for Injection patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional Paclitaxel Injection and Cisplatin was intravenously administrated. Three weeks&#xD;
      constituted one course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard preventive treatment must be given to patients in accordance with the specific&#xD;
      requirements in specifications of Paclitaxel Injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of the Trial Group or the Control Group, six treatment periods shall be the upper&#xD;
      limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the sample size based on objective remission indicators (CR + PR) in the study.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: the objective remission rate of the Paclitaxel Micelles for Injection combined&#xD;
      with Cisplatin in the Trial Group is different with that of first-line treatment of advanced&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer, and is also different with that of the Cremophor EL-containing&#xD;
      Paclitaxel Injection combined with Cisplatin in the Control Group. Trial parameter settings:&#xD;
      assuming α = 0.05 and 1-β = 80%, the Trial Group: Control Group is designed as per the&#xD;
      proportion of 2: 1. According to the sample size formula , a total of 426 patients is&#xD;
      required, including 284 patients assigned in the Trial Group and 142 in the Control Group. In&#xD;
      consideration of case expulsion in the process of clinical, enlarged by 10%, actually 468&#xD;
      cases were included in the groups, including 312 in the Trial Group and 156 in the Control&#xD;
      Group.&#xD;
