             control pills or patches, diaphragm, intrauterine device (IUD), condom, surgical&#xD;
             sterilization, and progestin implant or injection. Prohibited methods include: the&#xD;
             rhythm method or withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Willing and able to provide written informed consent and able to understand and comply&#xD;
             with protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. During the period of study confinement, subjects will be required to abstain from&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has a known allergy to any ester based anesthetics including cocaine HCl, procaine,&#xD;
             tetracaine, chloroprocaine, dibucaine, or benzocaine Amide based anesthetic allergies&#xD;
             are NOT exclusionary. Amide based anesthetics are: Lidocaine, mepivicaine,&#xD;
             bupivicaine, levobupivicaine, ropivicaine, etidocaine, prilocaine, and articaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The use of amphetamines, methylphenidate or other stimulant prescription and&#xD;
             nonprescription products such as pseudoephedrine, bronchial inhalers containing&#xD;
             sympathomimetics (epinephrine or other beta-receptor agonist) or herbal products in&#xD;
             the 7 days prior to screening or has a need to use these drugs during the course of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Use of any SNRIs/SSRIs antidepressants or tricyclic antidepressant up to7 days or 5&#xD;
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to screening or has a need to use these drugs&#xD;
             during the screening period and throughout the time period of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Use of MAO Inhibitor drugs up to14 days prior to screening or has a need to use these&#xD;
             drugs during the screening period and throughout the time period of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has a history of abuse of controlled substances, nasal or otherwise, or has damage to&#xD;
             the nasal space, that in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with the&#xD;
             ability to absorb RX0041-002.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has severely traumatized mucosa or sepsis in the nasal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has participated in an investigational study or received an investigational drug&#xD;
             within 30 days preceding the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Is a pregnant or nursing mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has a positive pregnancy test at Screening or Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has a history of seizure, with the exception of febrile seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has glaucoma, symptomatic cardiovascular disease, or moderate to severe hypertension&#xD;
             (defined as an average SBP ≥160 mmHg or an average DBP ≥ 100 mmHg at the dosing&#xD;
             visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has a known personal or family history of hereditary pseudocholinesterase deficiency.&#xD;
             Study participants will be screened by asking about personal or family history of&#xD;
             anesthetic reaction, anesthetic death, and previous diagnosis of psuedocholinesterase&#xD;
             deficiency in a relative or personally. Subjects identified with pseudocholinesterase&#xD;
             deficiency are at risk for delayed recovery with certain anesthetics (e.g.&#xD;
             succinylcholine and ester-based anesthetics).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has a known personal or family history of pheochromocytoma. Study participants will be&#xD;
             specifically asked if they have been treated for a pheochromocytoma previously or if&#xD;
             they have a family member who has been diagnosed with pheochromocytoma (since 10% of&#xD;
             these are familial).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has a known personal or family history of adrenal tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. ECG abnormalities judged clinically significant by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has a positive urine test result for drugs of abuse (amphetamines, barbiturates,&#xD;
             cannabinoids, cocaine metabolites, opiates and oxycodone) at Screening or Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Hematocrit, WBC, or platelets outside the normal limits and judged clinically&#xD;
             significant by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Serum potassium outside normal limits and judged clinically significant by the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Serum ALT, AST, and bilirubin exceeding 2X ULN for the lab's reference values.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Evidence of impaired renal function based upon laboratory tests and investigator&#xD;
             opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Clinical chemistry abnormalities judged clinically significant by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Donation of blood (one pint or greater) within four weeks prior to administration of&#xD;
             study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
