  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the safety of delivering continuous infusion&#xD;
      (CI) vancomycin in pediatric CRRT by utilizing CI via by mixing the vancomycin into the CRRT&#xD;
      solution(s). The secondary objectives are to describe the ability to achieve therapeutic&#xD;
      vancomycin concentrations by utilizing this new delivery technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether delivering continuous infusion vancomycin mixed into the CRRT solution&#xD;
      can maintain therapeutic levels of drug in patients being treated for proven or suspected&#xD;
      Gram-positive bacterial infections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment Patients deemed candidates for CRRT and antimicrobial therapy for a proven or&#xD;
      suspected Gram-positive bacterial infection that includes vancomycin at the time of CRRT&#xD;
      initiation or at any time during the CRRT course. If vancomycin is part of the empiric&#xD;
      regimen or needed for definitive therapy an assessment will be made whether the vancomycin&#xD;
      can be administered via a continuous infusion by mixing the vancomycin in the CRRT&#xD;
      solution(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Administration of continuous infusion vancomycin via mixing vancomycin in the&#xD;
      CRRT solution(s). The CRRT solution will be prepared at the time it is needed following&#xD;
      current standard operating procedures of the Department of Pharmacy at St. Christopher's&#xD;
      Hospital for Children for sterile product compounding. The amount of vancomycin to be added&#xD;
      to the CRRT solution will be determined by the clinical condition such as the site of&#xD;
      infection,infecting organism(s), and serum drug levels. The mixed solution will be infused&#xD;
      for the duration it is prescribed for CRRT. Vancomycin is stable with the components of the&#xD;
      CRRT solution for at least 96 hours, therefore the frequency with which each CRRT solution&#xD;
      bag will be prepared will not exceed 96 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vancomycin dosing and concentration adjustments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients started on vancomycin after initiation of CRRT, a single loading dose of 15-20&#xD;
      mg/kg of total body weight will be given intravenously over 60 minutes, after which the&#xD;
      vancomycin will be added directly to the CRRT solution(s). Vancomycin will be added at a&#xD;
      final concentration of 30 mg/L at CRRT initiation, regardless of age. For patients receiving&#xD;
      vancomycin prior to the initiation of CRRT, if the last dose administered is &gt; 8 hours prior&#xD;
      to CRRT initiation, a loading dose of 15-20 mg/kg of total body weight will be given&#xD;
      intravenously over 60 minutes, after which the vancomycin will be added directly to the CRRT&#xD;
      solution(s). Vancomycin will be added at a final concentration of 30 mg/L at CRRT initiation,&#xD;
      regardless of age. The first serum vancomycin level will be determined 8-12 hours after&#xD;
      initiation of CRRT mixed with vancomycin. All serum for vancomycin concentrations&#xD;
      determination will be obtained directly from the patient via a central line, arterial line or&#xD;
      peripheral venipuncture and no vancomycin concentrations will obtained from the CRRT circuit&#xD;
      for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vancomycin concentrations in the CRRT solution(s) will be adjusted based on the initial&#xD;
      vancomycin serum plateau level, and subsequent levels will be obtained based on these&#xD;
      changes. The target vancomycin plateau serum concentrations range is 15-30 mg/L. If the first&#xD;
      vancomycin plateau level obtained is within range, daily vancomycin plateau levels will be&#xD;
      obtained for the duration the vancomycin is mixed in the CRRT solution. If the first&#xD;
      vancomycin plateau level is not within range, the vancomycin concentration in the CRRT&#xD;
      solution will be adjusted. Subsequent vancomycin plateau levels will be obtained 8-12 hours&#xD;
      after the vancomycin concentration change and this process will continue until a therapeutic&#xD;
      plateau level is obtained. Once a therapeutic plateau level is obtained, daily vancomycin&#xD;
      plateau levels will be obtained for the duration the vancomycin is mixed in the CRRT&#xD;
      solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for vancomycin analysis will be obtained 8-12 hours after starting the CRRT&#xD;
      solution mixed with vancomycin. Based on the first drug level obtained, changes to the&#xD;
      concentration may be made to adjust to the desired serum concentration and serum levels will&#xD;
      be obtained 8-12 hours after each change to the vancomycin concentration in the CRRT&#xD;
      solution. Once a therapeutic level is obtained, serum levels will be obtained as needed but&#xD;
      usually not more frequently than daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the first vancomycin plateau level is &lt; 10 mcg/mL, then a single, supplemental dose of 10&#xD;
      mg/kg of vancomycin will be given while the vancomycin CRRT concentration is being adjusted.&#xD;
