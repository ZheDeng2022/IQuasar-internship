    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, post-chemotherapy, adjuvant phase III clinical&#xD;
      trial. The primary aim of this study is to determine the value of regorafenib in improving&#xD;
      disease-free survival (DFS). Patients with Stage III (IIIB or IIIC) colon cancer as defined&#xD;
      by the 7th Edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual are&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to placebo or the experimental agent regorafenib following completion of at&#xD;
      least four months of standard adjuvant therapy (e.g., 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin&#xD;
      (FOLFOX) , capecitabine, oxaliplatin (CapeOx), and other).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the value of regorafenib in improving DFS. The&#xD;
      secondary aims are to evaluate the dose tolerance and long term toxicity of two years of&#xD;
      regorafenib following standard adjuvant therapy, and to evaluate the effect of the use of&#xD;
      regorafenib in overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients in this double-blind study will be randomized to take either regorafenib&#xD;
      120 mg or placebo orally, once daily for 21 consecutive days of a 28 day cycle for 26 cycles&#xD;
      (2 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual for this study will be approximately 1118 randomized patients. These 1118 patients&#xD;
      will provide approximately 313 DFS events at the time of primary analysis. An initial&#xD;
      futility analysis will be performed when 312 patients have been on study at least 3 months.&#xD;
      The decision to continue the trial will be determined by success of both early stopping&#xD;
      endpoints defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The toxicity profile of regorafenib compared to placebo is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The regorafenib regimen is tolerable for prolonged administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimated compliance rate of 60% at 6 months for regorafenib will be required for&#xD;
      continuation of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If toxicity is acceptable and compliance with regorafenib is at least 60% nominally, then&#xD;
      accrual will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second futility analysis will be conducted when approximately 67 DFS events are observed.&#xD;
      Trial conduct and accrual will continue unless the primary endpoint (DFS) trends too far in&#xD;
      the opposite direction (hazard ratio greater than or equal to 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NSABP C-13 will include a Behavioral and Health Outcomes correlative science component. A&#xD;
      C-13 Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaire will be administered at baseline (after consent and&#xD;
      prior to randomization) and at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, and 30&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Submission of blood samples for C-13 correlative science studies will be a study requirement&#xD;
      for all patients. Submissions will also include archived primary tumor tissue from the&#xD;
      resected colon primary. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics (PK) will be collected on Day 15&#xD;
      of Cycle 1 and Day 15 of Cycle 2, with additional blood samples for biomarkers collected at&#xD;
      various time points for future analysis.&#xD;

    Due to the significantly lower than expected accrual it was impossible to evaluate the endpoint&#xD;
