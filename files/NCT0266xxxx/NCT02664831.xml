    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study to investigate molecular mechanisms mediating the&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory process, and their impact on brain injury, survival, and functional&#xD;
      outcomes after cardiac arrest. Investigators have shown that cardiac arrest induces changes&#xD;
      in the numbers and properties of circulating immune cells, shifting the balance towards a&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory phenotype and there is increased interest in the inflammatory pathways and&#xD;
      the signaling mechanisms through which they are modulated. Participants will undergo blood&#xD;
      sampling during 7 days following cardiac arrest, and analyses performed. Patient&#xD;
      characteristics, clinical circumstances, and outcomes will be recorded and their associations&#xD;
      with these inflammatory pathways characterized.&#xD;

      Preliminary evidence indicates that inter-individual variables such as immune cell activity&#xD;
      and the production of pro-inflammatory factors may differentiate patients with the highest&#xD;
      risk of poor outcomes, and may reveal novel therapeutic approaches based on promoting&#xD;
      molecular pathways of inflammation-resolution and recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparative analysis showed that cardiac arrest survivors have more CD73+ lymphocytes&#xD;
      compared to non-survivors. CD73 is the key enzyme in the generation of anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      immunosuppressive adenosine. We have also identified novel populations of neutrophils&#xD;
      (CD14posCD16low and DEspR+) that had amplified response to inflammatory stimuli. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that individual variability in the expression and signaling&#xD;
      profiles of white blood cells (lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages) following&#xD;
      resuscitation affects inflammation and is independently associated with neurological outcome.&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, investigators will determine levels of various immune cell&#xD;
      populations at different time points in peripheral blood of patients. Characterization of&#xD;
      blood circulating factors, clinical phenotypes, and neurological outcomes after cardiac&#xD;
      arrest is a second aim of this project, with a focus on understanding the heterogeneity of&#xD;
      cellular and humoral immune responses and how they relate to different clinical phenotypes of&#xD;
      post-resuscitation syndrome.&#xD;
