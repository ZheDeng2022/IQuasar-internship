  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each hospitalization leads to stress and anxiety. This is particularly true in psychiatry,&#xD;
      because of &quot;decompensation&quot;. That is why therapeutic treatments are delivered quickly to&#xD;
      treat these symptoms and to allow a better relationship with patients. This relationship&#xD;
      patients-nursing staff called &quot;therapeutic alliance&quot; is needed in psychiatry. Moreover, other&#xD;
      treatments added to the therapeutic ones are used, like mediation, to increase the patients'&#xD;
      state of health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These last years, numerous studies were based on hortitherapy or care-gardens. It consists in&#xD;
      the use of plants with a medical staff (for example nurses). A lot demonstrated the efficacy&#xD;
      of the care-gardens, but most of them showed methodological weaknesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That is why the investigators would like to perform a randomized study, controlled, and they&#xD;
      aim to demonstrate the efficacy of hortitherapy on anxiety in patients allowed in adult&#xD;
      psychiatry for at least 4 weeks.&#xD;

      Each hospitalization leads to stress and anxiety. This is particularly true in psychiatry,&#xD;
      because of &quot;decompensation&quot; that increases anxiety and fear. That is why therapeutic&#xD;
      treatments are delivered quickly to treat these symptoms and to allow a better relationship&#xD;
      with patients. This relationship patients-nursing staff called &quot;therapeutic alliance&quot; is&#xD;
      needed in psychiatry. Moreover, other treatments added to the therapeutic ones are used, like&#xD;
      mediation, to increase the patients' state of health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These last years, numerous studies were based on hortitherapy or care-gardens. It consists in&#xD;
      the use of plants with a medical staff (for example nurses). A lot demonstrated the efficacy&#xD;
      of the care-gardens, but most of them showed methodological weaknesses : no control group, no&#xD;
      randomization, few patients. Furthermore, these studies were not performed with feared&#xD;
      patients hospitalized in psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That is why the investigators would like to perform a randomized study, controlled, and they&#xD;
      aim to demonstrate the efficacy of hortitherapy on anxiety in patients allowed in adult&#xD;
      psychiatry for at least 4 weeks. This study will be performed on 190 patients who will be&#xD;
      included in one of these groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group : only usual care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hortitherapy group : 2 hortitherapy sessions/week during 4 weeks, added at the usual&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety will be evaluated with HAD-A scale that is a brief questionnaire (2 at 6 minutes).&#xD;
      HAD-A is very sensitive at the modifications and allows to follow the evolution of the&#xD;
      anxiety. This scale is easy to use by the nursing staff and shows an excellent reliability,&#xD;
      by the way really adapted to this study. On another hand researchers will also focus on the&#xD;
      effects on the therapeutic alliance and the persistence of the effects at week 8.&#xD;
