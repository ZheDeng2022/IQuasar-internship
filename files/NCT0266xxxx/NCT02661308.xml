  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this interdisciplinary proposal is to conduct two randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) of the efficacy of self-administered systematic light exposure (Bright White&#xD;
      Light (BWL)), an innovative, low cost, and low burden intervention to treat cancer-related&#xD;
      fatigue. Another common and often overlapping treatment side-effect is cognitive impairment.&#xD;
      A secondary outcome of the proposed RCT is, thus, cognitive functioning. Finally, possible&#xD;
      underlying chronobiological (circadian activity rhythms, sleep), biological (pro inflammatory&#xD;
      markers), and neurophysiological (brain morphology) mechanisms of BWL will be explored.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two independent but similar RCTs with a total of 144 breast cancer patients (Group 1 = 72&#xD;
      high risk patients; Group 2 = 72 low risk breast cancer patients) post-treatment screened for&#xD;
      fatigue will be randomized to BWL (36 in each of the two groups) or dim light(DL) (36 in each&#xD;
      of the two groups) exposure for 30 minutes/morning for 4 weeks, and assessed before, during,&#xD;
      immediately and 3 months after the intervention. Measures include questionnaires, cognitive&#xD;
      assessment, actigraphy, blood samples, saliva samples, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Aims and hypotheses. Aim 1: To test the efficacy of BWL on fatigue (primary outcome) in&#xD;
      breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Compared with control participants exposed to DL, participants randomized to&#xD;
      BWL will report less fatigue immediately and 3 months after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To test the efficacy of BWL on cognitive functioning (secondary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Compared with controls, BWL recipients will show improved cognitive functioning&#xD;
      immediately and 3 months after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To explore the effects of BWL on chronobiological, biological, and neurophysiological&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: BWL will be associated with normalized circadian activity rhythms (3a);&#xD;
      improved sleep (3b); decreased inflammation (3c); increased cortical and subcortical grey&#xD;
      matter density (3d); and increased cortical and subcortical white matter integrity (3e). If&#xD;
      hypotheses 1 and/or 2 are confirmed, the mediating effects of the markers will be explored.&#xD;
