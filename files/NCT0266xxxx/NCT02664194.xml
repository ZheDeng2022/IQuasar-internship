  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate and improve the safety and efficacy of hypothermia as an adjunctive therapy to&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with acute myocardial infarction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study involving at least 70&#xD;
      patients with up to 10 roll-in patients (for training purposes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female adults presenting with acute myocardial infarction may be eligible for this&#xD;
      research study. To qualify, patients must go to the Emergency Room within up to 6 hours of&#xD;
      onset of chest pain, present with anterior or inferior acute myocardial infarction with&#xD;
      elevation of the ST segment greater than 1mm in 2 or more contiguous leads in the anterior or&#xD;
      inferior wall and be eligible for the performance of a percutaneous intervention procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be intravascular hypothermia using Proteus System® as an adjunctive&#xD;
      method to percutaneous coronary intervention, adjunct hypothermia methods and parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the randomization phase, at least 70 patients who meet the eligibility criteria will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to the 03 hour hypothermia group (percutaneous coronary intervention +&#xD;
      cooling), to the 01 hour hypothermia group (percutaneous coronary intervention + cooling) or&#xD;
      to the control group (percutaneous coronary intervention only) in a 1:1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receiving PCI + Cooling will also be randomized to groups A and B. Group A will&#xD;
      receive 1 liter of chilled normal saline (4°C) prior to PCI/reperfusion, and Group B will not&#xD;
      receive chilled normal saline (4°C), prior to PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included in the randomization phase will be included in the statistical&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 10 Roll-in patients may be enrolled at the center (for training purpose), with&#xD;
      anterior or inferior wall infarcts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be reduction of the infarct size (%LV), studied with cardiac&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (cMR) using late gadolinium enhancement 5 days after the AMI, and&#xD;
      30 days after the infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secundary endpoints will be&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) or death within 30 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  resolution of the ST segment elevation after PCI;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ejection fraction determined by cMR after 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of adverse events potentially related to hypothermia and/or endovascular&#xD;
           cooling within 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differences in plaquelet aggregation during cooling and rewarming.&#xD;
