  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the reasons patients go to more than one prescriber or more than one pharmacy to&#xD;
      obtain prescriptions opioids and assess whether the percentage of patients reporting misuse,&#xD;
      abuse and/or diversion increases across defined categories of doctor/pharmacy shopping as&#xD;
      defined in Study 4A.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on a review of the literature, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that&#xD;
      more data are needed regarding the serious risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and&#xD;
      death associated with the long-term use of extended release/long acting (ER/LA) opioid&#xD;
      analgesics. Thus, the FDA is requiring that ER/LA opioid analgesic drug sponsors conduct&#xD;
      post-marketing studies to assess these risks. The four observational post-marketing&#xD;
      requirement (PMR) studies are labeled Study #2065-1, Study #2065-2, Study #2065-3, and Study&#xD;
      #2065-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of PMR Study #2065-4 is to define and validate doctor/pharmacy shopping as&#xD;
      outcomes suggestive of misuse, diversion, abuse and/or addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study #2065-4 consists of three sub-studies, Study 4A, Study 4B, and Study 4C. In the current&#xD;
      study (#2065-4 sub-study, Study 4B), the association between doctor/pharmacy shopping&#xD;
      behavior and misuse, diversion and abuse will be assessed by surveying patients within the a&#xD;
      priori defined four categories of shopping behaviors. The four categories of shopping&#xD;
      behaviors identified and defined in Study 4A will be applied to Study 4B. Asking patients&#xD;
      directly about their behaviors related to misuse and abuse will provide us with the patient's&#xD;
      perspective that is unavailable in Study 4A. Surveying patients regarding misuse and abuse&#xD;
      requires the use of an instrument that has undergone a validation process to ensure that&#xD;
      misuse and abuse are being measured. Study 4B will utilize the Prescription Opioid Misuse and&#xD;
      Abuse Questionnaire (POMAQ) that will be validated in PMR Study #2065-2A. An administrative&#xD;
      claims database will be used to identify the eligible patient population using their pharmacy&#xD;
      claims for immediate release (IR) or ER/LA opioid analgesics to determine the number of&#xD;
      prescribers and number of pharmacies they visit. Consenting patients will be asked to&#xD;
      complete an online survey that includes the POMAQ to self-report their behaviors of misuse,&#xD;
      abuse and/or diversion. It is hypothesized that as the likelihood of doctor/pharmacy shopping&#xD;
      behavior increases the risk of misuse, abuse and/or diversion.&#xD;
