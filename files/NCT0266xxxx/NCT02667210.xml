  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess whether the percentage of patients with behaviors suggestive of misuse, diversion,&#xD;
      abuse and/or addiction described in the medical record increases across pre-defined&#xD;
      categories of increasing doctor/pharmacy shopping behavior.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on a review of the literature, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that&#xD;
      more data are needed regarding the serious risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and&#xD;
      death associated with the long-term use of extended release/long acting (ER/LA) opioid&#xD;
      analgesics. Thus, the FDA is requiring that ER/LA opioid analgesic drug sponsors conduct&#xD;
      post-marketing studies to assess these risks. The four observational post-marketing&#xD;
      requirement (PMR) studies are labeled Study #2065-1, Study #2065-2, Study #2065-3, and Study&#xD;
      #2065-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of PMR Study #2065-4 is to define and validate doctor/pharmacy shopping as&#xD;
      outcomes suggestive of misuse, diversion, abuse and/or addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study #2065-4 consists of three sub-studies, Study 4A, Study 4B, and Study 4C. In the current&#xD;
      study (#2065-4 sub-study, Study 4C), the association of doctor/pharmacy shopping behavior&#xD;
      with misuse, diversion, abuse and/or addiction will be assessed by reviewing medical charts&#xD;
      in a sample of patients within specific categories of a priori defined doctor/pharmacy&#xD;
      shopping. The four categories of doctor/pharmacy shopping behaviors identified and defined in&#xD;
      Study 4A and will be applied to Study 4C. The medical chart is a rich source of information&#xD;
      about the patient's medical conditions and behaviors suggestive of misuse and abuse. Medical&#xD;
      record review for behaviors suggestive of misuse and abuse in patients with chronic pain&#xD;
      discriminates between patients with and without opioid use disorders. Therefore, Study 4C was&#xD;
      designed to utilize an insurance/health plan database (HealthCore Integrated Research&#xD;
      Database [HIRD]) with access to medical records, to evaluate the association of a priori&#xD;
      defined categories of doctor/pharmacy shopping and behaviors suggestive of misuse, diversion,&#xD;
      abuse and/or addiction.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients 18 years or older on the date of first IR or ER/LA opioid dispensing in 2012&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with at least two dispensings of any IR or ER/LA opioid. The first of these&#xD;
             dispensings will have occurred in 2012 and an additional dispensing within 18 months&#xD;
             after the first.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Continuous, fully insured enrollment with medical and pharmacy eligibility in a health&#xD;
             plan included in the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD) for at least six&#xD;
             months prior to the start of the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with continuous enrollment during the follow-up period of 18 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who cannot be classified into one of the four a priori defined&#xD;
             doctor/pharmacy shopping categories&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients for whom no medical records can be accessed&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with a known history of abuse identified through the administrative claims&#xD;
             data will be excluded because HealthCore is not permitted to request their medical&#xD;
             records.&#xD;
