      The proposed multicenter study will test the effect of glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 agonist&#xD;
      exenatide once weekly extended-release (ExQW, Bydureon®) on clinical outcomes and metabolic&#xD;
      parameters in a double-blind, placebo-controlled 36 week randomized trial with an 18 week&#xD;
      open label extension. Following baseline testing, 48 patients will be randomly assigned with&#xD;
      equal allocation to ExQW or matching placebo injection for 36 weeks, followed by an 18 week&#xD;
      open label extension during which all patients receive ExQW. Changes of weight status, body&#xD;
      composition, free-living total daily energy expenditure (EE) by doubly labeled water (DLW),&#xD;
      activity by acetimetry, energy intake (questionnaires and food diary), as well as glucose&#xD;
      tolerance and hormonal parameters of energy homeostasis and insulin resistance will be&#xD;
      assessed before treatment and at the end of the placebo-controlled phase (week 36). Activity,&#xD;
      metabolic outcomes, energy intake will be also assessed at study week 18 (mid treatment of&#xD;
      randomized study), as well as week 54 (end of open label treatment).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excessive weight gain and its cardiometabolic sequela are frequent complications of&#xD;
      hypothalamic tumors, a condition known as hypothalamic obesity (HO). Most tumors in this&#xD;
      region are craniopharyngiomas (CP),1 which constitute 5-9% of childhood brain tumors.&#xD;
      Patients with CP typically become obese and have more features of the metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      compared to matched controls. Overall, a 3-19-fold higher cardiovascular mortality had been&#xD;
      reported, and a recent nationwide population-based study in Sweden demonstrated increased&#xD;
      rates for cerebral infarction (7-fold), death due to cerebrovascular diseases (5-fold), and&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (6-fold) in CP patients in comparison to the general population.&#xD;
      Thus, early and effective management of obesity is vital for this population, which is more&#xD;
      resistant to treatment than uncomplicated obesity. Recognized risk factors for severe obesity&#xD;
      include large hypothalamic tumors or lesions affecting several medial and posterior&#xD;
      hypothalamic nuclei that impact satiety signaling pathways. Structural damage in these nuclei&#xD;
      often lead to uncontrolled appetite, rapid weight gain, central insulin and leptin&#xD;
      resistance, decreased sympathetic activity, low energy expenditure (EE), and increased energy&#xD;
      storage in adipose tissue. Recently, the investigators developed a semi-quantitative&#xD;
      assessment of hypothalamic damage on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict the&#xD;
      risk for HO development in CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous results of treating HO with a glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1RA) in&#xD;
      rats and humans provide promising proof-of-principle data to support this current randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial. The primary hypothesis of this study is that drugs causing weight loss via&#xD;
      intact hindbrain signaling pathways offer a desperately needed option for treatment of HO,&#xD;
      even in very obese HO subjects with severe hypothalamic damage. Induction of weight loss by&#xD;
      GLP1RAs is believed to be related to multiple mechanisms involving the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract, vagus nerve, and the brain leading to increased satiety. Peripheral administration of&#xD;
      GLP-1 or GLP1RA reduces blood glucose and energy intake in humans and rodents, and long-term&#xD;
      treatment results in loss of body weight. Critically, the investigators do not know whether&#xD;
      GLP1RA treatment affects EE and activity, or whether the site and size of brain lesions&#xD;
      affect responses to GLP1RA treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' previous clinical studies of the GLP1RA exenatide in obese adolescents and&#xD;
      adults have generated the critical safety and efficacy data needed to design a clinical&#xD;
      trial. In a pilot study conducted at Children's Hospitals and Clinics of MN, pretreatment&#xD;
      hyperphagia was associated with BMI reduction. Using these data, the investigators have&#xD;
      designed a prospective, multicenter trial that will examine the effects of GLP1RA on BMI,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, energy homeostasis and other factors in subjects&#xD;
      with HO secondary to CP.&#xD;
