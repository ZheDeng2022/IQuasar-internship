    <textblock>
      Photodynamic diagnostic (PDD) is a technique where a photodynamic drug is installed&#xD;
      preoperatively in the bladder. Mucosa cells with a higher metabolism than normal urothelial&#xD;
      cells, e.g. cancer cells, absorbs this drug which is utilized during cystoscopy where blue&#xD;
      light is absorbed by the drug, making the surgeon able to distinguish tumor cells from normal&#xD;
      cells and thus being able to identify flat lesions and small papillomas missed in white light&#xD;
      cystoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of PDD at this primary transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURB) has been&#xD;
      shown to be associated with a lower recurrence rate within the first year, probably mostly&#xD;
      owing to a higher detection rate of small papillomas and dysplasia that therefore can be&#xD;
      relevantly treated at an early stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the use of PDD at the primary TURB, a high number of patients experience an early&#xD;
      recurrence and patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin&#xD;
      (BCG) may have recurrence of their CIS or recurrence of papillomas despite the peroperative&#xD;
      use of PDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas the use of PDD is well established in the TURB setting, the use of PDD in the&#xD;
      follow-up setting with flexible cystoscopy in the outpatient clinic is not investigated.&#xD;
      Feasibility studies have been successful but the clinical relevance and benefits have not&#xD;
      been investigated so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thesis The thesis of the study is that the use of PDD in the outpatient clinic in patients&#xD;
      with a high recurrence risk undergoing follow-up flexible cystoscopy will result in diagnosis&#xD;
      of papillomas earlier than by the use of conventional flexible cystoscopy in white light.&#xD;
      Thus, a higher number of tumours can be treated in the outpatient setting without the need&#xD;
      for procedures in general anesthesia. Furthermore, the number of follow-up cystoscopies can&#xD;
      be reduced if PDD is used at the first cystoscopy following TURB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims To investigate whether the use of PDD when performing a flexible cystoscopy in the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic can reduce the number of recurrences of large size papillomas that cannot&#xD;
      be treated by simple fulguration without general anesthesia. Furthermore, to investigate&#xD;
      whether the use of PDD in follow-up cystoscopy in patients with earlier complete response to&#xD;
      BCG on CIS, can increase the detection rate of CIS recurrences.&#xD;

      Background Bladder cancer is a very heterogeneous disease ranging from minimal pathology in&#xD;
      small non-invasive Ta-tumors of low malignancy (Papillary Urothelial Neoplasm of Low&#xD;
      Malignant Potential or low grade Ta tumours) easily fulgurated upon cystoscopy to deeply&#xD;
      invasive metastasizing disease with fatal course despite aggressive treatment. Moreover,&#xD;
      urothelial pathology ranges from flat lesions not visible in regular white light to massive&#xD;
      bulky tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In advanced tumor stages with deeply invasive T1-tumours or muscle invasive disease (T2) the&#xD;
      highest risk is progression is tumour, nodes, metastases (TNM) stage and the largest&#xD;
      challenge thus to prevent this with aggressive radical treatment. In the lowest tumor stages&#xD;
      with non-invasive Ta-tumors and even superficially infiltrating non-muscle invasive tumors,&#xD;
      the vast majority of patients do not progress regarding stage but more than half of the&#xD;
      patients experience a recurrence of tumor at the same stage in the bladder. These recurrences&#xD;
      are time consuming, expensive to treat because of the high number, and is affecting quality&#xD;
      of life because they result in a need for frequent follow-up visits and recurrent procedures.&#xD;
      Flat lesions recur frequently after intravesical treatment and is associated with a high risk&#xD;
      of progression if left untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent tumors are mostly treated by a transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) in&#xD;
      general anesthesia. However, if recognized at a very early stage, these tumors can be safely&#xD;
      fulgurated in the outpatient clinic. Moreover, the recognition of flat lesions or even&#xD;
      carcinoma in situ (CIS) at an earlier stage is presumed to be associated with a lower risk of&#xD;
      progression to more advanced tumor stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a reduction of the size and number of recurrences and early recognition of flat&#xD;
      lesions is desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early recurrences within the first year following the primary TURB are thought to arise in&#xD;
      small areas of flat dysplasia, CIS, or small sub-visible papillomas not recognized at the&#xD;
      primary procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PDD is a technique where a photodynamic drug is installed preoperatively in the bladder.&#xD;
      Mucosa cells with a higher metabolism than normal urothelial cells, e.g. cancer cells,&#xD;
      absorbs this drug which is utilized during cystoscopy where blue light is absorbed by the&#xD;
      drug, making the surgeon able to distinguish tumor cells from normal cells and thus being&#xD;
      able to identify flat lesions and small papillomas missed in white light cystoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of PDD at this primary TURB has been shown to be associated with a lower recurrence&#xD;
      rate within the first year, probably mostly owing to a higher detection rate of small&#xD;
      papillomas and dysplasia that therefore can be relevantly treated at an early stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the use of PDD at the primary TURB, a high number of patients experience an early&#xD;
      recurrence and patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin&#xD;
      (BCG) may have recurrence of their CIS or recurrence of papillomas despite the peroperative&#xD;
      use of PDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas the use of PDD is well established in the TURB setting, the use of PDD in the&#xD;
      follow-up setting with flexible cystoscopy in the outpatient clinic is not investigated.&#xD;
      Feasibility studies have been successful but the clinical relevance and benefits have not&#xD;
      been investigated so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thesis The thesis of the study is that the use of PDD in the outpatient clinic in patients&#xD;
      with a high recurrence risk undergoing follow-up flexible cystoscopy will result in diagnosis&#xD;
      of papillomas earlier than by the use of conventional flexible cystoscopy in white light.&#xD;
      Thus, a higher number of tumours can be treated in the outpatient setting without the need&#xD;
      for procedures in general anesthesia. Furthermore, the number of follow-up cystoscopies can&#xD;
      be reduced if PDD is used at the first cystoscopy following TURB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims To investigate whether the use of PDD when performing a flexible cystoscopy in the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic can reduce the number of recurrences of large size papillomas that cannot&#xD;
      be treated by simple fulguration without general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a prospective, randomized study with randomization between&#xD;
      conventional white light flexible cystoscopy or PDD flexible cystoscopy. The study includes&#xD;
      the following category of patients that have the highest risk of tumor recurrence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • All patients coming for first outpatient flexible cystoscopy 4 month after TURB without&#xD;
      subsequent BCG instillations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be informed of the study before the visit and if patient accept is given,&#xD;
      randomization will be made at the time of cystoscopy. Patients in the PDD-arm will receive&#xD;
      the intravesical instillation of Hexvix 1 hour prior of cystoscopy. Cystoscopy will be made&#xD;
      with the Storz flexible PDD-cystoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be handled and followed according to the national Danish bladder tumor&#xD;
      guidelines. This includes follow-up cystoscopy 4 and 12 months following the primary TURB in&#xD;
      patients with low grade Ta tumors and follow-up cystoscopy at four months interval the first&#xD;
      2 years following diagnosis in patients with high grade tumors or CIS. If tumor recurrence is&#xD;
      diagnosed, size of the largest tumor is estimated based on the intervals: less than 5 mm,&#xD;
      5-10 mm, 11-20 mm, and more than 20 mm. All tumor recurrences and suspicious areas in the&#xD;
      mucosa will be histologically verified either by resection or biopsy before fulguration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up cystoscopies in the outpatient clinic are performed in white light (WL) in both&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Tumor recurrence found in outpatient flexible cystoscopies following but not including the&#xD;
      cystoscopy 4 months after TURB where intervention is made. Patients are dichotomized&#xD;
      regarding recurrence as primary endpoint in &quot;any recurrence at any cystoscopy&quot; versus &quot;no&#xD;
      recurrences&quot; at cystoscopy 8 or 12 months of the primary TURB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of procedures in general anesthesia within 12 months of the TURB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor recurrence of more than 5 mm, 10 mm, and more than 20 mm within 12 months of the&#xD;
           TURB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression in stage within 12 months of the TURB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of flat lesions including CIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Power calculation is made as one-sided testing at a 5% significance level with&#xD;
      risk of type I error (alpha) of 0.05 and risk of type II error (beta) of 0.20. Given a&#xD;
      recurrence rate of 35% within the first 12 month and presuming 15% of all patients have&#xD;
      recurrence found at the 4 months cystoscopy leaves at minimum 20% for detection at 8 and 12&#xD;
      months cystoscopy. This recurrence rate s slightly underestimated because patients with&#xD;
      recurrences after 4 months also have a high risk of recurrence at the following cystoscopies.&#xD;
      Recurrence rate is estimated to be reduced by one third (absolute 7%) to 13 % at the 8 and 12&#xD;
      months cystoscopy by the use of PDD at 4 months cystoscopy. Thus, a number of 696 patients is&#xD;
      needed when using equal sized groups of 348 in each of the randomization arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics The study has been approved by the Regional Science Ethics Committee (Number&#xD;
      1-10-72-76-15) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (Number 1-16-02-111-15). The study will&#xD;
      be reported on clinicaltrials.gov before initiation. The study has been submitted for&#xD;
      approval at the Danish Health And Medicines Authority. The local good clinical practice&#xD;
      (GCP)-units will be allocated to the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeframe The study is planned to begin February 2016. Inclusion of patients all 696 patients&#xD;
      is expected to be terminated within an 18 month period. Follow-up of the last patient&#xD;
      included can be made 8 months following the inclusion giving an estimated time of study&#xD;
      analysis in the end of 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Set-up The study will be performed as a single surgeon, multi center study. Thus, one surgeon&#xD;
      will be performing all cystoscopies at all three locations. Moreover the nurses involved in&#xD;
      handling the cystoscopes and patients at each of the three locations will be limited to two&#xD;
      at each location. This is to ensure the quality of the study and especially to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of unintentional damage to the equipment including the cystoscopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three study locations will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The outpatient clinic in Herlev at Herlev Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The outpatient clinic in Holstebro at Hospital of West Denmark&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The outpatient clinic at Aarhus University Hospital Based on patient catchment area of&#xD;
           the involved centers, it is expected to include 40% at Herlev Hospital (approximately&#xD;
           280 patients), 35% at Aarhus University Hospital (approximately 245 patients), and 25%&#xD;
           at Hospital of West Denmark (approximately 175 patients). These are expected numbers&#xD;
           subject to changes and will depend on inclusion rates at the involved centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional project regarding health economics, logistics and time used for flexible PDD Along&#xD;
      with the major project, two additional projects will be performed. One is a research year&#xD;
      student looking at health economics by using flexible PDD. In this, time spend for the&#xD;
      additional examination and biopsy will be compared to the time saved in case of a reduced&#xD;
      recurrence rate leading to fewer TURB's and cystoscopies. Moreover, the finances saved by&#xD;
      reducing the number of TURB's and cystoscopies will be compared with the additional cost by&#xD;
      using PDD. The other project is a nurse led study evaluating the feasibility and logistics by&#xD;
      implementing flexible PDD in the outpatient clinic. These studies will be evaluating all&#xD;
      three involved clinics to give a more valid insight than one-center studies.&#xD;
