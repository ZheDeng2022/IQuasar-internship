  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking causes significant morbidity and mortality in the United States. Smoking&#xD;
      cessation is difficult, with the average smoker attempting to quit five times before&#xD;
      permanent success. Moreover, the majority of smoking quit attempts result in relapse. Brain&#xD;
      stimulation for smoke cessation is an exciting new area that builds on advancing neuroscience&#xD;
      knowledge concerning the functional neurocircuitry of addiction. Cortical stimulation can now&#xD;
      be performed non-invasively by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Several studies have&#xD;
      shown that TMS can reduce cue-elicited craving in smokers. Previous research by group has&#xD;
      shown that a single session of 15 minutes high frequency (10 Hz) repetitive TMS (rTMS) at&#xD;
      100% motor threshold over the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can reduce&#xD;
      cue-induced craving compared to sham TMS. However, the mechanism by which craving is reduced&#xD;
      by rTMS is poorly understood both at behavioral and neural levels. Neuroimaging studies in&#xD;
      nicotine dependence have revealed cue-related responses in numerous brain areas, including&#xD;
      frontal, parietal cortices and subcortical areas. Recently functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI) studies by the group have shown that cue-induced craving induced brain&#xD;
      activation in ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), including medial frontal, orbital&#xD;
      frontal and anterior cingulate. This Chair Research Development Fund (CRDF) pilot proposal&#xD;
      will integrate two new techniques- TMS and fMRI to investigate DLPFC-VMPFC pathway in&#xD;
      smokers. Using double-masked methods investigators hypothesize that cue-induced exposure will&#xD;
      induce brain activity in VMPFC, and 15 minutes rTMS over DLPFC will reduce cue-induced&#xD;
      craving through modulating DLPFC-VMPFC pathway (increased activity DLPFC and decreased&#xD;
      activity VMPFC).&#xD;

    <description>The sham TMS system will be connected to an electrical generator on a 9 V battery and electrodes will be placed over the prefrontal cortex. The regulator is triggered by the TMS machine to allow brief, microsecond, pulses of the electrical current through to the skin on the subjects' forehead. Electrical stimulation will be triggered by the TMS machine to correspond to the sham TMS pulses.</description>
