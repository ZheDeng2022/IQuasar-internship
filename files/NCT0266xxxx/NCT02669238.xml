  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a chronic relapsing disease characterized by the presence and proliferation&#xD;
      of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus. This is a serious disease, widespread,&#xD;
      difficult to live with for the patients, but also difficult to treat for practitioners who&#xD;
      take care of these patients. It affects 1.6% of the general population, but its incidence is&#xD;
      10 times higher (up 40%) in patients with infertility. It occurs mainly by complex chronic&#xD;
      pelvic pain and a negative influence on fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a disease whose complexity can be explained to four levels. Firstly, through its&#xD;
      extremely polymorphic character with intraperitoneal superficial forms, ovarian forms and&#xD;
      deep sub-peritoneal forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly by the plurality of the main symptoms which are individually non-specific and the&#xD;
      frequency and / or intensity is not correlated with the severity of the disease. This&#xD;
      non-specificity of symptoms partially explains the long lead misdiagnosis, which vary by 5 to&#xD;
      11 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirdly, by its prevalence which seems very high and largely underestimated. If its precise&#xD;
      estimate in the general population is so complicated, it seems very high in many studies of&#xD;
      patients supported surgically for gynecological reasons. These very large prevalence figures&#xD;
      are observed when some consultations support the hypothesis of a widespread and probably&#xD;
      insufficiently evaluated disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lately by its management, insufficiently amended, for which there is currently only a few&#xD;
      scientifically supported recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic pain caused by the disease associated with altered sexuality to a loss of fertility&#xD;
      significantly impacts the quality of life of patients.&#xD;

      Investigators propose a randomized trial comparing two medical alternatives: a continuous&#xD;
      monophasic type of estrogen-progestin oral treatment of second generation versus the&#xD;
      establishment of an etonogestrel contraceptive implant type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are excluded from this study certain absolute surgical indications. Patients, by consenting&#xD;
      to participate in the study, choose a medical care, which means not to be operated&#xD;
      immediately. They are clearly informed about the various possible treatment alternatives. The&#xD;
      benefits and risks of surgery and medical treatment they are explicitly presented. At any&#xD;
      time during the study, patients who wish may discuss again a surgical treatment with their&#xD;
      physician and stop the study drug if the decision of an intervention is taken.&#xD;
