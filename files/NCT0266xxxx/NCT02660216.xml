    <textblock>
      Nowadays, maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy is a safe and routinely performed procedure. The&#xD;
      conventional approach is characterized by a vestibular incision extending from&#xD;
      molar-to-molar, associated with a pterygomaxillary disjunction performed with a curved&#xD;
      chisel. Adequate mobilization of the maxilla during Le Fort I osteotomy requires an effective&#xD;
      separation of the maxillary tuberosity from the pterygoid plates of the sphenoid bone.&#xD;
      However, as initially described by Precious (1991) and later by Hernandez-Alfaro (2013), a&#xD;
      true pterygomaxillary osteotomy is not necessary to achieve successful disjunction.&#xD;
      Furthermore, Hernandez-Alfaro combined his technique of pterygomaxillary disjunction, the&#xD;
      so-called &quot;Twist technique&quot;, to a minimally invasive protocol, performing the complete Le&#xD;
      Fort I osteotomy through a 20 to 30 mm long horizontal vestibular incision. Although&#xD;
      promising, the technique remains highly sensitive from a technical standpoint, and its true&#xD;
      accuracy has not been comprehensively evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to present and validate a minimally invasive approach towards Le&#xD;
      Fort I osteotomy, using a modified pterygomaxillary (PTM) disjunction technique. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is to evaluate the accuracy of the technique using rigid voxel-based registration of&#xD;
      the 3D virtual treatment planning and the 4 weeks postoperative CBCT images. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include the surgical time necessary to complete the procedure and the presence of&#xD;
      intraoperative and early postoperative complications.&#xD;
