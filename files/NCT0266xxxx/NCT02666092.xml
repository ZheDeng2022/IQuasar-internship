  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anisakidae frequently infect fish species that are commonly eaten by humans. Some of them are&#xD;
      recognized as zoonotic diseases agents, and have a high impact on human health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infestation results from the ingestion of living larvae from contaminated fishes. It can be&#xD;
      asymptomatic or symptomatic, resulting in acute gastric, acute intestinal or chronic forms.&#xD;
      Allergic manifestations are frequently encountered in gastric forms, but allergic symptoms&#xD;
      can also occur in isolation, after ingestion of Anisakidae antigens contained in raw or&#xD;
      cooked fish, and may masquerade as fish allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aim to characterize the relationship between Anisakidae and/or fish&#xD;
      sensitization and the presence of allergic manifestations in patients recruited in the&#xD;
      general population and presenting fish allergy resulting from ingestion, cutaneous or&#xD;
      respiratory contact. We will also determine the respective role of Anisakidae or fish&#xD;
      sensitization in patients with fish allergy. Then, we will determine the prevalence of&#xD;
      previous Anisakidae infections among these patients and a matched control population. We will&#xD;
      also compare the performances of serological tests (ImmunoCAP, immunoelectrophoresis and&#xD;
      Western Blot) for the diagnosis of Anisakidae allergy or infection. Lastly, we will explore&#xD;
      the relationship between domestic exposure to Anisakidae or fish antigens and the occurrence&#xD;
      of associated pathologies (Anisakidae or fish allergy/sensitization; Anisakidae infection).&#xD;

      First, 51 patients with fish allergy will be recruited from the Parasitology-Mycology and&#xD;
      Immunology Laboratories of Lille University Hospital databases (serology for anti-Anisakis or&#xD;
      anti-fish detection). Then, clinical (characteristics of allergic manifestations) and&#xD;
      epidemiological (domestic exposure to fish) data will be collected, and anti-fish or&#xD;
      Anti-Anisakis antibodies will be detected using ImmunoCAP (IgE), or ImmunoCAP,&#xD;
      immunoelectrophoresis, Western Blot, respectively. Similar serological tests will be&#xD;
      performed for a control group of 51 matched subjects who will be recruited among Lille&#xD;
      University Hospital workers.&#xD;
