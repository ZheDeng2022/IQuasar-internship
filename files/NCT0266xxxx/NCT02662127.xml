  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous disease effects 25% of the population and most healthy people experience venous&#xD;
      symptoms after standing for too long. The prime function of leg veins is drainage. Failure&#xD;
      leads to a condition called chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) with leg pain, heaviness,&#xD;
      swelling, varicose veins, ankle skin changes, eczema and occasionally venous ulcers. The aim&#xD;
      of the study is to identify blood components (biomarkers) that occur during the damaging&#xD;
      phase of standing versus the healing phases of lying recovery and with medical compression&#xD;
      stockings. This will be achieved by taking a blood sample from the ankle region at 3 separate&#xD;
      visits (days) to the vascular laboratory at Ealing Hospital. The first visit will be after&#xD;
      supervised standing for 1 hour. The second after supervised lying and the third standing&#xD;
      whilst wearing a medical compression stocking. Healthy volunteers will be compared to&#xD;
      patients with advanced CVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential importance to patients and the public is threefold. Firstly, biomarker profiles&#xD;
      will be obtained in each of the 3 states to increase understanding in the cellular mechanisms&#xD;
      of damage and recovery. In this way &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good&quot; biomarkers can be identified. Secondly,&#xD;
      drug treatments may develop from this research to adjust biomarkers towards a favourable&#xD;
      profile. Thirdly, the success of treating CVI with surgery, venous intervention or&#xD;
      compression can be monitored. Whilst it is known that relief of gravitational stress is the&#xD;
      treatment for all forms of CVI, the mechanisms of repair and its discrimination from damage&#xD;
      have yet to be identified.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It is well known that graduated elastic compression stockings (GECs) provide a favourable&#xD;
      environment by off-setting the damaging effects of dependency, reducing leg oedema,&#xD;
      preventing leg ulceration and in symptom relief. On a haemodynamic level, their mechanism of&#xD;
      action in augmenting the venous return has been quantified. However, on a molecular level,&#xD;
      their action in modulating local endogenous biomarkers towards a favourable profile is poorly&#xD;
      understood. This requires further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that there are two types of biomarkers: (i) damaging inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers which are increased after prolonged gravitational dependency, (i) healing&#xD;
      reparative biomarkers which are increased after prolonged elevation recovery. Local venous&#xD;
      blood samples draining the area of investigation may be more representative of loco-regional&#xD;
      processes than systemic blood samples from the arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single centre, collaborative, interventional, controlled, proof-of-concept trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effect of GEC stockings on modulating&#xD;
      biomarkers towards a healing profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 4 study visits per subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment, patient selection, distribution of information leaflets and consent form,&#xD;
           explanation of the demands of the study, claiming of expenses, duplex scanning and visit&#xD;
           scheduling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Formal consent. Blood test. The stage of &quot;damage&quot; will be in the afternoon after&#xD;
           standing all morning plus an hour of extra standing in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood test. The stage of &quot;healing&quot; will be in the morning after nocturnal sleep plus an&#xD;
           hour of extra elevation (20 degrees elevated from supine) in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood test. The stage of &quot;treatment&quot; will be from the effects of a class II below knee&#xD;
           stocking after standing all morning plus an hour of extra standing in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All venous blood will be taken from the ankle region. The samples will be taken during a&#xD;
      gravitational stress, after elevation recovery and after the therapeutic effect of the&#xD;
      compression stocking. These specifications must be met with due care and diligence to ensure&#xD;
      that the results are meaningful. The samples will be collected in citrated tubes, centrifuged&#xD;
      at 5,000 rpm for 10 minutes to achieve platelet poor plasma and stored at -20 degrees for&#xD;
      batch analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed biomarkers for quantification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radox (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, VEGF, IFNγ, TNFα, IL-1α, IL-1β, MCP-1, EGF) and&#xD;
      D-dimer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-10, MMP-12 and&#xD;
      MMP-13) and also 4 tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3 and TIMP-4).&#xD;
