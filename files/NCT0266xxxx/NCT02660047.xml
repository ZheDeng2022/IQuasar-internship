  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among South Asians, in comparison to Western Europeans, there is an increased risk of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (DM2) and DM2-related cardiovascular disease. The effect of Liraglutide&#xD;
      (Victoza®) on cardiovascular function is therefore investigated in the DM2 patient group of&#xD;
      South Asian descent specifically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liraglutide is a new widely prescribed therapeutic agent for DM2 patients. It is a Glucagon&#xD;
      Like Peptide - 1 homologue that improves glucose homeostasis and reduces blood pressure and&#xD;
      body weight. The disadvantageous metabolic phenotype as seen in South Asians includes a&#xD;
      relatively large total fat mass, with predominately visceral relative to subcutaneous adipose&#xD;
      tissue and lower brown adipose tissue volume and activity, accompanied by increased lipid&#xD;
      levels. The key elements in the mechanism of action of Liraglutide seem to correspond to the&#xD;
      differences in metabolic profile between South Asians and Western Europeans. Diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction, an early finding of cardiovascular disease in DM2 and obesity and an independent&#xD;
      predictor of mortality, has been shown to be associated with the amount of triglyceride&#xD;
      accumulation in the heart and liver. The investigators hypothesize that Liraglutide has&#xD;
      direct advantageous cardiovascular effects and reduces triglyceride accumulation in&#xD;
      end-organs, specifically for DM2 patients of South Asian descent.&#xD;

      RECRUITMENT AND SCREENING PROCEDURE OF STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinics of the Leiden University Medical&#xD;
      Center, general practitioners, local hospitals and by advertisement. Patients own physicists&#xD;
      will be asked to point eligible patients to the opportunity of study participation. If&#xD;
      interested, patients will be informed by the principal investigator. The screening will&#xD;
      consist of a medical history, physical examination consisting of measurement of height, body&#xD;
      weight, heart rate, blood pressure and examination of thorax and abdomen. Furthermore&#xD;
      laboratory tests and rest-ECG will be performed. If the patient is eligible and willing to&#xD;
      participate in the study, and has signed the informed consent, the patient will be included.&#xD;
      Informed consent must be obtained before any trial related activities take place. After&#xD;
      inclusion in the study protocol, the patient's treating physician and general practitioner&#xD;
      will be notified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically relevant differences and standard deviations of two studies were chosen to&#xD;
      generate data for the sample size calculation. The data we used to incorporate the precision&#xD;
      of MRI assessment of cardiac function was generated by a study performed by our group with&#xD;
      pioglitazone vs metformin on cardiac function parameters. To estimate the effect of GLP-1&#xD;
      therapy on cardiac function, we only have data of a pilot study with eight DM2 patients with&#xD;
      heart failure. With a power of 90% and alfa = 0.05, groups varying from 9 to 17 patients will&#xD;
      be needed. In a comparable trial the drop-out rate was 10%. Taken into consideration that the&#xD;
      population studied will have a significant better systolic function than the heart failure&#xD;
      patients studied by Sokos et al, differences may be smaller. In conclusion, investigators&#xD;
      estimate to be able to detect a clinically relevant, significant result with 90% power and&#xD;
      alfa = 0.05 with 25 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      USE OF CO-INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should continue to use the oral glucose lowering medicaments during the study. For&#xD;
      glycaemic control after initiation of the study drug, the current clinical guideline will be&#xD;
      followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycaemic management during study the will be performed as described in appendix 1. To avoid&#xD;
      the potential risk of hypoglycaemia, a rigorous monitoring and therapy adjustment schedule&#xD;
      will be applied, which will prevent risk of hypoglycemia to a great extent. In addition,&#xD;
      patients will be instructed how to recognize and manage a hypo or hyperglycaemic episode.&#xD;
      Appropriate individualized adjustments will be made in the unlikely case of a hypo or&#xD;
      hyperglycaemic episode. Routine self-measurement of blood glucose by the study participants&#xD;
      will be performed once a week. In addition, patients with insulin will be instructed to&#xD;
      perform routine self-measurement of blood glucose more frequently when study medication and /&#xD;
      or insulin dosage is titrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore patients are asked not to change their diet or level of physical activity during&#xD;
      the study period and adequate contraception is obligatory for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION, BLINDING AND TREATMENT ALLOCATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the medical screening and mutual agreement of participation in the study, patients will&#xD;
      be randomized by block randomization, stratified 1:1 for gender and insulin use. A&#xD;
      randomization schedule will be prepared by the research pharmacist who is employee at the&#xD;
      Department of Clinical Pharmacy. Coded and sealed envelopes for each participant will be kept&#xD;
      at the department of Radiology. In case of safety issues, the sealed envelopes are readily&#xD;
      available to the principal investigator and project leader. In case of a serious adverse&#xD;
      event - or a medical emergency requiring knowledge of the study medication - the&#xD;
      randomization code will be broken. In order to ensure that in medical emergencies, the study&#xD;
      participation of the patient is apparent, each patient will receive a patient file in the&#xD;
      electronic patient registry. In this personal file, the study number of the patient including&#xD;
      the procedure for deblinding and notification of the investigators will be mentioned. When&#xD;
      the whole study is completed the randomization list will be provided to the principle&#xD;
      investigator by the pharmacist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal of individual subjects: Patients can leave the study at any time for any reason if&#xD;
      they wish to do so without any consequences. The responsible investigator can also withdraw a&#xD;
      subject if continuing participation is in his opinion deleterious for the subject's&#xD;
      wellbeing. Patients can also be withdrawn in case of protocol violations and non-compliance.&#xD;
      When a subject withdraws from the study, a medical examination will be performed. In case of&#xD;
      withdrawal because of a severe or serious adverse event, appropriate laboratory tests or&#xD;
      other special examinations will be performed. Finally patients can be withdrawn from study&#xD;
      participation if an incidental finding at the MRI examination - for example a malignancy -&#xD;
      influences the ratio of justification versus risks / benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific criteria for withdrawal: not applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      Replacement of individual subjects after withdrawal: Patients will not be replaced after&#xD;
      withdrawal, after the first dose of study medication. However, patients may be replaced when&#xD;
      withdrawal took place between randomization and administration of the first dose of study&#xD;
      medication (for example withdrawal on the first study day due to claustrophobia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of subjects withdrawn from treatment: Follow-up of patients after withdrawal will&#xD;
      be done by the treating physicist (general practitioner in most cases). Immediately after&#xD;
      study withdrawal, the treating physicist will be updated on the patient's condition and&#xD;
      laboratory results and whether the patient was in the control group or intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premature termination of the study: In case of the incidence of three serious adverse events,&#xD;
      the study will be terminated prematurely and an independent committee will be asked to&#xD;
      investigate the safety of the trial. Furthermore, the investigators will prematurely&#xD;
      terminate the study when the number of subjects withdrawn from the study exceeds the number&#xD;
      used for sample size calculation, i.e. 16 individuals in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADVERSE EVENTS, SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS and SUSPECTED UNEXPECTED SERIOUS ADVERSE REACTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events are defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during a&#xD;
      clinical trial, whether or not considered related to the used medication or the infused&#xD;
      drugs. All adverse events reported spontaneously by the subject or observed by the&#xD;
      investigator or his/her staff will be recorded on the adverse event data collection form. The&#xD;
      intensity of these adverse events will be graded by the investigator as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild: Discomfort noted but no disruption of normal daily activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe: Inability to work or perform daily activity All adverse events will be actively&#xD;
           queried by asking the question: &quot;Have you had any complaints since the last time we&#xD;
           talked/met?&quot; at all visits. All adverse events will be followed until they have abated,&#xD;
           or until a stable situation has been reached. Depending on the event, follow up may&#xD;
           require additional tests or medical procedures as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chronicity of the event will be classified by the investigator on a three-item scale as&#xD;
      defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single occasion: Single event with limited duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intermittent Several episodes of an event, each of limited duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persistent: Event that remains indefinitely&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each adverse event, the relationship to the used medication or infused drug (definite,&#xD;
      probable, possible, unknown, definitively not) as judged by the investigator, will be&#xD;
      recorded, as well as any actions undertaken in relation to the adverse event, will be&#xD;
      recorded. The occurrence of an adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, disabling or&#xD;
      requires in-patient hospitalization, or causes congenital anomaly, will be described&#xD;
      according to CHMP guidelines as (suspected) &quot;serious&quot; adverse events and will be notified in&#xD;
      writing to the Medical Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators will copy Novo Nordisk when expediting SARs and SUSARs to&#xD;
      competent authorities and will report all SARs related to Novo Nordisk product to Novo&#xD;
      Nordisk. The submission to Novo Nordisk must however be within day 15 from the investigator&#xD;
      getting knowledge about a valid case no matter local timelines for reporting to the&#xD;
      authorities. All pregnancies in trial patients occurring during use of a Novo Nordisk product&#xD;
      must be reported to Novo Nordisk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events (SAEs):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in death;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is life threatening (at the time of the event);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing inpatients' hospitalization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is a congenital anomaly or birth defect;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or&#xD;
           require hospitalization, may be considered a serious adverse experience when, based upon&#xD;
           appropriate medical judgement, the event may jeopardize the subject or may require an&#xD;
           intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will report the SAEs to the accredited METC that approved the protocol, within 15&#xD;
      days after the sponsor has first knowledge of the serious adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAEs that result in death or are life threatening should be reported expedited. The expedited&#xD;
      reporting will occur not later than 7 days after the responsible investigator has first&#xD;
      knowledge of the adverse reaction. This is for a preliminary report with another 8 days for&#xD;
      completion of the report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unexpected adverse reactions are SUSARs if the following three conditions are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the event must be serious&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. there must be a certain degree of probability that the event is a harmful and an -&#xD;
           undesirable reaction to the medicinal product under investigation, regardless of the&#xD;
           administered dose;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the adverse reaction must be unexpected, that is to say, the nature and severity of the&#xD;
           adverse reaction are not in agreement with the product information as recorded in:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for an authorized medicinal product;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Investigator's Brochure for an unauthorized medicinal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will report expedited all SUSARs to the competent authorities in other Member&#xD;
      States, according to the requirements of the Member States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expedited reporting will occur not later than 15 days after the sponsor has first&#xD;
      knowledge of the adverse reactions. For fatal or life threatening cases the term will be&#xD;
      maximal 7 days for a preliminary report with another 8 days for completion of the report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAEs need to be reported till end of study within the Netherlands, as defined in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary study parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study endpoints will be analyzed according to intention-to-treat principles. All endpoint&#xD;
      parameters are continuous variables. Data will be calculated as mean SD, median (percentile&#xD;
      range) according to nature and distribution of the variable. Within group changes from&#xD;
      baseline will be tested with independent paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Between&#xD;
      group differences will be compared after 26 weeks between Liraglutide and control. Analysis&#xD;
      will be performed with SPSS. A 2-sided significance level of p &lt; 0.05 will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGULATION STATEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted according to the principles of the &quot;Declaration of Helsinki&quot; (as&#xD;
      amended in Tokyo, Venice and Hong Kong, Somerset West and Edinburgh) and in accordance with&#xD;
      the Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95 - 17th July 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS, MONITORING AND PUBLICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling and storage of data and documents:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants are provided a study name of the letter &quot;MAVI&quot; followed by the number of&#xD;
      enrolment (1-50). The study name is coupled to a randomly chosen seven - digit study number.&#xD;
      The study number will be used to register the participant in the Electronic Patient Registry&#xD;
      of the LUMC. This file will be used as the general patient record, as well as collection of&#xD;
      routine laboratory measurements needed for clinical and study treatment. The MRI images will&#xD;
      be filed under this registry so that anonymity will be safeguarded. The subject&#xD;
      identification code list will be stored by the principal investigator and will only be&#xD;
      accessible by the principal investigator and project leader. The data extracted from the&#xD;
      study file in the Electronic Patient Registry and from the MRI images will be saved in an&#xD;
      SPSS file. From this file the true identity of the study participants can not be discovered.&#xD;
      The data will be stored for fifteen years. The blood samples will be frozen and stored&#xD;
      anonymously using the above mentioned study name and study number. For ad hoc laboratory&#xD;
      tests of inflammatory, endocrine and other biomarkers, blood samples will be kept for a&#xD;
      maximum period of three years. The blood samples are solely accessible by the investigator&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure that in medical emergencies, the study participation of the patient is&#xD;
      apparent, each patient will receive a patient file in the electronic patient registry. In&#xD;
      this personal file, the investigator will mention the study number of the patient including&#xD;
      the procedure for de-blinding and notification of the investigators. In this file, the signed&#xD;
      Informed Consent form of the patient will be stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Public disclosure and publication policy: The data analysis will be performed by the&#xD;
      investigators. Novo Nordisk has no role in data analysis and / or publication of the results&#xD;
      of the trial in peer reviewed papers. The results of the study will be submitted to peer&#xD;
      reviewed papers, also in case the hypothesis has not been proven.&#xD;
