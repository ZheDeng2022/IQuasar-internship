      INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE CIN Cervical dysplasia is caused by HPV and most common in women&#xD;
      of reproductive age. Cervical dysplasia is known to be a precancerous stage of cervical&#xD;
      cancer, where cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer worldwide in women. Treatment&#xD;
      of moderate to severe dysplasia is often still surgical and aimed at eliminating the affected&#xD;
      part of the transformation zone. There are different type of surgical treatments (Large Loop&#xD;
      excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ), knife cone biopsy, laser conisation), which have&#xD;
      around 90% success rate. Historically moderate and severe dysplasia were treated with cold&#xD;
      knife biopsy. Nevertheless, with deep cones hemorrhage, infection and postprocedure stenosis&#xD;
      were reported. LLETZ seems to be a good alternative. It can be performed under local&#xD;
      anesthesia, is cheaper, less painful and seem to have less short and long term morbidity. In&#xD;
      outcome LETTZ has a similar risk in residual disease compared to cold knife cone. LLETZ is&#xD;
      therefore the golden standard for treating cervical dysplasia nowadays. Still, there is&#xD;
      uncertainty about the effects of LLETZ on short and long term in terms of recurrence,&#xD;
      fertility and future pregnancy outcomes. Women diagnosed with CIN are usually at their&#xD;
      reproductive age, so effects on future fertility and pregnancy are a concern. Women with a&#xD;
      shorter time interval from LLETZ to pregnancy seem to have an increased risk for spontaneous&#xD;
      abortion[6]. Also there is contradicting evidence on the presumed higher risk on preterm&#xD;
      delivery and low birth weight. One study reported a 10 fold higher risk for preterm&#xD;
      deliveries after more than one conisation procedure in women with cervical dysplasia.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a recent study showed a higher subfertility rate with patients who underwent&#xD;
      cervical surgery. Systematic review and meta-analysis reported on LLETZ for CIN also showed&#xD;
      an increased rate of preterm delivery (&lt;32wks RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.31-2.98; &lt;28wks RR 2.33, 95%&#xD;
      CI 1.84-2.94), premature rupture of the membranes (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.54-2.29) and low birth&#xD;
      weight (&lt;2,500g RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.75-3.51) Apart from reproductive arguments there is an&#xD;
      ongoing debate about the longterm outcome after treatment with surgical excision. Several&#xD;
      studies show a recurrence rate of CIN 2-3 after treatment of 15-22 % within 2 years. Margin&#xD;
      involvement seemed to be a risk factor for developing residual or recurrent cervical&#xD;
      dysplasia Moreover, even after adequate treatment and follow up with normal smear results,&#xD;
      patients who were treated for cervical intraepithelial dysplasia seem to have an excessive&#xD;
      risk of cervical cancer compared to patients with normal primary smear test results. This&#xD;
      risk is even almost 25 times higher in patients with abnormal smear test results than in&#xD;
      patients with normal smear test results after treatment. Recent studies found that most women&#xD;
      with residual or recurrent disease test positive for HPV after treatment. Possibly this could&#xD;
      be a tool for risk stratification in the follow up after treatment. Also, this could raise&#xD;
      the question if there is a need to treat HPV instead of treating the consequences of HPV&#xD;
      (removing the transformation zone). Especially in patients with recurrent or residual&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence for the involvement of Human Papilloma Virus in CIN Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is&#xD;
      the cause of pre-cancerous abnormalities of the cervix. HPV has over 100 subtypes and is&#xD;
      present in over 95% of pre-invasive and invasive squamous carcinomas of the cervix. Some&#xD;
      researchers state that HPV negative cervical cancer does not exist. Certain serotypes are&#xD;
      associated with a high risk for progression to malignancy and more often found in cervical&#xD;
      cancer. This are HPV type 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52, and 58.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that earlier detection of high stage CIN lesions (CIN 3) will be&#xD;
      accomplished by screening with HPV DNA tests other than cytology alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale Approximately 90% of the HPV is cleared after surgical treatment. Nonetheless,&#xD;
      surgical treatment often deals more with the consequences instead of the cause of the&#xD;
      disease. There is still a significant amount of women who will develop residual or recurrent&#xD;
      disease. Recent publications show a higher risk of invasive cancer after treatment for&#xD;
      cervical neoplasia grade 3 in comparison to the general population. Rebolj reported an&#xD;
      incidence of 35,1 per 100000 years and 6,4 per 100000 years, respectively, led to an adjusted&#xD;
      hazard ratio of 4,2 for periods after completed follow-up compared with periods after normal&#xD;
      primary smear test results. Strander et al, showed an overall standardised incidence ratio&#xD;
      for women with previous CIN grade 3 of 2,30 to develop invasive cervical carcinoma compared&#xD;
      to the general population. Over time, there is a request for non-invasive treatment which&#xD;
      treats HPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young girls are vaccinated against HPV 16 and 18 nowadays. The current analysis show efficacy&#xD;
      of almost 93% against CIN 2+associated with HPV-16/18 who had no evidence of oncogenic HPV&#xD;
      infection on baseline. However only a 30% efficacy was seen against CIN2+ irrespective of HPV&#xD;
      type in all women and 70% in the group who had no evidence of oncogenic HPV infection on&#xD;
      baseline. For CIN3+ these numbers are 33% in the whole group and 87% in the HPV negative&#xD;
      group. Vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ associated with 12 nonvaccine oncogenic types was 54%.&#xD;
      Another problem is the vaccination uptake along young women. Since the reality is still that&#xD;
      many women could or would not get vaccinated, primary prevention of HPV related diseases&#xD;
      still has a long way to go.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This is a randomized, single blinded, non-inferiority study in female patients&#xD;
      with histologically recurrent/residual CIN of reproductive age after previous ablative&#xD;
      treatment to evaluate the clinical and immunological effects of imiquimod. The estimated&#xD;
      duration of the total study is 24 months, where a total of 433 patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into one of two study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment with Imiquimod. Patients in this group will be treated with Imiquimod 5% for a&#xD;
           total of 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. LLETZ treatment (the standard treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
           STUDY POPULATION Population Inclusion of patients will take place in the Erasmus Medical&#xD;
           Center Rotterdam, Meander hospital in Amersfoort, Albert Schweitzer Hospital in&#xD;
           Dordrecht, Sint Franciscus hospital in Rotterdam, Catharina hospital in Eindhoven and&#xD;
           Maastricht University Medical Centre and other hospitals in the Netherlands in the&#xD;
           future. Patients will be drawn from colposcopy consultations. After qualifying for study&#xD;
           participation based on pre-study procedures, patients will be randomized to receive&#xD;
           either Imiquimod 5% cream or LLETZ (the standard treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size calculation The regression rate of a second LLETZ procedure is estimated 63%&#xD;
           in a retrospective cohort (data not published). The regression rate of CIN lesions after&#xD;
           treatment with imiquimod was based upon the only study reporting on the regression rate&#xD;
           after 16 weeks of imiquimod therapy of CIN. This study showed a regression rate of 73%&#xD;
           in patients with primary CIN lesions. Since the effect could be lower in patients with&#xD;
           residual or persistent CIN, we estimated the regression rate to be 60%. To calculate the&#xD;
           required sample size in this two-proportions non-inferiority trial we assume that the&#xD;
           probability of regression is 63% for the standard (LLETZ procedure) while it is 60%&#xD;
           after treatment with imiquimod.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Using a non-inferiority margin of 10% for the difference in proportions and a&#xD;
           significance level (alpha) of 5%, a sample size of 174 per group is required to obtain a&#xD;
           power of at least 80%. Allowing for 20% loss to follow-up the total required sample size&#xD;
           is 433. [Chapter 4: Sample size calculations in clinical research (2nd edn). Shein-Chung&#xD;
           Chow, Jun Shao and Hansheng Wang, Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC, Boca Raton, FL, 2008 ] Because the&#xD;
           uncertainty in the assumptions an interim analysis for futility will be performed by the&#xD;
           DMC as soon as the primary outcome is available for 35 patients. This interim analysis&#xD;
           is based on predictive power. That is the predicted probability of being able to prove&#xD;
           non-inferiority given the results at the interim analysis. When the predictive power at&#xD;
           this point is below 20% the trial will be stopped due to futility. Of course the DMC can&#xD;
           always stop the trial due to safety concerns. The trial will never be stopped&#xD;
           prematurely for efficacy so no alpha-adjustment is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Description and justification of route of administration and dosage Imiquimod 5% cream&#xD;
           will be administered in a vaginal applicator, containing 12,5 mg of Imiquimod (one&#xD;
           sachet). The cream will be administrated three times per week before going to bed by the&#xD;
           patients themselves. In case of uncomfortable reactions the application can be reduced&#xD;
           twice or ones per week if side effects persist. When local side effects persist&#xD;
           medication can be discontinued for one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following treatment protocol will be applied:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Treatment period for 16 weeks, in which 3 doses of 1 sachet (12,5 mg Imiquimod) will&#xD;
           be applied three times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Preparation and labelling of Investigational Medicinal Product The organization of the&#xD;
           preparation and labelling of imiquimod crème will be organized by the pharmacist of the&#xD;
           Erasmus Medical Center. Preparation and labelling of the investigational medicinal&#xD;
           products will be done according to the relevant GMP guidelines. The labels will be in&#xD;
           Dutch for the Dutch centers. (according to the CCMO rules). Distribution and labelling&#xD;
           of the study medication will be organized by the pharmacist of the Erasmus Medical&#xD;
           Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
           METHODS Randomisation, blinding and treatment allocation After signing the consent form,&#xD;
           the patient will be randomized with the use of a computer program, in order to conceal&#xD;
           the treatment allocation. Both doctor and patient will not know before randomization&#xD;
           what treatment the patient will be allocated to. Study medication will be randomized&#xD;
           according to a 1:1 ratio, such that there is 1 patient assigned to imiquimod for every&#xD;
           patient on LLETZ. Randomisation will be performed in variable blocks. The study is&#xD;
           single-blinded, which means only the pathologist will not be informed of the outcome&#xD;
           randomization. Analysis will take place in intention-to-treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study procedures Week 0 for all patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following procedures must be undertaken:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Informed consent signed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assigning a study number&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Confirmation of the in- and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collect demographic data&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Relevant medical and surgical history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality of life questionnaire will be handed out&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urine pregnancy test if necessary. Contraception will be discussed and prescribed&#xD;
                if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dispense study medication and instruct the patient how to apply the imiquimod cream&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients are randomized into one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
                -- Intervention group (12,5 mg imiquimod three times per week during 16 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
                -- Standard treatment, consisting of LLETZ or CKC.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Make a new appointment for week 2 for the patients in the Imiquimod group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Make a new appointment for LLETZ treatment in the LLETZ group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Week 1, 2, 6,10, 11 and 12 for patients in the Imiquimod group&#xD;
&#xD;
           After 1 week and 11 weeks there will be a telephone consultation. In this consultation&#xD;
           the side effects, as experienced by patients, will be documented. After 2, 6, 10 and 12&#xD;
           weeks of treatment (+/-2 days) a study visit will be conducted. The following procedures&#xD;
           must be undertaken:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ascertain whether the patient has experienced any adverse events since the previous&#xD;
                visit. This will be documented according to the Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
                Adverse Events guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ascertain whether the patient has used any concomitant medication or has any change&#xD;
                in the concomitant medication&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collect and review the patient diary card to monitor compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At week 10 colposcopic examination (and biopsy if suspicion of invasive disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dispense study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If necessary lower the imiquimod dose&#xD;
&#xD;
           Week 0-1 In the LLETZ group: an appointment to perform the surgical procedure. After the&#xD;
           procedure, follow up will be according to the dutch guidelines. This means cervical&#xD;
           smears at 6, 12 and 24 months after the treatment with determination of HPV. If the&#xD;
           patient has a PAP 2 or more or is carrying a high risk HPV during follow up, a&#xD;
           colposcopy with biopsies will be performed to determine the CIN classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Week 16 for patients in the Imiquimod group After 16 weeks of treatment (+/- 2 days) the&#xD;
           fifth study visit will be conducted. The following procedures must be undertaken: -&#xD;
           Ascertain whether the patient has experienced any adverse events since the previous&#xD;
           visit by asking generally about patients health&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ascertain whether the patient has used any concomitant medication or has any change&#xD;
                in the concomitant medication&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collect and review the patient diary card to monitor compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collect study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Make a new appointment for week 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Week 26 After 26 weeks (+/- days) the sixth study visit for the imiquimod group and will&#xD;
           be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following procedures must be undertaken:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the Imiquimod group&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Ascertain whether the patient has experienced any adverse events since the previous&#xD;
           visit according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Ascertain whether the patient has used any concomitant medication or has any change in&#xD;
           the concomitant medication&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Colposcopic examination and biopsy for histology in the Imiquimod group&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Surgical treatment will be performed in case of progression or stabilization of&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There will be a conservative treatment with follow up of cervical smears in cases of&#xD;
           regression of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Quality of life questionnaire will be handed out.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Cervix cytology and HPV typing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Make a new appointment for month 6 of follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
           Month 6 after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
           After 6 months the following procedures must be undertaken:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cervix smears and HPV determination&#xD;
&#xD;
           Month 12 after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
           After 12 months the following procedures must be undertaken:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cervix smears and HPV determination&#xD;
&#xD;
           Month 24 after treatment After 12 months the final study visit will be conducted. The&#xD;
           following procedures must be undertaken: - Cervical smears and HPV determination -&#xD;
           Informed consent for retrieving information about outcome of cervical cytology or HPV&#xD;
           testing from national prevention approximately 5 years after treatment. This information&#xD;
           will be retrieved from the national databank, general practitioner or patient itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A biopsy of the cervix has been taken within 3 months prior of the start of the trial,&#xD;
           together with a frozen tissue for HPV typing. Patients with a histologically proven CIN&#xD;
           2 and CIN 3 or persistent CIN 1 after previous treatment will be informed of the study&#xD;
           and given written information about it. When assessed for eligibility the patient will&#xD;
           be asked to give written informed consent to inclusion in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Every visit, a questionnaire will be filled in to evaluate symptoms and adverse events.&#xD;
           Side effects and adverse events will be documented according to Common Terminology&#xD;
           Criteria for Adverse Events guidelines during the checkups. Patients are also instructed&#xD;
           to report adverse events immediately and visit the hospital if necessary. Diary card&#xD;
           completion and dosing procedures will be reviewed at all treatment visits. Clinically&#xD;
           significant abnormalities associated with adverse events will be followed. Because of&#xD;
           unknown possible effects of imiquimod treatment, it is necessary to exclude pregnancy&#xD;
           before enrolment in to the study. Moreover, contraception will be advised during the&#xD;
           treatment period because of the unknown effects of Imiquimod during pregnancy. Many&#xD;
           CIN-patients are also diagnosed with VIN and VAIN lesions, so at colposcopy also the&#xD;
           vagina and vulva will be inspected and if necessary, taken biopsies. At 26 weeks (ten&#xD;
           weeks after the treatment period) a biopsy will be taken of the area of the cervical&#xD;
           lesion judged most abnormal and a HPV DNA assay will be conducted. Also cytology will be&#xD;
           taken. If the classification of CIN is increased or stabilised, LLETZ will be performed.&#xD;
           Patients with PAP 3B or more at cytology and colposcopic suspicion of CIN1 or less will&#xD;
           also be treated with LLETZ to rule out invasive disease of another location than the&#xD;
           biopsy taken. Patients with regression of the CIN classification of the lesion (with&#xD;
           cytology PAP3A or less) will be treated conservative and will be followed up in the same&#xD;
           schedule as patients after LLETZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At 6 and 18 months after finishing treatment cytology will be taken as follow-up. When&#xD;
           there is cytology is abnormal a colposcopy will be performed. When recurrence of CIN 2&#xD;
           or 3 or invasive disease is suspected at another biopsy will be taken. Further treatment&#xD;
           will be according to the expertise of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To evaluate the quality of life the following questionnaires will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey (RAND 36), to access&#xD;
           generic health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality-of-life&#xD;
           questionnaire: QLQ-C30, to assess cancer-specific health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality-of-life&#xD;
           questionnaire: QLQ-CX24, to assess cervical specific quality of life, including sexual&#xD;
           functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient withdrawal or discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following treatment initiation, each patient's trial participation will end when one of&#xD;
           the following occurs:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient has completed all study procedures including 16 weeks of treatment, and&#xD;
                follow-up visit at 26 weeks, 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient discontinues study participation prior to completion of all study&#xD;
                procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients may withdraw themselves from the study at any time, or be withdrawn by the&#xD;
           investigator, without prejudice to their future medical care. The investigator can&#xD;
           decide to withdraw a subject from the study for urgent medical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific criteria for withdrawal Patients who become pregnant during the study will be&#xD;
           immediately discontinued from further study participation and will complete all&#xD;
           withdrawal procedure prior to discontinuation. The investigator will record the reason&#xD;
           for withdrawal and the date of such occurrence on the patient status record.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Replacement of individual subjects after withdrawal Withdrawn individuals will not be&#xD;
           replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-up of subjects withdrawn from treatment If a patient discontinues the study due&#xD;
           to an adverse event or laboratory abnormality, the investigator will follow the patient&#xD;
           until the adverse event has resolved or reached a stable condition. In any case of&#xD;
           withdrawal the patients will be offered the treatment of recurrent/residual CIN which&#xD;
           will be advised by the treating physician of the patient. They will be followed up by&#xD;
           the current guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Premature termination of the study If any unexpected severe side effects occur, the&#xD;
           study will be prematurely terminated after advise of the DMSB. The METC will be&#xD;
           informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SAFETY REPORTING Section 10 WMO event In accordance to section 10, subsection 1, of the&#xD;
           WMO, the investigator will inform the subjects and the reviewing accredited METC if&#xD;
           anything occurs, on the basis of which it appears that the disadvantages of&#xD;
           participation may be significantly greater than was foreseen in the research proposal.&#xD;
           The study will then be suspended pending further review by the accredited Ethical Board,&#xD;
           except insofar as suspension would jeopardise the subjects' health. The investigator&#xD;
           will take care that all subjects are kept informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse and serious adverse events Adverse events (AEs) are defined as any undesirable&#xD;
           experience occurring to a subject during a clinical trial, whether or not considered&#xD;
           related to the investigational drug. All adverse events reported spontaneously by the&#xD;
           subject or observed by the investigator or his staff will be recorded. A Serious Adverse&#xD;
           Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose&#xD;
&#xD;
           - results in death;&#xD;
&#xD;
           - is life threatening (at the time of the event);&#xD;
&#xD;
           - requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing inpatients' hospitalisation;&#xD;
&#xD;
           - results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;&#xD;
&#xD;
           - is a congenital anomaly or birth defect;&#xD;
&#xD;
           - is a new event of the trial likely to affect the safety of the subjects, such as an&#xD;
           unexpected outcome of an adverse reaction, lack of efficacy of an IMP used for the&#xD;
           treatment of a life threatening disease, major safety finding from a newly completed&#xD;
           animal study, etc. All SAEs will be reported to the accredited METC that approved the&#xD;
           protocol, according to the requirements of that METC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) Adverse reactions are all&#xD;
           untoward and unintended responses to an investigational product related to any dose&#xD;
           administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Unexpected adverse reactions are SUSARs if the following three conditions are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. the event must be serious. 2. There must be a certain degree of probability that the event&#xD;
      is harmful and an undesirable reaction to the medicinal product under investigation,&#xD;
      regardless of the administered dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. The adverse reaction must be unexpected, that is to say, the nature and the severity of&#xD;
      the adverse reaction are not in agreement with the product information as recorded in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -- Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for an authorised medicinal product;&#xD;
&#xD;
      -- Investigator's Brochure for an unauthorised medicinal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will report expedited the following SUSARs to the METC:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SUSARs that have arisen in the clinical trial that was assessed by the METC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SUSARs that have arisen in other clinical trial of the same sponsor and with the same&#xD;
           medicinal product, and that could have consequences for the safety of the subjects&#xD;
           involved in the clinical trial that was assessed by the METC. The remaining SUSARs are&#xD;
           recorded in an overview list (line-listing) that will be submitted once every half year&#xD;
           to the METC. This line-listing provides an overview of all SUSARs from the study&#xD;
           medicine, accompanied by a brief report highlighting the main points of concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will report expedited all SUSARs to the competent authority, the Medicine&#xD;
      Evaluation Board and the competent authorities in other Member States. The expedited&#xD;
      reporting will occur not later than 15 days after the sponsor has first knowledge of the&#xD;
      adverse reactions. For fatal or life threatening cases the term will be maximal 7 days for a&#xD;
      preliminary report with another 8 days for completion of the report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annual safety report&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the expedited reporting of SUSARs, the sponsor will submit, once a year&#xD;
      throughout the clinical trial, a safety report to the accredited METC, competent authority,&#xD;
      Medicine Evaluation Board and competent authorities of the concerned Member States. This&#xD;
      safety report consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a list of all suspected (unexpected or expected) serious adverse reactions, along with&#xD;
           an aggregated summary table of all reported serious adverse reactions, ordered by organ&#xD;
           system, per study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a report concerning the safety of the subjects, consisting of a complete safety analysis&#xD;
           and an evaluation of the balance between the efficacy and the harmfulness of the&#xD;
           medicine under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of adverse events All adverse events will be followed until they have abated, or&#xD;
      until a stable situation has been reached. Depending on the event, follow up may require&#xD;
      additional tests or medical procedures as indicated, and/or referral to the general physician&#xD;
      or a medical specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Statistical analysis is performed with SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) for&#xD;
      the individual features studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study parameter Analysis will be done according to the non-inferiority principle to&#xD;
      show that imiquimod is not worse than an existing treatment (LLETZ). To investigate efficacy&#xD;
      we will perform a perprotocol analysis (although this is not the primary outcome of the&#xD;
      study). The primary outcome is the difference between the probability of regression in the&#xD;
      LLETZ and the imiquimod arms. The expected difference (LLETZ-imiquimod) will be calculated&#xD;
      together with the 95% Aggresti confidence interval. If the upper bound of the interval lies&#xD;
      below the noninferiority margin of 10% non-inferiority of the imiquimod treatment is assumed&#xD;
      to be proved. Logistic analysis of potential confounders (age at diagnosis, CIN grade, number&#xD;
      of previous treatments, smoking, HPV- subtype) will be performed. Withdrawn subjects will not&#xD;
      be replaced. Analysis will be based on intention to treat protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulation statement This study will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP),&#xD;
      the Declaration of Helsinki (version 2004) and in accordance with the Medical Research&#xD;
      Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO). The study will only be undertaken when fully approval of&#xD;
      the protocol and patient information and consent form has been obtained from the appropriate&#xD;
      Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and consent Recruitment Inclusion of patients will take place at the Erasmus&#xD;
      Medical Center in Rotterdam, Meander Hospital in Amersfoort and Albert Schweitzer Hospital in&#xD;
      Dordrecht. More hospitals can participate if they perform colposcopy and LLETZ in their&#xD;
      center. Patients will be informed of the study after diagnosed with cervical dysplasia grade&#xD;
      2-3 proved by biopsy. They will receive the patient information and an informed consent form.&#xD;
      On the outpatient clinic patients will be granted time to ask questions about the procedures.&#xD;
      During this visit all procedures are explained and patients will be asked if they are willing&#xD;
      to participate in the study. The patient will take written information home and will receive&#xD;
      a next appointment to ask questions and to sign the inform consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent Prior to entering the study, the investigator will explain to each patient,&#xD;
      the nature of the study, its purpose, procedures, expected duration, alternative therapy&#xD;
      available, and the benefits and risks involved in study participation. Each patient will be&#xD;
      informed of her right to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice. After this&#xD;
      explanation and before any study-specific procedures have been performed, the patient, as&#xD;
      well as the investigator, will voluntarily sign and date an informed consent statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits and risks assessment, group relatedness The possible benefit for the participating&#xD;
      subject may be an effective treatment of their disease, which can lead to a complete clinical&#xD;
      response of CIN and a total clearance of HPV. In contrast to surgical treatments (e.g. local&#xD;
      excision) this treatment targets the cause of CIN, namely hrHPV. This may lead to a lower&#xD;
      recurrence rate. Furthermore, the treatment is noninvasive and leaves the anatomy intact.&#xD;
      Second, other HPV related disease like VAIN could be treated as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk and burden are linked to protocol procedures, such as biopsy sampling. Although these&#xD;
      are routine procedures, carried out by medical qualified personnel, they may cause side&#xD;
      effects or discomfort to the subject. However, it is expected that these procedures will&#xD;
      generally be well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, since teratogenous effects of imiquimod are unknown, it is recommended that&#xD;
      patients use adequate contraceptives during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS AND PUBLICATION Handling and storage of data and documents Subject&#xD;
      numbers will be assigned sequentially to subjects enrolled in the study. All data collected&#xD;
      in this research protocol will be treated confidential and identified with the subject number&#xD;
      not with the subjects name or address. A safety physician safeguards the investigational code&#xD;
      All biopsies and serum samples will be stored in a secure location and will be kept for 15&#xD;
      years. All study records will also be archived in a safe and secure location. To verify the&#xD;
      accuracy of the data, study records will be available to the representatives of the Dutch&#xD;
      government (e.g. Inspection of Public Health) and members of the Ethical Board committee are&#xD;
      allowed to inspect the quality of the accomplished research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and quality assurance The study was determined by the medical committee and&#xD;
      through the medical plan of Erasmus medical center, as a study with a negligible risk.&#xD;
      Determination of the risk analysis is enclosed. Monitoring will be done according to the&#xD;
      current guidelines of the Erasmus Medical Center. For studies with a negligible risk, and&#xD;
      annual visit will be performed by an external monitoring board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendments Amendments are changes made to the research after a favourable opinion by the&#xD;
      accredited METC has been given. All amendments will be notified to the METC that gave a&#xD;
      favourable opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 'substantial amendment' is defined as an amendment to the terms of the METC application, or&#xD;
      to the protocol or any other supporting documentation, that is likely to affect to a&#xD;
      significant degree:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the safety or physical or mental integrity of the subjects of the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the scientific value of the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the conduct or management of the trial; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the quality or safety of any intervention used in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All substantial amendments will be notified to the METC and to the competent authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-substantial amendments will not be notified to the accredited METC and the competent&#xD;
      authority, but will be recorded and filed by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annual progress report The investigator will submit a summary of the progress of the trial to&#xD;
      the accredited METC once a year. Information will be provided on the date of inclusion of the&#xD;
      first subject, numbers of subjects included and numbers of subjects that have completed the&#xD;
      trial, serious adverse events/ serious adverse reactions, other problems, and amendments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study report The sponsor will notify the accredited METC and the competent authority&#xD;
      of the end of the study within a period of 90 days. The end of the study is defined as the&#xD;
      last patient's last visit (at 52 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case the study is ended prematurely, the sponsor will notify the accredited METC and the&#xD;
      competent authority within 15 days, including the reasons for the premature termination.&#xD;
      Within one year after the end of the study, the investigator/sponsor will submit a final&#xD;
      study report with the results of the study, including any publications/abstracts of the&#xD;
      study, to the accredited METC and the Competent Authority.&#xD;
