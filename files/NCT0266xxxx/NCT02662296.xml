      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib or idelalisib works in treating patients with&#xD;
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is&#xD;
      persistent or has returned (relapsed) after donor stem cell transplant. Ibrutinib and&#xD;
      idelalisib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To improve the outcomes of patients who have progressed or relapsed lymphoma or chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)/prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL)&#xD;
      within 180 days following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) compared to&#xD;
      historical data: 12-month overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the safety profile observed in these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate the overall response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) by&#xD;
      standard morphologic, flow cytometric, imaging, and molecular techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess progression free-survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Define incidences of grade III-IV toxicities and infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Estimate incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Estimate incidences of grade II-III and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and&#xD;
      chronic GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 or idelalisib PO twice&#xD;
      daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;
