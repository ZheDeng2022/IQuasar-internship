  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of RTA 901&#xD;
      following escalating single and multiple oral doses of RTA 901 in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This first-in-human, Phase 1, single-center study consists of single ascending doses (SAD)&#xD;
      and multiple ascending doses (MAD) conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 (SAD) of this study will be&#xD;
      conducted in approximately 56 healthy subjects in up to 7 groups. Each group will consist of&#xD;
      up to 8 subjects who will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single dose of RTA 901 or&#xD;
      placebo, respectively. Safety, tolerability, and available pharmacokinetics through Day 4&#xD;
      will be assessed in each group prior to dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 (MAD) of this study will be conducted in approximately 30 healthy subjects in up to 3&#xD;
      groups. Each group will consist of up to 10 subjects who will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive 14 daily doses of RTA 901 or placebo, respectively. Safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      available pharmacokinetics through Day 17 will be assessed in each dosing group prior to dose&#xD;
      escalation.&#xD;
