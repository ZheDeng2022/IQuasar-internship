  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of CK-2127107 relative to placebo on cycle&#xD;
      ergometer exercise tolerance, assessed as change from period baseline in constant work rate&#xD;
      (CWR) endurance time, utilizing a breath-by-breath metabolic measurement system with&#xD;
      integrated electrocardiogram (ECG). The time to intolerance was assessed by a stopwatch and&#xD;
      verified from electronic recordings of the cycle ergometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study assessed cardiopulmonary and neuromuscular effects of CK-2127107 relative to&#xD;
      placebo; the effect of CK-2127107 on resting spirometry relative to placebo; the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of CK-2127107 as well as the pharmacokinetics of CK-2127107.&#xD;

        <description>The Borg Scale (Borg CR10) is a simple 10-item method of rating perceived exertion and collects information on perceived exertion in an individual's rating of exercise intensity. Participants were asked to use this scale to rate the intensity of their breathing and leg discomfort before, during, and after exercise. Scores range from 0 (Complete Rest) to 10 (Extremely Hard (almost maximal)). BORG CR10 was reported at isotime and peak exercise during CWR test.</description>

An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study drug or who had undergone study procedures and did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An abnormality identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG data, physical examination) an AE only if the abnormality meets 1 of the following criteria: Induces clinical signs or symptoms, Requires active intervention, Requires interruption or discontinuation of study drug, The abnormality or test value is clinically significant in the opinion of the inves</description>

          <description>TEAEs were defined as any AE that started or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug up to 14 days after the last dose of study drug. An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study drug or who had undergone study procedures and did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An abnormality identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG data, physical examination) an AE only if the abnormality meets 1 of the following criteria: Induces clinical signs or symptoms, Requires active intervention, Requires interruption or discontinuation of study drug, The abnormality or test value is clinically significant in the opinion of the inves</description>
