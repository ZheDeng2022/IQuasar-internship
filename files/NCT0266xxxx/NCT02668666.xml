      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palbociclib 125 mg will be administered orally once daily on days 1-21 (D1-D21) of each&#xD;
           28-day cycle. Subjects will not take palbociclib on D22-D28.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tamoxifen 20 mg will be administered orally once daily for every day of the 28-day cycle&#xD;
           (i.e., continuously).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palbociclib should be taken with food in combination with tamoxifen. Subjects should take&#xD;
      their dose at approximately the same time each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is encouraged, but not mandatory, that premenopausal subjects will also receive treatment&#xD;
      with goserelin or equivalent (e.g., Lupron) given as an injectable subcutaneous implant on D1&#xD;
      of every 28 days cycle or every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease assessments will be performed at the completion of every 2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, subject refusal, or&#xD;
      subject death either from progression of disease, the therapy itself, or from other causes.&#xD;
      Subjects who voluntarily stop the study, have progressive disease, or unacceptable toxicities&#xD;
      will be followed for a total of 24 months after discontinuation of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate adequate organ function, all screening labs should be performed within 14 days&#xD;
      prior to registration for protocol therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematological (must meet ALL of the following criteria):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 10 9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platelet count ≥ 100 × 10 9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal (must meet ONE of the following criteria):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 × ULN, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 40 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic (must meet ALL of the following criteria):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × ULN or ≤ 5 × ULN for subjects with known&#xD;
           hepatic metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN or ≤ 5 × ULN for subjects with known hepatic&#xD;
           metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet all of the following applicable inclusion criteria to participate in&#xD;
        this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female ≥ 18 years of age at time of consent. NOTE: Both pre- and&#xD;
             post-menopausal women are eligible. Pre-menopausal status is defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Last menstrual period within the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In case of therapy-induced amenorrhea, plasma estradiol and /or FSH is in the&#xD;
                  premenopausal range per local normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Locally advanced, locoregionally recurrent, or metastatic disease, not amenable to&#xD;
             curative therapy. NOTE: Although not required as a protocol procedure, a patient with&#xD;
             a new metastatic lesion should be considered for biopsy whenever possible to reassess&#xD;
             ER/PR/HER2 status if clinically indicated. If a biopsy is prospectively done as part&#xD;
             of standard of care, the study would like to store samples for correlative research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of ER positive and/or PR&#xD;
             positive (ER &gt;1%, PR &gt;1%), HER2 negative breast cancer. NOTE: Subject has&#xD;
             HER2-negative breast cancer (based on most recently analyzed biopsy) is defined as a&#xD;
             negative in situ hybridization test or an IHC status of 0, 1+ or 2+. If IHC is 2+, a&#xD;
             negative in situ hybridization (e.g. FISH, CISH, SISH, DISH, etc.) test is required by&#xD;
             local laboratory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic disease evaluable on imaging studies. Subjects may have measurable disease&#xD;
             as per RECIST 1.1 or bone-only disease. NOTE: Bone-only subjects are eligible if their&#xD;
             disease can be documented/ evaluated by bone scans, CT or MRI. Their disease will be&#xD;
             assessed using MDA criteria. NOTE: Previously irradiated lesions are eligible as a&#xD;
             target lesion only if there is documented progression of the lesion after irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior systemic anti-cancer therapy for advanced HR+ disease. NOTE: Subjects&#xD;
             receiving adjuvant treatment with aromatase inhibitors at time of recurrence are&#xD;
             allowed to participate. There is no AI washout period required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provided written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability&#xD;
             Act of 1996 (HIPAA) authorization for release of personal health information, approved&#xD;
             by an Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC). NOTE: HIPAA&#xD;
             authorization may be included in the informed consent or obtained separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCP) must not be pregnant or breast-feeding. A&#xD;
             negative serum or urine pregnancy test is required within 72 hours of study&#xD;
             registration from women of childbearing potential. If the urine test cannot be&#xD;
             confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCP) must be willing to use two effective methods of&#xD;
             birth control such as use of a double barrier method (condoms, sponge, diaphragm, or&#xD;
             vaginal ring with spermicidal jellies or cream), or total abstinence for the course of&#xD;
             the study until 120 days after the last dose of study drug. The use of hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives is discouraged. NOTE: Women are considered to be of childbearing&#xD;
             potential unless they are postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months or&#xD;
             surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or&#xD;
             hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory&#xD;
             tests, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects capable of fathering a child must agree to use adequate contraception or&#xD;
             total abstinence for the course of the study until 120 days after the last dose of the&#xD;
             study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Male subjects will be considered as capable of fathering a child unless they have&#xD;
        azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical&#xD;
        condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Co-enrollment in an imaging biomarker study or other non-therapeutic study is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
