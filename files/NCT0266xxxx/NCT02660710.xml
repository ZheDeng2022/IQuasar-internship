  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      doxorubicin, vincristine,prednisone (R-CHOP) in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected diffuse large&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients in Malawi.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single-center, non-randomized phase II clinical trial of R-CHOP for&#xD;
      CD20-positive DLBCL, using the Indian generic biosimilar for rituximab, Reditux™. The&#xD;
      investigators will enroll 40 adult patients age 18-60 years (20 HIV-infected with CD4 count ≥&#xD;
      100 cells/µL, 20 HIV-uninfected) who will receive a maximum of 6-8 cycles of R-CHOP over&#xD;
      18-24 weeks. The primary goal of this study is to establish the safety of R-CHOP in the&#xD;
      Malawi population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study include estimates of complete response (CR) rates,&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). In addition, quality of life,&#xD;
      costs of care, study patient characteristics, clinical outcomes and other published data from&#xD;
      the region will be collected and used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of R-CHOP. If the&#xD;
      investigators' study supports incorporating rituximab into treatment regimens in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa, this strategy can be examined in larger trials, and provide momentum to increase&#xD;
      access to modern cancer medicines globally.&#xD;
