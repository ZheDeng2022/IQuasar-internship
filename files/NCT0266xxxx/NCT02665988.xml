  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an investigational device that has not been&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of any medical condition by the FDA but is allowed to be used for&#xD;
      research purposes. In clinical trials tDCS has been associated with pain relief by decreasing&#xD;
      the intensity and duration of chronic pain. tDCS potentially works by stimulating the brain&#xD;
      by delivering an extremely low-level electrical current to areas below the forehead - areas&#xD;
      associated with chronic pain. It is anticipated that this current will increase brain&#xD;
      activity or the likelihood of brain activity in these areas, affecting individual's ability&#xD;
      to regulate pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare eligible participants in the Pain Management Program&#xD;
      at The Menninger Clinic receiving adjunctive real transcranial Direct Current Stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS) versus those receiving sham tDCS in the resolution of chronic pain. The primary&#xD;
      objectives are: (1) improving pain tolerance and (2) improving subjective pain experience.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are: (1) improving subjective experience of sleep quality and (2)&#xD;
      increasing physical activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic or persistent pain is pain that continues when it should not be present; it is&#xD;
      ongoing or recurrent pain, lasting beyond the usual course of acute illness or injury, and&#xD;
      which unfavorably affects the individual's well-being. The Institute of Medicine (2011)&#xD;
      estimates that 116 million American adults experience chronic pain with direct and indirect&#xD;
      costs to the US economy totaling in excess of half a trillion dollars annually. Current&#xD;
      treatments for chronic pain are only partially effective, especially when used alone. There&#xD;
      is a critical need to develop new and more effective treatments for chronic pain.&#xD;
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) may be helpful as an additional treatment for&#xD;
      patients with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors and scientists conducting this research study want to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      an investigational device (tDCS) that delivers a form of brain stimulation as an additional&#xD;
      treatment to standard of care in the Menninger Clinic's Pain Management Program. Stimulation&#xD;
      with tDCS as an adjunctive to medication-based treatments as well non-medication treatments&#xD;
      options (such as physical therapy and psychotherapy) may improve an individual's ability to&#xD;
      tolerate the physical and emotional distress associated with chronic pain. Therefore the&#xD;
      investigators propose to engage in a clinical trial of adjunctive tDCS for chronic pain,&#xD;
      restricting enrollment to the population receiving services in the Pain Management Program.&#xD;

    <description>Prior to initiating the real tDCS trial and to reduce the likelihood of irritation associated with electrical stimulation, a low dose (1/8 of an inch) topical lidocaine (4%) cream will be applied to the skin where the tDCS the sponge-coated, surface electrodes soaked in saline solution will be placed. Neurotargeting tDCS-explorer software, Version 2.3 will be used to locate the left and right DLPFC, where anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC and cathodal stimulation of the right DLPFC will be received. Real tDCS will be applied during 20-minute periods over the course of 10 sessions.

        <description>Visual analogue scale measure for pain. Score range from 0-10. For rating overall pain, ranging from none, mild, moderate, or severe pain.</description>
        <time_frame>On a weekly basis: 1) Day 1 (first day of tDCS). 2) Day 8 (after first week with post 5 consecutive sessions of tDCS followed by 2 consecutive days without tDCS). 3) Day 15 (after second week post another 5 sessions of tDCS followed by 2 consecutive days</time_frame>
        <population>Analyses were not performed. Given the premature termination of the clinical program, the limited sample size of participants completing the study, the heterogeneity of chronic pain etiology and psychiatric comorbidity among participants, as well as variable and personalized interventions delivered as a part of the clinical care participants received, the data collected would have been grossly underpowered to provide meaningful results.</population>

            <description>Those receiving experimental treatment will receive real tDCS during 20-minute periods over the course of 10 sessions. The treatment will be delivered by trained clinical personnel.&#xD;
tDCS: Prior to initiating the real tDCS trial and to reduce the likelihood of irritation associated with electrical stimulation, a low dose (1/8 of an inch) topical lidocaine (4%) cream will be applied to the skin where the tDCS the sponge-coated, surface electrodes soaked in saline solution will be placed. Neurotargeting tDCS-explorer software, Version 2.3 will be used to locate the left and right DLPFC, where anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC and cathodal stimulation of the right DLPFC will be received. Real tDCS will be applied during 20-minute periods over the course of 10 sessions. After each session, vitamin-E will be applied to the skin where the electrodes had been placed to reduce likelihood of skin irritation.</description>
