      The purpose of the project is to investigate how aerobic exercise affects brain volume,&#xD;
      specific brain regions, neurotrophins and cognition in patients with multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a single blinded randomized controlled trial with a 6 months intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that aerobic exercise can slow down brain atrophy, increase the size of&#xD;
      hippocampus, upregulate the secretion of neurotrophins and improve cognitive performance in&#xD;
      people with multiple sclerosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a physically and cognitively disabling, chronic autoimmune disease&#xD;
      of unknown etiology. It is the most common neurological disease affecting young adults in&#xD;
      Western countries. According to the Danish MS Registry the prevalence has increased markedly&#xD;
      over the last 40 years for particularly women, and today there are approximately 14.000&#xD;
      patients with MS (PwMS) in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathological hallmark of MS is sclerotic plaque. Plaques in the central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) can be detected in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both the accumulation&#xD;
      of lesions and the accelerated whole-brain atrophy correlate with the progressing physical&#xD;
      and cognitive disabilities that clinically characterize PwMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease causes damage of both white and grey matter in the CNS, leading to whole brain&#xD;
      atrophy and topographically specific atrophy within the hippocampus and the frontal and&#xD;
      temporal cortices. The degradation of the CNS manifests as cognitive and physical disability.&#xD;
      Cognitive impairment is estimated to affect up to 65% of PwMS, making it one of the most&#xD;
      common and disabling symptoms of MS. Medical therapies for cognitive impairment in MS have so&#xD;
      far proved ineffective. Collectively, the prevalence, impact and missing treatments highlight&#xD;
      the importance of alternative approaches towards preservation of cognitive function. Despite&#xD;
      equivocal findings, aerobic exercise represents a promising approach towards preservation or&#xD;
      even expansion of hippocampal volume and cognitive functioning in MS. No longitudinal&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) study has so far applied the MRI technique when evaluating&#xD;
      the potential neuro-protective effect of exercise on brain structure and function in MS.&#xD;
      Also, given the scarcity of effective treatments for cognitive impairment in MS, a&#xD;
      longitudinal exercise intervention evaluating the potential effect of aerobic exercise on&#xD;
      cognition is urgently needed in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present project is to investigate how aerobic exercise affects brain&#xD;
      volume, specific brain regions, neurotrophins and cognition in PwMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that aerobic exercise can slow down brain atrophy, increase the size of&#xD;
      hippocampus, upregulate the secretion of neurotrophins and improve cognitive performance in&#xD;
      people with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a single blinded RCT. The exercise intervention will contain 6 months of&#xD;
      aerobic training (bicycling, rowing and cross trainer) performed two times a week at moderate&#xD;
      to high intensity and under supervision. The control group will be &quot;living as usual&quot; and will&#xD;
      be offered the same exercise intervention after a 6 month period. A total of approximately 85&#xD;
      PwMS will be expected to be enrolled. The primary outcome of the study will be brain atrophy&#xD;
      determined by MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current interdisciplinary project aims to document and understand the possible&#xD;
      neuro-protective effects of exercise in MS. This would be of high relevance to PwMS (and&#xD;
      other neurological pathologies). From a societal perspective it would help optimize MS&#xD;
      rehabilitation and subsequently reduce MS related costs due to disability. In case of&#xD;
      positive findings, this would provide the first convincing human evidence of a disease&#xD;
      modifying effect of exercise in MS.&#xD;
