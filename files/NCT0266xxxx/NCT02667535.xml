  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial to evaluate Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Safety of&#xD;
      Isosorbide Mononitrate gel for usage in participants with anal fissure and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. Three doses will be used in patients with anal fissure (0.5%, 1.0% or 2.0%) and&#xD;
      healthy volunteers will receive 2.0% dose. All treatment will last 7 days.&#xD;

      This is a Phase I, open-label, parallel trial to evaluate Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      and Safety of Isosorbide Mononitrate gel for usage in participants with anal fissure and&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational product will be randomly assigned as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  healthy volunteers will receive 2g (2.0%) of investigational product at a single dose,&#xD;
           and will undergo a washout period of 7 days; subsequently, they will receive 2g of&#xD;
           investigational product once daily, for 7 consecutive days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  participants with anal fissure will receive 2g of investigational product, either at&#xD;
           0.5%, 1.0% or 2.0%, at a single dose, and will undergo a washout period of 7 days;&#xD;
           subsequently, they will receive 2g of investigational product, either at 0.5%, 1.0% or&#xD;
           2.0%, once daily, for 7 consecutive days.&#xD;
