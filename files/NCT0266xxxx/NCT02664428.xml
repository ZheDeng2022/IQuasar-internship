      The first results of in vitro testing of the project PreBIOil have delineated the capacity of&#xD;
      a flour of olives to modulate the microbial population of the human intestine in a manner&#xD;
      comparable to that of inulin recognized as polysaccharide with a capacity prebiotic. Based on&#xD;
      these results, and to others in the literature, the bakery product PreBIOil has been&#xD;
      formulated. The product contains, flour of olives, buckwheat, pea, and chestnut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of the study is to assess whether the introduction in the diet of a&#xD;
      bakery product prepared with olive flour, mixed with buckwheat, pea and chestnuts flour can&#xD;
      change the profile of the intestinal microbiota and the plasma cholesterol, in particular&#xD;
      LDL. The study is set up as dietary supplementation, double-blind, randomized, parallel with&#xD;
      the control group, in which the following product will be compared:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) a new bakery product designed study PreBIOil (test); ii) a bakery product control&#xD;
      isoenergetic (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the Food supplemented in the Trial The test product is new baked product&#xD;
      formulated with a mixture of flour from olives, buckwheat, pea and chestnut and has the&#xD;
      appearance of a salty biscuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to consume daily about 90 grams of test or control product. The&#xD;
      exact quantities of each product batch will be determined following the assessment of the&#xD;
      nutritional characteristics of the finished product in order to provide the same calorie&#xD;
      intake with the two products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digestibility, fermentability and modulation of the microbiota Buckwheat is considered a&#xD;
      non-cereal that in addition to containing fiber, minerals and vitamins, such as B2 and B6,&#xD;
      also represents a source of antioxidant compounds due to the content of flavonoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pea flour contains important components for human diet (starch, protein and other&#xD;
      nutrients). The health benefits associated with consumption of peas primarily derived from&#xD;
      the concentration and properties of starch, protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals and&#xD;
      phytochemicals. The fiber contained in the integument and in the cell walls of the cotyledon&#xD;
      contributes to gastrointestinal function. The starch content in pea flour is characterized by&#xD;
      lower glycemic index. The proteins from pea may produce peptides with antioxidant activity.&#xD;
      The vitamin and mineral content of peas can play an important role in the prevention of&#xD;
      deficiency diseases, in particular those relating to the deficiencies of selenium and folate.&#xD;
      Peas contain a variety of phytochemicals. These include polyphenols that may have antioxidant&#xD;
      and anticancer, saponins which are present hypo colesterolemica and anticancer activities,&#xD;
      and oligosaccharides of galactose that can exert prebiotic benefits in the large intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nutritional components of chestnut flour consist of carbohydrates, protein and fat in the&#xD;
      composition such as to provide an energy value about 350-400 kcal / 100 g. Chestnuts have&#xD;
      been voted to have a positive effect on the metabolism of gut bacteria and are a source of&#xD;
      long-chain fatty acids C18: 1 and C18: 2 and vitamins (vitamin E). The possible presence of&#xD;
      polyphenols is limited to the outer skins, generally separated from the fruit during the&#xD;
      production of the flour. The flour coming from olive paste is not described in the scientific&#xD;
      literature for specific nutritional properties for the human diet. However olives are an&#xD;
      integral part of the Mediterranean diet in which they are consumed as table olives and olive&#xD;
      oil. The olive fruit contains 50% water, 22% fat, about 19% of carbohydrates and about 2% of&#xD;
      protein; the polyphenol content varies in the range 1-3%. The olives are consumed or as olive&#xD;
      oil or table olives. The olives are characterized by strong bitterness, caused mostly&#xD;
      dall'oleuropein. The oleuropein can reach 140 mg / g dry weight in unripe olives and&#xD;
      decreases and as the fruit ripens Table olives are treated to mitigate the bitter taste&#xD;
      through processes such as maceration soda and fermentation in brine. However in the process&#xD;
      of sweetening the bitterness over lost some important compounds present in olives such as&#xD;
      polyphenols and fiber. There is no evidence on the ability of extra virgin olive oil&#xD;
      polyphenols reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, but a large part of the possible&#xD;
      effects of the components of the olive alone or in synergy with the polyphenols are still&#xD;
      unexplored. In addition a large part of the water-soluble fraction contained in the olives,&#xD;
      between which the fibers and polyphenols with proven beneficial activities on human health,&#xD;
      is not removed in the process of oil production. There is evidence that some phenolic&#xD;
      fractions as secoiridoids are poorly absorbed by the intestinal mucosa and are then available&#xD;
      for the colonic microflora. Essentially the oil in its entirety would have the greatest&#xD;
      potential as a food can modulate beneficially the composition and activity of microorganisms&#xD;
      symbiotic human gut, as observed experimentally for other types of fruit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By means of simulation in vitro of colonic fermentation it has been observed that the olive&#xD;
      paste, even after baking at 180°C for 30 ', is capable of modulating the human intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota with a prebiotic effect or inducing a significant increase of bifidobacteria. Such&#xD;
      simulation in vitro was carried out by incubation for 24 h in a batch fermentation system&#xD;
      with control of pH and temperature, following inoculation with feces obtained from five&#xD;
      healthy individuals. The analysis of total polyphenols (main antioxidants present in the test&#xD;
      product) present in the flour of olives, in the mixture of the flour and in the test product&#xD;
      did detect a loss of total polyphenols, as a result of baking equal to 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Results Clinical results have shown that daily consumption of 100 g of buckwheat in&#xD;
      the form of flour has determined the increase in the HDL/cholesterol ratio and improved&#xD;
      glucose tolerance and more recently it was observed that the consumption of biscuits made of&#xD;
      buckwheat has reduced the serum level of a marker of inflammation, myeloperoxidase (MPO) in&#xD;
      addition to a reduction of total cholesterol with better pulmonary vital capacity. A recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis of several intervention studies on the human diet with supplementation of&#xD;
      legumes, including peas, showed their ability to decrease serum levels of LDL cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention studies on diet with olive oils, by-products of processing of olives and&#xD;
      olive-based products have been conducted with healthy volunteers and subjects with various&#xD;
      degrees of cardiovascular risk. Of these studies have been indicated the daily doses of total&#xD;
      polyphenols introduced (from a few mg / day to 30 mg / day, up to 100 mg / day) depending on&#xD;
      the type of olive oil and also enrichment with extracts. These interventions had in many&#xD;
      cases a duration of about a month, and most of the studies measured the effects of&#xD;
      antioxidant and anti-inflammatory changes in the circulatory system, along with the values of&#xD;
      plasma lipids, and other parameters related to oxidative stress. In particular in the study&#xD;
      &quot;EUROLIVE&quot;, on a large sample of healthy individuals, it was observed that the phenols of&#xD;
      olive oil were able to protect blood lipids from oxidation, increase the concentration of HDL&#xD;
      cholesterol and the relationship between reduced and oxidized glutathione, however no changes&#xD;
      dell'F2-isoprostane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2011 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has approved the claim that the olive oil&#xD;
      polyphenols, especially hydroxytyrosol, protect LDL from oxidation, at a dose greater than or&#xD;
      equal to 5 mg/kg/day. Other studies have also shown that olive oil polyphenols are related to&#xD;
      the reduction of CRP, reduced atherogenic gene expression in blood cells, and decreased blood&#xD;
      pressure. Although there are evidences on the ability of olive oil polyphenols to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of cardiovascular diseases, a large part of the possible effects of the components of&#xD;
      the olive alone or in synergy are still unexplored. Moreover, a large part of fibers and&#xD;
      polyphenols contained in the olive is not extracted in the process of oil extraction and&#xD;
      eliminated as a byproduct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the Study The buckwheat flour adds fiber and flavonoids, the pea flour contains&#xD;
      carbohydrates with low glycemic index, protein and is also a source of antioxidants, chestnut&#xD;
      flour brings prebiotic substances and vitamins. Flour olive is the fruit of the olive is with&#xD;
      its water-soluble components (eg. Fibers and polyphenols) and in the soluble fraction of&#xD;
      polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, tocopherols and carotenoids that only&#xD;
      partially pass extra virgin olive. These components are designed mostly as components of&#xD;
      extra virgin olive oil and scientifically have given evidence to contribute to the&#xD;
      improvement of lipid metabolism and plasma lipids framework, to heart health and protect&#xD;
      against oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on available clinical and experimental studies, it has been suggested that consumption&#xD;
      of a baked product made from a mixture of flour from olive paste, buckwheat, peas and&#xD;
      chestnuts can have positive effects on lipid plasma biomarkers and intestinal microbiota (for&#xD;
      example, an increase of bifidobacteria) in adult participants with plasma content of&#xD;
      cholesterol in medium to high levels even if not yet pathological.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement of compliance statement This study will be carried out in compliance with the&#xD;
      Protocol and in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as described in ICH GCP for&#xD;
      1996, the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and the Declaration of Helsinki. With the&#xD;
      signing of this protocol, the researcher agrees to comply with these requirements.&#xD;

      food diary will be written by each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants included in the study will also be asked to fill in a sensory evaluation of each&#xD;
      food offered in the first blind tasting and at the end of 8 weeks of supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling of blood and urine collection The blood (≤ 30 ml) will be drawn from a peripheral&#xD;
      vein, after 10 hours of fasting. 24 h urine will be collected, the volume measured and sample&#xD;
      will be stored at -80 ° C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of fecal samples Fecal samples will be processed within 12 hours of sample&#xD;
      collection. Aliquots of each fecal sample will be frozen directly at -80 ° C for analysis of&#xD;
      metabolomic profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests by the laboratory analysis of the Casa di Cura Eremo di Arco Blood samples&#xD;
      will be centrifuged according to the requirements of the tests to be performed immediately&#xD;
      after blood collection. Plasma or serum will be separated, in part immediately tested and the&#xD;
      remaining fraction stored at -80 ° C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose will be evaluated with&#xD;
      enzymatic method. LDL cholesterol will be measured analytically with enzymatic method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin levels will be assessed by elettrochemioluminescenza. The blood count and platelet&#xD;
      count will be assessed by method impedentiometric. The C-reactive protein (CRP) will be&#xD;
      measured by turbidimetric assay. The high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsPCR) will be&#xD;
      measured by turbidimetric assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apolipoprotein AI (ApoA-I), ApoB, and Lp (a) were determined by immunoturbidimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test for the verification of the absence of glucosuria will be made by measuring the&#xD;
      concentration of glucose in the urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests by the Fondazione Edmund Mach [EMF] Urinary and plasma metabolomic profile.&#xD;
      The F2-isoprostanes will be measured in the urine as a measure of oxidative stress, by means&#xD;
      of specific EIA kit, after purification by chromatography solid phase (columns SepPack).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of LDL oxidized in the plasma will be conducted with the aid of ELISA kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples of urine and blood (plasma and serum) will be subjected both to analysis of&#xD;
      targeted metabolomics (UPLC-MS / MS for non-volatile compounds and GC-MS / MS for volatile&#xD;
      compounds) that analyzes of non-targeted metabolomics (ULPC-Q -TOF-MS and Nano -FTMS-Q-TOF&#xD;
      nonvolatile and GC-TOF for the volatile compounds). For profiles of targeted plasma&#xD;
      metabolites, it will be used the MS-based Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ ® Kit P180, generating&#xD;
      precise quantitative data on 180 human metabolites linked to the risk of diabetes. In&#xD;
      addition, specific targeted analysis will be applied to the lipid profile of serum bile&#xD;
      acids, short-chain fatty acids (short chain fatty acids, SCFAs) and quantification of&#xD;
      metabolites of the polyphenols of microbial origin in biofluids (including feces) with UPLC /&#xD;
      QQQ-MS / MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of fecal microbiota. Changes in the faecal microbiota of specific bacterial&#xD;
      populations will be evaluated using the method of in situ hybridization with fluorescent&#xD;
      probes (FISH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also changes in the faecal microbiota will be evaluated using a metagenomics approach using&#xD;
      pyrosequencing 454. In short, after the collection of stool samples (n = 128, 2 stool samples&#xD;
      at different times T0, T1 from 64 subjects before and after consumption of each food test and&#xD;
      placebo) will extract the bacterial genomic DNA using the kit SPIN FastDNA (MPbio) specific&#xD;
      for feces. Using primers specific for the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (hypervariable region&#xD;
      V1-V3) it will be performed by PCR amplification and then subjecting the amplified V1-V3 at&#xD;
      454 pyrosequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will use the GS FLX Titanium Chemistry with adapters Multiplex Identifier (MID) to get&#xD;
      sequences of length 600 bp that will be analyzed by comparing the database of 16S rRNA&#xD;
      phylogenetic, publicly available, via the pipeline QIIME that allows assignment to the genus&#xD;
      level of human intestinal microbiota. It will be produced a total of about 20,000 sequences&#xD;
      for each fecal sample. As quality control and analysis of microbial ecology, it will be used&#xD;
      a multivariate statistical in order to correlate the changes in the composition of the fecal&#xD;
      microbiota following the consumption of food testing or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization blinded Participants will be assigned randomly but equally distributed by sex&#xD;
      and age to one of two treatments: bakery product test or control product even using specific&#xD;
      software. The clinical researchers, investigators and laboratory personnel will be blinded to&#xD;
      the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment The supplementation will be introduced in the daily diet through the consumption of&#xD;
      a bakery product (test) for a daily consumption of 90 grams of product containing flour of&#xD;
      olives, from buckwheat, from peas, chestnuts. The food will provide an analogue control&#xD;
      calorie intake. The products under study (test or control) will be supplied in packs that&#xD;
      will be labeled in the local language with the code number of the study. the manufacturer's&#xD;
      name, the number of patients, the number of study visit. The products will be distributed to&#xD;
      the participants from the visit T0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study and planning After eligibility will be assessed, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized in two groups (product test or control) that will follow 8 weeks of dietary&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall duration of the study, including the start-up period (run-in) and the treatment&#xD;
      will be 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment will start later and within three months of approval by the Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The run-in will begin within two weeks of the first visit (T-1). Subjects will be recruited&#xD;
      over a period of 10 months and the study will be completed within 12 months from the time of&#xD;
      the first recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for study discontinuation In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH&#xD;
      standards of good clinical practice, and the &quot;Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Regulations&quot;&#xD;
      of the United States, a person has the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for&#xD;
      any reason, without prejudice for future medical care from the physician or the institution.&#xD;
      Investigators also have the right to withdraw the study subjects (see below). In the event&#xD;
      that a person (or a person legally authorized representative) decides to retire, every effort&#xD;
      will be made to complete and report the observations as well as possible. A final&#xD;
      comprehensive assessment should be made at the time of the withdrawal of the subject where&#xD;
      the reason for the withdrawal must be registered and in any case should an attempt be made to&#xD;
      perform a follow-up evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Subjects can be removed from the study for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breach of the Protocol as from the experimenter Not meaningful compliance by the subject The&#xD;
      refusal of the subject to continue treatment or comments Unacceptable toxicity Decision of&#xD;
      the researcher that the closure is in the best medical interest of the subject Unclear event&#xD;
      of illness or complications Use of concomitant medications that are incompatible with the&#xD;
      study. Pregnancy Abuse of alcohol or drugs Those who discontinue or is withdrawn from the&#xD;
      study will not be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for Terminating&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an individual stop before the completion of the study, the reason and the cutoff date will&#xD;
      be recorded. The date of the last dose of food in the study should be recorded. In the event&#xD;
      of early termination, the following procedures must be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical tests (systolic and diastolic, heart rate, weight and height to calculate BMI and&#xD;
      waist and hip circumference).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking blood and feces and urine collection. A food frequency questionnaire (weekly). In the&#xD;
      event that the individual can not return for follow-up visit, the investigators will have&#xD;
      groped to contact the person by phone to track any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a person withdraws consent to receive food in the studio, you will be encouraged to remain&#xD;
      in the study without receiving treatment for the collection of safety data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures of reliability of the product under study The products (test or control) will&#xD;
      be provided in packages labeled in the local language with the code number of the study, the&#xD;
      number of site code, the manufacturer's name, the number of participants, the number of&#xD;
      visits of the study, the number of lot, instructions for storage and expiration dates. The&#xD;
      products will be distributed to the participants from the visit T0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Codes randomization The codes of randomization by sex and age, for each participant will be&#xD;
      stored in a sealed envelope by qualified group of Sensory Quality (QS of the Department of&#xD;
      Nutrition and Food Quality of the Research and Innovation Centre of the Edmund Mach&#xD;
      Foundation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Source Control All data collected during the study will be obtained from primary&#xD;
      sources, and will be recorded in written documents and electronic medical records as the&#xD;
      subject. The results of clinical, laboratory results and ECG will be recorded in the&#xD;
      electronic medical record file of the subject. No data will be inserted directly in the &quot;case&#xD;
      report form&quot; (CRF), without being transferred from the primary source, such as paper records&#xD;
      or electronic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Drug Therapy Any medication taken from the subject within one month before the&#xD;
      start of the study and / or administered during the study will be considered as concomitant&#xD;
      therapy. Such treatment must be documented on the appropriate page of the CRF and the medical&#xD;
      records of the subjects. Any changes to the concomitant therapy during the study must be&#xD;
      clearly recorded and the reason for the change should be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A letter will be sent to the doctor of each participant, specifying what are the treatments&#xD;
      concomitant incompatible with the study. The use of the following drugs will not be allowed&#xD;
      during the study: blood thinners, antihypertensives, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers,&#xD;
      systemic corticosteroids, neuroleptics, antibiotics, laxatives, vitamin supplements,&#xD;
      antioxidants and minerals, dietary fiber, prebiotics (eg inulin, oligofructose) and&#xD;
      probiotics. Therefore if the subject requires drug therapies incompatible with the study, the&#xD;
      subject is notified by the treating physician to terminate the study and inform the head of&#xD;
      the study and following the procedures for the early termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance Rating To assess compliance to supplementation, they will be measured urinary&#xD;
      phenols in subjects that will be supplemented with food tests at T0, T1. In addition, all the&#xD;
      unused or empty packaging at the end of each week will be returned to the experimenters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Security There were no security problems during previous studies related to the&#xD;
      consumption of products made from olives, buckwheat, pea flour, chestnut flour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be monitored by medical and paramedical staff of the Casa di Cura Eremo of&#xD;
      Arco. Adverse events will still be recorded throughout the study. Abnormal laboratory values&#xD;
      that induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapeutic intervention will be promptly&#xD;
      notified to the subject, if the subject has explicitly expressed that wish to receive such&#xD;
      communication in the form of informed consent. The subject will be free to withdraw from the&#xD;
      study in advance if in need of therapeutic intervention is not compatible with the study, or&#xD;
      if you experience adverse events that cause a change in the criteria for inclusion of this&#xD;
      subject in the study. The subject will still be free to withdraw from the study at any time,&#xD;
      in case the study is due to discomfort following the procedure for early termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The basic features are listed by type of supplementation: continuous&#xD;
      variables are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation or medians with interquartile ranges&#xD;
      and as a percentage for categorical variables. Data with an asymmetric distribution will&#xD;
      follow a log processing prior to analysis. The differences between the two supplements will&#xD;
      be evaluated with univariate and multivariate statistical methods. The medium before and&#xD;
      after the intervention will be compared with the General Linear Model (ANOVA) for repeated&#xD;
      measures or for paired data. You will perform simple and multiple linear regressions to&#xD;
      determine the relationships between independent variables; also we will run the test to&#xD;
      evaluate differences in compliance detected in the types of supplementation. The results are&#xD;
      expressed as mean +/- SEM and the differences will be considered significant when P &lt;0.05.&#xD;
      Data with an asymmetric distribution will follow a log processing prior to analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main analysis will be based on a comparison of the differences in mean levels after&#xD;
      consumption of test product and after consumption of control. The differences between the&#xD;
      mean values at the end of each supplementation (T1) in relation to the relative mean baseline&#xD;
      value (T0) will also be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differences in time between treatment arms will be evaluated by analysis of variance for&#xD;
      repeated measures.The level of significance will be considered &lt;0.05 in two tails.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for each supplementation has been determined to 32 to detect a decrease of&#xD;
      LDL cholesterol in the plasma equal to about 15.44 mg/dl with a standard deviation of 14.28&#xD;
      mg/dl using the equation Snedecor and Cochran with α equal to 0.05 and 1-β equal to 0.9 (Dell&#xD;
      et al., 2002). According to this formula the minimum number of subjects to enroll is equal to&#xD;
      28. Taking into account possible dropouts, 32 people for supplementation with the test&#xD;
      product and 32 people for supplementation with control product for a total of 64 volunteer&#xD;
      subjects in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment is made on the basis of the abundance of the decrease of LDL cholesterol in&#xD;
      plasma, on the basis of the measures (mean and standard deviation) of LDL cholesterol&#xD;
      reported in a parallel study published in the European Journal of Nutrition. The parameter&#xD;
      LDL cholesterol, in addition to being an effect on human health recognized is more&#xD;
      restrictive and requires observation times longer than the extent of the modification of the&#xD;
      intestinal microflora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct access to source data / documents Regulatory authorities may wish to carry out checks&#xD;
      on clinical research to evaluate compliance with the principles of GCP. Regulatory&#xD;
      authorities may also wish to conduct an inspection (during the trial or after its&#xD;
      completion). If an inspection required by a regulatory authority and / or the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee for Clinical Trials c/o APSS Trento, the researcher must agree to provide access,&#xD;
      regulatory authorities, the documentation related to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Records The source of the data and documentation is defined as the first&#xD;
      place where the data is recorded. Any original documents and should not be kept and made&#xD;
      available at the same location. The researcher must keep the original documents for each&#xD;
      person participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected on the CRF during the trial will be documented in an anonymous way, and&#xD;
      those will be identified by numbers or symbols. If in exceptional circumstances it is&#xD;
      necessary, for reasons of safety or regulation, identifying the person, OlioCRU Ltd and the&#xD;
      researcher are required to keep such information confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data entered in the CRF shall be legible and recorded in black ink. Should you require a&#xD;
      correction it should be made by deleting the entry with a single line and entering the&#xD;
      correct information next to the item itself. The correction must be initialed and dated by&#xD;
      the investigator, or a qualified person designated.&#xD;
