  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seroma formation is a common complication following breast and axillary surgery for breast&#xD;
      cancer. The use of drains is commonplace in practice after mastectomy, although there is&#xD;
      evidence to suggest that they do not affect the incidence of symptomatic seroma formation.&#xD;
      Methods have been adopted in attempts to decrease seroma formation, to varying results, which&#xD;
      include the use of deep sutures. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of drains&#xD;
      and quilting sutures on the incidence of seroma formation. Patients undergoing mastectomy and&#xD;
      axillary surgery for breast cancer will be eligible. Patients will be randomized to either&#xD;
      receive a drain, no drain or no drain with quilting sutures. The primary outcome measure will&#xD;
      be the incidence of symptomatic seroma. Secondary outcome measures will be postoperative&#xD;
      length of stay and postoperative pain scores.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The mainstay of treatment for the majority of breast cancers is surgical excision&#xD;
      of the primary tumour either by removing the lump (wide local excision) or the whole breast,&#xD;
      mastectomy. Breast cancer can commonly spread to the lymph nodes in the armpit (axilla)&#xD;
      meaning surgery to remove the cancer also involves surgery to axilla to sample lymph nodes.&#xD;
      The most common complication following mastectomy is a fluid collection deep to the wound&#xD;
      called a seroma. This is generally a minor complication but may cause significant discomfort&#xD;
      / distress to the patient. If the seroma is of a significant size as to cause discomfort, it&#xD;
      is usually drained using a needle and syringe near the wound. This is not only to improve&#xD;
      patient discomfort, but seromas can lead to wound healing problems which may delay the onset&#xD;
      of adjuvant treatment, such as radio- or chemotherapy. The incidence of seroma is variable,&#xD;
      but the most commonly quoted incidence of seroma formation is between 15% and 27%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a bid to reduce seroma formation, surgeons use drains following mastectomy to&#xD;
      theoretically remove any excess fluid that may accumulate following surgery. This is the&#xD;
      current practice in our unit at North Tees. Despite the widespread use of drains following&#xD;
      mastectomy, there is no clear evidence to suggest that the use of drains significantly&#xD;
      reduces seroma formation. There are also no consensus guidelines for the use of postoperative&#xD;
      drains. Most surgeons advocate the removal of drains when the volume drained is less than&#xD;
      50ml/day. Patients with a drain in-situ may be kept as inpatients until drain removal, others&#xD;
      may go home with drains with frequent review at home by the breast care nursing team. As a&#xD;
      consequence, drains may contribute to a longer postoperative stay and have also been linked&#xD;
      to higher postoperative pain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nature and behaviour of seromas remains ambiguous; it is hard predicting which patients&#xD;
      will be troubled by them. There is one argument however, that seroma fluid may be increased&#xD;
      by the presence of a drain. This is because the drain may irritate the tissues underneath the&#xD;
      wound, resulting in the tissues producing more fluid which may accumulate into a seroma.&#xD;
      Therefore, there lies a theoretical basis for which drains should be avoided altogether.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other measures have been adopted other than drains in a bid to reduce seroma formation. One&#xD;
      of the main ones are the use of 'quilting sutures' deep to the wound. These have previously&#xD;
      been used either in addition to a drain or without. Quilting sutures aim to reduce the 'free&#xD;
      space' left in the tissues following removal of the breast by adhering the tissues together.&#xD;
      The free space, commonly called 'dead space' is a risk factor for the accumulation of fluid.&#xD;
      It has been shown in studies that with or without a drain, these sutures (or stitches) reduce&#xD;
      the incidence of seroma and reduce the length of inpatient stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim/Objective: This pilot study aims to determine the effect that drains and quilting sutures&#xD;
      have on the incidence of symptomatic seroma formation following mastectomy and axillary&#xD;
      surgery for breast cancer. A symptomatic seroma is defined as a fluid collection beneath the&#xD;
      mastectomy wound which develops post-operatively, causing tension on the healing wound and&#xD;
      discomfort to the patient, thus needing drainage. This is usually approximately 100mls or&#xD;
      greater in quantity of fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: See below&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria: see below&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: This is a feasibility study which will recruit patients from four NHS Foundation&#xD;
      Trusts in the North-East of England (North Tees and Hartlepool, Northumbria, Gateshead and&#xD;
      Newcastle Hospitals). The principle research centre will be North Tees. No power calculation&#xD;
      has been used to determine sample size. A small sample will be used to assess the feasibility&#xD;
      of the intervention with the aim of using this study as a pilot for a large study in the&#xD;
      future which would have a sample based on power calculations. Seroma incidence has been&#xD;
      quoted as around 15-27%.2 University Hospital of North Tees and Hartlepool alone treat&#xD;
      approximately 500 patients diagnosed with breast cancer every year. Each centre will recruit&#xD;
      30 patients, which approximates to 10 per group. This gives a total sample size of 120&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited at the breast clinic when consenting for surgery. They will be&#xD;
      approached regarding the study as part of the consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation process: Block randomisation using computer generated opaque sealed envelopes&#xD;
      sequencing stratified by the centre. Variable block sizes are preferable but not necessary&#xD;
      given the three arms of the study and multiple study sites. According to site, participants&#xD;
      will be labelled in four blocks of 30 for randomisation to make sure all sites allocate 10 in&#xD;
      each group. These will be labelled A1-30 to D1-30. The reasoning for this method is that if&#xD;
      participants were labelled 1-120, then there would be a need for someone who always had&#xD;
      access to the next randomisation group. As this is a pilot study, there would not be the&#xD;
      facility to have a 24-hour randomisation call-line. Participants will be allocated into&#xD;
      either groups 1, 2 or 3 (as detailed below in 'Study Procedure').&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed written consent: Consent for the study will be taken at the time of consenting for&#xD;
      surgery at the breast clinic. This will be undertaken on a specific consent form. The&#xD;
      patients will also be given an information leaflet at this time, with the option of returning&#xD;
      to another clinic and consenting later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure: Patients eligible and who consent to be subjects in the study will be&#xD;
      randomized into one of three groups and will receive treatment at the hospital at which they&#xD;
      present. Pre-operative practice and operative technique will be standardised between sites&#xD;
      and will be routine practice. Group 1 will be allocated to receive a drain intra-operatively.&#xD;
      Group 2 will not receive a drain and no further intervention. Group 3 will not receive a&#xD;
      drain but will receive quilting sutures. A sealed envelope will be opened by the theatre&#xD;
      nursing staff immediately before wound closure to reveal the randomisation code. Patients in&#xD;
      group 2 and 3 and breast care nurses will be blinded regarding the use of quilting sutures.&#xD;
      Surgery will be carried out by consultants or experienced registrars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in group 1 will be discharged from hospital when ambulatory and pain is controlled&#xD;
      by oral analgesia. They may go home with the drain in-situ or be discharged when the drain is&#xD;
      removed. The drain in either case will be removed when the output is less than 50ml in 24h.&#xD;
      Patients in group 2 and 3 will be discharged when ambulatory and similarly analgesic&#xD;
      requirements are met with oral preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up in the breast clinic in two weeks post surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those randomised to not receive a drain (Groups 2 and 3) are not anticipated to have a longer&#xD;
      postoperative inpatient stay. On the contrary, it is anticipated they may be discharged&#xD;
      sooner than those in group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of the study: The end of the study will be marked when subjects' seromas cease to be&#xD;
      symptomatic or needing drainage. Participants will be followed up routinely within the breast&#xD;
      clinic as part of their on-going cancer management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of safety: No additional toxicity data will be required to be included. Any&#xD;
      adverse events or safety issues will be dealt with in accordance with standard hospital&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject withdrawal: Patients will be free to withdraw from the study at any time. This may be&#xD;
      defined as pre or post intervention. The reasons for withdrawal will be noted in the patient&#xD;
      records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data recording: Each patient will be assigned a case report form. The patient will be&#xD;
      reviewed at 24h post-operatively and data collected by the clinician. At 24h, data on the&#xD;
      drainage volumes in the drain group, pain scores and an examination of the wound will be&#xD;
      conducted. Pain scores at 48h by the same scoring system will also be used. Pain scores will&#xD;
      be recorded using a validated visual analogue score (VAS). The patient will be reviewed each&#xD;
      day in hospital until discharge. Upon discharge, the breast care nurses will collect data on&#xD;
      seroma incidence, aspiration volumes and wound care. Data will then be entered into a secure&#xD;
      hospital-based Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Transfer of data will be via NHS.net to NHS.net&#xD;
      email to ensure security.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations: This is a pilot study so only requires small patient numbers&#xD;
      therefore descriptive statistics only will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source data/documents/confidentiality: The Data Protection Act, NHS Research Governance&#xD;
      Framework and relevant NHS codes of practice will be followed with regards to the collection,&#xD;
      storage, processing and disclosure of personal and study information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given a study number at the onset of the trial, with a link to their&#xD;
      personal data on a separate database. The main data will only be collected in reference to&#xD;
      the unique study number and thus data will be anonymised and kept confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on case report forms. This will then be entered into a secure&#xD;
      hospital-based spreadsheet. The researchers will have access to the data. No patient&#xD;
      identifiable details will be removed from the hospital site. All paper copies will be filed&#xD;
      in a hospital-based master research file. The patient consent form will be filed in the&#xD;
      subjects' hospital records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this will be a four-centre study, data will be transferred from the other sites to North&#xD;
      Tees however no patient identifiable information will be transferred only study reference&#xD;
      number. Transfer will be between secure NHS.net email accounts and data will be held for 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control &amp; quality assurance: This is a low risk trial and no major issues are&#xD;
      anticipated. A formal data monitoring committee is not needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Either Consultant Surgeons or highly skilled specialist registrars will carry out the&#xD;
      surgery. Patients will be closely followed up by the surgical team or breast care nurses and&#xD;
      have open access to the breast care service. If however high complication rates are&#xD;
      experienced in a particular group, this method will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control will be maintained by strict adherence to the study protocol, the principles&#xD;
      of GCP, research governance and clinical trial regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations : The main ethical issue surrounding this trial is that two thirds of&#xD;
      patients will not receive the current practice at the four trusts, of receiving a drain.&#xD;
      However, this is not to suggest that by not receiving a drain, they will have a less&#xD;
      favourable outcome. The main risk to patients is a symptomatic seroma, which may require&#xD;
      drainage. However, patients are at risk of seromas whether they have a drain put in or not,&#xD;
      and by actually not receiving a drain, may have a lower incidence of seroma, less pain and&#xD;
      time in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be strict compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and&#xD;
      MRC/ICH good clinical practice.&#xD;
