  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Volume resuscitation is the mainstay of treatment in most types of shock, especially in&#xD;
      hemorrhagic and septic shock. Septic shock is a main cause of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      worldwide. Although there has been a lot of research to evaluate optimal amount and&#xD;
      composition of fluids for volume resuscitation (e.g. colloids, crystalloids, red blood cell&#xD;
      transfusion, albumin, fresh frozen plasma) particularly in the past decade, results remain&#xD;
      inconclusive and to some extent contradictive. The investigators would like to contribute to&#xD;
      the establishment of new endpoints for the guidance of shock therapy focusing on the first 24&#xD;
      and 48 hours, amending the currently used parameters (i.e. cardiac output, heart rate, blood&#xD;
      pressure, central venous pressure) with new measurements (see study specific measurements).&#xD;
      The goal is to decrease the need for renal replacement therapy, thereby eventually reducing&#xD;
      patient morbidity and mortality.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale, clinical evidence to date:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All forms of shock and especially septic shock, in which tissue metabolic demands are not&#xD;
      fulfilled by blood supply, are main causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide and develops&#xD;
      in one third of the patients admitted to the ICU. Not only is this high incidence alarming,&#xD;
      the uncertainty about the undeceiving parameters for guidance of fluid resuscitation to not&#xD;
      only avoid acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy but also the consequences of&#xD;
      fluid overload, such as interstitial pulmonary edema, underline the importance of further&#xD;
      research within this field. This is why the investigators would like to contribute to the&#xD;
      establishment of new parameters for the guidance of shock therapy focusing on the first 72&#xD;
      hours, amending the currently used parameters (i.e. cardiac output, heart rate, blood&#xD;
      pressure, central venous pressure) with new measurements, including assessment of total body&#xD;
      water, renal vascular resistance (renal resistive index (RRI)) and microcirculatory blood&#xD;
      flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the application of intravenous crystalloid fluids, red blood cell concentrates in&#xD;
      anemia, and catecholamines or inotropes are the mainstay of shock therapy, no clear endpoints&#xD;
      for the fluid resuscitation or the hemodynamic endpoints for catecholamine therapy have been&#xD;
      established so far. Static parameters such as central venous or arterial pressure, cardiac&#xD;
      output, or plasma lactate failed in the guidance of the amount of fluid administered. The&#xD;
      administration of intravenous fluids in response to so-called dynamic tests, such as stroke&#xD;
      volume variation in response to fluid bolus administration, also did not show an influence on&#xD;
      organ dysfunction and mortality due to shock. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most frequent&#xD;
      organ dysfunction in patients in shock. Despite a more aggressive early fluid resuscitation&#xD;
      and correction of arterial blood pressure, the incidence of AKI does not seem to decrease.&#xD;
      One possible reason is that the excessive amount of fluid administered to these patients for&#xD;
      hemodynamic stabilization and maintenance of urinary output harm kidney function. Indeed, a&#xD;
      correlation between total amount of fluid administered, high central venous pressure, organ&#xD;
      dysfunction, and mortality has been shown in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.&#xD;
      Established static and dynamic hemodynamic parameters are not influenced by the severity of&#xD;
      capillary leakage and microcirculatory impairment due to inflammation-induced injury in&#xD;
      capillaries. The relatively low perfusion pressure together with interstitial edema,&#xD;
      microcirculatory injury, and a high outflow pressure may harm renal function by a decreased&#xD;
      glomerular urine excretion. Intraabdominal pressure, total body water, and central venous&#xD;
      pressure together with the renal resistive index may be additional measurements to reduce the&#xD;
      rate of acute kidney injury and to guide fluid therapy in shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the present study is to refine fluid resuscitation endpoints with new&#xD;
      measurements to administer the optimal amount of fluid with the smallest possible adverse&#xD;
      effects. Complexity of therapy in severe sepsis and septic shock as well as in other shock&#xD;
      states was the topic of numerous studies showing no benefit of advanced macro-circulatory&#xD;
      parameters for guidance of fluid resuscitation in shock. If the chosen measurements are&#xD;
      unable to establish new endpoints for guidance in shock therapy, the investigators' research&#xD;
      might be expanded to the evaluation of future therapies, such as biomarkers or stem cells.&#xD;
      After establishment of more regional resuscitation endpoints, the investigators plan to&#xD;
      evaluate these endpoints in a randomized, controlled setting against established&#xD;
      hemodynamically-guided shock therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform the following new measurements and assessments for guidance of&#xD;
      fluid resuscitation at 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after shock diagnosis and concomitant&#xD;
      fulfillment of eligibility requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  APACHE II score, first 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simplified Acute Physiology (SAPS) II score, first 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Established parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic parameters (cardiac index [5], central venous pressure, blood pressure,&#xD;
           heart rate, central/mixed venous oxygen saturation = ScvO2/venous oxygen saturation&#xD;
           (SvO2), pulmonary capillary occlusion pressure (PAOP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of inotropic and vasoactive drugs (epinephrine, norepinephrine, milrinone,&#xD;
           dobutamine, levosimendan)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory parameters (lactate, sodium, potassium, blood sugar concentration and need&#xD;
           for insulin therapy with respect to need for immunosuppressive therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parameters of renal function (creatinine, creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen,&#xD;
           urine output, potassium, urinary protein, urinary sediment analysis, sodium excretion&#xD;
           fraction, need for renal replacement therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Creatinine clearance after 24, 48, and 72 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urinary sediment analysis 72 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urinary protein screening after 72 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total amount of fluids (ml) administered&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total amount of crystalloids (ml) administered after onset of shock symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total amount of colloids (ml) administered&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amount of red blood cell and plasma transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amount of albumin infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative parameters influenced by severity of capillary leakage and microcirculatory&#xD;
      injury:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Renal artery resistive index (Doppler analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra-abdominal pressure (bladder pressure management)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total body water (bio-impedance analysis): this is a commonly used method for assessment&#xD;
           of body composition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Microcirculatory blood flow (CytoCam incident dark-field illumination): &quot;hand-held&#xD;
           device (â€¦), providing new means of directly visualizing the microcirculation and&#xD;
           evaluating the effects of interventions on microcirculatory flow in easily accessible&#xD;
           surfaces&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute kidney injury according to 'Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes' (KDIGO)&#xD;
           criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for renal replacement therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of intensive care stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: risks and benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the investigators are only performing noninvasive measurements, additional to&#xD;
      interventions, pharmacotherapy and measurements in shock patients, there will be no&#xD;
      contributing risk by study enrolment. Since there will be a more precise way for guidance of&#xD;
      fluid resuscitation in shock evoked by these study-specific measurements (bio-impedance&#xD;
      analysis, doppler analysis, CytoCam incident darkfield illumination), study patients might&#xD;
      even benefit from enrolment.&#xD;
