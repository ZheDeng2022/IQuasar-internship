  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine reliability of codes and data from electronic&#xD;
      medical records to predict and measure overdose and death in patients prescribed opioid&#xD;
      analgesics. The study will compare this electronic data to data manually obtained from&#xD;
      medical charts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of a series of post-marketing requirement (PMR) studies for extended-release (ER) and&#xD;
      long-acting (LA) opioid analgesics, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is requiring New&#xD;
      Drug Application (NDA) holders of ER/LA opioids to conduct studies to estimate the incidence&#xD;
      of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and death among patients with chronic pain using&#xD;
      long-term opioid therapy, and to validate the measures used to estimate the incidence of&#xD;
      these adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to validate the measurement of opioid overdose events using&#xD;
      diagnostic codes and data extracted from notes written in the electronic medical record&#xD;
      (EMR), accompanied by diagnostic algorithms, to be used in a study of the incidence and&#xD;
      predictors of opioid overdose and death (PMR Study 1B) among patients prescribed opioid&#xD;
      analgesics. Diagnostic codes, accompanied by diagnostic algorithms, will be compared against&#xD;
      manually abstracted medical chart reviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Code-based algorithms will be useful for identifying opioid overdoses in claims-based systems&#xD;
      that include only coded data and will also find applicability in systems with EMRs.&#xD;
      Code-based algorithms will be improved with text search of EMR clinical notations using&#xD;
      Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify overdose events not identified by diagnostic&#xD;
      codes and to differentiate between intentional and unintentional overdoses. Yield from the&#xD;
      resulting EMR-based algorithm will again be compared against manually abstracted medical&#xD;
      chart reviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This EMR-based algorithm will be useful for identifying opioid overdoses in systems with&#xD;
      EMRs, and for further differentiating between the causes of different types of overdoses. For&#xD;
      example, overdose events can be due to misuse (e.g., therapeutic use not as indicated by a&#xD;
      clinician), medication errors by patients, medical errors made by prescribers, abuse by&#xD;
      patients, abuse by non-patients feigning to be patients in order to receive medications; and&#xD;
      suicides. Overdose events therefore differ in intentionality, that is whether the person was&#xD;
      attempting suicide or not. Unintentional overdoses can occur as a result of various causes,&#xD;
      including misuse (therapeutic use but not consistent with clinician orders), abuse, adverse&#xD;
      reactions to medications, anesthesia, and medication errors-both patient and provider-based.&#xD;
      In addition, the distinction between unintentional and intentional overdoses can sometimes be&#xD;
      unclear. This validation study will attempt to differentiate overdose by intentionality using&#xD;
      both code-based algorithms and NLP-enhanced algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, administrative databases use ICD-9 codes for nonfatal diagnoses and ICD-10 codes&#xD;
      for fatal events. In October of 2015, ICD-10 codes are scheduled to replace ICD-9 codes for&#xD;
      nonfatal diagnoses in administrative databases. This study will validate existing ICD-9 codes&#xD;
      so that the study can meet the FDA-required timeline for a final report by November 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not evaluate misuse since this will be captured by instruments in a&#xD;
      prospective study of patients with chronic pain (PMR Study 1A) using a combination of adapted&#xD;
      validated instruments, and new instruments that will be evaluated in PMR Study 2. This study&#xD;
      will not include a formal validation for opioid-related deaths, since processes for coding&#xD;
      deaths vary from state to state, but will include some verification of opioid-related deaths&#xD;
      relative to medical records for events with available state and national death data (there is&#xD;
      a 12-month to 2-year lag in state death records).&#xD;
