      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Infectious Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (PI-ME/CFS) refers to&#xD;
      long-lasting and disabling fatigue or malaise, inability to recover after exercise, and&#xD;
      physical and emotional discomfort that may occur after a person has an infection. Researchers&#xD;
      want to learn more about its causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about PI-ME/CFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18-60 years who have finished at least 7th grade education and either:&#xD;
&#xD;
      have ME/CFS that started after an infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR had Lyme disease, were treated, and returned to normal health&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR are healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will initially have a 2-5 day inpatient visit at the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health Clinical Center in Bethesda. During the visit, participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous (IV) line. A thin plastic tube is inserted into a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of&#xD;
      their brain. They may get a dye through their IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grip strength tested&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva, cheek swab, and stool collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tilt table test with measures of body functions such as sweating and breathing, blood&#xD;
      pressure, and heart rate and blood and urine sample collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of blood cells. Participants can choose to have the blood drawn through the IV or&#xD;
      through a machine that filters blood cells and returns the liquid blood back into the&#xD;
      participant s vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar puncture. Fluid will be removed by placement of a needle between the back bones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep study for participants with PI ME/CFS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about the participant s life and how they are feeling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions from a neuropsychologist&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions from an occupational therapist for participants with PI ME/CFS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questinos from a nutritionist&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial visit participants will return home. Participants evaluated for PI-ME/CFS&#xD;
      during the first visit will have their information reviewed by an adjudication panel of&#xD;
      experts in the diagnosis and care of ME/CFS to determine if they are eligible to participate&#xD;
      in the second study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be invited back for a second study visit. If a participant was&#xD;
      taking certain medications during the first visit, they may be asked to taper off of them&#xD;
      prior to the second visit and report any problems. They will also receive an activity&#xD;
      monitor, fatigue diary, and nutrition log to use for at least one week prior to their second&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are eligible will return for a 5-10 day inpatient hospital visit at the&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. During the visit, participants will undergo&#xD;
      measurements before and up to 96 hours after performing a stationary bike exercise test. The&#xD;
      purpose of the exercise test is to provoke ME/CFS symptoms (post-exertional malaise). Tests&#xD;
      will be performed before and after exercise testing. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleeping in a room that measures how the body uses energy with EEG monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eating a controlled diet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing vigorous exercise for 10-15 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about how participants are feeling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about what participants usually eat&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of saliva, blood, urine and stool&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wearing an activity monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having an Xray that measures body composition&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thinking and memory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation. A brief electrical current to the scalp creates a magnetic&#xD;
      pulse that affects brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of&#xD;
      their brain. They will do thinking and exercise tasks during the MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar puncture. Fluid will be removed by placement of a needle between the back bones.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to explore the clinical and biological phenotypes of post-infectious&#xD;
      myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (PI-ME/CFS). The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      explore the pathophysiology of fatigue and post-exertional malaise (PEM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 206 persons will be enrolled as part of this protocol. Up to 150 persons aged 18-60&#xD;
      will be part of 3 study groups: 50 ME/CFS patients whose fatigue began after an infection, 50&#xD;
      non-fatigued participants with a documented history of a full recovery from COVID-19&#xD;
      infection, and 50 healthy volunteers. The study has a target of completing all study&#xD;
      procedures on 20 enrolled participants in each group. Up to an additional 36 persons&#xD;
      reporting a community diagnosis of ME/CFS will be enrolled into focus groups to discuss the&#xD;
      experience of post-exertional malaise. Up to an additional 10 healthy volunteers and 10&#xD;
      ME/CFS patients may be enrolled to refine the protocol's electrophysiological and&#xD;
      neuroimaging techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, exploratory, cross-sectional study of PI-ME/CFS. Participants will&#xD;
      have a phenotyping visit, which will encompass a 2-5 day long inpatient admission at the NIH&#xD;
      Clinical Center. Case status for ME/CFS participants will be determined after the phenotyping&#xD;
      visit by a case adjudication process utilizing an expert physician committee and published&#xD;
      guidelines. Adjudicated participants meeting inclusion criteria will be invited back to&#xD;
      participate in an exercise stress visit, which will encompass a 5-10 day long inpatient&#xD;
      admission. Detailed subjective and objective measurements and biological specimens will be&#xD;
      serially collected before and up to 96 hours after a peak exercise test capable of inducing&#xD;
      post-exertional malaise during this visit. All procedures will be completed on all three&#xD;
      study groups to allow for optimal inter-group comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this protocol is to perform exploratory analysis of collected samples&#xD;
      for the generation of new hypotheses regarding ME/CFS. The types of analyses to be performed&#xD;
      will be wide ranging. Planned areas of focus include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characterization of the immune system and inflammatory signaling in collected samples at&#xD;
           baseline and following maximal exercise exertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Characterization of the pattern of microbiome in collected samples at baseline and&#xD;
&#xD;
           following maximal exercise exertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Characterization of bioenergetics, autonomic, and metabolic function in collected&#xD;
&#xD;
           samples at baseline and following maximal exercise exertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Characterization of physical and cognitive fatigue using functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
           imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation at baseline and following maximal exercise&#xD;
           exertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Characterization of neurocognition at baseline and following maximal exercise exertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Characterization of brain function and connectivity at baseline and following maximal&#xD;
           exercise exertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Characterization of autonomic function at baseline and following maximal exercise&#xD;
           exertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Characterization of gene expression profiles in collected samples at baseline and&#xD;
           following maximal exercise exertion.&#xD;

             the duration of the period of the exercise stress visit. The possibility for a&#xD;
             potential participant to be weaned off medication will be cooperatively determined by&#xD;
             both the clinical investigative team and personal physicians. Examples of medications&#xD;
             that influence brain excitability include tricyclic antidepressants, hypnotic,&#xD;
             antiepileptic, antipsychotic medication, stimulants, antihistamines, muscle relaxants,&#xD;
             dopaminergic medications, and sleep medications.&#xD;
