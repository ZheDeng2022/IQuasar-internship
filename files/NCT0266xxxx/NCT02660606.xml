  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the patient usability and reliability of the POMAQ&#xD;
      survey to evaluate opioid misuse and abuse among adults with chronic moderate to severe pain,&#xD;
      including patients who are opioid abusers, non-abusers, as well as non-opioid users&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested, as part of a post-marketing requirement&#xD;
      (PMR) for new drug application (NDA) holders of extended release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioids,&#xD;
      to conduct a study to develop and validate a measure of the opioid-related adverse events&#xD;
      misuse and abuse among patients with chronic pain prescribed long-term opioid therapy. This&#xD;
      measure will be used to assess misuse and abuse in PMR Study 2065-1A and PMR Study 2065-4B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no tool exists to meet this need except for the Self-report Misuse, Abuse and&#xD;
      Diversion of Prescription (Rx) Opioids questionnaire (SR-MAD) which has undergone several&#xD;
      rounds of prior content validation. The SR-MAD has been modified to meet the needs of PMR&#xD;
      Studies 2065-1A and 2065-4B, and has been renamed the Prescription Opioid Misuse and Abuse&#xD;
      Questionnaire (POMAQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will seek to further develop and validate the POMAQ using the the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry, Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical&#xD;
      Product Development to Support Labeling Claims (FDA 2009) as a reference for conducting&#xD;
      qualitative research throughout the process of instrument development to ensure the content&#xD;
      validity of a measure and to evaluate the comprehensibility of included questions. This&#xD;
      qualitative study to evaluate content validity will be conducted prior to the quantitative&#xD;
      study to evaluate construct validity&#xD;
