    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, single agent, open label, exploratory translational research study in&#xD;
      patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma being treated with Pembrolizumab.&#xD;
      Suitable patients will undergo serial surgical core biopsies (nonradiological) of&#xD;
      subcutaneous or lymph node metastases (as judged by an Oncological Surgical Consultant). As a&#xD;
      primary endpoint, the investigators will assess the safety and feasibility of undergoing&#xD;
      these biopsies within the patient cohort. A total of forty patients will be recruited over a&#xD;
      period of two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have provided consent and satisfied the eligibility criteria will undergo&#xD;
      baseline CT scanning and peripheral blood sampling. At baseline, biopsies of suitable&#xD;
      metastatic lesions will be undertaken and samples sent for histopathological assessment and&#xD;
      analysis of molecular and immune parameters. Participants will be treated with Pembrolizumab,&#xD;
      200mg, intravenously, every 3 weeks. At 6 weeks following commencement of Pembrolizumab&#xD;
      therapy, a further biopsy or excision of metastatic disease will be performed, unless&#xD;
      considered no longer possible on the basis of a near or complete response to treatment. Blood&#xD;
      sampling will be performed prior to each cycle and repeat CT scanning will occur every 9&#xD;
      weeks. Response evaluations will be performed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Pembrolizumab&#xD;
      will be continued as long as study participants are deriving benefit and further biopsies of&#xD;
      progressing lesions will be performed where possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to evaluate the safety and feasibility of obtaining serial tumour&#xD;
      biopsies or excisions of metastatic disease during treatment with Pembrolizumab with&#xD;
      exploration of the i) mechanistic activity of Pembrolizumab, ii) identification of&#xD;
      intratumoural and peripheral factors limiting response, iii) identification of candidate&#xD;
      predictive biomarker panels based on (i) and (ii) and iii) use of circulating free DNA&#xD;
      (cfDNA) as a surrogate marker of response and guide to duration of therapy.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is to assess the feasibility of obtaining sequential tumour biopsies will be achieved when sequential biopsies (at baseline, week 6 and at disease progression), have successfully been carried out in a minimum of 75% of patients (i.e. 29 out of 40).The percentage of patients with complete tumour response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) will be tabulated. Associated 95% CI will be provided for response rates. The duration of objective response (for patients with CR and PR) will be defined as the time from initial CR or PR to the time of disease progression or death (whichever occurs first). For patients who do not die or experience PD, duration of objective response will be censored on the day of the last tumour assessment.</description>

    <description>Complication rate will be defined as the proportion of patients who have hospital admission due to complication of biopsy e.g. infection/bleeding/pain control and/or delay in Pembrolizumab treatment due to complication of biopsy.
