  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Front-line clinicians cannot currently test for an individual participant whether symptoms&#xD;
      experienced are the pharmacological result of a statin or due to other phenomena. In this&#xD;
      trial, participants who have previously ceased statins due to side effects will be offered&#xD;
      the opportunity to undergo twelve randomly ordered 1-month periods. There will be four&#xD;
      periods of no medication, four periods of placebo and four periods of statin. The placebo and&#xD;
      the statin pills will be identical in appearance. Participants will record on a daily basis&#xD;
      side-effects experienced. At the end of the study, the one-month sessions are sorted into the&#xD;
      order shown above. The participant can then observe directly how much of the increase in&#xD;
      symptoms seen with statin is also seen with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hypothesis 1: that &gt;30% of participants enrolling for the study will complete it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis 2: Overall &gt;50% of symptom burden is nocebo rather than pharmacological&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The investigators will define the Nocebo proportion of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hypothesis 3: that the majority of participants, at 6 months after completion, will&#xD;
           either be taking statins or have declined statins for reasons other than perceived side&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;

      Participants: 50 participants will be recruited to the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: At baseline each participant will have a detailed interview with the study doctor to&#xD;
      assess past medical history and previous symptoms attributed to statins and assess if they&#xD;
      are eligible to be enrolled. Eligible participants will be enrolled on InForm which will&#xD;
      allocate each participant a random predefined order to take the study interventions in. These&#xD;
      random codes will be generated by the trials unit statistician and supplied to the production&#xD;
      pharmacy. The participant will be dispensed High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) containers which&#xD;
      are in this pre-specified order assigned on inform. Each participant will receive 12 sets of&#xD;
      HDPE containers pre-labelled. 4 sets of HDPE containers will contain no medication, 4 will&#xD;
      contain 1-month supply of matched placebo and 4 will contain 1-month supply of atorvastatin&#xD;
      20mg. At the start of the next calendar month after the screening visit the participants will&#xD;
      commence the trial intervention. The research nurse will call the participant to remind them&#xD;
      to start on the 1st day of the next month after screening and thereafter the participants&#xD;
      will also receive a monthly reminder on their phone to switch to the next set of HDPE&#xD;
      containers each month. Each day participants will rate their daily symptom on a phone&#xD;
      application and will also complete 3 additional questionnaires on a monthly basis. The study&#xD;
      nurse will call the participant at the end of each month to assess their progress in the&#xD;
      trial. Each participants will return their boxes at dispensing visits (if applicable) and at&#xD;
      the study end in order for a pill count to be undertaken to assess medication adherence. The&#xD;
      placebo and atorvastatin pills will be visually identical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study enrolls participants not intending to re-start clinical use of statins.&#xD;
      Participants' other medications will continue to be managed as normal by their own&#xD;
      physicians, with no restriction on starting, stopping or changing doses For safety reasons&#xD;
      the participant's own physician will be asked to consult the investigators prior to&#xD;
      consideration of starting, or amending the dose of, any other lipid lowering medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES For the trial, each participant will receive a smartphone or if&#xD;
      preferred can have the application downloaded to their existing phone to allow real-time&#xD;
      daily documentation of symptoms experienced on a visual analogue scale of 0-100. Participants&#xD;
      will receive training on the simple touch-screen interface and a leaflet with further&#xD;
      information will also be provided. There is an optional daily reminder that can be disabled&#xD;
      if intrusive. Participants will rate symptoms every day, with the daily scores aggregated&#xD;
      into a monthly score. This is preferable over scoring only once a month, because participants&#xD;
      may struggle to remember and aggregate their symptom burden especially if it varies between&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each month participants will fill out two validated questionnaires on the impact of their&#xD;
      side-effects on their quality of life. These are EuroQol (EQ-5D-3L), a well-validated measure&#xD;
      of health related quality of life, and the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medicine&#xD;
      (TSQM) questionnaire, a validated treatment satisfaction questionnaire. EQ-5D-3L assesses&#xD;
      five domains of health and overall self-rated health using a visual analogue scale. EQ-5D-3L&#xD;
      is conventional for assessing efficacy of medication on quality of life but may not be&#xD;
      sufficient for assessing side effects, therefore the TSQM questionnaire will also be used.&#xD;
      Use of both a health related quality of life questionnaire and a treatment satisfaction&#xD;
      questionnaire will allow assessment of participants' multiple health states, overall&#xD;
      self-rated health status and treatment satisfaction, and provide a test of both convergent&#xD;
      validity and measurement invariance for the monthly aggregate symptom burden score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also ask participants to fill in a short questionnaire detailing any&#xD;
      potentially their own physicians, with no restriction on starting, stopping or changing doses&#xD;
      For safety reasons the participant's own physician will be asked to consult the investigators&#xD;
      prior to consideration of starting, or amending the dose of, any other lipid lowering&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;

    <description>The individual nocebo proportion will be calculated at the end of the 12-months of the trial for each participant. The mean symptom scores for the four months on each arm will be calculated: placebo (mN) , Atorvastatin 20mg OD (mA) and no treatment (mZ). The Nocebo Proportion is (mN-mZ)/(mA-mZ). Let the averages of these standard deviations be respectively sA, sN, sZ. As long as mZ is small compared to mA and mN, and sA is not large in relation to mA, a reasonable approximation to the fractional standard error of the nocebo proportion will be calculated: (mN-mZ)/(mA-mZ) is (sA/mA + sN/mN) /112.</description>
