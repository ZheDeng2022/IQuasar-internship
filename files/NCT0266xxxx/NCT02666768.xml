      This study evaluates the effects of ACTIMMUNE (IFN-γ1b) in children and adults with&#xD;
      intermediate osteoporosis. All participants will receive treatment with ACTIMMUNE for 12&#xD;
      months. The investigators hypothesize that ACTIMMUNE will be tolerated by participants for&#xD;
      the full 12 months and result in decreased disease severity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteopetrosis is a rare inherited metabolic bone disease characterized by impaired osteoclast&#xD;
      function resulting in defective bone resorption and generalized high bone mass and mineral&#xD;
      density (BMD). In patients with severe disease, this high bone mass compromises bone marrow&#xD;
      space leading to marrow failure and frequent infections, along with hepatosplenomegaly from&#xD;
      extramedullary hematopoiesis. Currently, the only treatment for individuals with severe forms&#xD;
      of osteopetrosis is hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), however survival in patients&#xD;
      with osteopetrosis treated with HCT is only around 55%. Therefore, this treatment is only&#xD;
      indicated in select individuals with life-threatening complications of their disease. Thus&#xD;
      additional treatments for osteopetrosis are needed both for individuals who are not&#xD;
      candidates for HCT and to prolong the time until HCT is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) is a naturally occurring cytokine that has been shown to have&#xD;
      anti-microbial and anti-viral immunomodulatory effects, and is a potent stimulator of&#xD;
      superoxide anion production which in turn promotes the formation and activation of&#xD;
      osteoclasts. Two previous studies of IFN-γ1b in a small group of individuals with&#xD;
      osteopetrosis found a decrease in trabecular bone area, an increase in marrow space, a&#xD;
      decrease in the number of severe infections requiring antibiotic therapy, and an increase in&#xD;
      superoxide generation by granulocyte-macrophage colonies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators will conduct an early phase 2, multi-center, open-label,&#xD;
      12-month clinical trial of ACTIMMUNE (IFN-γ1b) treatment of patients with intermediate&#xD;
      osteopetrosis to determine the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The feasibility and tolerability of interferon gamma-1b treatment for 1 year in patients&#xD;
           with intermediate osteopetrosis. Specifically, i) the ability to enroll patients, and&#xD;
           ii) continued treatment throughout the 1-year observational period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change in immunologic and hematologic function, bone mineral density and osteoclast&#xD;
           function, physical function and quality of life.&#xD;
