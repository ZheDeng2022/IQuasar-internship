    <textblock>
      Low blood sodium is a common observation in patients presenting with heart failure and is&#xD;
      associated with increased mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and repeat hospital visits.&#xD;
      Tolvaptan is a new and approved medication to treat low sodium levels in patients who present&#xD;
      with symptoms of heart failure, however, it is not currently available as a treatment option&#xD;
      due to high costs not covered by our provincial plan. In this observational, non-randomized&#xD;
      study the drug will be provided to all subjects free of charge and given only during their&#xD;
      hospital stay. After discharge subjects will be followed for 6 months (3 visits).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Purpose: A prospective, open-label, real life registry of Tolvaptan in hospitalized heart&#xD;
      failure patients with hyponatremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Administration of Tolvaptan in hospitalized patients with heart failure and&#xD;
      hyponatremia will demonstrate improvements in patient symptom status and cost savings from&#xD;
      decreased healthcare utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: In clinical trials, Tolvaptan has been shown to quickly, effectively, and&#xD;
      safely improve sodium levels in heart failure patients, and decrease the length of hospital&#xD;
      stay and improve symptom status compared to placebo. Although Tolvaptan is an approved drug&#xD;
      in Canada for the treatment of patients hospitalized with heart failure and hyponatremia, its&#xD;
      availability is limited to private buyers and not available on hospital formularies due to&#xD;
      cost constraints. There are no alternatives to this first in class agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary endpoint is reduction in length of stay for heart failure in registry&#xD;
      participants compared to length of stay in the Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) administrative&#xD;
      data set. Secondary endpoints will include recurrent hospitalization, change in quality of&#xD;
      life, and B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) levels over the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method: Patients admitted to Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) with heart failure and&#xD;
      hyponatremia will be identified through clinical referral by cardiologists who have ensured&#xD;
      that all other measures have been undertaken to improve the patient's clinical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolvaptan is dispensed according to product monograph and clinician discretion, and will be&#xD;
      discontinued once serum sodium is normalized, or in the case of a drug related adverse event&#xD;
      or hospital discharge. Bloodwork will be drawn to monitor liver function and electrolytes&#xD;
      during hospitalization and in follow up. Data will be captured from time of consent until 6&#xD;
      months after hospital discharge.&#xD;
