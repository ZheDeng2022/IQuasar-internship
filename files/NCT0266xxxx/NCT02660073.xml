  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating medical problem that affects thousands of civilian&#xD;
      and military personnel in the United States. Spinal cord injuries (SCI) predispose&#xD;
      individuals to impaired fitness, obesity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, placing&#xD;
      them at greater risk for diabetes and coronary artery disease. These are devastating problems&#xD;
      that occur frequently because of changes in body composition and reduced level of physical&#xD;
      activity. Skeletal muscle wasting plays a central role in altered metabolism after SCI.&#xD;
      Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is an effective rehabilitation tool that has been&#xD;
      used to train the paralyzed skeletal muscles and which has shown some ability to ameliorate&#xD;
      the deleterious effects of SCI on metabolism, particularly on insulin sensitivity. However,&#xD;
      its ability to reverse skeletal muscle wasting is modest; most studies report limited gains&#xD;
      in muscle mass and workload with highly variables outcomes from one study to another. This&#xD;
      proposal was stimulated by the findings that a program of neuromuscular electrical&#xD;
      stimulation resistance exercise prior to initiating functional electrical stimulation lower&#xD;
      extremity cycling (FES-LEC) improves the gains in muscle mass and workload observed with FES.&#xD;
      The specific objectives for the current proposal are to compare the impact of FES following&#xD;
      evoking skeletal muscle hypertrophy of the lower extremity versus initiating FES cycling&#xD;
      without introducing the hypertrophy effects on insulin sensitivity, control of blood sugar&#xD;
      levels, oxygen uptake and amounts of muscle tissue and fat deposition. These studies could&#xD;
      potentially have significant effects on thousands of people that will experience an SCI in&#xD;
      the future as well as those living with SCI where prolonged paralysis is a major quality of&#xD;
      life issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a major need to investigate the mechanisms lead to maximize the benefits of FES&#xD;
      applications and to understand cellular or molecular events that are associated with muscle&#xD;
      hypertrophy and lead to promoting metabolic health after SCI. The designed study will provide&#xD;
      a greater understanding regarding utilization of energy sources (like fats and sugars) in&#xD;
      muscle&#xD;

      Primary Objectives Aim #1: To determine the impact of 12+12 weeks of neuromuscular electrical&#xD;
      stimulation (NMES)+FES-LEC on oxygen uptake, insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in adults&#xD;
      with SCI compared to control + FES-LEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: To determine the impact of 12+12 weeks of NMES+FES-LEC on skeletal muscle size,&#xD;
      infiltration of intramuscular fat, visceral adiposity as well as fatigue resistance compared&#xD;
      to control+ FES-LEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Aim #3 : To determine the impact of 12+12 weeks of NMES+FES-LEC on determinants of energy&#xD;
      metabolism, protein molecules involved in insulin signaling, muscle hypertrophy and oxygen&#xD;
      uptake (IRS-1, adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK), glucose transporter (GLUT-4), insulin&#xD;
      like growth factor (IGF-1), Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Peroxisome&#xD;
      proliferator-activated receptor coactivator (PGC-1 alpha) and electron transport chain&#xD;
      proteins compared to control + FES-LEC only.&#xD;
