  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year &gt; 50.000 people in Denmark are hospitalized with a suspected acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (AMI). The majority has other explanations of their chest discomfort and most are&#xD;
      discharged again without any initiation of treatment. Still, the suspicion dictates acute&#xD;
      ambulance deployment, hospital admission to a highly specialized cardiac unit, cardiac&#xD;
      surveillance and cardiac troponin blood sampling. The novel biomarker copeptin, a byproduct&#xD;
      of vasopressin production, is released immediately from the pituitary gland as part of the&#xD;
      hormonal response to AMI. Peak concentrations are reached within the first hour. Previous&#xD;
      studies have suggested the combination of copeptin and cardiac troponin for fast and reliable&#xD;
      rule out of AMI. However, the blood sampling should be performed as soon as possible after&#xD;
      symptom onset, preferably already during the prehospital phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim, in an open randomized setting, to investigate the combined measurement of prehospital&#xD;
      copeptin and in-hospital high sensitive cardiac Troponin T compared to the standard rule-out&#xD;
      procedure of suspected myocardial infarction. We hypothesize that the combined measurement of&#xD;
      prehospital copeptin and in-hospital high sensitive troponin T:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduces admission time by 1.5 hours in patients where AMI is ruled out&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduces the time to disposition&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is non-inferior compared to the standard rule-out procedure in relation to major adverse&#xD;
           cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is more cost efficient compared to standard diagnostic strategy&#xD;

      Patients with suspected Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) constitute one of the largest&#xD;
      patient groups in emergency medicine. The majority of these patients, however, have other&#xD;
      causes than AMI, for their chest discomfort and many are discharged again without any&#xD;
      initiation of treatment.(1) At present, cardiac troponin is gold standard in diagnosing AMI.&#xD;
      Diagnostic levels of troponin are not reached until hours after onset of symptoms and serial&#xD;
      sampling is recommended at intervals of 3-6 hours to confirm or rule-out AMI. The novel&#xD;
      biomarker copeptin, a by-product of vasopressin production, is released immediately from the&#xD;
      pituitary gland as part of the hormonal response to AMI. However, copeptin elevation, is not&#xD;
      specific of AMI. Peak concentrations of copeptin are reached within the first hour and the&#xD;
      values normalizes within 4-10 hours.(3) Previous studies have suggested the combination of&#xD;
      copeptin and high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) for early and reliable rule-out of&#xD;
      AMI.(2,3,6) These studies are based on copeptin measurement in blood sample acquired at&#xD;
      hospital admission. However, because of the rapid release of copeptin, the blood sampling&#xD;
      should be performed as early as possible after symptom onset, preferably already in the&#xD;
      ambulance, whereas the analysis can be performed after arrival at the hospital because&#xD;
      copeptin is stable. The PREHAB trial conducted in the Central Denmark Region, documented that&#xD;
      prehospital blood sampling is performed 70 minutes earlier than first in-hospital sample.(5)&#xD;
      Post-trial analysis of blood samples from the PREHAP trial has demonstrated the potential for&#xD;
      early and safe rule-out of AMI using the combination of prehospital copeptin and in-hospital&#xD;
      troponin analysis. AMI could potentially be safely, ruled out in approximately 40-50% of&#xD;
      patients, in whom the AMI diagnosis eventually was dismissed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last 7 years, studies have evaluated the effect and validity of prehospital blood&#xD;
      sample analysis. This is now standard procedure in The Central Denmark Region, Denmark.(5)&#xD;
      Currently, prehospital blood sampling is carried out in two major randomized studies, aiming&#xD;
      at identifying patients with myocardial infarction and heart failure (NCT01638806 and&#xD;
      NCT02050282).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there is at present no point-of-care analysis equipment for copeptin&#xD;
      available. Manufacturer of copeptin analysis equipment, Thermo Fischer, has informed that the&#xD;
      development of point-care-care equipment is in process, but will not be available in near&#xD;
      future. Therefore, we will perform in-hospital analysis of the prehospital blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall aim of this protocol is to demonstrate the combination of troponin T and copeptin as&#xD;
      a safe and effective biomarker for rule-out of AMI. In a randomized setting, we will compare&#xD;
      the combination of prehospital copeptin and in hospital hs-cTnT, to the standard diagnostic&#xD;
      procedure in patients with suspected AMI, evaluating rule-out potential and potential for&#xD;
      reduction of the length of stay at the hospital. The diagnostic effects of measuring&#xD;
      copeptin/ hs-cTnT in prehospital vs in-hospital blood samples will be evaluated. Moreover an&#xD;
      other diagnostic rule-out strategy, using hs-cTNT at admission and 1 hour after admission,&#xD;
      will be evaluated in retrospective analysis of blood samples acquired from patients in the&#xD;
      conventional diagnostics arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary purposes of the AROMI trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate if early discharge, based in the combined biomarker analysis is associated&#xD;
           to duration of hospital stay. Will be evaluated in interim analysis after rule out of&#xD;
           AMI(discharged within 12 hours) in 900 patients (300 patients in each site)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate if early discharge, based in the combined biomarker analysis is associated&#xD;
           to major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during index admission, after discharge, within&#xD;
           30, 90, and 365 days of randomization (separately or in combination). No interim&#xD;
           evaluation of MACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary purposes of the AROMI trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate if early discharge, based in the combined biomarker analysis is associated&#xD;
           to time to decision of discharge or continued hospitalization. Will be evaluated in&#xD;
           interim analysis after rule out of AMI(discharged within 12 hours) in 900 patients (300&#xD;
           patients in each site)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate if early discharge, based in the combined biomarker analysis is&#xD;
           cost-effective regarding satisfaction and safety from a patients perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate if early discharge, based in the combined biomarker analysis is&#xD;
           cost-effective from a public perspective, regarding staff resources, costs of hospital&#xD;
           stay, adherence to the labour market, and use of other healthcare services, Cost benefit&#xD;
           analysis(CBA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate if early discharge, based on the hs-cTnT analysis at arrival and 1 hour&#xD;
           after arrival at hospital is associated to duration of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate if early discharge, based on the hs-cTnT analysis at arrival and 1 hour&#xD;
           after arrival at hospital is associated to MACE(major adverse cardiac event) during&#xD;
           index admission, after discharge, within 30, 90, and 365 days of randomization&#xD;
           (separately or in combination).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate the diagnostic properties (including sensitivity, specificity, negative&#xD;
           predictive value, and positive predictive value) of the accelerated rule out algorithm&#xD;
           using copeptin and high sensitivity troponin. Will be evaluated in interim analysis&#xD;
           after rule out of AMI(discharged within 12 hours) in 900 patients (300 patients in each&#xD;
           site). Will be evaluated in the total cohort (since both prehospital and inhospital&#xD;
           copeptin and high sensitivity troponin is available in all patients) and randomization&#xD;
           will not be revealed during this evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To evaluate the prognostic value of the accelerated rule out algorithm using copeptin&#xD;
           and high sensitivity troponin. Will be evaluated in interim analysis after rule out of&#xD;
           AMI(discharged within 12 hours) in 900 patients (300 patients in each site). Will be&#xD;
           evaluated in the total cohort (since both prehospital and inhospital copeptin and high&#xD;
           sensitivity troponin is available in all patients) and randomization will not be&#xD;
           revealed during this evaluation.&#xD;
