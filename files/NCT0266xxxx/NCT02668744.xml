  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators recently completed an NIH R21 grant, which was a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) to test the effects of a gardening, nutrition, and cooking program in 375&#xD;
      low-income Hispanic students living in Los Angeles. Preliminary results from this study show&#xD;
      that intervention compared to the control students have reductions in BMI parameters and&#xD;
      waist circumference, increases in daily intake of dietary fiber and vegetables, and improved&#xD;
      lipid profiles. The investigators want to expand and replicate this study by: a) using a&#xD;
      cluster randomized school design; b) implementing the program during school hours; c)&#xD;
      increasing sample size; d) lengthening the intervention period to one school year; e)&#xD;
      collecting comprehensive metabolic measurements on the child; f) enhancing family workshops;&#xD;
      g) collecting more parental data; and h) developing and evaluating sustainability strategies.&#xD;
      Thus, the overall goal of this project is to test the effects of a large school-based&#xD;
      gardening, nutrition, and cooking RCT (called &quot;Sprouts&quot;) on dietary intake, dietary-related&#xD;
      behaviors, obesity, and related metabolic disorders in low-income Hispanic youth and their&#xD;
      families in Central Texas. Sixteen elementary schools will be randomized to either: 1)&#xD;
      Sprouts intervention or 2) Control (delayed intervention). At each intervention school, the&#xD;
      investigators will build edible gardens; form and train Garden Leadership Coalitions (GLCs);&#xD;
      teach 20 Sprouts in-school lessons to the students; and teach nine family-based Sprouts&#xD;
      lessons throughout school year. The following measures will be obtained for students at&#xD;
      baseline and post-intervention: height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, body composition&#xD;
      (via bioimpedance), blood pressure, glucose, insulin, and lipids (via voluntary fasting blood&#xD;
      draws), dietary intake, and related psychosocial behaviors (e.g.,&#xD;
      preference/motivation/self-efficacy to eat FV). The investigators will also measure&#xD;
      anthropometrics, dietary intake, and related dietary psychosocial variables on the parents at&#xD;
      baseline and post-intervention. After the intervention year, the investigators will provide a&#xD;
      series of training workshops and resources to the GLCs and schoolteachers to sustain the&#xD;
      Sprouts program in subsequent years. The investigators will measure the sustainability&#xD;
      employed by each school by process logs/surveys, structured interviews, and school&#xD;
      observations.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Garden Leadership Coalition (GLC): The investigators will establish GLCs at each of the&#xD;
      schools during the intervention phase, which will facilitate some of the school-level&#xD;
      components of the intervention. These GLCs will be comprised of interested teachers, school&#xD;
      staff, senior citizens, parents, and children, but these groups will be different and unique&#xD;
      at each school site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Edible Gardens: Raised beds will be used at all garden sites, as these are easy to build,&#xD;
      make garden access easy for children of all developmental levels, ensure that soils are free&#xD;
      of heavy metals/contaminants, and reduce weeds in the garden area. Each school site will get&#xD;
      the materials and supplies needed for garden upkeep and for teaching the lessons,.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curriculum: A total of 18 lessons (1 hour each) will be taught weekly over the course of the&#xD;
      intervention year. The curriculum is culturally tailored to Hispanics, including culturally&#xD;
      appropriate recipes, content, and activities. The curriculum is mapped on State of Texas&#xD;
      Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) standards for science, math, language arts, health,&#xD;
      and social studies. The 9 parent lessons (each 1 hour long) will parallel the nutrition and&#xD;
      gardening topics/activities taught to the children. The parent curriculum is available in&#xD;
      both English and Spanish and has been culturally adapted and evaluated. The curriculum has a&#xD;
      strong emphasis on the cooking components and focuses on growing and cooking foods that are&#xD;
      culturally appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      School Lessons: The investigators will hire bilingual nutrition and garden educators who have&#xD;
      experience teaching nutrition/ gardening programs to teach the Sprouts curriculum. Lessons&#xD;
      will be taught by our educators separately to each 3rd-5th grade classroom throughout the&#xD;
      school year as part of their normal school day. Although nutrition and garden educators will&#xD;
      be provided to teach these lessons the first year, the schoolteachers will attend all of&#xD;
      these lessons, providing the initial training for them to continue the program in subsequent&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family Lessons at Schools: The bilingual garden/nutrition educators will also teach monthly&#xD;
      Sprouts lessons throughout the school year for the families of participants at each of the&#xD;
      schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed Intervention to Control Schools: The control schools will receive a delayed&#xD;
      intervention (identical intervention as described above) in the year after the post-testing&#xD;
      for that wave. Baseline and post-intervention measurements will occur in the control parents&#xD;
      and students within the same time period as the intervention schools. Every control school&#xD;
      will receive a garden, identical in size and structure to the intervention schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation Measures: Evaluation measures will be collected at baseline and end of the school&#xD;
      year in both arms (intervention and control schools). Measurements will occur during the&#xD;
      first four weeks of school in the fall and the last four weeks of school in the spring. Most&#xD;
      measures on children will be collected at the schools during normal school hours, whereas the&#xD;
      blood draw will be collected on school campuses before school starts. Parent questionnaires&#xD;
      will be handed out or mailed to the homes after consent is obtained. The questionnaires are&#xD;
      translated into Spanish, culturally appropriate, and take ~60 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometrics, Body Fat, and Blood Pressure: For both children and parents, weight will be&#xD;
      measured using a digital scale to the nearest 0.1 kg, and height will be measured using a&#xD;
      wall-mounted stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm. BMI (kg/m2) and BMI percentiles for the&#xD;
      Center for Disease Control (CDC) age- and gender-specific values will be used. Waist&#xD;
      circumferences (WC) will be measured and recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm. Body composition&#xD;
      will be assessed using Bioelectrical Impedance with the Tanita Body Fat Analyzer. Blood&#xD;
      pressure will be obtained in duplicate with an automatic cuff according to recommendations of&#xD;
      the American Heart Association. Parental height, weight, body fat, WC, and blood pressure&#xD;
      will be collected at first and last family workshop (expecting a subsample only). Therefore&#xD;
      the investigators will ask self-reported height and weight in questionnaire packets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Intake: The questionnaire will use the School Physical Activity and Nutrition Project&#xD;
      diet intake questions, which was designed to assess children's intake by food group, with a&#xD;
      specific focus on fruit and fruit juices, vegetables, potatoes (including and excluding&#xD;
      French fries), whole grains, meat/poultry/fish, dairy, legumes, saturated fat, and &quot;added&#xD;
      sugars&quot; (in sweetened cereals, soft drinks, and sweets). The investigators will also collect&#xD;
      24-hour diet recalls in a subset of children. Trained interviewers will collect three recalls&#xD;
      by telephone. All recall data will be analyzed using the Nutrition Data System for Research&#xD;
      (NDS-R 2012, University of Minnesota).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and Dietary Psychosocial Measures: Demographic information including age,&#xD;
      socioeconomic status and ethnicity will be obtained via a questionnaire. Parents will fill&#xD;
      out a brief medical history form for their child and themselves to rule out exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Children and parents will complete questionnaires to assess preference and&#xD;
      motivation for fruit and vegetable Intake, self-efficacy to garden, cook, and eat FV, food&#xD;
      insecurities, and home eating environment. All parent questionnaires will be available in&#xD;
      both English and Spanish, and written at a 3rd grade reading level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting Blood Sample: Certified phlebotomists will perform the fasting blood draws on&#xD;
      students first thing in the morning before school starts at the schools at baseline and at&#xD;
      the end of the school year. Students with parental consent and assent will participate in the&#xD;
      blood draw. Students who do not assent to participate in the blood draw will still be allowed&#xD;
      to participate in the Sprouts program. Fasting blood will be drawn to assess glucose,&#xD;
      insulin, lipids, and adipocytokines. Blood samples will be spun, aliquoted, frozen, and&#xD;
      transported to the University of Texas (UT) campus for assaying. All children with elevated&#xD;
      glucose levels (in the abnormal or Type 2 diabetes range) or elevated blood pressure will be&#xD;
      contacted via telephone by Dr. Pont (Co-I on this study) to explain the test results and be&#xD;
      referred immediately to a health clinic for follow-up. However, these children will still be&#xD;
      allowed to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Train the Trainer Workshops: At the beginning of the sustainability year, our educators will&#xD;
      lead three &quot;train the trainer&quot; workshops. Schoolteachers will be given complete curriculum&#xD;
      manuals, electronic copies of all student curriculum, and have access to all teaching&#xD;
      material needed for every lesson. The workshops will connect teachers to community resources&#xD;
      and will train the teachers in: structure/flow of lessons, all lesson activities/content,&#xD;
      cooking/preparation skills, and available resources/materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sustainability Measures: During the Sprouts intervention and sustainability year, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect pilot data on sustainability strategies being implemented in both&#xD;
      the intervention and control schools. Structured interviews will be conducted with GLC&#xD;
      members to document member information, leadership structure, meeting times/places, how the&#xD;
      garden was designed/built, workshops offered/attended, fundraising and media events, types of&#xD;
      produce harvested, produce use and distribution plans, community resources leveraged,&#xD;
      barriers and future action plans. Structured interviews will be conducted with teachers,&#xD;
      principals, administration staff, GLCs, and district directors and staff to evaluate various&#xD;
      aspects of the program including: a) use and maintenance of garden; b) successful and&#xD;
      unsuccessful components/strategies implemented to sustain program; and c) additional&#xD;
      material/resources/training requested and/or needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Screening/Recruitment: Sixteen elementary schools will be allocated to either&#xD;
      Sprouts intervention (n=8 schools) or Control group (n=8 schools). All participants and their&#xD;
      parents will have to sign assent and consent forms, approved by UT-Austin's Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board. Based on previous intervention work with Hispanic communities, the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate ~50% of parents will consent for their children to participate, and&#xD;
      their children will complete all the baseline measures. The investigators anticipate 15%&#xD;
      attrition at post-intervention measurement due to parents/students moving away or being sick&#xD;
      or absent from school. Based on parental participation rates in Los Angeles (LA) Sprouts, the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate that 25% of parents will return parental baseline questionnaires,&#xD;
      and the investigators assume a 15% attrition rate at post-testing. Based on blood draw&#xD;
      participation rates in LA Sprouts, the investigators anticipate that 50% of participating&#xD;
      children (n=1,200) will also participate in the blood draws at pre-intervention and 40%&#xD;
      (n=960 or 60 per school) at post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Analyses: Data will be merged, edited, and cleaned using system files&#xD;
      created with REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), which is a secure web application for&#xD;
      building and managing databases. The database is ideal for field data collection and will be&#xD;
      accessible to all key personnel at any location. All data will be entered using the double&#xD;
      data entry method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary statistics, graphical analyses, and frequency distributions will be used to describe&#xD;
      the data between the intervention and control groups. Data will be transformed if needed. The&#xD;
      investigators will handle missing data using two primary approaches: multiple imputation and&#xD;
      full information maximum likelihood estimation methods. For Aim 1: The investigators will&#xD;
      test if the children and parents participating in Sprouts compared to control will have&#xD;
      increased changes in average consumption of vegetable servings per day and decreased average&#xD;
      changes in BMI z-scores, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and insulin using well-known&#xD;
      statistical methods for cluster randomized trials. Several analytic strategies will be&#xD;
      employed to determine the effect of the intervention on vegetable intake and many of the&#xD;
      other primary outcome variables. The investigators plan to conduct a two-stage nested&#xD;
      analysis of variance model, which is a special case of the mixed effects linear regression&#xD;
      model also known as a repeated measures analysis of variance model. The terms in the model&#xD;
      include the true mean for the outcome variable, the fixed effects of the intervention arm,&#xD;
      one random cluster effect (school), and the random error term. In this case, the schools&#xD;
      (clusters) should be regarded as nested within the intervention arms and the students or&#xD;
      parents within the school (clusters). The analytic approach for the secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures (i.e., blood pressure, percent body fat, metabolic syndrome, adipocytokines, other&#xD;
      dietary intake variables, and related dietary psychosocial behaviors) will involve a similar&#xD;
      use of linear mixed models. For Aim 2: To test the effects of the Sprouts intervention on&#xD;
      changes in vegetable intake and availability and on related dietary behaviors in the parents,&#xD;
      the investigators will use similar and well-known statistical methods as described for Aim 1.&#xD;
      For the Exploratory Aim, the investigators will conduct descriptive statistics on the&#xD;
      collected pilot data of the sustainability strategies (qualitative and quantitative data&#xD;
      obtained via structured interviews and focus groups) on both intervention and control&#xD;
      schools.&#xD;
