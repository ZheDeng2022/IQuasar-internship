      This research is being done to better understand how a new lab test called the Oncotype DX&#xD;
      Prostate Cancer Assay may impact what treatment men decide to get and how they feel and think&#xD;
      about their choice of treatment. The study will compare men who receive this new lab test&#xD;
      with men who receive the usual counseling given to men after they get a new diagnosis of&#xD;
      prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is sometimes slow-growing and sometimes fast-growing.&#xD;
      Healthcare providers are searching for better ways to predict how each tumor will behave so&#xD;
      that each man can make a better decision about when to receive treatment. The Oncotype DX lab&#xD;
      test uses leftover prostate biopsy tissue to generate a Genomic Prostate Score (GPS). The GPS&#xD;
      is related to the risk of a fast-growing cancer being discovered if surgery is performed to&#xD;
      remove a man's prostate. The goal of this study is to find out if this test helps men when&#xD;
      they are deciding how their prostate cancer will be treated. Treatment options include&#xD;
      surgery to remove the prostate, radiation therapy, or an approach called &quot;active&#xD;
      surveillance&quot; in which there is no immediate therapy and the tumor is watched using prostate&#xD;
      specific antigen (PSA) tests and repeat biopsies.&#xD;

    <description>National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) counseling uses recommendations based on currently-accepted approaches to cancer treatment. The result provided by the Oncotype DX prostate test is called a Genomic Prostate Score (GPS). The GPS provides important information about how aggressive a man's cancer is based on the biology of the man's individual tumor.</description>
