      This pilot research trial studies the use of the Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells Clinical&#xD;
      Assay in finding and monitoring kidney cancer. Studying samples of blood and urine from&#xD;
      patients with kidney cancer in the laboratory may aid doctors in the early detection of&#xD;
      cancer, monitor tumor response to therapy, detect the presence of occult spreading of&#xD;
      disease, and identify early return of disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate a novel clinical assay (Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells [MDSC] Clinical&#xD;
      Assay) to detect cancer associated immune cells in the peripheral blood of patients as a&#xD;
      means to better detect and monitor malignant renal cell carcinoma in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine mean MDSC level, intra-subject variability, and inter-subject variability for&#xD;
      three groups of subjects with variable renal cell carcinoma disease status at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. In patients with known localized renal cell carcinoma who undergo nephrectomy, determine&#xD;
      the change in MDSC level from diagnosis to after nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. In patients with known metastatic renal cell carcinoma who undergo systemic treatment,&#xD;
      determine the change in MDSC level from baseline to after treatment (4 months) and,&#xD;
      secondarily, to compare these changes to the changes in tumor burden as evaluated by computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scan or other imaging modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups according to disease status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients with no evidence of cancer and no hematuria undergo collection of blood and&#xD;
      urine samples at baseline and 2 months for analysis via the Flow Cytometry MDSC Clinical&#xD;
      Assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients diagnosed with localized renal cell carcinoma undergo collection of blood&#xD;
      and urine samples at baseline and after nephrectomy for analysis via the Flow Cytometry MDSC&#xD;
      Clinical Assay. Patients also undergo CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 30 days&#xD;
      after nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP III: Patients diagnosed with metastatic renal cell carcinoma undergo collection of&#xD;
      samples prior to baseline and then after 4 months of systemic treatment for analysis via the&#xD;
      Flow Cytometry MDSC Clinical Assay. Patients also undergo CT or MRI after completion of 4&#xD;
      months of systemic treatment.&#xD;
