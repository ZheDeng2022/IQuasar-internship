  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of MGN1703&#xD;
      that can be given in combination with ipilimumab to patients with advanced tumors. The safety&#xD;
      of this drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. MGN1703 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It&#xD;
      is currently being used for research purposes only. Ipilimumab is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of unresectable (cannot be removed with surgery) or&#xD;
      metastatic (has spread) melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of MGN1703 based on when you joined this study. Up to 4 dose levels of MGN1703 will be&#xD;
      tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of&#xD;
      participants will receive the lowest dose level of MGN1703. Each new group will receive a&#xD;
      higher dose of MGN1703 than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.&#xD;
      This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of MGN1703 is found. This is called dose&#xD;
      escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another part of the study (called dose expansion) up to 3 groups of up to 12 additional&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled. Two (2) groups will receive MGN1703 at the highest tolerable&#xD;
      dose that was found in dose escalation. One (1) group will receive the first dose level of&#xD;
      MGN1703 (if it is found to be tolerable). The study doctor will tell you which dose of&#xD;
      MGN1703 you will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose level of ipilimumab. You will receive ipilimumab&#xD;
      at standard doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given MGN1703 as an injection under the skin on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle.&#xD;
      Each administration will be between 1-4 injections in multiple parts of your body (such as&#xD;
      your upper arms and thighs, your abdomen and thighs, or your abdomen and upper arms). The&#xD;
      study doctor will tell you how many times you will be injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in dose expansion, you may receive MGN1703 as an injection directly into the&#xD;
      tumor. The study doctor will tell you if you will receive the study drug this way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also receive ipilimumab by vein over about 90 minutes on Day 8 of Cycles 1-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 1 of every cycle, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 2 of Cycles 1-4, you will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 3 of Cycles 1 and 3, blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests&#xD;
      and biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 3 of Cycles 2 and 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have imaging scans to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in dose expansion and depending on when you join the study, on Day 1 of Cycle 3&#xD;
      you will have a biopsy for biomarker testing (including genetic biomarkers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Cycle 4 and then every even-numbered cycle after that (Cycles 6, 8, 10, and so on):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have imaging scans to check the status of the disease. After 1 year on study,&#xD;
           you will have these scans every 4 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Cycle 4 and then every 4 cycles after that (Cycles 8, 12, 16, and so on):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 30 days for 90 days after your last dose of study drug, you will be called by a member&#xD;
      of the study staff and asked about any new anticancer drugs you may have started and how you&#xD;
      are feeling. You may also be asked these questions during a routine clinic visit or this&#xD;
      information may be collected from your medical record. If you are called, each call should&#xD;
      last about 10-15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive MGN1703 in combination with ipilimumab for up to 4 cycles. After that, you&#xD;
      may continue taking MGN1703 alone for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You participation on this study will be over 90 days after your last dose of study drug.&#xD;

             by case basis by the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. As the effect of these drugs on the developing human fetus is not known, women of&#xD;

             immunotherapy regimens; cytotoxic chemotherapy; immunosuppressive agents; other&#xD;
             investigational therapies; or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids (when used in&#xD;
             the management of cancers other than intracranial glioblastoma, gliosarcoma or&#xD;
             anaplastic astrocytoma, or when used to treat non-cancer-related illnesses).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Radiation therapy within 4 weeks of study enrollment (exception is radiotherapy&#xD;
             expansion arm which requires radiation treatment within 2 week period).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study. Women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use contraception prior to study entry and for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Use of any other concurrent investigational agents or anticancer agents including&#xD;
             hormonal therapy, except in the case of prostate cancer patients who are being treated&#xD;
             with LHRH agonist at the time of trial entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Previous exposure to TLR agonist therapy.&#xD;
