  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of an internet-delivered&#xD;
      cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) intervention originally developed for neurotypical&#xD;
      adolescents with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in adolescents with OCD and autism&#xD;
      spectrum disorder (ASD). This feasibility study will inform us how to adapt the original&#xD;
      intervention to the specific needs of patients with ASD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of ICBT for OCD in adolescents with ASD, this study will use a&#xD;
      single case experimental design with weekly measures during two phases: A-B. The A-phase will&#xD;
      consist of baseline measures at least three weeks prior to treatment. The B-phase will&#xD;
      consist of the 12 weeks ICBT-program as well as one measure post-treatment. Single case&#xD;
      descriptions of each participant will be presented. Weekly measures on the Obsessional&#xD;
      Compulsive Inventory - Child version (OCI-CV) will be analyzed through visual inspection of&#xD;
      each participants graph and through computation of Percentage of Non-overlapping Data (PND).&#xD;
      PND is a frequently used effect measure in SCED and reflects how large percentage of the&#xD;
      measurements during the treatment-phase that do not overlap with any of the measurements&#xD;
      during the base-line phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the feasibility and comprehension of the ICBT treatment semi-structured interviews&#xD;
      (face-to-face or telephone) will be conducted with participants and parents weekly during the&#xD;
      four first weeks of ICBT and semi-weekly during the rest of the treatment. Detailed notes&#xD;
      will be taken during each interview and will serve as content material for a thematic&#xD;
      analysis trying to determine possible accommodations to the ICBT protocol to better suit&#xD;
      patients with ASD.&#xD;
