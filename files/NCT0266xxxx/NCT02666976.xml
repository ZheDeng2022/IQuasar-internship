    <textblock>
      Non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) patients used to be less responsive to proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitor (PPI)s as compared with patients with erosive esophagitis. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to objectively evaluate the effect of a new PPI, ilaprazole in NERD for adjusting the focus&#xD;
      of symptom score, histopathologic findings and inflammatory biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective study performed at single hospital enrolled 20 patients who were diagnosed&#xD;
      clinically as NERD. Patients underwent EGD, a 24hr-combined multichannel intraluminal&#xD;
      impedance and pH esophageal monitoring (MII-pH) and were treated with ilaprazole 20mg once&#xD;
      daily for 4 weeks. Biopsies were obtained from 3cm above the EG junction before and after&#xD;
      treatment. GERD Q questionnaire, histologic findings (basal cell hyperplasia, papillary&#xD;
      elongation, dilated intercellular spaces, intraepithelial eosinophils and intraepithelial T&#xD;
      lymphocyte) and inflammatory biomarkers (TNF-α, IL-8, IL-1β, TRPV1 and MCP-1) will be&#xD;
      accessed.&#xD;
