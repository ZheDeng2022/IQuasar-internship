    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Weekly Number of UI Episodes at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly number of UI episodes was measured using a 7-day bladder diary. Bladder diaries that contained data recorded on at least 5 days were included in the analysis. The least square (LS) mean of the change in weekly number of UI episodes at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Maximum Cystometric Capacity (MCC) at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects had a standardised urodynamic (filling cystometry) assessment at baseline (screening) and again at Week 6 to determine the MCC. The LS mean of the change in MCC at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Maximum Detrusor Pressure (MDP) at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects had a standardised urodynamic filling cystometry assessment at baseline (screening) and again at Week 6 to determine the MDP. The LS mean of the change in MDP at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using an ANCOVA.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Volume at First Involuntary Detrusor Contraction (Vol@1stIDC) at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects had a standardised urodynamic (filling cystometry) assessment at baseline (screening) and again at Week 6 to determine the Vol@1stIDC which is the instilled volume when first IDC commences. Subjects who did not exhibit a post-treatment IDC at Week 6 had Vol@1stIDC imputed using the recorded corrected MCC volume at Week 6. The LS mean of the change in Vol@1stIDC at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using an ANCOVA.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With No Episodes of UI at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly number of UI episodes was measured using a 7-day bladder diary. Bladder diaries that contained data recorded on at least 5 days were included in the analysis. The number of subjects with no UI episodes at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was recorded and the percentage of subjects was also calculated from the total number of subjects with any number of UI events at Week 6.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QoL) Questionnaire Total Summary Score at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>The I-QoL questionnaire is a validated, disease-specific questionnaire designed to measure the effect of UI on subjects' QoL. It consists of 22 items in 3 domains (avoidance and limiting behaviour, psychosocial impact and social embarrassment). Subjects used a 5-point response scale for each of the 22 items with values ranging from 1 (extremely) to 5 (not at all). The total summary score was transformed to a 100 point scale ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better QoL. The LS mean of the change in the I-QoL total summary score at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using a MMRM analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With a UI Response at Improvement Levels ≥30%, ≥50%, and ≥75% at Week 6 of the DBPC Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly number of UI episodes was measured using a 7-day bladder diary. Bladder diaries that contained data recorded on at least 5 days were included in the analysis. The number of baseline UI episodes was compared with the number of UI episodes at Week 6 to determine the level of response each subject reached, i.e. a decrease of ≥30%, ≥50% or ≥75% . The number of subjects showing an improvement of ≥30%, ≥50% and ≥75% were recorded and the percentage of subjects was also calculated from the total number of subjects with any number of UI events at Week 6.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Volume Per Void at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>The volume per void was measured during one 24-hour period of the 7-day bladder diary. The LS mean of the change in volume per void at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using a MMRM analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Time Between Treatments</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of first treatment (baseline) and day of retreatment, up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of effect for time between treatments was calculated by: (the date of the first retreatment visit - date of first treatment administration in the DBPC cycle). The median number of days between treatments was determined based on the Kaplan-Meier method. Subjects with no retreatment were censored at the last visit.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 227 subjects with urinary incontinence (UI) caused by neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) due to spinal cord injury (SCI) or multiple sclerosis (MS) were randomised at 64 study sites worldwide. One randomised subject was not eligible for entry and did not receive treatment. Hence, 226 subjects were randomised and treated during the study. The study was terminated early by the sponsor due to lack of recruitment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects were randomised to 1 of 4 sequences: A) placebo in a double blind placebo controlled (DBPC) cycle then Dysport® 600 Units (U) in subsequent double blind cycles: B) placebo in DBPC cycle then Dysport® 800 U in subsequent cycles: C) Dysport® 600 U in all cycles: D) Dysport® 800 U in all cycles. The minimum re-treatment interval was 12 weeks.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Subjects were administered placebo on Day 1 of the DBPC cycle.&#xD;
All study treatments were injected into the detrusor muscle via cystoscopy in a total volume of 15 millilitres (mL) divided into 30 injection points of 0.5 mL each.&#xD;
Subjects were followed-up by telephone at Week 1 and Week 4; and attended clinic visits at Week 2, Week 6 (primary study timepoint), and Week 12. Thereafter telephone visits were scheduled every 12 weeks until end of study, or until retreatment was required.</description>

        <description>All subjects had a standardised urodynamic (filling cystometry) assessment at baseline (screening) and again at Week 6 to determine the Vol@1stIDC which is the instilled volume when first IDC commences. Subjects who did not exhibit a post-treatment IDC at Week 6 had Vol@1stIDC imputed using the recorded corrected MCC volume at Week 6. The LS mean of the change in Vol@1stIDC at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using an ANCOVA.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QoL) Questionnaire Total Summary Score at Week 6 of DBPC Cycle</title>
        <description>The I-QoL questionnaire is a validated, disease-specific questionnaire designed to measure the effect of UI on subjects' QoL. It consists of 22 items in 3 domains (avoidance and limiting behaviour, psychosocial impact and social embarrassment). Subjects used a 5-point response scale for each of the 22 items with values ranging from 1 (extremely) to 5 (not at all). The total summary score was transformed to a 100 point scale ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better QoL. The LS mean of the change in the I-QoL total summary score at 6 weeks after the first study treatment was calculated using a MMRM analysis.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With a UI Response at Improvement Levels ≥30%, ≥50%, and ≥75% at Week 6 of the DBPC Cycle</title>
        <description>The weekly number of UI episodes was measured using a 7-day bladder diary. Bladder diaries that contained data recorded on at least 5 days were included in the analysis. The number of baseline UI episodes was compared with the number of UI episodes at Week 6 to determine the level of response each subject reached, i.e. a decrease of ≥30%, ≥50% or ≥75% . The number of subjects showing an improvement of ≥30%, ≥50% and ≥75% were recorded and the percentage of subjects was also calculated from the total number of subjects with any number of UI events at Week 6.</description>
