  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ATLANTIS is a multicenter, phase IIIb, prospective, open-label, randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate superiority of a strategy of anticoagulation&#xD;
      with apixaban (Anti-Xa Group) as compared to the current standard of care in patients who&#xD;
      have undergone a successful TAVI procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization is stratified according to the presence or not of a mandatory indication&#xD;
      for anticoagulation for a reason other than the TAVI procedure (e.g. atrial fibrillation or&#xD;
      DVT/PE).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Guidelines on antithrombotic therapy after TAVI are scarce and no randomized evaluation has&#xD;
      been performed to demonstrate what the optimal antithrombotic strategy is. The rates of major&#xD;
      stroke and of major bleeding on DAPT, the standard of care in TAVI (Class IIb LOE C), are&#xD;
      respectively as high as 3% and 10% within the first 30 days excluding the perioperative&#xD;
      period. In addition, the rate of MACCE is estimated to be of 15% on DAPT. However, more than&#xD;
      half of senior patients display high on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity, less than 1/3&#xD;
      undergo coronary stent implantation prior to valve replacement and more than 1/3 display&#xD;
      transient atrial fibrillation (AF) during hospital stay. Anticoagulation appears therefore to&#xD;
      be underused in this high stroke risk population and has never been evaluated in post-TAVI&#xD;
      procedures. Non-vitamin K Oral Anticoagulants (NOAC) have shown superiority or&#xD;
      non-inferiority versus VKA to prevent cardio-embolic events with a consistent reduction in&#xD;
      intracranial bleeds in patients with non-valvular AF. Apixaban, a direct anti-Xa inhibitor,&#xD;
      is the only NOAC which has demonstrated a mortality benefit associated with significant&#xD;
      reductions in embolism and major bleeding versus VKA. In addition, apixaban is the only NOAC&#xD;
      which has demonstrated superiority over aspirin to prevent cardio-embolic events with a&#xD;
      similar safety profile in non-valvular AF patients with a contraindication to VKA. The&#xD;
      investigators therefore formulate the hypothesis that apixaban is superior to SOC to prevent&#xD;
      cardiovascular events in post-TAVI procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose is to demonstrate superiority of a strategy of anticoagulation with apixaban&#xD;
      5mg bid (Anti-Xa Group) with dose adjustment as compared to the current standard of care (SOC&#xD;
      Group = VKA or Antiplatelet therapy) as measured by the time from randomization to the first&#xD;
      occurrence of any event of the composite endpoint of death, myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      stroke/TIA/systemic embolism, intracardiac or bioprosthesis thrombus, episode of deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, life-threatening or disabling or major bleeding at one year&#xD;
      follow-up defined according to VARC2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who underwent a clinically successful TAVI procedure. Non-inclusion criteria include&#xD;
      any recent acute cardiovascular event, mechanical heart valve, necessary use of prasugrel or&#xD;
      ticagrelor (new P2Y12 inhibitors), concomitant medical illness associated with reduced&#xD;
      survival, end stage renal failure defined as a creatinine clearance &lt; 15mL/min.&#xD;
