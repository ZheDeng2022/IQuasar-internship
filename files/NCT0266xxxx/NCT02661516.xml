        Retrospective cohort with study period from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2013 using the&#xD;
        Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The study will identify AF patients treated&#xD;
        with VKA during the study period and will follow them from the first record of VKA use&#xD;
        (index date). until the first of end of study period, leaving the database, VKA&#xD;
        discontinuation/switch, or death. It will use person-time denominators to handle the&#xD;
        varying length of follow-up of patients&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the CPRD-HES cohort, patients will be included if they meet these criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have CPRD data linked to HES&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an AF diagnosis (based on Read codes from CPRD or ICD-10 codes from HES) and have&#xD;
             been treated with VKA during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
             -≥18 years old at index date&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CPRD acceptability quality criteria are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the CPRD cohort, patients will be included if they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an Atrial Fibrillation (AF) diagnosis (based on Read codes from CPRD) and have&#xD;
             been treated with VKAs during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥18 years old at index date&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CPRD acceptability quality criteria are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the two cohorts of interest, patients will be excluded if they meet the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fewer than 12 months of computerised data available prior to the index date (in order&#xD;
             to provide a minimum amount of computerised history and to avoid issues associated&#xD;
             with updating records when a patient joins a practice). The date of start of&#xD;
             computerized records will be the latter of the patient's date of registration with the&#xD;
             practice or the practice's Up-to-Standard (UTS) date (when the practice is deemed to&#xD;
             be contributing data of adequate quality)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The practice is not UTS, or the patient is deemed &quot;unacceptable&quot; according to CPRD's&#xD;
             quality criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is evidence of valvular disease, repair, or replacement before (ie, up to 12&#xD;
             months prior to the index date) or during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There are records of Novel anticoagulant (NOAC)&#xD;
