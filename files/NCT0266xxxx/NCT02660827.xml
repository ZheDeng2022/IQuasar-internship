    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, multi-center, Home and Hotel Clinical Investigation in pediatric&#xD;
      subjects with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      demonstrate that the closed loop algorithm is safe as part of the overall system, and to&#xD;
      assess the PLGM feature in 7-13 years old subjects.&#xD;

      The study will proceed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in Period - General:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of up to 200 subjects (age 2-13) will be enrolled at up to 15 investigational centers&#xD;
      (14 in the US, 1 EMEA) in order to reach 120 subjects who will complete the HCL study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period - At Home:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the two week run-in period using the Study Pump (670G), all subjects (age 2-13)&#xD;
      will participate in a 3-month study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period - Hotel Study Subjects (age 7-13) will participate in a Hotel study (6 days, 5&#xD;
      nights), with the remainder of the study period to be spent at home. Subjects 2-6 years of&#xD;
      age are not required to participate in a hotel study. Instead, they will participate in an&#xD;
      out-of-home study for 5 consecutive days, 4-6 hours per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continued Access Program Subjects will be given the opportunity to extend use of their study&#xD;
      devices for a period of up to 3 years . If subjects choose to participate in the continuation&#xD;
      period, they will retain the study devices at the end of study period visit or receive them&#xD;
      back in the event they have been returned to study staff already.&#xD;
