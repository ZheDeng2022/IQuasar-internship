    <textblock>
      ABACUS is an open-label, international, multi-centre, window of opportunity phase II trial&#xD;
      for patients with histologically confirmed (T2-T4a) transitional cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
      bladder. The trial aims to test the efficacy of preoperative MPDL3280A and will include&#xD;
      extensive biomarker work on samples from these patients. Eligible patients will receive two&#xD;
      3-weekly cycles of MPDL3280A pre-cystectomy. Following cystectomy, patients will be followed&#xD;
      up for safety, survival, and disease data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MPDL3280A (also called atezolizumab) is an immune check point inhibitor which targets&#xD;
      programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Overexpression of PD-L1 prevents the immune system from&#xD;
      eradicating cancerous cells as it blocks antigen recognition. MPDL3280A inhibits this&#xD;
      interaction, allowing immune-mediated tumour cell killing.&#xD;
