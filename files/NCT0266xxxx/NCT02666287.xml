  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Batefenterol (BAT) is a novel bifunctional molecule that combines muscarinic antagonism and&#xD;
      beta2-agonism in a single molecule and is in development for the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). FF is a corticosteroid approved as the inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroid (ICS) component of a combination product, with vilanterol (VI), a long-acting&#xD;
      beta2-agonist for COPD. In the current study FF will be investigated as an inhaled product in&#xD;
      combination with BAT, for treatment of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open-label, six-way crossover, single and repeat dose study to evaluate the&#xD;
      systemic pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of FF and BAT when administered via the&#xD;
      ELLIPTAâ„¢ alone, in combination, or concurrently at 3 times the clinical dose, following a&#xD;
      single dose, and at the proposed clinical dose, following repeat doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of screening period, 6 treatment periods, and a follow-up visit. Each&#xD;
      subject will have 3 periods in which they receive a single dose treatment regimen (3&#xD;
      inhalations on Day 1 of each single dose study period) and 3 periods in which they receive a&#xD;
      single dose treatment regimen followed by a 7-day, once-daily, repeated dose. On Day 1 of&#xD;
      those periods, subjects will receive their single dose as 3 inhalations. On Days 2-8,&#xD;
      subjects will receive 1 inhalation per day for the repeated dose regimen. There will be a&#xD;
      minimum of 7-day washout between each treatment periods. All subjects will receive 9&#xD;
      treatments and follow-up procedures will be done 7 14 days after the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty eight healthy subjects will be enrolled into the study, such that approximately 40&#xD;
      subjects complete dosing and PK assessments. The total duration of participation for each&#xD;
      subject in this study will be up to 15 weeks. ELLIPTA is a registered trademark of the&#xD;
      GlaxoSmithKline [GSK] group of companies.&#xD;

             medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, vital signs,&#xD;
             laboratory tests, and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or&#xD;
             laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or&#xD;
             exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may&#xD;
             be included only if the investigator agrees and documents that the finding is unlikely&#xD;
             to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.5-30.0 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2)&#xD;
             inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Males: Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must use a condom from&#xD;
        the time of first dose of study medication until follow-up, or have had a vasectomy with&#xD;
        documentation of azoospermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females: A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed&#xD;
        by a negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not lactating, and at least&#xD;
        one of the following conditions applies: Non-reproductive potential defined as:&#xD;
        Pre-menopausal females with one of the following: documented tubal ligation, documented&#xD;
        hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal&#xD;
        occlusion, hysterectomy, documented bilateral oophorectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Post-menopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea, with simultaneous follicle&#xD;
        stimulating hormone (FSH) and oestradiol levels consistent with menopause (refer to&#xD;
        laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels). Females on hormone replacement&#xD;
        therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the&#xD;
        highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.&#xD;
        Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior&#xD;
        to study enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed in the Modified List&#xD;
        of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential&#xD;
        (FRP) during the trial, and until follow-up. The investigator is responsible for ensuring&#xD;
        that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form as described in this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin &gt;1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct&#xD;
             bilirubin &lt;35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities&#xD;
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mean QTC &gt; 450 millisecond (msec). NOTES: The QTc is the QT interval corrected for&#xD;
             heart rate according to Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), and/or&#xD;
             another method, machine read or manually over-read.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an&#xD;
        individual subject should be determined prior to initiation of the study. In other words,&#xD;
        several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an individual subject&#xD;
        and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the subject from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For purposes of data analysis, QTcB, QTcF, another QT correction formula, or a composite of&#xD;
        available values of QTc will be used as specified in the reporting and analysis plan (RAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality identified at the screening medical assessment&#xD;
             (physical examination/medical history), clinical laboratory tests, or 12-lead ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing condition(s) interfering with normal gastrointestinal (GI) anatomy or&#xD;
             motility, including constipation, malabsorption or other GI dysfunction which may&#xD;
             interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or elimination of the study&#xD;
             drug. Subjects with a history of cholecystectomy must be excluded.&#xD;

             triplicate measurements taken at least 2 min apart) than 140/90 millimetres of mercury&#xD;
             (mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At screening, a supine mean (triplicate measurements) heart rate (HR) outside the&#xD;
             range 40-90 beats per minute (bpm).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of respiratory disease in the last 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary&#xD;
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a&#xD;
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose&#xD;
             of study medication, unless in the opinion of the investigator and GSK Medical Monitor&#xD;

             average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males and &gt;14 units for females. One unit is&#xD;
             equivalent to 8 grams (g) of alcohol: a half-pint (approximately 240 mL) of beer, 1&#xD;
             glass (125 milliliter [mL]) of wine or 1 (25 mL) measure of spirits.&#xD;
&#xD;
