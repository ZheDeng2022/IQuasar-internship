  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the etonogestrel (ENG) +&#xD;
      17β-estradiol (E2) (MK-8342B) vaginal ring compared to placebo vaginal ring in the treatment&#xD;
      of dysmenorrhea at Treatment Cycle 2. This study was also to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the ENG-E2 vaginal rings over 4 treatment cycles. Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
      Relative to the placebo ring, the ENG-E2 vaginal ring results in a greater proportion of&#xD;
      participants with a ≥3-point reduction in peak pelvic pain score and no increase in the&#xD;
      number of rescue pain relief (ibuprofen) tablets taken at Treatment Cycle 2 as compared to&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;

      The cramping window for each participant was to be defined as a 4-day time interval that&#xD;
      began the day prior to initiation of each cyclic bleeding episode (spontaneous menses or&#xD;
      hormone withdrawal bleeding) and continued until the third bleeding day (inclusive). An&#xD;
      external committee of blinded independent reviewers was to determine the 4-day cramping&#xD;
      window for each participant so that analysis of the efficacy data could be conducted. The&#xD;
      study was terminated early due to a business decision by the Sponsor to discontinue product&#xD;
      development for reasons unrelated to safety or efficacy outcomes. Due to the early study&#xD;
      termination, the blinded independent review committee that was supposed to determine the&#xD;
      4-day cramping windows for data analysis was not assembled; thus cramping windows were not&#xD;
      determined. Without defined cramping windows, the efficacy outcome measures for this study&#xD;
      could not be analyzed.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline 4-day cramping window and Treatment Cycle 2 4-day cramping window, as determined by committee for each participant</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to rate their worst pain or cramps in the past 24 hours on a scale of 0 to 10 (0=No pain or cramps to 10=Extreme pain or cramps) and to indicate the number of ibuprofen tablets they took during the 4-day cramping window. The peak pelvic pain score was to be calculated as the highest (daily) pelvic pain score observed within the cramping window of the cycle and the total number of ibuprofen tablets taken was to be based on the 4-day cramping window. The baseline peak pelvic pain score and number of ibuprofen tablets taken were to be defined as the mean value of the 2 peak pelvic pain scores and the mean value of the total number of ibuprofen tablets taken during the cramping window of each of the 2 menstruations during the screening period, respectively. The percentage of participants with a reduction in peak pelvic pain score of ≥3 points and no increase in the use of ibuprofen at Treatment Cycle 2 as compared to baseline was to be presented.</description>

The change from baseline to Treatment Cycle 2 in the number of days during the cramping window with no impact of dysmenorrhea (score = 0) on each of the following items was to be presented: work/school, physical activities and leisure/social activities.</description>

        <description>Participants were asked to rate their worst pain or cramps in the past 24 hours on a scale of 0 to 10 (0=No pain or cramps to 10=Extreme pain or cramps) and to indicate the number of ibuprofen tablets they took during the 4-day cramping window. The peak pelvic pain score was to be calculated as the highest (daily) pelvic pain score observed within the cramping window of the cycle and the total number of ibuprofen tablets taken was to be based on the 4-day cramping window. The baseline peak pelvic pain score and number of ibuprofen tablets taken were to be defined as the mean value of the 2 peak pelvic pain scores and the mean value of the total number of ibuprofen tablets taken during the cramping window of each of the 2 menstruations during the screening period, respectively. The percentage of participants with a reduction in peak pelvic pain score of ≥3 points and no increase in the use of ibuprofen at Treatment Cycle 2 as compared to baseline was to be presented.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With ≥3-point Reduction in Peak Pelvic Pain Score and a Decrease in Number of Ibuprofen Tablets Taken at Treatment Cycle 2, Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Participants were asked to rate their worst pain or cramps in the past 24 hours on a scale of 0 to 10 (0=No pain or cramps to 10=Extreme pain or cramps) and to indicate the number of ibuprofen tablets they took during the 4-day cramping window. The baseline peak pelvic pain score and number of ibuprofen tablets taken were to be defined as the mean value of the 2 peak pelvic pain scores and the mean value of the total number of ibuprofen tablets taken during the cramping window of each of the 2 menstruations during the screening period, respectively. The percentage of participants with a reduction in peak pelvic pain score of ≥3 points and a decrease in the use of ibuprofen at Treatment Cycle 2 as compared to baseline was to be presented.</description>
