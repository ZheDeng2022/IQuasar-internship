  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Testosterone deficiency is classically associated with the development of metabolic syndrome,&#xD;
      osteoporosis, erectile disorder and / or a reduced libido, a depressive syndrome and&#xD;
      alteration of the quality of patients life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronicity of HIV infection leads to several disorders as fever, chronic stress, weight loss&#xD;
      and cachexia which are the cause of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. On the other hand,&#xD;
      abnormal secretion of cytokines, secondary to the infection may alter the Leydig cells&#xD;
      causing a hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and disrupts steroidogenesis. Cases of testicular&#xD;
      invasion by lymphoma or Kaposi's syndromes have also been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advent of antiretroviral therapy has reduced the prevalence of hypogonadism in patients&#xD;
      infected with HIV that is currently about 20%. This prevalence remains about 20%, regardless&#xD;
      of the antiretroviral therapy and CD4-T cell count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study to our knowledge has so far assessed exhaustively the clinical features, biological,&#xD;
      therapeutic and paraclinical of hypotestosteronemiae while assessing the level of total serum&#xD;
      testosterone, SHBG and serum free testosterone, among HIV infected patients in the European&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
