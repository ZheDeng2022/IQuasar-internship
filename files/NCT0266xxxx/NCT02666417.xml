  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants and young children in sub-Saharan Africa have high rates of iron deficiency anemia&#xD;
      (IDA), which adversely affects their growth and cognitive development. In-home iron&#xD;
      fortification of complementary foods using micronutrient powders (MNPs) reduces risk for IDA.&#xD;
      However, in areas with a high burden of infectious diseases iron may increase the risk of&#xD;
      unfavorable gut microbiota composition possibly influencing diarrhea prevalence. Thus, there&#xD;
      is an urgent need to find safer formulations of iron fortification for African infants. The&#xD;
      investigators recently finished a randomized, double blind controlled intervention trial in&#xD;
      Kenya where the investigators tested whether the addition of galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS)&#xD;
      in a MNP containing 5 mg of iron protects against the adverse effects of the iron on the&#xD;
      infant gut microbiome and gut inflammation (ClincalTrails.gov Identifier: NCT02118402).&#xD;
      Prebiotics are also potential enhancers of colonic iron absorption. Therefore, to complement&#xD;
      the intervention study, the present study will compare iron absorption from the combination&#xD;
      of sodium iron EDTA (NaFeEDTA) and ferrous fumarate (FeFum) with and without prior&#xD;
      consumption GOS or 3 weeks. The investigators will enroll 80 Kenyan infants from Kwale&#xD;
      County, aged 6-14 months of whom 40 infants will consume maize porridge blended with MNP&#xD;
      containing iron and 40 infants will receive a porridge mixed with MNP containing iron+GOS.&#xD;
      After 3 weeks of MNP consumption, two test meals will be fed on two consecutive mornings, and&#xD;
      will consist of maize porridge containing isotopically labeled FeFum and NaFeEDTA or&#xD;
      isotopically labeled ferrous sulfate (FeSO₄), respectively. Fourteen days after the second&#xD;
      test meal administration, a whole blood sample will be collected by venipuncture for iron&#xD;
      isotopic analysis. Iron and inflammation status parameter will be determined at baseline and&#xD;
      endpoint. A stool sample will be collected at baseline and on the first test meal day. The&#xD;
      gut microbiome, fecal pH and fecal SCFAs profile will be analyzed. Knowing the expected iron&#xD;
      absorption from the iron and GOS containing MNP will inform decisions on type of iron&#xD;
      compound and dosing regimens for MNPs to allow the lowest iron dose to be used but still&#xD;
      cover the infant requirement for absorbed iron.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron absorption from two iron-fortified maize-based test meals will be measured in two groups&#xD;
      of 40 infants (total N=80). Infants will be recruited at Msambweni District Hospital and&#xD;
      communities served by Msambweni District Hospital in southern coastal Kenya. In group 1, iron&#xD;
      absorption is measured after 3 weeks of MNP consumption containing 5 mg iron in form of&#xD;
      NaFeEDTA (2.5 g) and FeFum (2.5 g) but no GOS. In group 2, iron absorption is measured after&#xD;
      3 weeks of MNP consumption containing 5 mg iron in form of NaFeEDTA (2.5 g) and FeFum (2.5 g)&#xD;
      and 7.5 g GOS. Iron absorption is measured as the incorporation of stable isotopes into&#xD;
      erythrocytes at least 14 days after the test meal administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, a blood sample will be collected from potential study participants for the&#xD;
      determination of the following iron and inflammation status parameters: hemoglobin (Hb),&#xD;
      plasma ferritin (PF), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP),&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP). Anthropometrics (height, weight,&#xD;
      mid-upper arm and head circumference) will be measured, and demographics, the medical history&#xD;
      and the feeding habits will be assessed using a questionnaire. On day 1, infants will be&#xD;
      enrolled and randomized into the two groups, and then start the intervention. The infants&#xD;
      will consume 1 MNP sachet added to maize porridge per day for a total of 5 weeks. A stool&#xD;
      sample will be collected on day 1 for the determination of gut microbiota composition, fecal&#xD;
      pH and fecal SCFAs. After 3 weeks of MNP consumption, the two isotopically labelled test&#xD;
      meals will be fed to the infants by their caregivers under supervision of the research team&#xD;
      on two consecutive mornings between 7 and 8 am. Test meal A will contain 2.5 mg 57Fe in form&#xD;
      of FeFum and 2.5 mg iron as NaFeEDTA (given as 1.5 mg 56Fe and 1 mg 58Fe). Test meal B will&#xD;
      contain 5 mg iron in form of FeSO₄ (3 mg of 56Fe and 2 mg of 54Fe). The test meals will&#xD;
      consist of maize porridge (5-10% dry weight) and mineral water (30 ml) and will be randomly&#xD;
      administered on the two consecutive days (AB or BA). Overnight, only breast milk will be&#xD;
      allowed to the infant and no breast milk will be given at least 3 h before test meal&#xD;
      administration. Infants will not be allowed to eat or drink for 2 h after the test meal. On&#xD;
      the day of the first test meal, a stool sample will be collected and analyzed for gut&#xD;
      microbiota composition, fecal pH and fecal SCFAs. Fourteen days after the second test meal&#xD;
      administration, 3 ml of whole blood will be collected by venipuncture for iron isotopic&#xD;
      analysis and iron and inflammation status. Anthropometrics and the baseline questionnaire&#xD;
      will be repeated. Compliance of MNP consumption and adverse event reporting (morbidity&#xD;
      monitoring) will be done during weekly visits of the infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a follow-on study, iron absorption from the two above described mentioned iron-fortified&#xD;
      maize-based test meals will be measured in 24 infants aged 6-12 months without pre-feeding of&#xD;
      GOS. All procedures will be done identical as described above.&#xD;
