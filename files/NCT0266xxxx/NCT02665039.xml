    <textblock>
      This study aim to compare the efficacy, safety and quality of life of vinflunine/gemcitabine&#xD;
      and carboplatin/gemcitabine in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer and impaired renal&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rational The standard first line treatment for patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma&#xD;
      unfit for cisplatin due to renal impairment is carboplatin containing chemotherapy, with a&#xD;
      median overall survival of approximately 8-10 month. New, more effective regimens in terms of&#xD;
      tumor control and quality of life are urgently needed. Vinflunine has proven efficacy in&#xD;
      urothelial carcinoma and is registered as second line treatment. The combination of&#xD;
      gemcitabine and vinflunine has not yet been evaluated in first line treatment for patients&#xD;
      with metastatic urothelial carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the progression free survival (FPS) of vinflunine/gemcitabine versus&#xD;
           carboplatin/gemcitabine in patients with locally advanced or metastatic transitional&#xD;
           cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract unfit for cisplatin based chemotherapy due to&#xD;
           impaired renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the tumour response (ORR), overall survival (OS) and disease control rate&#xD;
           (DCR) of vinflunine/gemcitabine versus carboplatin/gemcitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and toxicity of vinflunine/gemcitabine versus&#xD;
           carboplatin/gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate and compare Quality of life during treatment with vinflunine/gemcitabine&#xD;
           and carboplatin/gemcitabine respectively.&#xD;
