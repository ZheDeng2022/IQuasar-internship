  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Performance of endoscopy in children requires more patience, experience, and&#xD;
      expertise than in adults. The anxiety of the children is related to parent's separation, loss&#xD;
      of self-control, unknown surroundings and strange people that are taking care of them, and&#xD;
      frequently unpleasant or even painful procedures. Painful and frightening procedures in&#xD;
      children have been shown to result in short-term physiologic changes and long-term behavioral&#xD;
      changes. The response to unpleasant stimuli with stress and fear may be exaggerated in&#xD;
      children and experienced as pain. Most infants and children and many teenagers need deep&#xD;
      sedation or light general anesthesia to complete a successful and safe procedure. Induction&#xD;
      of general anesthesia is a stressful procedure itself. Strategies to reduce preanesthesia&#xD;
      anxiety include pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this evidence is based mainly on self reports rather than objective measurements.&#xD;
      Therefore, objective and non-invasive measurements to be utilized in the current study,&#xD;
      should provide an assessment tools regardless the children's age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies, beginning in the 1970's, have shown that humor has many positive effects on&#xD;
      physical and mental health and well-being. Previous investigations have reported that humor&#xD;
      has beneficial effects on the immune system, stress related to potentially fatal illnesses,&#xD;
      pain tolerance, and mental functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dream doctors (DDs) are professional medical clowns or stage artists, who received training&#xD;
      specifically to understand medical patient's need and to give the patient adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      during hospital admissions or ambulatory treatment.The Israel dream doctors project,&#xD;
      integrates professional medical clowning into the medical services provided at Israeli&#xD;
      hospitals.Studies already proved that presence of medical clowns significantly reduces the&#xD;
      level of anxiety during induction of anesthesia in children. Hypothesis of the study: 1) DDs&#xD;
      lessen the level of anxiety and attention impairment in children undergoing gastroscopies. 2)&#xD;
      DDs improve the satisfaction of children and their parents during gastroscopies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is: 1) To explore the influence of DDs on the satisfaction of children&#xD;
      and their parents undergoing gastroscopy, utilizing questioners. 2) To explore the effects of&#xD;
      DDs on anxiety and attention of children and their parents, undergoing gastroscopies by means&#xD;
      of GSR, startle response and pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) tests, as well as , and measuring&#xD;

      The effect of Dream Doctors in children undergoing digestive endoscopic procedures:&#xD;
      Physiological and biological assessment of emotional and cognitive consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Since the advent of pediatric gastrointestinal endoscopy in the early 1970's,&#xD;
      there has been a remarkable increase in the number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures&#xD;
      performed in infants and children. Performance of endoscopy in children requires more&#xD;
      patience, experience, and expertise than in adults. The anxiety of the children is related to&#xD;
      parent's separation, loss of self-control, unknown surroundings and strange people that are&#xD;
      taking care of them, and frequently unpleasant or even painful procedures. Painful and&#xD;
      frightening procedures in children have been shown to result in short-term physiologic&#xD;
      changes and long-term behavioral changes. The response to unpleasant stimuli with stress and&#xD;
      fear may be exaggerated in children and experienced as pain. Most infants and children and&#xD;
      many teenagers need deep sedation or light general anesthesia to complete a successful and&#xD;
      safe procedure. Induction of general anesthesia is a stressful procedure itself. Strategies&#xD;
      to reduce preanesthesia anxiety include pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this evidence is based mainly on self reports rather than objective measurements.&#xD;
      Therefore, objective and non-invasive measurements to be utilized in the current study,&#xD;
      should provide an assessment tools regardless the children's age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies, beginning in the 1970's, have shown that humor has many positive effects on&#xD;
      physical and mental health and well-being. Previous investigations have reported that humor&#xD;
      has beneficial effects on the immune system, stress related to potentially fatal illnesses,&#xD;
      pain tolerance, and mental functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dream doctors are professional medical clowns or stage artists, who received training&#xD;
      specifically to understand medical patient's need and to give the patient adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      during hospital admissions or ambulatory treatment. Laughter has physiological effects on&#xD;
      different body mechanisms and it affects the cardiovascular system (decreasing heart rate and&#xD;
      blood pressure), strengthens the immune system, and lowers level of stress hormones like&#xD;
      Norepinephrine. Humor can also help in strengthening the bond between therapist and patient&#xD;
      and reduce stress and anxiety and enhance recovery. The Israel dream doctors project,&#xD;
      integrates professional medical clowning into the medical services provided at Israeli&#xD;
      hospitals. The DDs are part of the multidisciplinary staff, principally but not only, in&#xD;
      pediatric wards. Studies already proved that presence of medical clowns significantly reduces&#xD;
      the level of anxiety during induction of anesthesia in children. In the pediatric ward in&#xD;
      Afula Medical Center, the investigators have experience with DDs for preparing children to&#xD;
      kidney scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Puls Inhibition PPI A computerized human startle response monitoring system (SR-HLAB&#xD;
      STARTLE REFLEX, San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA) was used to deliver acoustic startle&#xD;
      stimuli via headphones and record and score the corresponding electro myographic activity&#xD;
      from the orbicularis oculi muscle. Two disposable electrodes (sensor area 12 mm2) were placed&#xD;
      approximately 0.75-1cm below the pupil on the orbicularis oculi muscle and 3rd reference&#xD;
      electrode on the mastoid bone. The skin area at the electrode site was cleaned with a cotton&#xD;
      swab saturated with rubbing alcohol, then prepared by gently rubbing a small amount of EEG &amp;&#xD;
      ECG Skin Prepping Gel (Signa Gel- Parker Laboratories Inc., Fairfield, New jersey, USA), and&#xD;
      cleaned again with a cotton swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The session (a total of 56 trials) is started with 3 min acclimatization period with a 60 dB&#xD;
      background noise level that is delivered continuously throughout the test session. The&#xD;
      session is comprised from two blocks. block1: comprised from randomly delivered six trials of&#xD;
      single 40 msec 120 dB &quot;pulse alone&quot; startle stimuli in order to evaluate the startle&#xD;
      response, ten &quot;pre&quot; stimuli (at 74, 78, 82, 86 or 92 dB), and thirty &quot;pre pulse&quot; trials that&#xD;
      consisted of a single 120 dB pulse preceded (120 msec inter-stimulus-interval) by a 20 msec&#xD;
      pre pulse of 14, 18, 22, 26 or 32 dB above background (i.e., 74, 78, 82, 86 or 92 dB). Block1&#xD;
      trials were delivered on average 20 sec inter-trial-interval ITI (15-25 sec, total 46&#xD;
      trials). Block2: comprised of the last ten trials of &quot;pulse alone&quot; startle, at fixed 2 sec&#xD;
      ITI in order to evaluate a measure of habituation in response to repeated delivery of the&#xD;
      startling stimuli. Finally, prepulse inhibition (PPI) was calculated as the percent of the&#xD;
      habituated response as follows [100-(max response to &quot;pre pulse&quot; trial / max response to&#xD;
      &quot;pulse alone&quot; trial X 100)]&#xD;
&#xD;
      GSR - Galvanic Skin Response Electrodermal activity will be measured by the differences of&#xD;
      the skin conductivity. Two 5 mm electrodes will be placed on fingers 2 and 4 of the&#xD;
      non-dominant hand. The electrodes will be connected to sensor and amplifying receiver with a&#xD;
      10Hz sampling rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different portions of the skin can show differences in conductivity, due to sweat related to&#xD;
      stress. Thus, measuring the skin conductivity of the non-dominant hand was shown to reduce&#xD;
      this variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis of the study: 1) DDs lessen the level of anxiety and attention impairment in&#xD;
      children undergoing gastroscopies. 2) DDs improve the satisfaction of children and their&#xD;
      parents during gastroscopies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is: 1) To explore the influence of DDs on the satisfaction of children&#xD;
      and their parents undergoing gastroscopy, utilizing questioners. 2) To explore the effects of&#xD;
      DDs on anxiety and attention of children and their parents, undergoing gastroscopies by means&#xD;
      of GSR, startle response and pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) tests and measuring anxiety-related&#xD;
      biologic indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods: This randomized, controlled study will be conducted with children&#xD;
      undergoing deep sedation during pediatric upper gastrointestinal endoscopies in the&#xD;
      Gastroenterology institute of the Emek Medical Center,Afula, Israel. One hundred children&#xD;
      (age 1-18 years) scheduled to undergo deep sedation and elective gastroscopy will be&#xD;
      enrolled. During enrollment, the potential clown involvement will be explained to parents.&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned to one of two groups: Group 1:children and their parents with the&#xD;
      presence of DD upon arrival to the Gastroenterology institute and throughout the induction of&#xD;
      sedation, gastroscopy and recovery. Group 2: children and their parents undergoing&#xD;
      gastroscopy with deep sedation without the presence of a DD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization process: In Afula Medical Center, the investigators perform gastroscopies&#xD;
      weekly. During the study period the investigators will perform the gastroscopies one week&#xD;
      with the DD and one week without the DD.The patients will not be aware to that fact that in&#xD;
      some weeks the DD is participating during the sedation induction in some of the patients&#xD;
      (every other week). The DD will use various methods for entertaining the child and alleviate&#xD;
      stress according to the child's age. The parents and the children will be given anxiety&#xD;
      questioners to fill before the induction of sedation. At the end of the gastroscopy the&#xD;
      parents and the children will be given satisfaction questioners. The children will perform&#xD;
      Pre-Pulse inhibition (PPI) test and GSR before and after the gastroscopy to assess&#xD;
      physiological and biological emotional and cognitive consequences. The parents will perform&#xD;
      PPI test and GSR before, during and after the gastroscopy (no caffeine or nicotine&#xD;
      consumption will be allowed 30min before examination). The anesthesiologist and the nurse at&#xD;
      the recovery room will fill a questioner evaluating the behavior of the child during the&#xD;
      induction of sedation and awakening. While inserting an IV line blood spots will be taken for&#xD;
      stress hormones: cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. The following physical indices&#xD;
      will be measured: blood pressure, pulse, saturation and body temperature. The amount of drugs&#xD;
      given for deep sedation will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study hold two major innovativeness: (a) The effects of DD as part of the medical&#xD;
      team in gastroscopy in children. (b) The physiological and biological evaluation of the&#xD;
      emotional and cognitive consequences in children and their parents during gastroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is Mixed design (2X3), with DD as between subject factor (with or without&#xD;
      DD) and stage of treatment as within subject factor (prior, during and after gastroscopy&#xD;
      examination).Thus, we will conduct a Two-Way ANOVA (2X3) with post hoc Tukey's test.&#xD;
      Significant interactions will be further analyzed with One-Way ANOVA. Moreover to relate&#xD;
      physiological and biological measurement to questioner items, Pearson's correlations will be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment: 1.5 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study period: for each patient the study will be held during the day of gastroscopy.&#xD;
