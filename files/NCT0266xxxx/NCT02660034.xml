        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants have voluntarily agreed to participate by giving written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Must have received standard of care in the primary treatment of their disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants who have the below specified histologically confirmed malignancies that&#xD;
             have progressed to the advanced or metastatic stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. In Part A, the participants must have an advanced malignancy including but not&#xD;
                  limited to high-grade serous cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum,&#xD;
                  triple negative breast cancer, SCLC, primary peritoneal cancer, and any tumor&#xD;
                  likely to harbor DNA damage repair deficiencies susceptible to treatment with a&#xD;
                  PARP inhibitor or likely to be responsive to a PD-1 blocker.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. In Part B, the participants recruited to one of the eight expansion arms must&#xD;
                  have advanced solid tumors of the following types:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Arm 1: Participants with relapsed, platinum-sensitive high grade epithelial,&#xD;
             non-mucinous, ovarian cancer, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (EOC) must&#xD;
             meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             I. Must have at least 2 prior platinum-containing treatments in any treatment setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
             ii. Must have platinum-sensitive recurrent disease and must not have progressed (by&#xD;
             RECIST v1.1 criteria) within 6 months of the completion of the last platinum&#xD;
             containing line of treatment • Note: participants may receive additional non-platinum&#xD;
             based chemotherapy for recurrence after prior last platinum containing regimen if the&#xD;
             criteria for platinum sensitivity are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
             iii. Arm 1a: Participants with relapsed, platinum-sensitive high grade epithelial,&#xD;
             non-mucinous, ovarian cancer, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (EOC) with&#xD;
             either known deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic BRCA1/2&#xD;
             mutations or with HRD&#xD;
&#xD;
             • If HRD or BRCA1/2 mutation status from archival tissue is unknown or has not been&#xD;
             previously evaluated, then the archival tissue must undergo tissue screening using a&#xD;
             validated diagnostic test to determine eligibility. If the diagnostic test result is&#xD;
             BRCA1/2 or HRD positive the participant will be eligible for enrollment in Arm 1a iv.&#xD;
             Arm 1b: Participants with relapsed, platinum-sensitive high grade EOC who otherwise&#xD;
             meet the above criteria and are without known germline or somatic BRCA1/2 mutations&#xD;
             and without HRD mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
             Arm 2: Participants with triple negative breast cancer must meet the following&#xD;
             criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. 0-1 prior platinum-containing treatment in any treatment setting&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Note: participants could have received additional therapy after the last&#xD;
             platinum-containing line of treatment if the other eligibility criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
             ii. Participants who have received at least 1 prior treatment but not more than 3&#xD;
             prior lines of treatment in the advanced or metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
             iii. Known deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic BRCA1/2 mutations&#xD;
             or with documented HRD&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If HRD or BRCA1/2 mutation status from archival tissue is unknown or has not been&#xD;
                  previously evaluated, then the archival tissue must undergo tissue screening&#xD;
                  using a validated diagnostic test to determine eligibility. If the diagnostic&#xD;
                  test result is HRD positive, then the participant will be eligible for enrollment&#xD;
                  in Arm 2&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If archival tissue is not available and the participant submits a fresh tumor&#xD;
                  biopsy, then the diagnostic test needs to demonstrate somatic BRCA1/2 mutation or&#xD;
                  HRD positivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Arm 3: Participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, including&#xD;
             but not limited to mutations in homologous recombination (HR) pathways and/or defined&#xD;
             by HRD algorithms, and must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. May be either chemotherapy-naïve, but must have received prior abiraterone acetate&#xD;
             and/or enzalutamide treatment, or have previously had no more than 2 taxane-based&#xD;
             chemotherapy lines of treatment including docetaxel and carbazitaxel. If docetaxel is&#xD;
             used more than once, this will be considered as 1 line of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             ii. At least 2 weeks since the completion of prior flutamide, bicalutamide, and&#xD;
             nilutimide, or enzalutamide and abiraterone treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             iii. Documented prostate cancer with one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Surgically or medically castrated. The testosterone levels do not need to be checked&#xD;
             if the participant has undergone surgical castration for &gt; 4 months. Participants&#xD;
             receiving chemical castration should have testosterone levels checked at baseline and&#xD;
             confirmed to be in the castrate levels (&lt; 0.5 ng/mL or 1.735 nM). In all cases the&#xD;
             luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonist/agonist is to be continued in&#xD;
             these participants&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with only non-measurable bone lesions must have disease progression&#xD;
                  based on PCWG3 with 2 or more new lesions or have prostate-specific antigen (PSA)&#xD;
                  progression before enrolment iv. Known deleterious or suspected deleterious&#xD;
                  germline or somatic BRCA1/2 mutations or with documented HRD&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If HRD or BRCA1/2 mutation status from archival tissue is unknown or has not been&#xD;
                  previously evaluated, then the archival tissue must undergo tissue screening&#xD;
                  using a validated diagnostic test to determine eligibility. If the diagnostic&#xD;
                  test result is HRD positive, then the participant will be eligible for enrollment&#xD;
                  in Arm 3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If archival tissue is not available and the participant submits a fresh tumor&#xD;
                  biopsy, then the diagnostic test needs to demonstrate somatic BRCA1/2 mutation or&#xD;
                  HRD positivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Arm 4: Participants with extensive-stage disease small cell lung cancer (SCLC) must&#xD;

&#xD;
             Arm 6: Participants with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial (muscle-invasive&#xD;
             bladder, ureter, urethra or renal pelvis) cancer must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Received at least 1 and not more than 2 prior lines of treatment in the advanced or&#xD;
             metastatic disease setting ii. At least 1 prior line of treatment must have contained&#xD;
             a platinum agent&#xD;
&#xD;
             Arm 7: Participants with advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma must meet&#xD;
             the following criteria:&#xD;
