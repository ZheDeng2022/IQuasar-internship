      The purpose of this study is to formulate definitions of doctor/pharmacy shopping and&#xD;
      evaluate its association with abuse/addiction&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on a review of the literature, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that&#xD;
      more data are needed regarding the serious risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and&#xD;
      death associated with the long-term use of extended release/long acting (ER/LA) opioid&#xD;
      analgesics. Thus, the FDA is requiring that ER/LA opioid analgesic drug sponsors conduct&#xD;
      post-marketing studies to assess these risks. The four observational post-marketing&#xD;
      requirement (PMR) studies are labeled Study #2065-1, Study #2065-2, Study #2065-3, and Study&#xD;
      #2065-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of PMR Study #2065-4 is to define and validate &quot;doctor/pharmacy shopping&quot; as&#xD;
      outcomes suggestive of misuse, abuse and/or addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study #2065-4 consists of three sub-studies, Study 4A, Study 4B, and Study 4C. In the current&#xD;
      study (#2065 sub-study, Study 4A), the IMS® LRx database, a longitudinal pharmacy database&#xD;
      that captures both third-party and self-pay transactions, will be linked to the PharMetrics&#xD;
      Plus™ database, which contains provider, facility and pharmacy claims. From these databases,&#xD;
      patients with shopping behavior will be identified and evaluated against an algorithm for&#xD;
      abuse/addiction that will be developed and validated in PMR Study #2065-3B. Study #2065-3B&#xD;
      will review the literature for health information suggestive of abuse/addiction in medical&#xD;
      charts and medical claims. Then, through iterative processes that involve experts reviewing&#xD;
      claims profiles and medical charts, text searches of medical records using natural language&#xD;
      processing and supervised machine learning will identify and create a compilation of codes&#xD;
      and health information with the best specificity and sensitivity to identify patients with&#xD;
      opioid abuse/addiction. The compilation of codes and health information will be used to&#xD;
      develop the algorithm that Study 4A will apply to define abuse/addiction. Restricting the&#xD;
      validation of shopping behavior to only patients with diagnoses related to abuse would ignore&#xD;
      the population with undiagnosed abuse. By supplementing ICD-9 codes with other information&#xD;
      available on claims (e.g., addiction treatments, emergency visits) to define abuse/addiction,&#xD;
      the measurement bias will be decreased and the estimates of the association of shopping&#xD;
      behavior with abuse/addiction will be more valid. Categories of doctor shopping will be&#xD;
      derived from the population distributions of the multiple variables analyzed for opioid&#xD;
      users. The 4 categories will range from no shopping behavior (lowest level) to extensive&#xD;
      shopping behavior (most extreme). The specifics of how the categories will be defined will be&#xD;
      driven by the data.&#xD;
