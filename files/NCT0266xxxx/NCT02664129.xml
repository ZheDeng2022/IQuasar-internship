  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The deficit of awareness of pathology (or insight) is a common symptom in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia and has a negative impact on the prognosis of the disease. Current treatments&#xD;
      aren't effective enough on this symptom (Pijnenbord et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown a positive impact of videos of patients themselves on insight but&#xD;
      they lacked power. This technique needs more investigation. The study aims to improve the&#xD;
      patient's awareness of pathology with a video of themselves recorded in the acute phase of&#xD;
      their illness. Patients will watch this video after clinical stabilization. This is a&#xD;
      randomized controlled and single blinded trial. A population of 60 patients (30 in each&#xD;
      group) will be included. The impact on the insight, symptomatology, treatment adherence and&#xD;
      functional remission will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The video of patient is useful for a personalized clinical follow-up. Its use for therapeutic&#xD;
      purposes would be innovative and could be extended to other applications in psychiatry,&#xD;
      especially as this tool is readily available.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In everyday practice in psychiatry, some interviews are filmed in order to follow the&#xD;
      clinical course and for educational purposes. But the videos are not used as a therapeutic&#xD;
      tool for patients. This research project focuses on the therapeutic potential of these videos&#xD;
      and particularly on the awareness of patients of their disorder (insight). Patients&#xD;
      hospitalized for decompensation of their schizophrenic pathology will be filmed during&#xD;
      structured interviews. After clinical stabilization patients will be proposed to participate&#xD;
      to this trial. A group of patients (G1) will watch the video recorded in the acute phase of&#xD;
      their illness. A control group (G2) will have a usual care without video or specific therapy.&#xD;
      48 hours after, the clinical impact et the evolution of insight of patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated. Then follow-up visits will also be provided at one and four months with the same&#xD;
      clinical evaluation, plus an evaluation of treatment adherence and functional remission. This&#xD;
      study also includes qualitative interviews for group 1 after watching the video to explore&#xD;
      the experience of patients in this situation of self-confrontation. The autobiographical&#xD;
      memory will also be studied in this protocol. Tolerance of this experience will be assessed&#xD;
      by a monitoring of emotions, specifically depressive affects and suicidal ideation. Adverse&#xD;
      events will be reported and patients will always have the access to a psychiatrist if&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
