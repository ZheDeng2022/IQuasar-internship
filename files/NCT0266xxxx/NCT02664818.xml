      The purpose of this study is to assess clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcome of&#xD;
      patients hospitalized with heart failure in China and compared those with other registries&#xD;

      -  All sites were monitored randomly every year. Trained monitors were designated to&#xD;
           monitor the process, compliance of enrollment criteria and accuracy of original data by&#xD;
           visiting every site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to make sure the accuracy of data collected, we make some restrictions (range&#xD;
           or format) and reminding functions in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detail information of each variable has been pre-defined. Staffs were trained before&#xD;
           data entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard Operating Procedures: Case data were collected by printed Case Report Form&#xD;
           (CRF) and entered into a web-based data center (http://103.31.202.60/subFW/). Hospitals&#xD;
           that did not complete eCRF would send printed CRF to data center. Trained clinicians or&#xD;
           staffs were asked to enter these data into the web-based eCRF. Following variables were&#xD;
           included in the database: (i) demography and characteristics of patients: age, gender,&#xD;
           medical history, life style, precipitating factors of HF, laboratory tests, ECG, chest&#xD;
           X-ray and comorbidities diagnosed at discharge. Physical examination, echocardiography,&#xD;
           laboratory tests were performed at both admission and discharge; (ii) Heart failure&#xD;
           management included pharmacological treatments (before admission, during hospitalization&#xD;
           and at discharge), and nonpharmacological treatments (including coronary&#xD;
           revascularization, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, cardiac resynchronization&#xD;
           therapy, pacemakers, and surgical or transcatheter valvular therapies, electrical&#xD;
           conversion, intra aortic balloon pump, continuous renal replacement therapy, and&#xD;
           invasive mechanical ventilation).The causes of in-hospital death included sudden death,&#xD;
           cardiac death and non-cardiac death. All patients were followed up after discharge in&#xD;
           outpatient department, or via electronic hospital records, or conversations with&#xD;
           patients or patients' families by telephone. Outcomes for post-discharge included death&#xD;
           (sudden death, cardiac death and non-cardiac death), and rehospitalization for heart&#xD;
           failure deterioration, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac shock, syncope, and cardiac&#xD;
           transplantation were recorded and entered into the web-based database. Information about&#xD;
           physical examination, laboratory tests, ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiography, and costs&#xD;
           and use of medications were collected at each follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size: A total of 15000 patients with heart failure were planned to be recruited&#xD;
           from hospitals based on classification of economic-geographic regions in China, and a&#xD;
           minimum number of patients were expected to enroll according to the number of&#xD;
           hospitalized cases for each hospital. By September 2015, data from 13687 patients have&#xD;
           been collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plan for missing data: Validated data was used to describe the clinical characteristics&#xD;
           and treatment of patients without considering those missing. As for September 2015, the&#xD;
           missing data on most of variables accounts for no more than 10% of all patients (n =&#xD;
           13687). Furthermore, variables obtained in multiple Logistic regression models (10318)&#xD;
           for death were from over three quarters of (75.4%) of all patients. Simple and multiple&#xD;
           imputation methods were not used in this study because of a large number of patients has&#xD;
           been validated for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis plan: Clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were&#xD;
           described by using means ± standard deviation or interquartile range (IQR) for&#xD;
           continuous variables, and absolute numbers and percentages for categorical variables.&#xD;
           The comparison of subgroups were performed by Student t-test or ANOVA for symmetrical&#xD;
           continuous, Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis H test for nonsymmetric continuous, and χ2&#xD;
           tests for categorical variables. Logistic regression was used to select potential risk&#xD;
           factors for outcomes. Candidate variables associated with mortality in univariable&#xD;
           Logistic regression analysis (P ≤ 0.20) were proceeded with multivariable analysis.&#xD;
           Variables with significant P values (P &lt; 0.05) were retained in the final multivariable&#xD;
           model. Logarithmic transformation was performed to normalize the distribution of&#xD;
           variables with skewed distribution. All P values of less than 0.05 from two-sided tests&#xD;
           were accepted as statistically significant.&#xD;
