    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial targets 248 community-dwelling older adults with impaired&#xD;
      mobility (i.e. walking slowly; gait speed &lt; 1.20 m/s). The trial compares a 12 week&#xD;
      &quot;standard-plus&quot; program of strength, endurance, flexibility plus task specific timing and&#xD;
      coordination training to a standard 12 week strength, endurance and flexibility program. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is gait speed at 12 weeks. Secondary and tertiary outcomes represent&#xD;
      components of the intervention and measures of activity and participation. Delayed and&#xD;
      sustained effects of the intervention are examined at 24 and 36 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Walking difficulty is common and costly in older adults. While traditional exercise has been&#xD;
      shown to promote physical and mental health and may prevent walking difficulty, such exercise&#xD;
      has focused on strength and endurance, and has overlooked a critical component of walking&#xD;
      ability; the timing and coordination of movement. Aging and disease alter timing and&#xD;
      coordination as reflected by slowed neuromotor performance, increased gait variability and&#xD;
      reduced smoothness of movement. Task specific timing and coordination exercise that includes&#xD;
      practice of smooth coordinated aspects of gait over multiple walking conditions has the&#xD;
      potential to improve walking ability greater than a standard program. Our preliminary data&#xD;
      suggest that interventions on timing and coordination of gait impact mobility greater than&#xD;
      the standard strength and endurance program. The next key step and the objective of this&#xD;
      proposal is to combine the two interventions to determine if potential gains in mobility,&#xD;
      activity and participation obtained from a standard plus timing and coordination program, are&#xD;
      larger than the gains obtained from the standard program alone. Therefore, the primary aim of&#xD;
      the proposed project is to evaluate the impact of adding timing and coordination training to&#xD;
      standard strength and endurance training on mobility. Secondary aims include examining 1)&#xD;
      additional outcomes representing the components of the intervention and measures of activity&#xD;
      and participation, 2) the delayed and sustained effects of the intervention, and 3) the&#xD;
      effects of the intervention within various other subgroups of interest. This randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial in 248 community-dwelling older adults who walk slowly (i.e. &lt; 1.20 m/s) will&#xD;
      compare a standard 12 week strength, endurance and flexibility program to a 12 week&#xD;
      &quot;standard-plus&quot; program of strength, endurance, flexibility plus task specific timing and&#xD;
      coordination training. The primary outcome is gait speed at 12 weeks. We will also examine&#xD;
      secondary and tertiary outcomes representing components of the intervention and measures of&#xD;
      activity and participation and the delayed and sustained effects at 24 and 36 weeks. The&#xD;
      findings from this efficacy trial will provide evidence for the added value of task specific&#xD;
      timing and coordination training for promoting walking ability in older adults and will form&#xD;
      the basis for future effectiveness trials. Future work includes translation to&#xD;
      nonprofessional exercise leaders with the long-term goal to incorporate neurological training&#xD;
      into standard exercise programs for health promotion for older adults.&#xD;
