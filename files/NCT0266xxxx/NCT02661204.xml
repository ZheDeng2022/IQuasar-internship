  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a new ABUS system&#xD;
      among 4 different population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population A: women undergoing screening for familial or genetic predisposition for breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population B: women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. ABUS performance will be compared to&#xD;
      breast MRI in the pre-operative assessment of breast cancer extent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population C: women with BI-RADS 3 or 4 lesions in a routine breast imaging examination. ABUS&#xD;
      will be evaluate as a problem-solving tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population D: women undergoing breast MRI for the assessment of breast implants integrity.&#xD;
      ABUS performance will be compared to breast MRI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Population A: women in the age range of 20 to 40 years, with a strong family history of&#xD;
      breast cancer or a predisposing gene mutation such as BRCA1 or BRCA2. A total of 100 patients&#xD;
      should be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population B: women with new breast cancer diagnosis undergoing pre-operative local cancer&#xD;
      staging.A total of 50 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population C: women with lesions classified BI-RADS 3 or 4 in a routine breast imaging&#xD;
      examination. A total of 50 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population D: women undergoing breast-MRI for the evaluation of breast implants integrity. A&#xD;
      total of 50 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected duration of subject participation is 5 years for population A: every year the&#xD;
      patients will undergo ABUS examination and the results will be compared with HHUS&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In population B, C and D only one examination will be performed and the data obtained with&#xD;
      ABUS will be compared with HH-US and breast MRI data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Images will be evaluated by a radiologist with breast imaging experience and ABUS findings&#xD;
      will be compared with findings from HHUS and MR imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, two or three readers (radiologists with different levels of experience in breast&#xD;
      imaging) blinded to clinical, HH-US and MRI data, will evaluate the interobserver agreement&#xD;
      ABUS images will be evaluated by Methods of minimising bias Population A - During the&#xD;
      recruitment, family history of breast cancer will be in-depth analysed in order to avoid the&#xD;
      bias related to different levels of risk for breast cancer. In order to reduce the loss of&#xD;
      patients to follow-up, women will be invited every year to undergo HHUS and ABUS examination&#xD;
      at our department.&#xD;
