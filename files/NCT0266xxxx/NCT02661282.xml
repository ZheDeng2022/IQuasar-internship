    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of autologous cytomegalovirus&#xD;
      (CMV)-specific cytotoxic T cells when given together with temozolomide and to see how well&#xD;
      they work in treating patients with glioblastoma. Autologous CMV-specific cytotoxic T cells&#xD;
      may stimulate the immune system to attack specific tumor cells and stop them from growing or&#xD;
      kill them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, may work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,&#xD;
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving autologous CMV-specific cytotoxic T cells with&#xD;
      temozolomide may be a better treatment for patients with glioblastoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum feasible dose (MFD) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T cells in combination with dose-dense temozolomide in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the immunological effects in&#xD;
      resected glioblastoma after intravenous administered cytomegalovirus (CMV)-stimulated&#xD;
      adoptive T cells in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). (Phase II: recurrent&#xD;
      glioblastoma undergoing resection) III. To correlate 6-month progression-free survival rate&#xD;
      (PFS6) with objective clearance of CMV antigens as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and&#xD;
      by ex vivo T-cell-specific effector responses using intracellular cytokine profiling. (Phase&#xD;
      II: recurrent glioblastoma undergoing resection) IV. Overall survival (OS). (Phase II: newly&#xD;
      diagnosed glioblastoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Time to progression, overall survival (OS) as well as immunological reactivity and safety.&#xD;
      (Phase II: recurrent glioblastoma undergoing resection) II. Safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      dose-dense temozolomide in combination with intravenous administered CMV-stimulated adoptive&#xD;
      T cells in patients receiving adjuvant therapy after completing external beam radiotherapy&#xD;
      with concurrent temozolomide for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. (Phase II: newly diagnosed&#xD;
      glioblastoma) III. Overall objective response rate (ORR), median duration of response, PFS6.&#xD;
      (Phase II: newly diagnosed glioblastoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the persistence and expansion of adoptively-infused CMV-specific T cells by&#xD;
      multiparameter flow cytometry in serially-sampled peripheral blood. (Phase I) II. To identify&#xD;
      imaging characteristics such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) textural analysis associated&#xD;
      with immunological changes in tumor following treatment with CMV-stimulated adoptive T cells.&#xD;
      (Phase II: recurrent glioblastoma undergoing resection) III. To ascertain if adoptive&#xD;
      transfer of CMV-specific T cells leads to the expansion of T cells with specificity to other&#xD;
      glioblastoma antigens (i.e. epitope spreading) by performing longitudinally monitoring of&#xD;
      antigen-specific T cell frequency with enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISPOT).&#xD;
      (Phase II: recurrent glioblastoma undergoing resection) IV. To determine the persistence and&#xD;
      expansion of adoptively-infused CMV-specific T cells by multiparameter flow cytometry in&#xD;
      serially-sampled peripheral blood. (Phase II: newly diagnosed glioblastoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of CMV-specific T cells followed by a phase&#xD;
      II study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) once a day (QD) on days 1-21 and&#xD;
      CMV-specific T cell transfer intravenously (IV) over 1-5 minutes on day 22. Patients undergo&#xD;
      surgery on day 30 of cycle 1. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 4 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive temozolomide&#xD;
      PO QD on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-21 and CMV-specific T cell transfer&#xD;
      intravenously IV over 1-5 minutes on day 22. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 4&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive&#xD;
      temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 3 months.&#xD;

Toxicity rate of 30% or higher will be considered unacceptable. The prior probability of toxicity is assumed to follow a Beta (0.3, 0.7) distribution with one patient worth of information. The toxicity will be monitored by a cohort size of 4, starting after at least 8 patients have completed toxicity evaluation (within cycle one). Will be summarized by frequency and 95% confidence interval. AEs will be tabulated by grade and by their relationship to the treatment.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE II DOSE EXPANSION IN RECURRENT GBM UNDERGOING RESECTION: Have histologically&#xD;
             confirmed World Health Organization grade IV malignant glioma (glioblastoma or&#xD;
             gliosarcoma); participants will also be eligible if the original histology was lower&#xD;
             grade glioma and there is suspected transformation to glioblastoma based on imaging&#xD;
             findings; if the final pathology report after resection fails to confirm recurrent&#xD;
             glioblastoma or gliosarcoma, the subject will be followed for adverse events (AEs) and&#xD;
             survival, but excluded for other primary and secondary objective analysis; the subject&#xD;
             will be replaced&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE II DOSE EXPANSION IN NEWLY DIAGNOSED GBM: Have histologically confirmed World&#xD;
             Health Organization grade IV glioma (glioblastoma or gliosarcoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE II DOSE EXPANSION IN RECURRENT GBM UNDERGOING RESECTION: Be at first relapse;&#xD;
             Note: relapse is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e., radiation,&#xD;
             chemotherapy, or radiation plus (+) chemotherapy); if the participant had a surgical&#xD;
             resection for relapsed disease and no antitumor therapy instituted for up to 12 weeks,&#xD;
             this is considered one relapse; for participants who had prior therapy for a lower&#xD;
             grade glioma, the surgical diagnosis of glioblastoma or gliosarcoma will be considered&#xD;
             first relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE II DOSE EXPANSION IN NEWLY DIAGNOSED GBM: Patients must have completed standard&#xD;
             radiation therapy with concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) within 5 weeks (wks) of&#xD;
             enrollment and must not have evidence of progressive disease on post treatment&#xD;
             imaging; progression can only be defined using diagnostic imaging if there is new&#xD;
             enhancement outside of the radiation field (beyond the high-dose region or 80% isodose&#xD;
             line) or if there is unequivocal evidence of viable tumor on histopathologic sampling&#xD;
             (e.g., solid tumor areas [i.e,&gt; 70% tumor cell nuclei in areas], high or progressive&#xD;
             increase in mindbomb homolog 1[MIB-1] proliferation index compared with prior biopsy,&#xD;
             or evidence for histologic progression or increased anaplasia in tumor); Note: given&#xD;
             the difficulty of differentiating true progression from pseudoprogression, clinical&#xD;
             decline alone, in the absence of radiographic or histologic confirmation of&#xD;
             progression, will not be sufficient for definition of progressive disease in the first&#xD;
             12 weeks after completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE II DOSE EXPANSION IN RECURRENT GBM UNDERGOING RESECTION: Have measurable disease&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator&#xD;
