      The aim of this study is to determine the surgical site infection rate and the patient's&#xD;
      satisfaction for closure of subcutaneous tissue versus non closure of subcutaneous tissue&#xD;
      after cesarean delivery in women with diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized prospective comparative clinical study will be conducted in Ain Shams&#xD;
      University, Maternity Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include a sample of (136) pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      and type 2 diabetes mellitus who underwent elective Cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will b divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (closure group): will include 68 pregnant women who underwent elective Cesarean&#xD;
      section with closure of subcutaneous tissue. Group B (non closure group): will include 68&#xD;
      pregnant women who underwent elective Cesarean section without closure of subcutaneous&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ All participants in the study will have consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included women will be subjected to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. History Full history taking, (personal, present, past and obstetrics history).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical examination including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of vital data&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessment of general condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cardiac and chest examination, to exclude any contraindication for anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of fundal level for fetal dating, fetal lie and fetal heart sound. 3.&#xD;
      Investigations: Laboratory Complete blood picture.- Random blood sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal biometry for fetal dating and fetal viability. 4. All participants operated under&#xD;
      general or spinal anesthesia. Prophylactic antibiotic is given according to the approved&#xD;
      protocol of Ain Shams Maternity Hospital (as two intravenous doses of broad spectrum&#xD;
      penicillin (after clamping of the umbilical cord and 12 hours postoperatively. Oral&#xD;
      antibiotic of the same group was then started for 3-5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.In group A (closure group)the subcutaneous fat will be closed with three to five&#xD;
      interrupted sutures. The sutures were tied until the tissue was adequately re-approximated,&#xD;
      but not as hard as possible to avoid necrosis. In group B (non closure group) the&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat will not sutured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.In all participants Skin to be closed by subcuticular stitches using absorbable polyglactin&#xD;
      910 suture 7. Dressing is removed after 48hours postoperatively, to be disinfected with&#xD;
      alcohol 70% antiseptic solution daily in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. The wound is to be inspected 48 hours, 7 days and one month after the cesarean section.&#xD;
