    <textblock>
      Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) is a clinical-radiological entity, which&#xD;
      is associated with a variety of clinical conditions. The imaging and clinical findings are&#xD;
      typically reversible, but many patients still have permanent neurological sequelae with a&#xD;
      fatal outcome. Up to now there are no consistent conclusions about the factors that affecting&#xD;
      its prognosis. The objective of our study is to discuss the effects of different causes,&#xD;
      different imaging findings and laboratory parameters on the prognosis of PRES and deepen the&#xD;
      understanding of the nature of PRES. This will contribute to predict the prognosis of&#xD;
      patients with PRES and to further investigate the pathogenesis of PRES so as to guide the&#xD;
      clinical treatment and follow-up evaluation. A multi-center retrospective case study will be&#xD;
      performed from January 2016 to July 2017 and a total of 400 patients who meet the criteria&#xD;
      for PRES diagnosis from 10 sub-centers are anticipated included in this research. Patients&#xD;
      will be divided into several subgroups according to the etiology. Date will be collected from&#xD;
      the clinical recordsï¼Œimaging and laboratory data of the patients, including demographic data,&#xD;
      clinical data, imaging findings, laboratory parameters and follow-up data. During the&#xD;
      follow-up, MRI and blood biochemical examination will be performed once more. The imaging&#xD;
      findings of the patients will be assessed by two neuroimaging physicians, any difference&#xD;
      between them will be agreed upon by consensus. Prognosis of the patients will be assessed by&#xD;
      using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores. All of the above data is saved into the&#xD;
      database. In this study we will review etiologies and imaging findings, laboratory and&#xD;
      follow-up data of the patients we selected. Univariate and multivariate analysis will be&#xD;
      performed within the group and between groups according to the subgroups. Then we will&#xD;
      discuss the connection between different causes, different imaging findings and laboratory&#xD;
      parameters and the prognosis of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.&#xD;

      Background and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) is a clinical-radiological syndrome. It&#xD;
      was first described by Hinchey et al. in 1996. It is characterized by a variable combination&#xD;
      of headaches, seizures, altered mental status, visual impairment, nausea, vomiting and focal&#xD;
      neurological signs and accompanied with symmetric vasogenic edema of bilateral posterior&#xD;
      cerebral circulation territory. PRES is associated with multiple risk factors, such as renal&#xD;
      dysfunction, hypertension, cytotoxic drugs, autoimmune disease and pre-eclampsia or&#xD;
      eclampsia, which can occur in a wide range of diseases and predisposing factors. Lesions are&#xD;
      usually located in the parietal occipital region. However, lesions may also involve&#xD;
      unilateral cerebral hemisphere, anterior circulation area or deep brain structure. According&#xD;
      to the location of the lesions, five distribution patterns were described: mainly&#xD;
      parietal-occipital pattern, superior frontal sulcus pattern, holo-hemispheric watershed&#xD;
      pattern, partial or asymmetric expression of the primary patterns and central pattern. In&#xD;
      addition, cytotoxic edema with associated diffusion restriction, abnormal enhancement due to&#xD;
      blood brain barrier disruption, hemorrhages, infarction are atypical findings which may be&#xD;
      occasionally detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRES is associated with a variety of clinical conditions. The occurrence of PRES is not&#xD;
      affected by age and gender, it may present in all age groups. The occurrence of PRES may be a&#xD;
      result of either breakdown of cerebral autoregulation and disruption of blood brain barrier,&#xD;
      causing vasogenic edema or endothelial dysfunction resulting from circulating toxic&#xD;
      mediators, sepsis, autoimmune conditions, or eclampsia. Up to now, the pathophysiological&#xD;
      mechanism of PRES is still not clear, but cerebral autoregulation impairment and endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction are considered to be the most important potential mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRES usually has a favourable prognosis. The clinical and imaging findings are often&#xD;
      reversible when the underlying causes are eliminated and the blood pressure is controlled.&#xD;
      Even so, many patients still have permanent neurological sequelae and have a mortality of&#xD;
      5%-15%. Known risk factors for PRES include hypertension, renal disease and immunosuppressive&#xD;
      therapy, and researchers have also found that lymphopenia and dyslipidemia are the potential&#xD;
      risk factors for PRES. The prognostic factors of PRES include the presence of PRES risk&#xD;
      factors, duration of symptoms, the presence of cytotoxic edema and hemorrhage. Alhilali et&#xD;
      al. through the retrospective analysis of the etiologies, imaging findings and cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid examination of the 47 PRES patients with lumbar puncture showed that clinical factors,&#xD;
      imaging findings, cerebrospinal fluid laboratory results all affect the prognosis of PRES,&#xD;
      with low CSF glucose, hypertensive encephalopathy, and imaging findings of hemorrhage&#xD;
      increasing the risk of fatal outcome, while toxemia of pregnancy was found to have a&#xD;
      relatively protective effect. Recent research had shown correlation of MRI findings and LDH&#xD;
      and albumin levels, suggesting that these biochemical indices may be used as a prognostic&#xD;
      factor. Although the various risk factors of PRES and its related imaging findings are well&#xD;
      described, and in previous studies, the relationship between clinical factors, imaging&#xD;
      findings, laboratory examination results and prognosis of PRES were analyzed respectively by&#xD;
      different investigators, their relative effects on the prognosis are remain unclear and there&#xD;
      are no consistent conclusions about it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here we use a multi-center approach to conduct this study to ensure a larger patients sample.&#xD;
      This proposed multi-center retrospective study will analyze the factors that influence the&#xD;
      prognosis of the patients with PRES. The aim of our research is to study the connection&#xD;
      between different causes, different imaging findings, laboratory findings and clinical&#xD;
      outcome in patients with PRES and deepen the understanding of the nature of PRES. The&#xD;
      pathogenesis of PRES will be further discussed based on the results obtained. This will&#xD;
      contribute to predict the prognosis of patients with PRES and to further investigate the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of PRES so as to guide the clinical treatment and follow-up evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Overall Design of The Research&#xD;
&#xD;
           A multi-center retrospective case study, after securing required Institutional Review&#xD;
           Board approval, will be performed from January 2016 to July 2015 and the patients with&#xD;
           complete inpatient clinical records who meet the criteria from 10 sub-centers will be&#xD;
           included. Patients' demographic data, clinical data, auxiliary examination, imaging&#xD;
           findings and follow-up data will be collected and summarized. The imaging findings of&#xD;
           the patients will be assessed by two neuroimaging physicians, any difference between&#xD;
           them will be agreed upon by consensus. Following this, the connection between the&#xD;
           different causes, different imaging findings, laboratory findings and clinical outcome&#xD;
           of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients and Grouping&#xD;
&#xD;
           A total of 400 patients with complete inpatient clinical records who meet the criteria&#xD;
           from 10 sub-centers will be included in this research. The patients above will be&#xD;
           divided into several subgroups according to the causes of the disease, including&#xD;
           hypertensive encephalopathy, cytotoxic drugs, toxemia of pregnancy (pre-eclampsia or&#xD;
           eclampsia), autoimmune diseases and other diseases (anemia, hypomagnesemia, infection,&#xD;
           sepsis, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data Acquisition&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following information will be collected by reviewing the medical records and&#xD;
           follow-up of the patients who met the inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Basic information: demographic and sociological characteristics of patients, such as&#xD;
           name, gender, age and so on; Clinical date: including the history of past illness,&#xD;
           etiology, symptoms (headache, seizures, visual disturbances, nausea and vomiting,&#xD;
           altered mental status, focal neurological signs, etc.), blood pressure/MAP at the time&#xD;
           of attack, therapeutic measure, time from symptom onset to control of the causative&#xD;
           factor, hospitalization, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Examination to identify cause of PRES: including blood biochemical examination (enzymes,&#xD;
           metabolites, minerals, blood protein, etc.), lumbar puncture cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
           examination, EEG, blood gas analysis, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Imaging examination: including the time from PRES onset to MRI examination, location of&#xD;
           lesion , the distribution pattern of edema, degree of edema, cytotoxic edema appears or&#xD;
           not, abnormal enhanced appears or not, hemorrhage appears or not, MRA or DSA&#xD;
           examination, perfusion weighted imaging, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Time interval from PRES onset to MRI follow-up; Follow up imaging findings; Prognosis&#xD;
           observation: discharge status, including the partial or complete recovery of abnormal&#xD;
           imaging, hemorrhagic and ischemic complications appear or not ,continue medication&#xD;
           treatment or not (antihypertensive drugs, anticonvulsant drugs, etc.), death; time from&#xD;
           symptoms onset to recovery of image abnormalities; recurrence and interval time;&#xD;
           increased patient's current MRI and blood biochemical examination; the patients' mRS&#xD;
           score at the time of onset, discharge and follow-up were achieved by review cases and&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           All of the above data is saved into the database. In this study we will review&#xD;
           etiologies and imaging findings, laboratory and follow-up data of the patients we&#xD;
           selected. Univariate and multivariate analysis will be performed within the group and&#xD;
           between groups according to the subgroups. In this research prognosis of the patients&#xD;
           will be assessed by using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores. Single PRES related&#xD;
           factors will be tested with Chi-square test. Intergroup comparison will be performed by&#xD;
           using student t-test for normally distributed variables and Mann-Whitney U test for&#xD;
           variables not normally distributed. In binary variable analysis, logistic regression&#xD;
           analysis will be used to analysis factors related PRES. In polytomous variable analysis,&#xD;
           multivariate logistic regression analysis will be performed to analyze factors related&#xD;
           to PRES.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Quality Control&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be identified strictly in accordance with the established inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. The imaging findings of the patients will be assessed by 2 neuroimaging&#xD;
      physicians and the consensus will be reached through consultation when there were&#xD;
      differences. The members of the group who assess the prognosis of PRES should be unified&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline of Events&#xD;
&#xD;
