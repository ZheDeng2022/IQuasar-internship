  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well recognized that a subset of patients who contracts Hepatitis C virus (HCV)&#xD;
      spontaneously clears the virus. Such individuals are anti-HCV antibody positive, yet HCV RNA&#xD;
      PCR negative in the blood. While they have not been considered candidates for live kidney&#xD;
      donation in the past, with the recent availability of novel anti-HCV drugs with &gt;95% cure&#xD;
      rates, they now represent a potential pool of donor candidates, especially since the risk for&#xD;
      transmission of HCV to the recipient is extremely low. The investigators goal is to&#xD;
      demonstrate that live kidney donation from anti-HCV positive, HCV RNA PCR negative&#xD;
      individuals is safe and carries a negligible risk of viral transmission to the recipient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who test positive for anti-HCV IgG antibody, but who have negative blood HCV RNA&#xD;
      PCR are generally considered to have been infected with HCV but to have cleared the the virus&#xD;
      spontaneously. However, due to the general conservative approach of living donor kidney&#xD;
      transplant programs, these individuals are not considered potential live kidney donors,&#xD;
      despite being considered at extremely low risk for HCV transmission to the recipient. This&#xD;
      reluctance stems from past experiences with post-transplant HCV complications, both hepatic&#xD;
      (e.g. cirrhosis) and extra-hepatic (e.g. transplant glomerulonephritis) and from the fact&#xD;
      that the historical mainstay of HCV treatment, interferon, was poorly tolerated, had low cure&#xD;
      rates, and caused transplant rejection. Now, however, highly effective novel therapeutics may&#xD;
      transform the way transplant physicians and patients think about HCV-positive donated&#xD;
      kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these new agents, the current cure rates for HCV now exceed 95%. A recent report&#xD;
      demonstrated high cure rates even in the liver transplant setting, suggesting that&#xD;
      immunosuppression does not impede eradication and that interactions between HCV and&#xD;
      transplant drugs can be successfully managed. Thus, while the risk of transmission of&#xD;
      infection from anti-HCV antibody positive, HCV PCR-negative is not known, if transmission&#xD;
      were to occur, treatment is now possible, to the point where transplant professionals are&#xD;
      beginning to advocate using anti-HCV Ab positive individuals as donors for HCV-negative&#xD;
      recipients. A group in Barcelona reported transplantation of a live donor kidney from a donor&#xD;
      treated with an anti-HCV regimen that achieved a sustained virological response to her spouse&#xD;
      with no transmission of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main area of concern seems to be what is described as &quot;occult HCV infection&quot;- the&#xD;
      presence of HCV RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and organ tissue by ultrasensitive&#xD;
      assays in the absence of detectable RNA in the serum. However, this entity is itself&#xD;
      controversial, and its significance is uncertain, with inadequately described risk of&#xD;
      transmission. If HCV were transmitted and successfully treated, another concern is the&#xD;
      potential residual risks of viral complications, even though these have not been evident in&#xD;
      any previous trials. Finally, a major concern is financial, as HCV treatment currently costs&#xD;
      more than $80,000 for a 3-month regimen. However, chronic hemodialysis costs upwards of&#xD;
      $100,000 per year when all costs are considered, while kidney transplantation costs only&#xD;
      about $20,000 per year after the first year. Thus, over time, even after treatment for CMV&#xD;
      infection, if it is required, kidney transplantation would result in an overall cost savings&#xD;
      to the health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the unknown, though generally considered very low risk of transmission of HCV from an&#xD;
      antibody-positive, PCR-negative individual, combined with the wide availability of effective&#xD;
      treatment for HCV infection, it is felt that the recipient is not exposed to a high risk of&#xD;
      infection in such a transplant. Furthermore, this small risk needs to be weighed against the&#xD;
      risk of staying on dialysis, which carries a mortality rate of 6.5-7.4 times that of the&#xD;
      general population and 4.6-5.9 times that of the renal transplant population. The case&#xD;
      becomes even more compelling when considering patients with a high risk of deterioration if&#xD;
      they continue dialysis (elderly, diabetics, and those with cardiovascular disease),&#xD;
      disadvantageous blood types, and those with broad sensitization, with extremely limited&#xD;
      compatible donor options. Given the proven survival benefit of kidney transplantation in&#xD;
      patients with chronic HCV, there is ample reason to believe that providing HCV positive&#xD;
      kidneys and HCV therapy (if indeed required) to HCV negative recipients will lead to better&#xD;
      outcomes than those associated with remaining on dialysis.&#xD;
