  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional gastrointestinal disorders are common disorders that are characterized by&#xD;
      persistent and recurring GI symptoms. These occur as a result of abnormal functioning of the&#xD;
      GI tract and are not caused by structural or biochemical abnormalities. As a result, medical&#xD;
      tests- such as blood tests and endoscopic exams- have essentially normal/negative&#xD;
      (non-disease) results. More than 20 functional GI disorders have been identified. They can&#xD;
      affect any part of the GI tract. One of the most common functional disorders is nausea and&#xD;
      dyspepsia (pain or discomfort in the upper abdominal area, feeling of fullness, bloating).&#xD;
      Any chronic illness, including functional nausea, will affect a person's health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (general well-being, ability to carry out everyday activities), additional&#xD;
      psychosocial disturbances and amplify the experienced illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of children suffering from functional nausea in Europe are treated with&#xD;
      Iberogast®. a herbal mixture, whose effect was demonstrated in several studies. Since&#xD;
      Iberogast® is not available in the United States of America, children there receive an&#xD;
      acupressure therapy. The American gastroenterologists refer hereby to several studies, which&#xD;
      have shown, that the positive effect of such therapies in patients with chemotherapy-induced&#xD;
      nausea is even greater than a therapy with ondansetron. Since acupressure is able to reduce&#xD;
      somatic nausea, it is also believed to decrease functional nausea, but it has never been&#xD;
      investigated. Therefore, there are no data. That's why Investigators want to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of these two therapies, that is, Iberogast® and acupressure&#xD;

      Functional gastrointestinal disorders are common disorders that are characterized by&#xD;
      persistent and recurring GI symptoms. These occur as a result of abnormal functioning of the&#xD;
      GI tract and are not caused by structural or biochemical abnormalities. As a result, medical&#xD;
      tests- such as blood tests and endoscopic exams- have essentially normal/negative&#xD;

      Any chronic illness, including functional nausea, will affect a person's health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (general well-being, ability to carry out everyday activities), additional&#xD;
      psychosocial disturbances and amplify the experienced illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the majority of children suffering from functional Nausea in Europe get treated with&#xD;
      Iberogast®: A herbal mixture, whose effect was demonstrated in several studies [10, 11].&#xD;
      Since Iberogast® is not available in the United States of America, children receive there an&#xD;
      acupressure therapy. The American gastroenterologists refer hereby to several studies, which&#xD;
      have shown, that the effect of such therapies in patient with chemotherapy-induced nausea is&#xD;
      even greater than the taking of ondansetron [12,13 ]. Since acupressure is capable to reduce&#xD;
      somatic nausea, it is also believed to decrease functional nausea, but it has never been&#xD;
      investigated, therefore no data are available. That's why Investigators plan to compare the&#xD;
      efficiency of these two therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore Investigators want to measure the cognitive performance before and after the&#xD;
      intervention to proof a possible effect on the 'gut-brain-axis'. For this purpose the&#xD;
      participants have to do the 'Flanker Task', a standardised test on the computer.&#xD;
