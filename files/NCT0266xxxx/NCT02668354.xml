      The aim of this study is to investigate the spectrum of various types of malignant neoplasms&#xD;
      of infancy, according to the experience of South Egypt Cancer Institute, which represents the&#xD;
      largest referral site in Upper Egypt.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer in the first year of life is relatively rare ; however, the age of peak cancer&#xD;
      incidence among children occurs during the first year of life, representing 10% of all cancer&#xD;
      that was diagnosed among children younger than 15 years of age. Female and male infants have&#xD;
      essentially the same overall cancer incidence rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer occurring in infants often has a clinical and biological behavior that is different&#xD;
      from cancers occurring in older children. The histologic distribution of cancers in infants&#xD;
      and that in older children are also different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients &amp; Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From January 2001 to December 2015, retrieval &amp; analysis of the medical records of infant&#xD;
      patients, diagnosed with any of malignant tumors, at the pediatric oncology department at&#xD;
      South Egypt Cancer Institute will be done. Pathologic diagnoses &amp; age of the patients will be&#xD;
      verified for the enrollment in the study. The collected data will be analyzed to delineate&#xD;
      the spectrum of these disease entities, their clinico-pathologic features, associated&#xD;
      patients' demographics and characteristics, treatment modalities received, and outcomes of&#xD;
      these treatments.&#xD;
