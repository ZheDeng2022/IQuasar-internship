    <textblock>
      This study is intended to demonstrate that the Simplify® Disc is at least as safe and&#xD;
      effective as conventional anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) when used to treat&#xD;
      one level between C3 to C7 for cervical degenerative disc disease (DDD) defined as&#xD;
      intractable radiculopathy (arm pain and/or a neurological deficit) with or without neck pain&#xD;
      or myelopathy due to a single-level abnormality localized to the level of the disc space in&#xD;
      subjects who are unresponsive to conservative management.&#xD;

      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      Simplify® Disc for treatment of DDD compared to conventional ACDF for reconstruction of the&#xD;
      disc space at one level between C3 to C7 for DDD defined as intractable radiculopathy (arm&#xD;
      pain and/or a neurological deficit) with or without neck pain or myelopathy due to a&#xD;
      single-level abnormality localized to the level of the disc space that is unresponsive to&#xD;
      conservative management.&#xD;
