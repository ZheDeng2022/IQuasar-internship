  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is an infectious disease caused by a parasite that is passed to humans when an&#xD;
      infected mosquito bites a person. About 3.4 billion people live in areas of the world where&#xD;
      malaria is regularly found. In many countries, malaria is one of the leading causes of&#xD;
      illness and death. Despite this, there are a limited number of drugs, called antimalarials,&#xD;
      that can be used to treat malaria and increasing reports of resistance to existing&#xD;
      antimalarials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to test a new experimental antimalarial drug called&#xD;
      SJ733 to first assess its safety, tolerability and blood levels in healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-dose, multi-dose and boosted-dose cohorts (both single and multi-dose) will be&#xD;
      studied. The pharmacoenhancer (booster), cobicistat, will be given in combination with SJ733&#xD;
      in the boosted dose-cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the preliminary safety and tolerability of escalating doses of antimalarial&#xD;
           SJ733 in healthy human volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of escalating doses of antimalarial&#xD;
           SJ733 and its metabolite in healthy human volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify a dose of SJ733 that can be tested in a separate Phase 1b human malaria&#xD;
           challenge study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the preliminary safety and tolerability of SJ733 in healthy adult volunteers&#xD;
           after multiple oral dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics of SJ733 and its metabolite SJ506 after multiple dosing&#xD;
           of SJ733 in healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the preliminary safety and tolerability of escalating single oral doses of&#xD;
           SJ733 in combination with cobicistat among healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics of SJ733 and its metabolite SJ506 after single oral doses&#xD;
           of SJ733 in combination with cobicistat among healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the preliminary safety and tolerability of SJ733 in combination with&#xD;
           cobicistat in healthy adult volunteers after multiple oral dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics of SJ733 and its metabolite SJ506 after multiple dosing&#xD;
           of SJ733 in combination with cobicistat among healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the impact of food intake on the pharmacokinetic profile of antimalarial&#xD;
           SJ733.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single site, Phase 1a, first-in-human, oral, primarily single-dose, dose escalation&#xD;
      study of (+)-SJ000557733 (SJ733) in healthy adult volunteers. SJ733, is an investigational&#xD;
      oral anti-malarial agent is a novel inhibitor of Plasmodium falciparum plasma membrane&#xD;
      protein (PfATP4). Subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be enrolled using a leap frog,&#xD;
      fixed dose escalation design with an adaptive component where 6 subjects are enrolled per&#xD;
      dose cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following successful completion of the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment resulting&#xD;
      from the single-dose escalation portion of the study, a three-dose cohort study will be&#xD;
      undertaken. It includes once per day oral dosing for 3 consecutive days. Both single and&#xD;
      multi-dose cohorts of SJ733 in combination with cobicistat (boosted cohorts) will also be&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the study results from the single-dose cohorts of SJ733 in combination with cobicistat&#xD;
      (boosted cohorts) were reviewed, multi-dose cohorts of SJ733 in combination with cobicistat&#xD;
      (boosted cohorts) were not conducted and Phase 2 study planning initiated.&#xD;
