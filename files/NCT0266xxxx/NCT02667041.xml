  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating illness that affects millions of&#xD;
      individuals in North America and can result in clinical symptoms including loss of pleasure&#xD;
      and feelings of worthlessness, in addition to significant cognitive impairments (e.g.,&#xD;
      memory, attention) that affect daily functioning. Major depression bears a heavy burden for&#xD;
      the individuals and family members afflicted, as well as an enormous health care and economic&#xD;
      cost. Approximately half of major depressive patients seek out treatment for their illness&#xD;
      and only 20% of those individuals report their treatment as satisfactory. Many MDD patients&#xD;
      do not respond to pharmacological therapy following the first course of treatment, resulting&#xD;
      in the need for alternative measures to alleviate the clinical and cognitive symptoms of&#xD;
      treatment-resistant depression and the targeting of these therapies to better suit each&#xD;
      individual patient. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a well-accepted,&#xD;
      non-invasive technique that utilizes currents to induce electrical fields that excite&#xD;
      specific brain regions. The current recommended practice of rTMS involves the administration&#xD;
      of a biphasic stimulus waveform; however, a novel method using monophasic pulses may prove&#xD;
      more effective for the treatment of depression. The present study aims to determine the&#xD;
      effect of monophasic rTMS compared to biphasic rTMS on cognitive processing in MDD patients&#xD;
      through electrophysiological recordings of the brain taken before and after 6 weeks of&#xD;
      stimulation. Additionally, the study aims to investigate various biological markers linked to&#xD;
      clinical rTMS response; these brain markers will help in personalizing treatment for&#xD;
      individuals suffering from MDD.&#xD;
