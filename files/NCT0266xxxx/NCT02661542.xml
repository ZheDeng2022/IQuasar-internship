  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 1/2a, dose-escalation study of FF-10502-01 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors and&#xD;
      Lymphomas. A total of up to 9 cohorts will be enrolled in Phase 1 to establish the MTD. Phase&#xD;
      2 will consist of 2 cohorts: Cohort 1 will include subjects with Pancreatic Cancer. Cohort 2&#xD;
      will include subjects with another tumor type enrolled in the Phase 1 dose-escalation phase&#xD;
      who have demonstrated Clinical Benefit by Week 16.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive doses of FF-10502-01 intravenously (IV) weekly for three weeks,&#xD;
      repeated every 28 days (= 1 cycle). Disease assessments, based on computed tomography (CT),&#xD;
      magnetic resonance image (MRI), and, for lymphoma, [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (FDG-PET) scans, will be obtained at Week 8 and every 8 weeks thereafter until&#xD;
      documented progression of disease (PD). Subjects who demonstrate clinical benefit will be&#xD;
      allowed to continue therapy with FF-10502-01 until progression of disease, observation of&#xD;
      unacceptable adverse events, intercurrent illness or changes in the subject's condition that&#xD;
      prevents further study participation.&#xD;
