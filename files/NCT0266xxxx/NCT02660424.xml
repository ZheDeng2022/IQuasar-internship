&#xD;
          -  Subjects (male and female [of non-childbearing potential]) will be between the ages of&#xD;
             40 and 80 years, inclusive. Female subjects must have a negative pregnancy test at&#xD;
             Screening and on Day 1 of each Treatment Period and must not be nursing; male subjects&#xD;
             must not have a female partner who is pregnant or nursing.&#xD;

             pain on the majority of days for the past 30 days. Symptoms must include knee joint&#xD;
             pain. In subjects with bilateral knee osteoarthritis, the more symptomatic knee will&#xD;
             be considered the index knee.&#xD;
&#xD;

             12 months before the Day 1 Visit.&#xD;
