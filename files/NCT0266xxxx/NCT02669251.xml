    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is a complication people can experience after&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant. It usually affects people with chronic graft versus host&#xD;
      disease (cGVHD). This occurs when donor stem cells attack the cells of the person who&#xD;
      received them. BOS reduces airflow and oxygen levels in the body. It may be caused by&#xD;
      neutrophil elastase in the body. Researchers believe the new drug alvelestat (MPH966) may&#xD;
      help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the safety of alvelestat (MPH966) and see what dose best inhibits neutrophil elastase&#xD;
      in people with BOS after a stem cell transplant. To study how well the best dose improves&#xD;
      lung function in those people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18 and older who have had a hematopoietic stem cell transplant and have cGVHD and BOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine&#xD;
      tests. They will have lung function and heart function tests. They will have computed&#xD;
      tomography scans of the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study part 1: Participants will take the starting dose of the study drug by mouth twice a day&#xD;
      for 14 days. This is 1 cycle. They will get different doses, for up to 4 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study part 2: Participants will take the study drug twice a day by mouth at the dose set in&#xD;
      part 1, for up to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep medicine diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have several study visits. These may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeats of the screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sputum samples taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6-minute walking test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      cGVHD assessment and answer questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted after the study for up to 24 months.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of non-relapse morbidity&#xD;
           and mortality in persons after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is a complication of cGVHD associated with a&#xD;
           high morbidity and mortality, and treatment options are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neutrophil elastase (NE) is a protease released by neutrophils in the setting of&#xD;
           inflammation, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of BOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alvelestat (MPH966) (Formerly known as AZD9668) is a potent and selective inhibitor of&#xD;
           NE that has demonstrated evidence of target inhibition and a good safety profile in&#xD;
           patients with inflammatory lung diseases, but has not been evaluated in BOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the optimal biologic dose (OBD) based on maximal NE inhibition measured in&#xD;
      blood, and to determine the safety of alvelestat (MPH966) in patients with BOS after SCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the clinical efficacy of alvelestat (MPH966) at the OBD in patients with BOS&#xD;
      after SCT, based on the proportion of patients with stable or improved forced expiratory&#xD;
      volume in 1 second (FEV1) on pulmonary function testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BOS after SCT and moderate to severe cGVHD as defined by the NIH consensus criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within 2 years from the time of diagnosis (Phase 2 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 60%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If on systemic cGVHD therapy, must be receiving stable or tapering doses in the&#xD;
           preceding 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be required to have received prior treatment with azithromycin for at&#xD;
           least 3 months prior to enrollment, unless there is evidence of progression or&#xD;
           unsatisfactory response while on azithromycin prior to 3 months of treatment, as deemed&#xD;
           by the treating or referring physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are on azithromycin, an antibiotic used in the treatment of BOS, will need&#xD;
           to discontinue for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FEV1 &lt; 30% (based on absolute percent predicted using USA-ITS-NIH equation) on pulmonary&#xD;
           function testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior use of neutrophil elastase inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progressive malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncontrolled infection or any major organ dysfunction as defined by the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a Phase 1b trial to determine the OBD and safety of alvelestat (MPH966) in&#xD;
           patients with BOS after SCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This trial will use an intra-patient dose escalation schedule. The starting dose will be&#xD;
           60mg twice daily for 2 weeks, and the dose will be increased by 60mg with each&#xD;
           escalation every 2 weeks until a maximum dose of 240mg twice daily is reached for a&#xD;
           total treatment period of 8 weeks. After completion of the dose escalation phase,&#xD;
           patients will have the option to continue the dose at which maximal NE inhibition and&#xD;
           safety are demonstrated for up to 6 additional months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The co-primary endpoint of OBD will be defined as the dose level at which the maximal NE&#xD;
           inhibition occurs, and at which no more than 1/3 of patients experience a DLT. NE&#xD;
           activity will be measured in the blood at baseline and with each dose escalation, and&#xD;
           will be compared between dose levels to determine the OBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The co-primary endpoint of safety will be determined by monitoring adverse events and&#xD;
           dose limiting toxicities (DLT) as defined by the protocol. Further dose escalation will&#xD;
           cease in a patient who experiences a DLT. In addition, no subsequent patients will be&#xD;
           treated at or beyond the dose in which 1/3 of patients have experienced a DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of 10 patients will be enrolled in the Phase 1b trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a Phase 2 trial to determine the efficacy of alvelestat (MPH966)at the OBD in&#xD;
           patients with BOS after SCT, as measured by stabilization or improvement of FEV1 (based&#xD;
           on absolute percent predicted) after 6 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive alvelestat (MPH966) at the OBD determined in the Phase 1b trial,&#xD;
           and pulmonary function testing with measurement of FEV1 will be performed to determine&#xD;
           the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response assessments will occur every 3 months with primary efficacy endpoint evaluated&#xD;
           at 6 months. Patients with stable or responding disease will have the option to continue&#xD;
           therapy for another 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As an early stopping rule for futility, if 0-2 of the first 8 patients enrolled have&#xD;
           responded, then no further patients will be accrued. While up to10 patients may be&#xD;
           required for the Phase 1b portion of the trial and 20 patients may be needed for&#xD;
           evaluation in phase II, in order to allow for a small number of inevaluable patients,&#xD;
           the accrual ceiling will be set at 34 patients.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and have moderate&#xD;
             to severe chronic GVHD as defined by the NIH consensus criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have BOS as defined by the NIH consensus criteria (2014 updated&#xD;
             criteria). To meet the criteria for BOS, all of the following must be present, in&#xD;
             addition to at least one distinctive manifestation of cGVHD:&#xD;

               -  FEV1 &lt;75% of predicted with greater than or equal to 10% decline over less than 2&#xD;
                  years. FEV1 should not correct to &gt;75% with albuterol, and the absolute decline&#xD;
                  for the corrected values should still remain at greater than or equal to 10% from&#xD;
                  pre-translplant&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absence of infection in the respiratory tract&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  One of the 2 supporting features of BOS:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Evidence of air trapping by expiratory CT or small airway thickening or&#xD;
                       bronchiectasis by high-resolution CT, or&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Evidence of air trapping by PFTs: residual volume &gt;120% predicted or&#xD;
                       residual volume/total lung capacity elevated outside the 90% confidence&#xD;
                       interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If a patient carries the diagnosis of cGVHD by virtue of organ involvement elsewhere, then&#xD;
        only the first 3 criteria above are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the Phase 1b study, patients may have had the diagnosis of BOS for any period of&#xD;
             time. For the Phase 2 study, patients must be within 2 years from the time of&#xD;
             diagnosis. Patients may be at any time interval after SCT as long as the criteria for&#xD;
             chronic GVHD and BOS are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If patients are taking systemic therapy for cGVHD at the time of enrollment, they must&#xD;
             be receiving stable or tapering doses within the previous 4 weeks. Patients are not&#xD;
             required to have completed a course of steroids prior to enrollment.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  platelets greater than or equal to 50,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin less than or equal to 3 X institutional upper limit of normal,&#xD;
                  unless there is a known history of Gilbert s disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min will be calculated using&#xD;
                  eGFR per DLM standards&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be required to have received prior treatment with azithromycin for at&#xD;
             least 3 months prior to enrollment, unless there is evidence of progression or&#xD;
             unsatisfactory response while on azithromycin prior to 3 months of treatment, as&#xD;
             deemed by the treating or referring physician. Patients who are on azithromycin will&#xD;
             need to discontinue for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to adhere to methods of contraception and other fertility control measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The effects of alvelestat (MPH966)on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
        reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
        (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the&#xD;
        duration of study therapy. Contraception should be used up until 1 week of discontinuing&#xD;
        study medication. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is&#xD;
        participating in this study, or if a man s partner becomes pregnant or suspects she is&#xD;
        pregnant while he is participating in this study, she or he should inform their treating&#xD;
        physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
        document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FEV1 &lt;30% (based on absolute percent predicted using USA-ITS-NIH equation) on&#xD;
             pulmonary function testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically relevant abnormal ECG findings, including abnormal QTc&gt;500 ms&#xD;
             on screening ECG (Note: If a patient has a QTc interval &gt;500 ms on screening ECG, the&#xD;
             screening ECG may be repeated twice [at least 24 hours apart] for a total of 3 ECGs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recurrent or progressive malignancy requiring anticancer treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, acute kidney injury, or psychiatric illness/social situations within the&#xD;
             previous 4 weeks that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the teratogenic effects of&#xD;
             alvelestat (MPH966) are unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for&#xD;
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with alvelestat&#xD;
             (MPH966), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with this&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or use of drugs associated&#xD;
             with NAFLD for more than 2 weeks in the year prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of significant alcohol consumption for a period of more than 3&#xD;
             consecutive months within 1 year prior to screening. NOTE: Patients must also be&#xD;
