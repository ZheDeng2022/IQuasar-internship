    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators will prospectively evaluate the outcome of renal transplantation&#xD;
      into a defunctionalized bladder by comparing direct transplantation into this&#xD;
      defunctionalized bladder and pre-transplant programmed bladder cycling.&#xD;

      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients maintained on hemodialysis for more than 12 months, have&#xD;
      oliguria or anuria, reduced bladder capacity, have no history of lower urinary tract&#xD;
      dysfunction and have no evidence of urological cause of renal failure. Patients with history&#xD;
      of lower urinary tract symptoms before developing renal failure and those with lower urinary&#xD;
      tract disease resulting in renal failure will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a randomized controlled trial comparing the outcome of programmed bladder cycling&#xD;
      before the time of renal transplantation and direct transplantation without bladder cycling&#xD;
      in patients with defunctionalized bladder. Patients, who meet the inclusion criteria, will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated into two groups. The first group will undergo renal transplantation on the&#xD;
      defunctionalized bladder without bladder recycling. The second group will undergo renal&#xD;
      transplantation after bladder recycling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be diagnosed by proper history taking, cystoscopy, ascending cystogram and&#xD;
      cystometry in order to confirm the diagnosis of reduced bladder capacity and exclude any&#xD;
      organic or neurological cause. Bladder recycling will be done by the patient after proper&#xD;
      education. It will be started by the instillation of the sterile water in the bladder in&#xD;
      amount equal to the estimated bladder capacity. Then the amount will be gradually increased&#xD;
      till the patient can withstand filling the bladder with 300 cc of sterile water for 2 hours.&#xD;
      Any associated complications will be reported and the time needed to reach the due bladder&#xD;
      capacity will be recorded. The procedure of renal transplantation will be carried out&#xD;
      according to the hospital protocol and the ureteroneocystostomy will be done by a non-stented&#xD;
      Leich Gregoir technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming that the bladder will regain its activity and full capacity after 8 weeks of&#xD;
      transplantation, all patients will be assessed 3 months after transplantation by the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. IPSS questionnaire in order to evaluate the lower urinary tract symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ascending cystogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cystometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Graft function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is to evaluate whether bladder recycling is efficient to restore bladder&#xD;
      function prior to renal transplantation in terms of IPSS score, and urodynamic evaluation.&#xD;
      The secondary outcome is to evaluate the differences in graft and patients outcome between&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation and Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that at 3 months postoperatively; recipients without bladder training will be&#xD;
      non-inferior to those underwent bladder training in terms of cystometric capacity. Based on&#xD;
      this, to achieve a difference in mean cystometric capacity of 50 cc in favor of bladder&#xD;
      training patients, 16 patients in each group are required to achieve a power of 80% and an α&#xD;
      error of 0.05. Statistical power is determined using medcalc version 12.5.0.0 software and&#xD;
      all statistical analyses will be performed using IBM version 20 statistical software.&#xD;
