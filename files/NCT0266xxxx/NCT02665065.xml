    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of Iomab-B, in conjunction&#xD;
      with a Reduced Intensity Conditioning (RIC) regimen and protocol-specified allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT), versus Conventional Care in patients with Active,&#xD;
      Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      SIERRA is a pivotal Phase 3 randomized controlled study of Iomab-B in Relapsed or Refractory&#xD;
      AML patients. The SIERRA trial has a primary endpoint of durable Complete Remission (dCR) at&#xD;
      six months and a secondary endpoint of overall survival following randomization to Iomab-B,&#xD;
      as well as Event-Free Survival. Iomab-B is intended to prepare and condition patients for a&#xD;
      bone marrow transplant, also referred to as a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, in a&#xD;
      potentially safer and more efficacious manner than intensive chemotherapy conditioning that&#xD;
      is the current standard of care in bone marrow transplant conditioning.&#xD;

             combination chemotherapy, or (4) second or subsequent relapse&#xD;
