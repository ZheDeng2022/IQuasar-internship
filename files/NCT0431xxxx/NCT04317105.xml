  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of copanlisib when given&#xD;
      together with nivolumab and ipilimumab and to see how well they work in treating patients&#xD;
      with solid cancers that have spread to other places in the body (advanced) and have changes&#xD;
      in PIK3CA and PTEN genes. Copanlisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. The addition of copanlisib to&#xD;
      usual immunotherapy may work better in treating patients with solid cancers compared to usual&#xD;
      immunotherapy alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate safety and confirm the combination recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the&#xD;
      combination of copanlisib, nivolumab (and ipilimumab) in patients with molecularly-selected&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record antitumor activity. II. To assess clinical benefit of copanlisib in&#xD;
      combination with nivolumab (and ipilimumab) in patients with molecularly-selected advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors, as measured by objective response (OR) = complete response (CR) + partial&#xD;
      response (PR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess overall duration of response (DoR), progression free survival (PFS), and&#xD;
      overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess immune-modulatory changes associated with copanlisib-induced PI3K inhibition&#xD;
      and combination of copanlisib and nivolumab (and ipilimumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To correlate molecular alterations in the PI3K-AKT pathway and treatment induced&#xD;
      immune-modulatory changes with objective response (OR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To perform molecular profiling assays on malignant and normal tissues, including, but not&#xD;
      limited to, whole exome sequencing (WES), ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing, reverse phase&#xD;
      protein array (RPPA), circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis, and immune&#xD;
      profiling in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Identify potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers beyond any genomic alteration by&#xD;
      which treatment may be assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. Identify resistance mechanisms using genomic DNA- and RNA-based assessment platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To contribute genetic analysis data from de-identified biospecimens to Genomic Data&#xD;
      Commons (GDC), a well annotated cancer molecular and clinical data repository, for current&#xD;
      and future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To bank formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, blood (for cell-free DNA&#xD;
      analysis), and nucleic acids obtained from patients at the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical&#xD;
      Trials Network (ETCTN) Biorepository at Nationwide Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of copanlisib followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
      Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL I: Patients receive copanlisib hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1,&#xD;
      8, and 15 of cycle 1. Beginning in cycle 2, patients also receive nivolumab IV over 60&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL II: Patients receive copanlisib hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 of&#xD;
      cycle 1. Beginning in cycle 2, patients also receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1&#xD;
      and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes every 8 weeks for 4 doses. Cycles repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3-6&#xD;
      months for up to 2 years.&#xD;

             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to&#xD;
             baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using&#xD;
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include&#xD;
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with HbA1c &gt; 8.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: For patients with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus that cannot meet&#xD;
                  protocol requirements, a single re-screening (which includes all screening&#xD;
                  procedures) should be performed when the patient's diabetes is controlled and can&#xD;
                  meet protocol eligibility requirement for HbA1c&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any clinically significant drug allergy or hypersensitivity to compounds of&#xD;
             similar chemical or biologic composition to copanlisib, PI3K inhibitors, nivolumab,&#xD;
             and ipilimumab (such as anaphylaxis or hepatotoxicity)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known history of psoriasis even if not active at the time given may pose&#xD;
             additional risks of immune activation with the combination regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with live vaccines and live, attenuated vaccines (prohibited for 30 days&#xD;
             prior to study agents, during the study, and for 100 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             drug). Patients with inactivated vaccines are permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Copanlisib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, the concomitant use of&#xD;
             strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin,&#xD;
             ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir) and strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g.&#xD;
             rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort) is not permitted&#xD;
             from 14 days prior to enrollment until the end of the study. Other medications that&#xD;
             are prohibited while on copanlisib treatment include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Herbal medications/preparations (except vitamins)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Anti-arrhythmic therapy other than beta blockers or digoxin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with&#xD;
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or&#xD;
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents&#xD;
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Patients are permitted to&#xD;
             use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids&#xD;
             (with minimal systemic absorption). A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis&#xD;
             (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g.,&#xD;
             delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted. The&#xD;
             use of corticosteroids as antiemetics prior to copanlisib administration will not be&#xD;
             allowed&#xD;
