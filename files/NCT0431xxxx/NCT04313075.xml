      This is a single arm, compassionate use study with 30 patients for leronlimab (PRO 140)&#xD;
      combined with a treatment of physician's choice (TPC) in patients with CCR5+ mTNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leronlimab (PRO 140) will be administered subcutaneously as weekly dose of 350 mg until&#xD;
      disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Treatment of Physician's Choice (TPC) is defined&#xD;
      as one of the following single-agent chemotherapy drugs administrated according to local&#xD;
      practice: eribulin, gemcitabine, capecitabine, paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, vinorelbine,&#xD;
      ixabepilone, or carboplatin. The selected treatment should be administered as per the dosing&#xD;
      schedule included on the package insert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients will be evaluated for tumor response approximately every 3 months or&#xD;
      according to institution's standard practice by CT, PET/CT or MRI with contrast (per treating&#xD;
      investigator's discretion) using the same method as at baseline. Tumor measurements will be&#xD;
      done using RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
