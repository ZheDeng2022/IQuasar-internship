  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will find the maximum tolerated dose or the maximum planned dose of CYNK-001 which&#xD;
      contains natural killer (NK) cells derived from human placental CD34+ cells and&#xD;
      culture-expanded. CYNK-001 cells will be given after lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The safety&#xD;
      of this treatment will be evaluated, and researchers want to learn if NK cells will help in&#xD;
      treating acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;
