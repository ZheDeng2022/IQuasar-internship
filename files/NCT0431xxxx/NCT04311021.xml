      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycaemia is the most frequent complication of insulin treatment in individuals with type&#xD;
      1 diabetes and a limiting factor for achieving optimal glycaemic control. When recurrent,&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia can induce a process of habituation, leading to impaired awareness of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia (IAH), a process that can be reversed by meticulous avoidance of hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
      In the past 5-10 years, the use of continuous real-time (RT-CGM) or flash glucose monitoring&#xD;
      (FGM) has increased rapidly in the clinical management of type 1 diabetes to improve overall&#xD;
      glycaemic control and reduce the frequency of hypoglycaemic events, in particular in patients&#xD;
      with IAH. It is unknown, however, whether the use of these devices, as well as other&#xD;
      improvements in clinical management, has reduced the prevalence IAH and exposure to severe&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia (SH) in subjects with type 1 diabetes in a real-world setting. Therefore, it&#xD;
      becomes highly appropriate to investigate the current state of IAH and SH in type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
      Also, since invites to this study will specifically include people who have taken part of&#xD;
      previous assessments, this study will be able to investigate the change in IAH over time and&#xD;
      the potential contributing role of RT-CGM/FGM. Furthermore, we want to explore associations&#xD;
      of IAH and SH with clinical parameters, quality of life and psychosocial impact. This&#xD;
      knowledge will help people with diabetes and their healthcare providers to better adjust&#xD;
      treatment recommendations to individual targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of our study is to investigate the current prevalence of IAH and&#xD;
      exposure to severe hypoglycaemia in individuals with diabetes type 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of our study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the difference in IAH prevalence over time in individuals with diabetes type 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the association of RT-CGM/FGM with IAH and SH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study thoughts, emotions and worries which lead to a certain behaviour in case of&#xD;
           hypoglycaemia and prevention of hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study associations of IAH and history of SH with productivity in different situations&#xD;
           (work/study, relation/sexuality, driving behaviour/traffic and sport/leisure).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study association between partner involvement and handling in case of (unawareness for)&#xD;
           hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study knowledge of subjects with diabetes about hypoglycaemia and IAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study burden of IAH and severe hypoglycaemia on family members of people with type 1&#xD;
           diabetes, as experienced by patients themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a cross-sectional observational cohort study. The study will be conducted&#xD;
      at the Radboud university medical center, department of internal medicine. Subjects with type&#xD;
      1 diabetes will be recruited from outpatient diabetes clinic as well as subjects who&#xD;
      participated in two earlier cohorts and agreed to be approached again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be individuals with diabetes type 1, older than sixteen years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints The main study parameter will be the current prevalence of&#xD;
      IAH and exposure to severe hypoglycaemia in the past 12 months.&#xD;
