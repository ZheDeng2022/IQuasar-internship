      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memory consolidation is the process by which memories become stable, long-term&#xD;
      representations in the brain. Consolidation of a motor skill is dependent upon sleep. Some&#xD;
      research shows that daytime naps improve people s motor performance and memory retention.&#xD;
      Researchers want to find out how daytime naps may contribute to learning and support&#xD;
      consolidation of motor skill memories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn the role of memory replay during wakeful rest and sleep (naps) in retaining a newly&#xD;
      learned skill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      English-speaking adults ages 18 and older with chronic stroke, or healthy, right-handed,&#xD;
      English-speaking adults ages 18-35 and 50-80&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  neurological history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medicine review&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  neurological exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain. For this, they&#xD;
      will lie down in a scanner. The scanner makes loud noises, so they will wear earplugs. They&#xD;
      will fill out an MRI screening form before each MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also have magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG maps brain activity. It does&#xD;
      this by recording the magnetic fields produced by naturally occurring electrical currents in&#xD;
      the brain. For MEG, participants will lie down in the MEG room. Their eye movements may be&#xD;
      recorded by a video camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have behavior testing. They will practice typing random keys. Then they&#xD;
      will repeatedly type a custom sequence that they see on a computer screen. Then they will&#xD;
      take a 2-hour nap. Then they will type the same sequence again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have no more than 4 visits at the NIH over 3 months. Visits will last 2-4&#xD;
      hours each.&#xD;

      Study Description: We will investigate sleep neural replay to motor skill consolidation in&#xD;
      three groups: (a) young healthy subjects, (b) older healthy subjects and (c) patients with&#xD;
      chronic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary aim is to determine the relative contribution of neural replay during&#xD;
      wakeful rest and sleep to consolidation of a newly learned skill in young and older healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, and in chronic stroke patients with magnetoencephalography (MEG). The secondary&#xD;
      aim is to evaluate differences in replay rates between these subject cohorts. We will also&#xD;
      explore differences in replay rates, spatiotemporal dynamics of neural replay and sleep&#xD;
      spindles to generate additional hypotheses and preliminary data for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: The primary endpoint measure is motor skill consolidation (i.e., offline change in&#xD;
      correct sequence typing speed following a nap). The secondary endpoint measure is neural&#xD;
      replay rate. Exploratory endpoints measures are spatial (i.e. - parcellated source space) and&#xD;
      time-frequency maps of neural replay during wakeful rest and sleep, and changes in&#xD;
      button-press finger movement kinematics during learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: 46 healthy young (18-35) volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: 46 healthy older (50-80) volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 3: 46 chronic (&gt;6 months post-stroke) stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriotion of Site/Facilities: This protocol utilizes the NIH Clinical Center Outpatient&#xD;
      Clinic, and NMRF and MEG core facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 48 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration: Up to 4 visits lasting approximately 2-4 hours each.&#xD;
