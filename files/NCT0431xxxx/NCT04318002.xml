  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an age de-escalation, dose-escalation open label randomised trial studying the safety&#xD;
      and immunogenicity of RH5.1/Matrix-M, administered intramuscularly in healthy adults, young&#xD;
      children and infants in Tanzania&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 participants will be enrolled consisting of healthy adults (18-45 years) and&#xD;
      infants (5-17 months) residing in Bagamoyo district, Tanzania. Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      from areas of low malaria transmission in Bagamoyo town and areas of high malaria&#xD;
      transmission within Bagamoyo district. All participants will be followed for 2-2.5years after&#xD;
      the first vaccination with RH5.1/Matrix-M vaccination. The duration of the entire study will&#xD;
      be 2-2.5years per participant from the time of first vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is funded by EDCTP, reference: RIA2016V-1649 MMVC&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Likelihood of travel away from the study area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive malaria by blood smear at screening.&#xD;
