  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a peer&#xD;
      recovery coach (PRC) intervention to improve linkage to hepatitis C (HCV) and/or human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care, treatment initiation, and evaluation for HIV pre-exposure&#xD;
      prophylaxis (PrEP) (when applicable) among individuals with a history of opioid use disorder&#xD;
      accessing a substance use low-barrier-to-access (LBA) walk-in clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-depth interviews will be administered to participants at baseline, three- and six-months&#xD;
      for study participants (40 total participants). The investigator will also follow-up with the&#xD;
      per recovery coach and administer surveys to assess the feasibility of a peer recovery&#xD;
      coaching intervention in improving HCV/HIV related linkage to care and management. Patient&#xD;
      medical records and peer recovery coach monthly reports will be accessed and reviewed to&#xD;
      determine fidelity to research protocols.&#xD;
