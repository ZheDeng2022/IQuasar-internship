  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regorafenib and nivolumab are proven effective agents for the management of unresectable&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma patients. As preclinical studies have suggested potential synergism&#xD;
      between antiangiogenic agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors, regorafenib and nivolumab may&#xD;
      have synergism in terms of efficacy. Herein, this study investigates the combination of&#xD;
      regorafenib and nivolumab as first-line therapy in patients with unresectable hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;
