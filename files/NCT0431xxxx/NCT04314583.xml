  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center cohort study of patients in a cardiac rehabilitation program with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including heart failure, coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      post myocardial infarction, post percutaneous coronary intervention and post cardiac surgery.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to the gratitude intervention or an attention control group.&#xD;
      This study is a pilot study to determine the feasibility and acceptability of administering&#xD;
      the gratitude intervention in a cardiac rehabilitation setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nursing-led interventions of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), have&#xD;
      been proved to be successful. Appropriately trained nurses produce high-quality care and good&#xD;
      health outcomes for patients equivalent to that achieved by physicians with higher levels of&#xD;
      patient satisfaction. CVD, including coronary artery disease and heart failure, is a major&#xD;
      and rapidly growing public health problem. Despite advances in its treatment, it remains the&#xD;
      leading cause of death in the U.S. Furthermore, the prevalence of CVD in adults is estimated&#xD;
      to continue to rise and that by 2035, 45.1% of the U.S. population will have some form of CVD&#xD;
      with total costs expected to reach $1.1 trillion with direct medical costs projects to reach&#xD;
      $748.7 billion. Therefore, novel preventive efforts are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Negative psychological states, including depression and pessimism (negative future&#xD;
      expectation), have been linked with poor CVD outcomes. Despite the fact that optimism&#xD;
      (positive future expectation) and other positive affective states have been associated with&#xD;
      superior cardiovascular outcomes, little research has focused on interventions designed to&#xD;
      increase positive psychological states in patients at risk for CVD. In the current trial,&#xD;
      patients in an academic medical center cardiac rehabilitation program will be approached.&#xD;
      Cardiac rehabilitation is an integral component in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease including coronary artery disease, heart failure with reduced ejection&#xD;
      fraction, following heart valve surgery or cardiac transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of its core components is psychological support and management. In this nursing-led&#xD;
      study, participants will be randomized to a gratitude intervention or an attention control&#xD;
      group. The gratitude intervention, which encourages participants to notice and appreciate the&#xD;
      positive features of life, is based on the work of Emmons and McCullough, and involves&#xD;
      participants writing (or if unable to write, speaking) things for which they are grateful.&#xD;
      Much of the existing research on gratitude (noticing and appreciating the positive features&#xD;
      of life) has focused primarily on outcomes associated with psychological factors and social&#xD;
      interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this feasibility study will be to determine if a gratitude intervention is&#xD;
      acceptable and feasible in a cohort of patients attending cardiac rehabilitation.&#xD;

    <description>The Gratitude Questionaire (GQ6) will be used to assess gratitude at baseline and following the intervention. The GQ6 is a 6 item questionnaire with scales ranging from 1-7. Cumulative scores range from 6-42; higher scores indicate increased gratitude.</description>

    <description>The Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R) will be used to assess optimism at baseline and following the intervention. The LOT-R is a 10-item survey, with scales ranging from 1-5. (Not all questions are scored). Cumulative scores range from 6-30; higher scores indicate increased optimism.</description>

    <description>The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) will be used to measure resilience at baseline and after the intervention. The BRS is a 6 item survey, with each item scored from 1-5. Raw total scores range from 6-30; final scores will be calculated as the mean of all scores. Higher scores indicate increased resiliency.</description>
