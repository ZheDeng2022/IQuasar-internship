      This study evaluates the safety, feasibility, and acceptability of a novel medical abortion&#xD;
      via telemedicine service in the Republic of Moldova.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women and girls in Moldova, especially those in rural areas, must travel to regional medical&#xD;
      centers to obtain an abortion from a certified gynecologist. This creates barriers to&#xD;
      accessing safe abortion that disproportionately affect poor women and girls, through wage&#xD;
      loss due to missed work and accrued costs due to transportation. This innovation is a novel&#xD;
      service delivery model that allows self-management of medical abortion (MA) with remote&#xD;
      guidance from a provider. After confirming their pregnancy, women seeking MA will receive&#xD;
      counseling from a gynecologist via videoconference and will subsequently obtain the necessary&#xD;
      medication via mail or at at participating pharmacy with prescription. Follow-up will occur 1&#xD;
      weeks later via phone/videoconference (with referral to a doctor if necessary) to confirm MA&#xD;
      success and assess the patient's and provider's satisfaction with the service. We hope to&#xD;
      demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness and acceptability of telemedicine MA services in&#xD;
      Moldova so that it can thus be integrated into the national public healthcare system. As a&#xD;
      result, this project will serve as a model that could be adapted and implemented in nearby&#xD;
      countries within the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region.&#xD;
