      &gt;2-4 cm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether the addition of adjuvant Pembrolizumab following surgical resection&#xD;

           cm in size, regardless of PD-L1 TPS score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether the addition of adjuvant Pembrolizumab following surgical resection&#xD;
           improves overall survival compared with observation in patients with stage I non-small&#xD;
           cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary tumors between 1-4 cm in size, regardless of PD-L1&#xD;
           TPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the disease-free survival and overall survival rates at 1 year, 2 years, and&#xD;
           3 years on each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the toxicity profile of adjuvant Pembrolizumab following surgical&#xD;
           resection in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary&#xD;
           tumors between 1-4 cm in size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether the addition of adjuvant Pembrolizumab following surgical resection&#xD;
           improves disease free survival compared with observation following surgical resection in&#xD;
           patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary tumors between 1-4&#xD;
           cm in size and a PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) of ≥ 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether the addition of adjuvant Pembrolizumab following surgical resection&#xD;
           improves disease free survival compared with observation following surgical resection in&#xD;
           patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary tumors between 1-4&#xD;
           cm in size and a high tumor mutation burden (TMB) defined as ≥ 10 mutations/MB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether the addition of adjuvant Pembrolizumab following surgical resection&#xD;
           improves disease free survival compared with observation following surgical resection in&#xD;
           patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary tumors between 1-4&#xD;
           cm in size and a high tumor mutation burden (TMB) defined as ≥ 16 mutations/MB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the disease free survival and overall survival for patients stratified by&#xD;
           PD-L1 status (TPS ≥ 50% vs. &lt; 50%), and tumor size (1-2 cm vs. &gt;2-4 cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the association between various known prognostic variables, including, but&#xD;
           not limited to, tumor differentiation (well-differentiated, moderately well&#xD;
           differentiated, poorly differentiated), lymphovascular invasion, sex (male, female), PET&#xD;
           max SUV and disease free survival and overall survival in patients treated with adjuvant&#xD;
           Pembrolizumab for stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary tumors between&#xD;
           1-4 cm in size.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether the presence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or circulating tumor&#xD;
           cells (CTCs) following surgical resection predicts relapse in patients with stage I&#xD;
           non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary tumors between 1-4 cm in size.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether the presence of ctDNA or CTCs following surgical resection in&#xD;
           patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary tumors between 1-4&#xD;
           cm in size can predict which patients benefit from adjuvant Pembrolizumab compared to&#xD;
           observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate potential biomarkers (which may include genomics, RNA, tumor infiltrating&#xD;
           lymphocytes, CD4 and CD8 expression, JAK2, STK11/LB1 loss of function, macrophage&#xD;
           profile, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and microbiome) as prognostic or predictive for&#xD;
           improved disease free survival and overall survival.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) must provide&#xD;
             written informed consent for the study. The participant may also provide consent for&#xD;
             future unspecified research samples. However, the participant may participate in the&#xD;
             study without participating in the future unspecified research sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0-1 within 28 days prior to registration.&#xD;

             between 4-12 weeks prior to registration and have negative surgical margins (R0).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Both squamous and non-squamous histologies are allowed into the study.&#xD;
                  Cancers with a histology of &quot;adenosquamous&quot; are considered a type of&#xD;
                  adenocarcinoma and thus &quot;non-squamous histology&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Staging will be according to the AJCC 8th edition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathological tumor size must be 1.0 - 4.0 cm in greatest dimension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgery for this lung cancer must be completed at least 28 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have either previous NGS and PD-L1 results available using the Dako 22C3 antibody&#xD;
             or have archival tissue of surgical specimen from current diagnosis available to&#xD;
             perform analyses. If prior PD-L1 results with Dako 22C3 antibody are not available&#xD;
             from a CLIA-accredited laboratory, subjects must be able to provide 5µm x 4unstained&#xD;
             slides for prospective analysis to be used for stratification. If NGS results are not&#xD;
             available, subjects must be able to provide at least 10 x 10µm unstained and 1 x 4µm&#xD;
             H&amp;E slides from current diagnosis for future NGS and/or other genetic analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in the protocol; all screening labs to&#xD;
             be obtained within 28 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 72 hours prior to registration. If the urine test is positive or cannot be&#xD;
             confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. For subjects&#xD;
             randomized to the pembrolizumab arm: If there is &gt; 72 hours between the screening test&#xD;
             and C1D1, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed and must be&#xD;
             negative before the subject may start C1D1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Females are considered of childbearing potential unless: they are&#xD;
                  postmenopausal; are surgically sterile; or they have a congenital or acquired&#xD;
                  condition that prevents childbearing. See Section 5.1.4 for definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred&#xD;
                  contraception for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not&#xD;

                  usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) during the&#xD;
                  intervention period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
                  The investigator should evaluate the potential for contraceptive method failure&#xD;
                  (i.e., noncompliance, recently initiated) in relationship to the first dose of&#xD;
                  study drug. See contraceptive guidance in Section 5.1.4 of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
