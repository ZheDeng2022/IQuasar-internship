  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary abnormalities are present in up to 60% of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      (RA), and up to 10% of the patients will develop clinical interstitial lung disease (ILD).&#xD;
      Recent data indicate that inhibition of Janus kinase is beneficial for this extra-articular&#xD;
      manifestation. Our goal is to determine whether tofacitinib is an effective and safe&#xD;
      treatment, compared to standard-of-care methotrexate, for subclinical and clinical ILD in&#xD;
      patients with early RA. The study also explores disease mechanisms in lungs and joints, to&#xD;
      identify potential biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatment of RA-ILD.&#xD;

      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: Effects of tofacitinib compared to that of methotrexate on interstitial&#xD;
      pulmonary abnormalities at 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: Effects of tofacitinib compared to that of methotrexate on pulmonary&#xD;
      abnormalities and function, RA disease activity and remission rates and patient reported&#xD;
      outcome measures at different time points. Frequency of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives: Effects of tofacitinib compared to that of methotrexate on cellular&#xD;
      and molecular activity profiles of clinical samples from joints and lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, actively controlled, open-label, assessor-blinded, multicenter 48 weeks phase&#xD;
      IV trial. The study design includes an optional sub-study collecting tissue samples using&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided synovial biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage and Particles in Exhaled Air&#xD;
      (PExA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with early untreated RA with active and seropositive disease will be eligible for&#xD;
      screening and the performance of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Subjects with&#xD;
      pulmonary abnormalities suggestive of RA-ILD will be randomized (1:1) to tofacitinib 5 mg BID&#xD;
      (group 1) or standard-of-care methotrexate 20 mg weekly (group 2) for 48 weeks. All patients&#xD;
      receive prednisone with tapering for 6 weeks. Patients with incomplete response at 24 weeks&#xD;
      will escalate to combination therapy with tofacitinib+methotrexate (group 3). Intra-articular&#xD;
      injections of cortisone will be allowed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      145 subjects will be included and screened (part 1), and approximately 48 subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to active treatment (part 2).&#xD;
