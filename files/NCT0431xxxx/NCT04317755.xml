  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body image is one of the leading concerns for young. Such concerns can have serious health&#xD;
      consequences, including unhealthy weight control and exercise behaviours, depression and&#xD;
      self-harm, low self-esteem, substance abuse. Emerging approaches for improving body image are&#xD;
      effective among adolescent girls and boys in the school setting. However, the vast majority&#xD;
      of trials in this area are conducted in high-income westernised countries, despite body image&#xD;
      concerns increasingly being recognised as a global concern. As such, it is important to&#xD;
      develop and disseminate interventions to promote positive body image among adolescents in in&#xD;
      low-to-middle income countries, too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One country where body image concerns are becoming an increasing issue is India. The&#xD;
      investigators recently finished developing and evaluating a body image programme, Dove&#xD;
      Confident Me, among adolescents in New Delhi, India. The investigators found immediate and&#xD;
      3-month follow-up improvements in body image, disordered eating, self-esteem, and other&#xD;
      related outcomes. Whilst these findings offer an effective body image programme for school&#xD;
      students in urban areas of India, this may not be feasible for schools in more rural areas in&#xD;
      India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is therefore to conduct an acceptability study, followed by a&#xD;
      pilot randomised controlled trial, of a comics-based body image programme among adolescents&#xD;
      in a rural area of India (Rajasthan), in order to understand its acceptability, feasibility,&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy. This comics-based programme will be based on Dove Confident Me,&#xD;
      which was found to be effective among adolescents in Delhi, India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the acceptability of the comic-book-based programme, interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      with students in one school to explore their thoughts on the comic books e.g., What do they&#xD;
      like? Could they identify with the characters? What were the key messages? Focus groups will&#xD;
      also be conducted with teachers to understand their thoughts on the comic-book-based&#xD;
      programme, e.g., Do they think the content is appropriate for their students? How could the&#xD;
      key messages be improved? Is the Teacher Guide easy to understand? Investigators will gather&#xD;
      in-depth feedback from students and teachers, and this will be used to optimise the programme&#xD;
      prior to a randomised controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, to assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the comic-book-based programme,&#xD;
      an RCT will allow comparisons of the body image and well-being of students who take part in&#xD;
      the programme to students who do not take part in any programme (classes as usual). To&#xD;
      undertake the RCT, the investigators will recruit students and teachers from six schools in a&#xD;
      rural area of India (Rajasthan). Students will complete questionnaire assessments of body&#xD;
      image and well-being before and after the 5-week programme period, and again 10-12 weeks&#xD;
      later to assess longer-term benefits.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body image is a significant and prevalent concern for adolescents in high-income countries&#xD;
      such as the UK, the USA, and Australia. For example, a study of 1,600 girls in the UK found&#xD;
      that four in ten 11-16 year old girls are unhappy with the way they look. Similarly, a&#xD;
      nationally representative survey of nearly 22,000 young people in Australia found that 3 in&#xD;
      10 adolescent boys and girls are very concerned about their body image, and body image was&#xD;
      voted among the top three life concerns. The high prevalence of body image concerns among&#xD;
      adolescent boys and girls is worrisome, given their serious negative physical and&#xD;
      psychological health consequences. For example, body dissatisfaction is associated with&#xD;
      engagement in unhealthy weight loss behaviours and the onset of eating disorders, depression&#xD;
      and self-harm, substance use, and lower levels of academic engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing recognition that body image is a global issue, as opposed to one&#xD;
      relegated to privileged adolescents in high-income Westernised countries. For example, in&#xD;
      India, 57% of adolescents aged 15-19 years report being concerned with their appearance.&#xD;
      Further, adolescent girls across different regions of India have expressed concerns in&#xD;
      relation to their weight and report dieting behaviours. Skin colour has also been indicated&#xD;
      as an additional source of appearance concern among young people in India. A large-scale&#xD;
      study among Asian, African, and South American countries, found that 19% of Indian&#xD;
      undergraduate students had used a skin lightening product in the previous 12 months, strongly&#xD;
      suggesting dissatisfaction with their natural skin tone, which may be pertinent to younger&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collectively, these findings indicate the importance of developing and disseminating&#xD;
      interventions to promote positive body image among adolescents in India. The investigators&#xD;
      recently finished developing and evaluating a school-based body image programme, Dove&#xD;
      Confident Me, among adolescents in New Delhi, India. Immediate and 3-month follow-up&#xD;
      improvements were found in body image, disordered eating, self-esteem, and other related&#xD;
      outcomes. Whilst these findings offer an effective body image programme for school students&#xD;
      in urban areas of India, this may not be feasible for schools in more rural areas in India;&#xD;
      where they do not have electricity or computers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is therefore to conduct an acceptability study followed by a&#xD;
      pilot randomised controlled trial of a comics-based body image programme among adolescents in&#xD;
      a rural area of India (Rajasthan), in order to understand its acceptability, feasibility, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy. This comic-book-based programme will be based on Dove Confident Me,&#xD;
      which was found to be effective among adolescents in Delhi, India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, an acceptability study will be conducted to explore the target group's opinions of the&#xD;
      comic books. Interviews will be conducted with 24 students across years 6-8 in one government&#xD;
      school. They will be asked questions such as: What do they like about the comic books? Could&#xD;
      they identify with the characters in the stories? What did they think were the key messages?&#xD;
      Focus groups will also be conducted with 9 teachers who teach across years 6-8 of the school&#xD;
      to understand their thoughts on the comic-book-based programme. They will be asked questions&#xD;
      such as: Do they think the content is appropriate for their students? How could the key&#xD;
      messages be improved? Is the Teacher Guide easy to understand? Investigators will gather&#xD;
      in-depth feedback from students and teachers, and this will be used to optimise the programme&#xD;
      prior to conducting a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, a cluster RCT will be conducted, whereby at least 8 schools (aiming for 2,400 students&#xD;
      across both conditions) will be randomly allocated to receive the comic-book-based body image&#xD;
      intervention or classes-as-usual (control). Students will be assessed on body image and&#xD;
      related outcomes at baseline, post-intervention and 10-12 weeks follow-up, under standardised&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants &amp; recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the acceptability study, one co-educational government school in Rajasthan will be&#xD;
      invited to take part. 24 students across years 6-8 (50% male) will be randomly selected by&#xD;
      the headmaster to participate in the interviews, if the students so wish to. Focus groups&#xD;
      will also be conducted with 9 teachers who teach across years 6-8 of the school. The head&#xD;
      master will also select these teachers, and aim to ensure variability in terms of age,&#xD;
      gender, and length of time teaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the RCT, at least eight co-educational government schools in Rajasthan will be&#xD;
      invited to take part. All students in classes 6-8 (equivalent of UK years 7-9; students aged&#xD;
      11-14) in each school will be invited to take part. The total number of schools will depend&#xD;
      on the number of students across the year groups. However, the aim will be to recruit 1,200&#xD;
      students for each condition, with 50% males. This will allow us to detect a small effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both studies (acceptability and RCT), after expressing their initial interest, each&#xD;
      school will receive detailed information regarding the aims, objective and requirements of&#xD;
      the study to help them decide if they would like to take part in this research project.&#xD;
      Depending on the school, either the head teacher will provide active informed consent, or&#xD;
      parents will consent. Students will also be required to provide their consent before taking&#xD;
      part. All students will have the opportunity to opt out of the study, or withdraw from the&#xD;
      study at any time, irrespective of head teacher consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AdhaFULL AdhaFULL is a comic-book series co-created by BBC Media Action and UNICEF, which&#xD;
      follows the journey of 3 adolescents as they solve cases related to important issues (e.g.,&#xD;
      under-age marriage, nutrition, gender-stereotypes, peer pressure etc). The comics aim to&#xD;
      raise awareness and encourage adolescents to take action against these issues. There are 6&#xD;
      different comics based on AdhaFULL, which target issues relating to gender stereotypes and&#xD;
      appearance concerns amongst adolescents in rural India. Specifically, they focus on gender&#xD;
      prejudice (Comic 1), societal appearance ideals (Comic 2), media literacy (Comic 3),&#xD;
      appearance comparisons (Comic 4), appearance-related conversations and teasing (Comic 5), and&#xD;
      promoting 'body activism' (Comic 6). At the end of each comic, the teacher will facilitate&#xD;
      one or two activities with the students based on the comic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators from the Centre for Appearance Research (CAR) based at the University of the&#xD;
      West of England will be leading the study remotely from Bristol, UK. CAR researchers will be&#xD;
      responsible for designing the study, analysing the data, and writing up the manuscript. They&#xD;
      will also be working with the Dove Self-Esteem Project, UNICEF, and BBC Media Action to&#xD;
      design the comics. The investigators will work with an Indian research agency, who will be&#xD;
      'on the ground' collecting the data (as travel from the UK is currently forbidden due to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acceptability Study As described above, both students and teacher will participate in&#xD;
           interviews and focus group to provide their thoughts and opinions on the comic books (in&#xD;
           addition to the Teacher Guide among teachers). Permission to audio record the focus&#xD;
           groups and interviews will be sought from participants prior to commencing the&#xD;
           discussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RCT Independent randomisation by a blinded researcher external to the project will be&#xD;
           used to assign schools to each condition. This will be done using freely available&#xD;
           computer software. The teachers of years 6-8 will be trained by two researchers from CAR&#xD;
           and/or collaborators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire comprising the self-report measures described below will be used to assess&#xD;
      the impact of the intervention on students' body image and associated risk factors. After&#xD;
      obtaining consent from the school head teachers, and the students, these measures will be&#xD;
      administered in the classroom to the 11-14-year-old students at pre-intervention (1-2 weeks&#xD;
      before intervention delivery), immediately after intervention delivery (within 1 week of the&#xD;
      final session), and again at 10-12 weeks follow-up. The questionnaire will take students no&#xD;
      more than 20-25 minutes to complete. Students will complete questionnaires under standardised&#xD;
      conditions supervised by their teachers and trained research staff. Blinding of students,&#xD;
      teachers, and researchers is not possible due to the nature of the intervention. However,&#xD;
      risk of bias from teachers and researchers is minimised due to anonymous self-report&#xD;
      assessments. Risk of contagion is also minimised by randomising at the school level. This&#xD;
      project has ethical approval from the University of the West of England's Faculty Research&#xD;
      Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the fidelity of the intervention manuals, all sessions will be&#xD;
      audio-recorded as well as observed by a researcher and rated based on adherence to lesson&#xD;
      plans. The teachers will be asked to complete a brief form after each lesson stating which&#xD;
      activities were completed.&#xD;
