    <textblock>
      This is a proof of concept study to determine whether an extended release vaginal film can&#xD;
      deliver drug for seven days. Two film formulations containing MK-2048 which differ by&#xD;
      dissolution and spreadability attributes will be compared for safety and pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I randomized trial assessing the safety, acceptability, and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of two formulations of MK-2048 vaginal film. While the primary objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety of the product, the overarching objective of this study is to provide proof of concept&#xD;
      that an antiretroviral drug can be delivered in an extended release film formulation to&#xD;
      provide drug delivery for 7 days or more after a single application. Forty eight women will&#xD;
      be randomized with equal frequency to receive a single dose of a vaginal film containing&#xD;
      MK-2048 (either the high Eudragit® or low Eudragit® formulation). The film will be inserted&#xD;
      by a clinician on the day of enrollment. Vaginal swabs and plasma will be collected at days&#xD;
      0, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 and 28 for all participants. On the day of enrollment, some participants&#xD;
      may elect to participate in immediate post insertion sample collection (vaginal swab and&#xD;
      plasma) at one or two time points within 6 hours of insertion. Genital biopsy samples and a&#xD;
      rectal swab will be obtained on day 7, and cervicovaginal lavage will be collected at&#xD;
      screening and days 14 and 28. The primary endpoint is the frequency of Grade 2 or higher&#xD;
      adverse events. The secondary endpoints are: MK-2048 concentrations in plasma, cervical&#xD;
      tissue homogenate, cervicovaginal lavage fluid, rectal and vaginal swab eluents;&#xD;
      self-reported assessment of qualities of the experience with the films drawn from existing&#xD;
      survey on microbicidal films, and general acceptability ratings drawn from market research&#xD;
      methodology.&#xD;
