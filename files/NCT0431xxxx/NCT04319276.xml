  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 investigational study to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of oral&#xD;
      gallium maltolate (GaM) in participants with relapsed glioblastoma (GBM).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, open-label phase 1 study to determine the&#xD;
      antineoplastic activity, safety and tolerance of GaM in participants with relapsed,&#xD;
      treatment-refractory GBM. Although GaM has been studied in previous phase 1 clinical trials&#xD;
      in normal individuals and in participants with a variety of different solid tumors, it has&#xD;
      never been evaluated in this population of participants. Dosages in this study have been&#xD;
      defined to have limited side effects in other phase 1 trials. The maximum number of&#xD;
      participants to enroll in the dose escalation part will not exceed 24. The trial will follow&#xD;
      a 3 + 3 phase I dose escalation design.&#xD;

    <description>This is a 3 + 3 design. Participants will be entered sequentially. If 0 of 3 participants has a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), new participants may be entered at the next higher dose level. If 1 of 3 participants has a DLT, up to 3 more participants are to be treated at that same dose level. If 0 of the additional 3 participants at that dose level has a DLT, new participants may be entered at the next higher dose level. If 1 or more of the additional 3 participants experience a DLT, 0 participants are to be started at that dose level and the preceding dose is the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). If 2 of 3 of the dosed participants has a DLT on the first dose level, the drug will be administered at a lower dose. If 0 of 3 participants has a DLT at the highest dose level, an additional 3 participants will be enrolled to ensure that 6 participants are treated at the MTD. The MTD is the highest dose level at which no more than 1 of 6 treated participants, experiences a DLT.</description>

                  the above two criteria), agree to practice two acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception (combination methods require use of two of the following: diaphragm&#xD;
                  with spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, contraceptive sponge, male or&#xD;
                  female condom, hormonal contraceptive) from the time of signing of the informed&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and&#xD;
                  usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Patients taking oral iron supplements or iron chelators must discontinue these&#xD;
             medications at least one week prior to starting GaM since these agents may impact on&#xD;

             malignancy receiving treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 14 days of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known hypersensitivity to or intolerance to gallium-based medications.&#xD;

             mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participants who have not completed all standard-of-care treatments including surgical&#xD;
             procedures and radiation therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Participants who are pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
