  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 8 mg endoxifen in the study&#xD;
      population. As endoxifen represents a totally new class of drugs in the treatment of the&#xD;
      bipolar disorder, it is essential to compare the drug against placebo to rule out the&#xD;
      psychological influence upon study results. More so given the risks to patients and their&#xD;
      communities from a medication whose efficacy has not been thoroughly evaluated against a&#xD;
      placebo control. Thus, Endoxifen will be compared to placebo to demonstrate that the test&#xD;
      product is active and to establish that the study is sufficiently sensitive to detect&#xD;
      differences between the investigational products.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protein Kinase C (PKC) plays a major role in the regulation of both pre and postsynaptic&#xD;
      neurotransmission. Excessive activation of PKC results in symptoms related to bipolar&#xD;
      disorder. PKC exists as a family of closely related subspecies, has a heterogeneous&#xD;
      distribution in the brain (with particularly high levels in presynaptic nerve terminals), and&#xD;
      plays a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal excitability, neurotransmitter release,&#xD;
      regulation of synaptic plasticity and various forms of learning and memory. Research findings&#xD;
      show that the PKC pathway can be used as a target for developing treatment strategies for&#xD;
      bipolar disorder. Endoxifen exhibited activity in inhibiting the PKC activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with acute bipolar mania, rapid reduction of symptoms is a key treatment goal;&#xD;
      however, there is also a need for effective maintenance of effect treatment beyond the period&#xD;
      of acute stabilization. The current study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Endoxifen&#xD;
      in Bipolar I Disorder patients against a control placebo arm.&#xD;
