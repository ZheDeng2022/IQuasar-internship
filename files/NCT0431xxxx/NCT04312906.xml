  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to address the paucity of accurate incidence data of diarrheal diseases&#xD;
      associated with Shigella in Zambia and Burkina Faso. Given the limited feasibility of the&#xD;
      current complex diagnostic methods used to detect Shigella in endemic and developing&#xD;
      countries due to the costs, the none availability of reagents and a requirement of expensive&#xD;
      and complex machinery, we suggest to use a rapide, easy-to-use, cost-effective, and robust&#xD;
      Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based rapid tool, the Loop-mediated isothermal amplification&#xD;
      (LAMP) based diagnostic assay (ES-RLDT). This baseline study will enable us to generate an&#xD;
      accurate estimate of Shigella incidence so as to inform future trials' designs of an oral&#xD;
      vaccine development (ShigOraVax) in Burkina Faso and Zambia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is part of the EDCTP2 programme supported by the European Union under grant&#xD;
      agreement &quot;No RIA2018V-2308&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an observational, cohort study to determine the incidence of Shigella in children&#xD;
      under 5 years in Zambia and Burkina Faso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will first identify the population at risk i.e children that will form the cohort of&#xD;
      children to be followed up in the study. In Zambia, this will be done through a household&#xD;
      census that will be conducted to identify children under 5 years in the catchment areas&#xD;
      served by the selected health facility. In Burkina Faso, the study will be conducted in the&#xD;
      Ouagadougou Health and Demographic Surveillance System (OHDSS) catchment area. Children under&#xD;
      five years old will be randomly selected from the OHDSS database. The heads of households or&#xD;
      guardians of the randomly selected children will be approached for the informed consenting&#xD;
      process to enrol into the cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will then follow up these children using active and passive surveillance systems follow&#xD;
      for the duration of the study. During passive follow-up, a surveillance system will be set up&#xD;
      at the selected health facilities serving the catchment populations. Parents/guardians of&#xD;
      enrolled children will be asked to take their child to designated health facilities once they&#xD;
      develop an episode of diarrhoea. At presentation, a clinical evaluation will be performed on&#xD;
      the child and the data recorded. A stool sample/rectal swab will then be collected. Once a&#xD;
      stool sample is tested positive for Shigella, the participant will be actively followed up&#xD;
      and monitored on days 3, 5, 7 and 9 to inquire about the disease outcome and to collect blood&#xD;
      and stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active follow-ups will include a combined home and clinic visits. The parents or guardians of&#xD;
      participants enrolled in the study will be contacted through phone calls and/or home visits&#xD;
      by trained study staff every month to collect information on the child health status. They&#xD;
      will enquire on whether the child had an episode of diarrhoea and fever in the preceding four&#xD;
      weeks, the use of healthcare services for the diarrhoea episode and any treatment received&#xD;
      for the diarrhoea and fever. If an episode of diarrhoea is detected during any of the active&#xD;
      visits, the parents/guardians will be encouraged to take the child to the clinic for&#xD;
      appropriate management. The child will then go through the passive surveillance procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSD cases will be defined as a three or more loose stools or at least one bloody/mucoid stool&#xD;
      within a 24 hour period (WHO, 2005). A diarrhoea episode will be defined as new if the&#xD;
      diarrhea definition is met after seven days free of diarrhoea or dysentery. A Shigella case&#xD;
      will be defined as any loose stool with LAMP confirmed Shigella.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Ndola, the burden of shigella disease will be determined in under five children presenting&#xD;
      with moderate to severe diarrhea and admitted to Arthur Davison children's hospital in Ndola.&#xD;

      Stool- Isolates will be grown on horse blood agar and Shigella Salmonella agar plates&#xD;
      overnight at 37Â°C to detect potential contamination. Only pure ETEC and Shigella cultures&#xD;
      will be used for DNA extraction. For Illumina whole genome sequencing, we will use the&#xD;
      Genomic DNA kit (Promega) for DNA extraction according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
      For Single-Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing (Pacific Bioscience) which requires long&#xD;
      intact strands of DNA, we will use the phenol-chloroform extraction method described by&#xD;
      Mentzer and others (2014). The DNA will be stored in E buffer and sequenced at the Wellcome&#xD;
      Trust Sanger Institute.&#xD;
