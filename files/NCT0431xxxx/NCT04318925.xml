      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in the United States, but other diseases&#xD;
      transmitted by ticks have also been on the rise in recent years. Early symptoms of a&#xD;
      tickborne disease include fever, headache, fatigue and possible rash. Researchers want to&#xD;
      collect information and samples from people with Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses&#xD;
      to better understand and diagnose these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate and follow people with tick-borne diseases to help researchers learn more about&#xD;
      these infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who have or are suspected of having a tick-borne infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an initial visit, and visits about 1, 6, and 12 months later. The&#xD;
      visits can include a physical exam, blood tests, collection of blood, urine and saliva&#xD;
      samples for research, and filling out health-related questionnaires. Participants who have&#xD;
      the rash of Lyme disease may be invited to have up to 3 skin punch biopsies of the rash for&#xD;
      research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lyme disease is a multisystem illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and it is&#xD;
      the most common vector-borne illness in the United States. Tick-borne disease cases reported&#xD;
      to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been on the rise with over 59,000&#xD;
      cases reported in 2017. This protocol is designed to collaborate with University of Maryland&#xD;
      School of Medicine for the purpose of recruiting and enrolling patients with Lyme disease and&#xD;
      other tickborne illnesses. This is a natural history study which has the objective of&#xD;
      developing a rigorously defined population of patients with Lyme disease and other tick-borne&#xD;
      illnesses, per CDC case definitions, to serve as the basis for research in multiple aspects&#xD;
      of the infections. These research sub-projects have emphasis in exploring the biological&#xD;
      markers of tick-borne infections, developing new diagnostic tests for these infections,&#xD;
      assessing the clinical course and outcome of patients with these tick-borne infections, and&#xD;
      defining the immunological response to the pathogens.&#xD;
