  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interleukin 22 (IL-22) is known to be regulated by IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP), a&#xD;
      soluble, inhibitory receptor. The potential role of IL-22BP in atopic dermatitis (AD) is&#xD;
      mostly unknown and deserves further investigation. The main objective of this study is to&#xD;
      better understand the potential protective role of IL-22BP through the assessment of its&#xD;
      expression at the Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) and protein levels in skin and serum&#xD;
      which will be correlated to the severity of the diseases and through the identification of&#xD;
      its cellular sources in lesions. The results of this study will help to correctly interpret&#xD;
      the levels of IL-22 in AD and will potentially allow identifying biomarkers for patient&#xD;
      stratification and predicting clinical outcomes to targeted therapeutic agents.&#xD;

      This is a single-visit study. All patients will have a blood sample and 2 skin biopsies (2 mm&#xD;
      diameter) in lesional and non lesional area&#xD;
&#xD;
      . It is planned to include 45 patients (15 patients per severity group: SCORAD ]25-50] ,&#xD;
      ]50-65]; 50-65; &gt;65).The first 20 patients included will be group 2 and 3 patients (SCORAD &gt;&#xD;
      50).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be adults with AD recruited from the cohort of patients followed up in the&#xD;
      Dermatology department of Nantes University Hospital. A refusal rate of 4/5 is expected.&#xD;
      Recruitment can therefore be envisaged in 18 months (2.5 patients/month). Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited during follow-up consultations or at the first consultation in the department.&#xD;
      Recruitment will be coordinated by the clinical research team (CRT). Blood samples will be&#xD;
      taken by the CRT Nurse. The skin and blood samples will be sent to the CIMNA/ Immunology&#xD;
      Laboratory Nantes University hospital&#xD;

Three groups of patients will be defined based on the SCORAD score . The score is out of 103 and is higher the greater the severity of the disease:&#xD;
Group 1: SCORAD score between ]25-50]&#xD;
Group 2: SCORAD between ]50; 65]&#xD;
Group 3: SCORAD greater than 65.</description>
