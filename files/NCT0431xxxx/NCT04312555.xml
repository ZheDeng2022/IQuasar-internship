      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of Alprostadil (Prostaglandin E2) as adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy after failure of direct but indirect angiosomal revascularization in patients with&#xD;
      critical limb ischemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In large number of elderly patients aged between 50 and 75 years, the arterial disease is&#xD;
      prevalent (1%-7%). It has a significant impact on the quality of life. Pain, fear of limb&#xD;
      loss, increased inactivity, and poor lifestyle choices which finally ended by disability.&#xD;
      Disability in turn makes communities and counties carry more efforts and charges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of critical limb ischemia (CLI) is increasing, and diabetic patients are&#xD;
      especially prone to developing ischemic and neuro-ischemic foot ulcers. Twelve to 25% of&#xD;
      diabetic patients may develop a foot lesion over time. Diabetic patients often present with&#xD;
      more extensive tissue loss compared to non-diabetic patients. The importance of&#xD;
      revascularization of the lower limb in patients with CLI has been well established, and&#xD;
      expedited revascularization is mandatory once an ischemic foot ulcer is detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is still a role for surgical bypass, over the last several decades the use of&#xD;
      endovascular techniques has become more frequent. This development has been made possible by&#xD;
      the evolution of endovascular devices and operator skills. The less-invasive endovascular&#xD;
      approach is the preferred treatment method, especially in the frail diabetic patient with&#xD;
      multiple comorbidities. Incisional wound healing in diabetic patients can also be&#xD;
      problematic. In both open and endovascular revascularization there is a clear difference of&#xD;
      approach in patients with CLI caused by inflow disease (iliac, femoral, and popliteal&#xD;
      disease) and those with (additional) infrapopliteal involvement. Whereas in above-the-knee&#xD;
      disease, it is clear that flow in the stenotic or occluded segment needs to be&#xD;
      re-established, in below-the-knee (BTK) disease, potentially three vessels can be&#xD;
      revascularized, and this poses a therapeutic dilemma. Choosing the correct target for&#xD;
      revascularization can present a critical, complex issue in challenging cases, especially when&#xD;
      multilevel arterial disease is present. Revascularization can be accomplished by using two&#xD;
      approaches: &quot;complete&quot; revascularization (one vessel is better than none, two to three&#xD;
      vessels are better than one) or &quot;wound-related&quot; revascularization. With CLI, the healing of&#xD;
      an ulcer is blood-flow-dependent and the goal of treatment should be to get the best possible&#xD;
      blood supply to the foot (direct revascularization). In practice this is not always feasible,&#xD;
      and in order to guide the choice of which BTK vessel should be revascularized, the angiosome&#xD;
      concept has been proposed, based on the idea that specific anatomical regions are perfused by&#xD;
      specific arteriovenous bundles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostaglandins are potent vasoactive agents with wide variety of other actions -&#xD;
      vasodilatation, fibrinolysis and inhibition of platelet aggregation. PG infusion therapy may&#xD;
      show a promising results in patients where such new reconstructive procedures are not&#xD;
      feasible or failed and also as an adjunctive when there is a residual ischemia after the&#xD;
      revascularization procedures.&#xD;
