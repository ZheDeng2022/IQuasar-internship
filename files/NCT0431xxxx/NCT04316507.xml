  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer (PC) has a dismal prognosis. Approximately 10% of PC patients carry a&#xD;
      germline pathogenic variant in a cancer susceptibility gene, whose identification can lead to&#xD;
      better treatments for the patient and participation in cancer prevention programs for their&#xD;
      family members. Conventional genetic testing for PC patients is based on the family history&#xD;
      of cancer, and may take up to six months from the point of meeting with the treating&#xD;
      physician to receiving the results from a genetic counsellor. The median overall survival for&#xD;
      these patients is 6 - 12 months, which may prevent them from having the genetic testing in&#xD;
      the first place, or from receiving further targeted treatments. Patients with PC need a more&#xD;
      comprehensive knowledge of their disease for better treatment planning. This includes genetic&#xD;
      testing in absence of family history of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed a one year study to assess the feasibility of medical oncologist&#xD;
      initiated cancer genetic testing for all newly diagnosed PC patients unselected by family&#xD;
      history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with negative genetic testing, no further testing will be ordered after the&#xD;
      disclosure of results. Patients with positive genetic testing results will be informed and&#xD;
      referred to Cancer Genetics Clinic. The investigators expect to enroll 100 patients in 1&#xD;
      year. Patients will be asked to complete satisfaction questionnaires according to the&#xD;
      Satisfaction with Genetic Counseling Scale in multiple time points (pre-testing,&#xD;
      post-testing, at 6 months and at 12 months). Designated oncologists will be asked to evaluate&#xD;
      the process using the Oncologist Satisfaction Survey after every five counseled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three primary objectives will include 1) assessment of the turnaround time for genetic&#xD;
      testing results; 2) assessment of patient satisfaction; 3) assessment of oncologist's&#xD;
      satisfaction. Secondary objectives will include assessment of association between genetic&#xD;
      testing results and types of treatment and overall survival.&#xD;
