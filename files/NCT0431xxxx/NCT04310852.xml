  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently there has been a growing interest in the role of subchondral bone in knee arthritis,&#xD;
      both in its etiology and evolution and in its clinical significance. It has now been widely&#xD;
      demonstrated that changes in the subchondral bone can develop both as a cause and as a&#xD;
      consequence of joint degeneration and it is now accepted in the scientific community that the&#xD;
      presence of these changes is of clinical importance, causing pain and an inflammatory state&#xD;
      that can contribute to the evolution of arthrosis arthropathy. Recently the use of&#xD;
      mesenchymal cells obtained from the bone marrow has been proposed for the treatment of&#xD;
      gonarthrosis by intra-articular injections. Even more recently, treatments have been studied&#xD;
      and proposed for the treatment of the bone-cartilage interface in knees affected by&#xD;
      osteoarthrosis, using autologous bone marrow concentrate, with promising results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative and disabling disease of joint joints, in which&#xD;
      metabolic impairment between the synthesis and degradation of cartilage and subchondral bone,&#xD;
      involves progressive destruction of joint tissue accompanied by chronic pain and synovial&#xD;
      inflammation. Currently, available therapies are mostly palliative and designed to mask&#xD;
      symptoms. The study proposed here has been constructed on the basis of the scientific&#xD;
      evidence reported in the literature regarding the etiology and the treatment of OA. As&#xD;
      recently demonstrated, the use of mesenchymal cells obtained from the bone marrow was&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of gonarthrosis by intra-articular injections. Even more recently,&#xD;
      treatments aimed at treating the bone-cartilage interface in arthritic knees have been&#xD;
      studied and proposed. In the 2016 Val et al. pilot study, stem cells from the tibial bone&#xD;
      marrow injected into the percutaneous bone-cartilage interface were described as a new&#xD;
      therapeutic approach to osteoarthritis of the knee. This procedure is able to repair&#xD;
      cartilage by stimulating subchondral bone angiogenesis and alleviating ischemia associated&#xD;
      with arthritic knee pain, generating extremely positive outcomes in patients with low-grade&#xD;
      osteoarthritis and relieving long-term pain in patients with high-grade osteoarthritis. This&#xD;
      treatment is also able to induce differentiation and proliferation of chondrocytes, leading&#xD;
      to an increase in the size of the intra-articular matrix, demonstrating an effective and&#xD;
      minimally invasive treatment for the resolution of OA. The study described here aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the potential effectiveness of the synergistic effect of both injections, with the&#xD;
      aim of improving the symptomatic picture of patients with OA of the knee. Combining&#xD;
      percutaneous injections at the bone-cartilage interface with intra-articular injections will&#xD;
      provide proven results for the use of stem cells such as cartilage repair, increased&#xD;
      vascularity, and pain reduction, in both compartments of the knee affected by OA. The&#xD;
      positive effects reported in the literature regarding intra-articular injections will be&#xD;
      combined with those reported with respect to the use of percutaneous injections at the&#xD;
      cartilage, in order to obtain a better outcome in the treatment of the disease than in&#xD;
      previous studies.&#xD;

    <description>The treatment will be carried out in the operating room under ordinary hospitalization and involves the application of 9 ml of autologous bone marrow concentrate in the knee affected by arthrosis. Specifically, 3 ml will be applied at the level of the bone-cartilage interface of the femur, 3 ml at the level of the bone-cartilage interface of the tibia, and 3 ml will be injected into the joint for a simultaneous action also at the level of the cartilage. To obtain the necessary amount of bone marrow concentrate, an aspirate of bone marrow will be taken from the iliac crest (60 ml) and homolateral tibia (30 ml) of the patient and concentrated by BioCue Concentration Kit, company Zimmer biomet, and centrifuge. This autologous bone marrow concentrate will be injected by means of the Perfuse at the level of the tibial and femoral bone-cartilage interface of the percutaneous arthrosis affected compartment under radiographic control.</description>

      for histological and molecular analysis. In particular, each sample will be characterized in&#xD;
      terms of vitality, proliferation, cellular senescence, immunophenotype and differentiative&#xD;
      capacity towards the osteogenic and chondrogenic lines. In addition, for each sample, the&#xD;
