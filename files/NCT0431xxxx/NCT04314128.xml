  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) is a rare disease, primarily affecting overweight&#xD;
      females of child-bearing age. Patients suffer from increased intracranial pressure (ICP),&#xD;
      typically resulting in headaches, visual disturbances and bilateral papilledema, pulsatile&#xD;
      tinnitus and cognitive deficits. The disease is difficult to diagnose, treat and monitor. The&#xD;
      only current method of measuring the ICP in day-to-day clinical practice is by lumbar&#xD;
      puncture. This procedure is invasive, and often painful for the patient. There is an unmet&#xD;
      need of methods that can reliable measure or estimate ICP in a non-invasive manner.&#xD;
      Ultrasound is one such potential method, and the aim of this study is to investigate the use&#xD;
      of ocular ultrasound and transcranial doppler to measure or estimate ICP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective cohort study. Investigators plan to include 50 patients in whom&#xD;
      the IIH-diagnosis is suspected. Patients are referred from general practitioners,&#xD;
      neurologists or ophthalmologists to the Danish Headache Center or admitted to the Neurology&#xD;
      ward when the IIH diagnosis is suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of an established routine clinical work-up to establish the diagnosis of IIH, all&#xD;
      patients will undergo (according to the Friedman criteria) the following examinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An interview (history taking) and clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Routine laboratory tests (blood tests)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ophthalmological examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lumbar puncture with measurement of the ICP&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally the following investigations will be performed at baseline (before and after&#xD;
      lumbar puncture):&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Transorbital sonography (TOS) C) Transcranial Doppler When the patient is seen at the&#xD;
      clinic for their regular follow-up visits the same measurements will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control group of healthy participants (NR=25) will be included in whom TOS (B) and TCD (C)&#xD;
      will be performed in order to compare the values between the patient group (IIH) and control&#xD;
      group. Controls will be included to match the patients according to BMI, age and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ultrasound images- and films will be saved, and evaluated by a blinded investigator.&#xD;
