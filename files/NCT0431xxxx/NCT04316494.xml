      The purpose of this study is to find out whether hydroxychloroquine, in addition to&#xD;
      background treatments, reduces disease activity in patients with Anti-Neutrophilic&#xD;
      Cytoplasmic Autoantibodies (ANCA) Vasculitis, a group of autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine and is an established, effective, safe and inexpensive therapy, widely&#xD;
      used in other autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is open to adults diagnosed with certain types of vasculitis, called Granulomatosis&#xD;
      Polyangiitis (GPA), Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA) or Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with&#xD;
      Polyangiitis (EGPA). Participants will be eligible if they are treated with background&#xD;
      medication to control their vasculitis disease and have a low level of disease activity as&#xD;
      defined by a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) of greater than 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly placed in 1 of 2 groups. Both groups will be given background&#xD;
      medication. One group will receive hydroxychloroquine and the other will receive placebo.&#xD;
      Participants will be on treatment for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      76 ANCA Vasculitis participants will be recruited (38 in each treatment arm) from UK&#xD;
      vasculitis specialist centres over 2 years.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate if&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine in combination with background maintenance therapy improves the clinical&#xD;
      response and quality of life in patients with AAV. 76 participants who have Granulomatosis&#xD;
      with Polyangiitis, Microscopic Polyangiitis or Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis&#xD;
      will be recruited from 10 sites over 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio of hydroxychloroquine or placebo. Neither the patient&#xD;
      nor the research team will know which treatment group the participant is in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participant agrees to take part and has signed informed consent, they will undergo&#xD;
      the following assessments, tests and procedures to find out if they can take part in the&#xD;
      study. Some may be routinely done by the study doctor as part of regular vasculitis care even&#xD;
      if the participants are not in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine drug test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arrange for optician review&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is eligible to take part in the study, they will be randomised to receive&#xD;
      either hydroxychloroquine or placebo in addition to background medication. Participants will&#xD;
      receive 2 tablets to take once a day over the course of a year. Participants may have their&#xD;
      dose reduced to 1 tablet dependent on their weight at baseline and renal function. All&#xD;
      participants will have their prednisolone dose tapered down over the course of the study.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to fill in a patient diary on a weekly basis to record whether&#xD;
      they've taken their medication, and if they've experienced any change of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to attend the hospital at weeks 4, 16, 28, 40, 44, 48, 52 and 56.&#xD;
      At each of these visits, participants will undertake some or all of the following&#xD;
      tests/assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam including visual acuity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight and vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BVAS assessment and Vasculitis Damage Index (VDI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there are any changes to their medicines and health status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If they experiencing any side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples and urine tests to see how the study drug is affecting the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At three visits, participants will also be asked to undergo an electrocardiogram (ECG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up by phone in weeks 10, 22, and 34. This phone call will be based&#xD;
      on the ANCA-associated Vasculitis Patient Reported Outcome (AAV PRO) questionnaire and&#xD;
      patients will also be encouraged to report any adverse events. Patients reporting new or&#xD;
      worsening symptoms will be invited to the hospital for an unscheduled visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to clinical bloods, 76ml of blood will be taken for research purposes for all&#xD;
      participants. These will be taken at the same time as clinical bloods to minimise discomfort&#xD;
      for the participant. Participants at Guy's and St Thomas' will have an additional 200ml of&#xD;
      blood taken for isolation of cells. These bloods will be stored and kept for future research,&#xD;
      with the written consent of the participant.&#xD;
