      Patients with urothelial high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients will be&#xD;
      treated with intravesical electromotive drug administration/mitomycin (EMDA/MMC) after&#xD;
      bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) failure. Patients are scheduled for an initial 6 weekly&#xD;
      treatments, a further 6 weekly treatments for non-responders and a followup 10 monthly&#xD;
      treatments for responders. Complete response will be defined as histological disappearance of&#xD;
      malignancy on bladder biopsy and resolution of abnormal cytological findings after treatment.&#xD;
      Time to first recurrence, time to progression, overall survival, and disease-specific&#xD;
      survival wil be estimated by use of the Kaplan-Meier method.&#xD;

&#xD;
      BCG Failure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of BCG failure in patients has been proposed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. BCG-refractory disease when there is failure to achieve a disease-free state at 6 months&#xD;
           following initial BCG therapy with either maintenance or retreatment at 3 months because&#xD;
           of persistent or rapidly recurrent tumor;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. BCG-resistant disease when there is recurrence or persistence at 3 months following an&#xD;
           induction cycle;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BCG-relapsing disease when the disease recurs after the patient is disease-free for 6&#xD;
           months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. BCG-intolerant disease when the disease recurs following administration of a less than&#xD;
           adequate course of therapy because of a serious adverse event or symptomatic intolerance&#xD;
           that requires discontinuation of further BCG therapy.13 Study design Patients will&#xD;
           underwent: upper urinary tract imaging, urinary cytology of the bladder and upper&#xD;
           urinary tract; random cold-cup biopsies of the bladder and prostatic urethra-ie,&#xD;
           sampling of seemingly healthy urothelium and of suspicious areas; and complete&#xD;
           transurethral resection (TUR) of all bladder tumour visible on endoscopy, ensuring&#xD;
           muscle was included in resected samples. All patients will underwent re-staging TUR 4-5&#xD;
           weeks later. All clinical assessors are adequately trained in the above procedures, and&#xD;
           no methods are used to enhance the quality of measurements. All biopsy samples of tumour&#xD;
           and bladder will be reviewed by a pathologist for stage and grade. Tumour stage are&#xD;
           classified according to the 1997 TNM classification of the International Union Against&#xD;
           Cancer, and tumour grade was defined in accordance with the 1973 WHO classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment schedule All patients will start induction EMDA/MMC of 6 intravesical treatments at&#xD;
      weekly intervals commencing 2-3 weeks after re-staging TUR. Intravesical EMDA MMC is given by&#xD;
      a battery-powered generator delivering a controlled electric current that passes between the&#xD;
      active intravesical electrode integrated into a specific transurethral catheter and&#xD;
      dispersive ground electrodes on skin of the lower abdomen (Physion srl, Mirandola, Italy).&#xD;
      Patients are placed on fluid restriction and 2 g ingested sodium bicarbonate the night before&#xD;
      treatment, the morning of treatment, and 2 h before treatment with mitomycin. The bladder is&#xD;
      emptied through the electrode-transurethral-catheter and 40 mg mitomycin dissolved in 100 mL&#xD;
      water was infused intravesically by gravity and retained in the bladder for 30 min, while 20&#xD;
      mA for 30 min pulsed electric current was given externally. Two dispersive cathode electrodes&#xD;
      were placed on lower abdominal skin that had been degreased with alcohol. The bladder was&#xD;
      then emptied and the catheter removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were disease-free 3 months after treatment were scheduled to receive monthly&#xD;
      infusions of BCG for 10 months. Maintenance treatment was given to the same dose and methods&#xD;
      of infusion as initial allocated treatment. Response to treatment was assessed with abdominal&#xD;
      ultrasonography, cystoscopy, and urinary cytology. In patients who were free of disease 3&#xD;
      months after treatment, these assessments were done every 3 months during the first 3 years&#xD;
      and every 6 months thereafter. Patients with carcinoma in situ underwent abdominal&#xD;
      ultrasonography, cystoscopy, urinary cytology, and random bladder biopsies at 3 months and 6&#xD;
      months. If bladder cytology was positive for cancer cells but no lesions were visible on&#xD;
      cystoscopy, cytology of the upper urinary tract and random biopsies of the bladder and&#xD;
      prostatic urethra were done. If, at 3 months' follow-up, carcinoma in situ persisted or a&#xD;
      superficial tumour recurred (ie, stage pTa tumour confined to the urothelium or stage pT1&#xD;
      with invasion of the lamina propria), the patient underwent multiple, random biopsy sampling&#xD;
      and TUR of all bladder tumour visible on endoscopy and received a second course of&#xD;
      intervention treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cystoscopy, biopsies, and urinary cytology were repeated 3 months after the start of the&#xD;
      second course. Patients who were disease-free after the second course of treatment received&#xD;
      the full course of monthly maintenance instillations (ie, one infusion of electromotive&#xD;
      mitomycin for 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were suspended from the trial on a second recurrence, on persistence of carcinoma in&#xD;
      situ, on development of carcinoma in the upper-urinary tract or prostatic urethra, on&#xD;
      progression to muscle-invasive disease (ie, stage pT2 or more advanced), or on development of&#xD;
      metastases. Further treatment was left to the discretion of the local investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity Side effects were classified as local, systemic or allergic. Local toxicity was&#xD;
      defined as culture proven bacterial cystitis, drug induced (chemical) cystitis and other&#xD;
      localized effects. Systemic side effects were defined as fever exceeding 38C, general malaise&#xD;
      and fatigue. Skin rash was regarded as allergic reaction. The severity of side effects were&#xD;
      classified by the treating physician, with subsequent decision to continue, delay or abandon&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow-up. Response to treatment was assessed with cystoscopy, urinary cytology and&#xD;
      /or biopsy only if indicated by suspicious cytological findings or on cystoscopy. In&#xD;
      disease-free cases, cystoscopy and urinary cytology were repeated at 3-month intervals for 2&#xD;
      years, 6-month intervals for 3 years and yearly thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient evaluation Patients with stage pTa and pT1 tumour without carcinoma in situ are&#xD;
      classified as disease-free and therefore treated prophylactically; those with carcinoma in&#xD;
      situ are treated therapeutically, and response is scored as no response or as complete&#xD;
      response. Complete response is defined as complete disappearance of carcinoma in situ, as&#xD;
      documented by a normal cytology, cystoscopy, and random bladder biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is disease-free interval for patients without carcinoma in situ and for&#xD;
      patients with carcinoma in situ who are disease-free after treatment-ie, time from enrollment&#xD;
      to first cystoscopy noting recurrence. Patients with carcinoma in situ who did not have&#xD;
      complete response after 3 months of treatment are regarded as having recurrence with no&#xD;
      follow-up. The secondary endpoints are time to progression, overall survival, and disease&#xD;
      specific survival. Time to progression is defined as time from randomisation until the onset&#xD;
      of muscle invasive disease as recorded by pathological assessment of TUR samples or biopsy&#xD;
      samples. Overall survival is defined as time from enrollment until death from any cause;&#xD;
      disease specific survival as time from enrollment until death from bladder cancer. Patients&#xD;
      without recurrence or progression are censored at the last cystoscopy, and those lost to&#xD;
      follow-up were censored at the last known day of survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis All analyses are done by intention to treat. Time to first recurrence,&#xD;
      time to progression, overall survival, and disease-specific survival are estimated by use of&#xD;
      the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparisons are estimated by use of log-rank test. All tests are&#xD;
      two-sided, and p&lt;0·05 was regarded as significant. The investigators will calculated hazard&#xD;
      ratios with 95% CI by use of proportional-hazards regression.&#xD;
