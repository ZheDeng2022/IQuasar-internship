      This clinical trial uses multicenter, single-arm, prospective trial design,people who met the&#xD;
      enrollment requirements were performed with Ewata balloon guiding and stent type thrombectomy&#xD;
      device.The clinical results were compared with those of other historical guiding catheter&#xD;
      products combined with the stent type thrombectomy device to to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Ewata balloon guide catheter in combination with a stent for&#xD;
      thrombectomy.&#xD;

    <description>When the balloon guiding catheter arrives at the desired location, the thrombectomy instrument can enter the balloon guiding catheter smoothly, which can be opened successfully when needed to form a local blockage of blood flow. After the thrombectomy, the thrombectomy instrument can be withdrawn back into the guide catheter, which is considered as a success.Ewata balloon guide catheter should be used at least once during thrombectomy</description>
