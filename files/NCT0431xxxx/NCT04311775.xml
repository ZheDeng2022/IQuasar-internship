      LMA insertion provide an intact airway for many surgeries during general anesthesia . LMA&#xD;
      insertion technique was defined when it was first produced by Archie Brain . Accordingly, it&#xD;
      is recommended to advance the device to the level where resistance is felt blindly. However,&#xD;
      placing LMA may not always be smooth and uncomplicated. Thus, gas leaks may occur and&#xD;
      intragastric pressure increase may occur due to gastric insufflation. To overcome these&#xD;
      difficulties, the placement of the LMA under direct vision using a laryngoscope has been&#xD;
      described in several studies . Previous studies have shown that the reliability of the&#xD;
      laryngeal mask can be demonstrated by the oropharyngeal cuff leak test . In addition, the&#xD;
      classification of the image of the laryngeal structures mediated by fiberoptic imaging and&#xD;
      vocal cords from the LMA gives us information about the availability of effective positive&#xD;
      pressure ventilation.&#xD;

      pressure ventilation.In cases where difficulties are found in laryngeal mask placement, using&#xD;
      direct laryngoscope or videosingoscope, placement is frequently applied in anesthesia&#xD;
      practice. Kim GW et al investigated LMA placement with direct laryngoscope. However, there is&#xD;
      no study investigating the effectiveness of videongoscopes. Videoingoscopes have wide viewing&#xD;
      angles through their cameras located at the blade tips. For this reason, we think that it&#xD;
      will be advantageous in placing a laryngeal mask.&#xD;
