  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, single-center, randomized, single-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, single dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD&#xD;
      of SSS17 following oral administration in healthy subjects. Approximately 65 subjects (53&#xD;
      receiving active drug and 12 receiving placebo) will participate in this study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll healthy volunteers from a single academic medical center in China. All&#xD;
      participants will be informed about the study and potential risks and required to provide&#xD;
      written informed consent prior to undergoing study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The improved Fibonacci dose escalation design will be implemented. The protocol specifies 10&#xD;
      mg, oral, one time for the first cohort without placebo control. Successive cohorts will be&#xD;
      given doses up to 540 mg with placebo parallel control. Only no observation meets the&#xD;
      criteria under stop rules, dose will escalate to the next higher level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided into 2 stages: 1st period (fast) and 2nd period(fed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      First period (fast): Subjects will be allocated 1:4 to receive placebo or SSS17, which will&#xD;
      be administered by oral route. At each dose, tolerability, safety, PK and PD characteristics&#xD;
      will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second period (fed): in order to investigate the effects of food on PK and PD of SSS17.&#xD;
      Subjects in one cohort will be administered again after meal on Day15. The accurate dose will&#xD;
      be adjusted according to the findings in 1st period (fast)&#xD;
