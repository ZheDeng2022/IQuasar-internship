      This study aims to evaluate the effect of early vs late enteral feeding after abdominal&#xD;
      surgery on neonatal outcome after surgery, weight gain, length of hospital stay, time to&#xD;
      reach full enteral feeding, time to pass first stool, surgical site infections, sepsis and&#xD;
      electrolyte disturbances.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are a many reasons for gastrointestinal (GI) tract surgery and following surgery the&#xD;
      aim is to efficiently establish infants on enteral feeds and wean them off of parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition. Neonates may lose their body resources after surgery due to inadequate nutrient&#xD;
      intake and undergoing long periods of fasting after surgery. Nil peroral (NPO)/nil by mouth&#xD;
      has been the most commonly practiced convention in post-operative period. Misplaced fear of&#xD;
      aspiration, prevent nausea, vomiting and anastomotic complications led to routine&#xD;
      prescription of &quot;NPO.&quot; The duration of postoperative fasting is variable but can range from 0&#xD;
      to 5 days depending on the operation. The ramiﬁcations of this period of fasting are not&#xD;
      insigniﬁcant and may include prolonged length of stay, increased use of parenteral nutrition&#xD;
      (PN), social effects and signiﬁcant costs to the health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starvation leads to disuse atrophy of villi, decrease disaccharide activity, decreased&#xD;
      intestinal mucosa mass, and loss of DNA of enterocyte. This malfunctioning enterocyte leads&#xD;
      to increase the permeability of intestinal mucosa to antigen and macromolecules. This&#xD;
      starvation-induced gut mucosal injury leads to decrease the production of Vitamin K due to&#xD;
      the absence of normal colonic flora. This also leads to decreased growth factors and bile&#xD;
      acid metabolism. This compounded effect of starved gut and abnormal colonic bacterial&#xD;
      environment leads to colonization of pathological bacteria and might lead to sepsis and&#xD;
      sequelae. In addition, starvation leads to decreased immune cells of intestine gut-associated&#xD;
      lymphoid tissue. This decreased gut immunity leads to increased uptake of toxins and&#xD;
      decreased immune response to foreign antigen. This leads to bacterial translocation&#xD;
      Traditionally after abdominal surgery, presence of bowel sounds or passage of flatus or&#xD;
      stools has been the clinical evidence of restoration of bowel activity and indicators for&#xD;
      starting oral diet. Bowel sounds are poor markers of bowel function as uncoordinated and&#xD;
      antegrade peristalsis can be heard as bowel sounds. Currently, there is no good marker for&#xD;
      return of bowel sounds, and even in the presence of prolonged ileus, the bowel moves .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cochrane reviews have shown no advantage in keeping patients &quot;nil by mouth&quot; following&#xD;
      gastrointestinal surgery and support early commencement of enteral feeding .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In neonates and infants there are additional issues with delayed feeding including&#xD;
      cholestatic jaundice, sepsis, delayed gut development, and metabolic disease. Early trophic&#xD;
      feeds may improve recovery time by increasing gut blood flow, improving motility and limiting&#xD;
      the impact of starvation on the structure of the gut and its ability to absorb nutrients.&#xD;
      Early introduction of enteral nutrition improves intestinal adaptation, reducing the risk of&#xD;
      intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESPEN guidelines recommend early initiation of enteral feeding within 24 h after&#xD;
      gastrointestinal surgery, but also state that it needs to be adapted according to the&#xD;
      individual tolerance and type of surgery .&#xD;
&#xD;
      So this study aims to evaluate the effect of early vs late enteral feeding after abdominal&#xD;
      surgery on neonatal outcome after surgery, weight gain, length of hospital stay, time to&#xD;
      reach full enteral feeding, time to pass first stool, surgical site infections, sepsis and&#xD;
      electrolyte disturbances and will include all neonates who undergoing abdominal surgery and&#xD;
      admitted in neonatal intensive care unit in Assiut University Children Hospital for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 2 groups group A :start enteral feeding within 2 days postoperative&#xD;
      and group B :start enteral feeding after 2 days postoperative according to clinician&#xD;
      discretion based on clinical progress(ranging from 1-5 days after passage of flatus or stool.&#xD;
