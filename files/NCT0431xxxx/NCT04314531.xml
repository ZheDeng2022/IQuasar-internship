        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has provided written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject is ≥ 18 years of age at time of Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has a diagnosis of active PsA for at least 6 months before the first&#xD;
             administration of the study agent and has active PsA at Screening or Baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP Ab)&#xD;
             negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must have no prior exposure to anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agent(s)&#xD;
             use for the treatment of PsO or PsA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject has a planned surgical intervention between Baseline and the Week 52&#xD;
             evaluation for a pretreatment condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has an active infection or history of infections as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  any active infection for which systemic anti-infectives were used within 28 days&#xD;
                  prior to first IMP dose, with the last dose having been received within 7 days of&#xD;
                  Screening,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  a serious infection, defined as requiring hospitalization or intravenous (IV)&#xD;
                  anti-infectives within 8 weeks prior to the first IMP dose, with the last dose&#xD;
                  having been received within 7 days of Screening,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  recurrent or chronic infections, e.g., chronic pyelonephritis, chronic&#xD;
                  osteomyelitis, bronchiectasis, or other active infection that, in the opinion of&#xD;
                  the Investigator, might cause this study to be detrimental to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has any concurrent medical condition or uncontrolled, clinically significant&#xD;
             systemic disease (e.g., renal failure, heart failure, hypertension, liver disease,&#xD;
             diabetes, or anemia) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could cause this study&#xD;
             to be detrimental to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has a known history of infection with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject had myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, or ischemic stroke within&#xD;
             the past 6 months prior to the first IMP dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has any active malignancy, including evidence of cutaneous basal or squamous&#xD;
             cell carcinoma or melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with a history of alcohol or drug abuse in the previous 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential who do not agree to abstain from&#xD;
             heterosexual activity or practice a dual method of contraception, for example, a&#xD;
             combination of the following: (1) oral contraceptive, depo progesterone, or&#xD;
             intrauterine device; and (2) a barrier method (condom or diaphragm). Male subjects&#xD;
             with female partners of childbearing potential who are not using birth control as&#xD;
             described above must use a barrier method of contraception (e.g., condom) if not&#xD;
             surgically sterile (i.e., vasectomy). Contraceptive methods must be practiced upon&#xD;
             signing the Informed Consent and through 24 weeks after the last dose of IMP. If a&#xD;
             subject discontinues prematurely, the contraceptive method must be practiced for 17&#xD;
             weeks following final administration of IMP. A follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) test&#xD;
             should be performed to confirm menopause (per reference values of the laboratory) for&#xD;
             those women with no menses for less than 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject currently enrolled in another investigational device/procedure or drug study,&#xD;
             or Baseline of this study is less than 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)&#xD;
             since ending another investigational device/procedure or drug study(s), or receiving&#xD;
             other investigational agent(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject previously has been enrolled (randomized) in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject has any kind of disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may&#xD;
             compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent and/or to&#xD;
             comply with all required study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Donation or loss of 400 milliliter (mL) or more of blood within 8 weeks before first&#xD;
             dose of IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects who have been placed in an institution on official or judicial orders.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects who are related to or dependent on the Investigator, Sponsor, or study site&#xD;
             such that a conflict of interest could arise.&#xD;
