  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with opioid-use disorder (OUD) might benefit from having more treatment drugs to&#xD;
      choose from. A new drug, TRV734, could be used like methadone to treat OUD. It might not have&#xD;
      as many side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if TRV734 relieves withdrawal symptoms and has fewer side effects than oxycodone in&#xD;
      people with OUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18-75 who have been receiving daily treatment with methadone for opioid use&#xD;
      disorder for at least 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under Protocol 415. They will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical, social, and psychiatric history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram (ECG). For this, sticky pads will be placed on the participant s chest to&#xD;
      monitor their heartbeat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in a residential unit for 13-26 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most days, participants will receive their regular daily dose of methadone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On 4 or 5 occasions, 3-4 days apart, participants will skip two doses of methadone in a row.&#xD;
      About 4 hours after they skip the second dose, they will have an IV catheter inserted with a&#xD;
      needle so that blood samples can be taken. They will take capsules of either oxycodone, a&#xD;
      placebo, or the study drug. They will have an ECG. They will complete questionnaires. Their&#xD;
      blood pressure, pupil size, and alertness will be tested. They will then take their usual&#xD;
      dose of methadone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give daily urine and breath samples.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background. Opioid-agonist medications (methadone and buprenorphine) are the most effective&#xD;
      treatments available for opioid addiction. However, they are not effective in all cases, and&#xD;
      with the vast number of people requiring treatment in the current crisis, even a modest&#xD;
      increase in the percentage of people who respond to treatment would represent a substantial&#xD;
      benefit in public health. Recent advances in neuropsychopharmacology have led to the&#xD;
      discovery of a new class of opioid agonists that are functionally selective. That is, they&#xD;
      are biased towards specific post-receptor pathways and in theory can produce therapeutic&#xD;
      opioid effects (analgesia, withdrawal relief) while minimizing side effects (sedation,&#xD;
      respiratory depression) that can lead people to discontinue treatment with methadone or&#xD;
      buprenorphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. Our goal is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of a biased opioid agonist for&#xD;
      suppressing or reversing opioid withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant population. Adults who are physically dependent on opioids and already receiving&#xD;
      chronic daily methadone treatment (up to 53 enrolled; up to 30 completers, plus three to run&#xD;
      in an initial unpowered dose-finding pilot). Target enrollment will include 40% women and 60%&#xD;
      minorities (mostly African-American), reflecting the demographics of the relevant local&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design. A double-blind within-subject randomized placebo-controlled experiment&#xD;
      will be used to test whether a biased opioid agonist suppresses withdrawal when given about&#xD;
      52 h after discontinuing methadone. TRV734 (capsule form), a biased opioid agonist with good&#xD;
      oral bioavailability, will be compared to placebo and to oxycodone (positive control) in&#xD;
      matching capsules. A signal of efficacy and safety in the proposed laboratory study will be&#xD;
      our cue to embark on a larger clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Participants will stay at the inpatient unit for 13-21 consecutive nights to help&#xD;
      ensure that participants use no additional opioids during a 52-hr opioid abstinence period&#xD;
      prior to each test session. The first three participants will be enrolled in an unpowered&#xD;
      dose-finding five-session pilot study (18-26 consecutive nights) to test placebo, oxycodone,&#xD;
      and a range of doses of TRV734, starting on the high side of the analgesic dose range. The&#xD;
      highest dose that relieves withdrawal symptoms with no appreciable adverse effects will be&#xD;
      used as the higher of two doses for the participants in the main study. To help demonstrate&#xD;
      that TRV734 s effects are dose-related, we will also select a lower dose with&#xD;
      withdrawal-relief efficacy intermediate between placebo and the higher dose. For participants&#xD;
      in the main study, there will be four experimental sessions: one each with placebo,&#xD;
      oxycodone, and the two doses of TRV734. Safety and research measures will be collected before&#xD;
      (baseline) and for 4 hours after administration of study drugs. The participant s usual&#xD;
      methadone dose will be administered after each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcome will be suppression of withdrawal symptoms, to be&#xD;
      assessed by the SOWS (Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale). Secondary outcomes will include&#xD;
      safety, specificity of effects (e.g., absence of psychomotor slowing), tolerability, and&#xD;
      suppression of objective signs of withdrawal. Instruments used for these assessments will&#xD;
      include the COWS (Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale), scales for opioid effects, psychomotor&#xD;
      assessments, and differential dropout across sessions. We hypothesize that the higher dose of&#xD;
      TRV734 will be superior to placebo in therapeutic effects and have lower adverse effects&#xD;
      (including effects on alertness and psychomotor performance) compared to oxycodone.&#xD;

             they will be considered menopausal, and will not require contraception or additional&#xD;
             pregnancy testing. If their FSH test is less than 20, they will need pregnancy testing&#xD;
             and contraception as required by the protocol.).&#xD;
