  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To characterize the safety and tolerability profile of ascending doses of scopolamine&#xD;
      hydrobromide trihydrate (Scopolamine HBT) administered by intramuscular (IM) injection. And&#xD;
      characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ascending doses of Scopolamine HBT administered by&#xD;
      IM injection&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, in-clinic, Phase 1, single-dose,&#xD;
      IM, sequential dose-escalation study in healthy adults aged 18-55. Healthy volunteers will be&#xD;
      assigned to 1 of 5 cohorts of Scopolamine HBT dosage groups: 0.005, 0.007, 0.011, 0.014, or&#xD;
      0.021 mg/kg, or will receive the placebo administered by IM injection to the anterior thigh.&#xD;
      In each cohort, 6 to 9 subjects will receive active drug and 2 to 3 subjects will receive&#xD;
      placebo. Each cohort will have at least 3 male and 3 female subjects enrolled among the first&#xD;
      8 subjects in the dosing group to ensure that at least 1 male subject and 1 female subject in&#xD;
      each dosing group receive active drug. If nonextreme dose-limiting toxicities are observed in&#xD;
      any of the cohorts, 4 additional subjects, 3 active and 1 placebo, may be added to each&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;

    <description>A goal of this clinical study is to measure Scopolamine HBT immunity remaining in each participant after IM administration. The predicted efficacious Cmax, based on limited nonclinical studies, is 16-18 ng/mL. At the end of each cohort, the PI, DSMB, and sponsor will evaluate the safety outcomes and PK data associated with the Scopolamine HBT dosing for that group.</description>
