    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority (NI) of the immune response to&#xD;
      2 doses of 9vHPV vaccine, 1 co-administered with TDV, compared with 2 doses of 9vHPV vaccine&#xD;
      administered alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vaccine being tested in this study is called Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine (TDV). The study&#xD;
      will assess the immunogenicity and safety on the co-administration of 9vHPV vaccine with TDV&#xD;
      in healthy participants aged ≥9 to &lt;15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 614 healthy volunteers. Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the two treatment groups-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive recombinant 9-valent Human Papillomavirus Vaccine (9vHPV)&#xD;
      intramuscular (IM) in combination with Dengue Tetravalent Vaccine (TDV) subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      injection on Day 1 (Month 0 ) followed by 9vHPV on Day 90 (Month 3) and TDV on Day 180 (Month&#xD;
      6) in Group 1. Participants will receive 9vHPV on Day 1 (Month 0) and Day 180 (Month 6) IM in&#xD;
      Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Thailand. The overall time to participate in&#xD;
      this study is 12 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, after last&#xD;
      dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;
