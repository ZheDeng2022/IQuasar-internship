      The primary study goal is to evaluate the histological characteristic of Silk Voice at a&#xD;
      surrogate implantation site to evaluate the potential for Silk Voice to deliver long-term&#xD;
      results to patients. Information obtained from this study will help clinician determine Silk&#xD;
      Voice's treatment duration and whether Silk Voice is appropriate for their patient.&#xD;
