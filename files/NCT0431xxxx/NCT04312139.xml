      AthenaValve aims to develop and initial validate a novel serum diagnostic kit, for the&#xD;
      assessment of severity and prognosis of progression of aortic valve stenosis (AS, a&#xD;
      devastating disease without early diagnosis and medical treatment). Two independent clinical&#xD;
      cohorts of patients will provide serum samples, along with tissue and serum of a validated&#xD;
      animal model of the disease for evaluation of the early stages, in order to develop and&#xD;
      validate a multiplexed Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay kit (multiplex ELISA). Advanced&#xD;
      bioinformatics analysis will facilitate the selection of most promising molecules from&#xD;
      integrated proteomics-transcriptomics-metabolomics data. The novel biomarkers will help&#xD;
      clinicians to early diagnose patients at high risk and will pave the way for the experimental&#xD;
      implementation of promising pharmaceutical therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The deposition of calcium salts in the arterial wall and the heart valves is a commonly&#xD;
      occurring phenomenon associated with increasing age and various pathological factors. A&#xD;
      particular case is the calcification of the aortic valve, which is accompanied by gradual&#xD;
      stenosis leading to heart failure. As a result, causes significant morbidity and a dramatic&#xD;
      increase in mortality if not treated surgically or via transcatheter intervention. It affects&#xD;
      approximately 2% of the population over the age of 65, being the third cause of death in this&#xD;
      population. It numbers about 100 surgeries per 100,000 person-years in the decade and 180000&#xD;
      patients each year are candidates for percutaneous aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in the&#xD;
      US, Canada, and European Union.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristic of the disease is that it remains even today without a diagnosis at the&#xD;
      critical early stages and all existing therapies have failed to slow or reverse the damage&#xD;
      when applied in the final stages. Previous experimental studies suggested that existing drugs&#xD;
      may be more effective if given early in the disease course. At the time when the aortic&#xD;
      stenosis becomes evident on echocardiography or Computerized Tomography (CT), underlying&#xD;
      biochemical and molecular lesions have already developed. Moreover, among the aortic valve&#xD;
      stenosis patients, it is unknown who will rapidly evolve to a dynamic narrowing of the valve&#xD;
      and previous research studies report significantly diverse progression rates among patients,&#xD;
      with approximately 20-25% demonstrating more than double rates. Thus, the Achilles heel of&#xD;
      the therapeutic management of patients is the lack of early diagnosis and disease progression&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under a combination of pathological effects by factors such as hypertension, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus and dyslipidemia in patients with a possible genetic predisposition, impairment of&#xD;
      the normal structure and function of endothelium occurs, which progressively leads to the&#xD;
      disease of the underlying valve tissue. Local acidosis and accumulation of oxidative oxygen&#xD;
      radicals cause damage to membrane phospholipids, oxidation of cholesterol and proteins, which&#xD;
      lose their normal quaternary structure and degrade. The gradual deposition of phosphate and&#xD;
      calcium carbonate salts over the pathological proteins leads to calcification of the valve&#xD;
      tissue. Intense inflammatory reaction with activation of bone marrow and infiltration of&#xD;
      tissue with immunocompetent cells accompanies the damage: macrophages, B and T lymphocytes,&#xD;
      mast cells infiltrate and actively contribute to the disease. Within this environment,&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines secreted from the inflammatory cells lead to activation of embryonic&#xD;
      cell pathways that help to further enhance the calcification through the conversion of&#xD;
      resident fibroblasts to active osteoblasts, which actively deposit calcium salts through&#xD;
      extracellular vesicles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the disease, multiple cell types and distant organs are involved (liver - cholesterol&#xD;
      metabolism, spleen and bone marrow - immune response activation) and the damage is expected&#xD;
      to release fragments of biological and biochemical substances in the blood circulation.&#xD;
      Hence, the disease is expected to be reflected in changes in serum protein and. It is&#xD;
      possible to detect proteins and metabolites in the blood serum in appropriately selected&#xD;
      patients, prospectively enrolled and monitored through the course of aortic valve stenosis.&#xD;
      An optimal subgroup description of patients with rapid or slow disease progression can reveal&#xD;
      important information for future clinical diagnostic and prognostic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of Athena Valve are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (A) Collection of data on the progression of calcification and aortic valve stenosis,&#xD;
      description of subpopulations with rapid and slow progression and record of clinical events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (B) The bioinformatics analysis of data from combined transcriptomics-metabolomics-proteomics&#xD;
      of diseased animal model aortic valve tissue in the early, intermediate and final stages, in&#xD;
      comparison with existing patient multi-omics databases, in order to investigate candidate&#xD;
      molecules - &quot;drivers&quot; of the damage with a causal relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (C) The differential proteomic analysis of patient sera samples with severe aortic valve&#xD;
      stenosis, retrospectively defined as rapid versus slow disease progressors and control group&#xD;
      of individuals without aortic valve stenosis and severe calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (D) The differential metabolomic analysis of patient sera samples with severe aortic valve&#xD;
      stenosis, retrospectively defined as rapid versus slow disease progressors and control group&#xD;
      of individuals without aortic valve stenosis and severe calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (E) The integrated bioinformatics data analysis of differential patient serum proteome and&#xD;
      metabolome enriched with the results of the animal model and existing databases from other&#xD;
      patients, to determine the most probable - causally related molecules with disease&#xD;
      progression in a molecular network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (F) Utilization of the more important protein targets for the development of a novel&#xD;
      detection assay for multiple protein targets in blood serum by multiplex ELISA based on the&#xD;
      results of the bioinformatics analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (G) Application of the new assay multiplex ELISA in paired serum samples of patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe aortic stenosis and control group of individuals without aortic valve&#xD;
      stenosis and severe calcification, prospectively enrolled and monitored, initial validation&#xD;
      of the assay and review of its diagnostic performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two independent clinical cohorts will provide necessary data and serum samples. The first, a&#xD;
      retrospective cohort of patients with severe aortic valve stenosis will define serum,&#xD;
      echocardiographic and clinical differences among subgroups with different progression rates.&#xD;
      The second cohort, prospectively developed, will confirm the retrospectively obtained&#xD;
      clinical and echocardiographic data and provide baseline and follow-up measurements of aortic&#xD;
      valve calcification (CT calcium score). Paired baseline and follow-up serum samples will&#xD;
      validate serum targets from the retrospective cohort. Patients will be assessed with&#xD;
      echocardiography annually and with follow-up CT at 2 and 5 years from enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective proteomics will be done with untargeted Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry&#xD;
      (LC/MS) and metabolomics with untargeted Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry&#xD;
      (LC-MS/MS) in Serial Reaction Monitoring (SRM) mode. Prospective proteomics and metabolomics&#xD;
      will be quantitative and targeted. Blood samples will be immediately frozen and stored to -80&#xD;
      C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For pathophysiological enrichment, a modified New Zealand rabbit model for aortic stenosis&#xD;
      will be used in a longitudinal protocol of tissue harvesting in the early, intermediate and&#xD;
      late-stage disease (corresponding to inflammation - calcification and subsequent valve&#xD;
      stenosis).&#xD;
