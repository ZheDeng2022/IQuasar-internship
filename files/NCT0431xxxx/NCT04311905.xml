    <textblock>
      Study is a Randomized clinical trial conducted at Endodontic department- Ain Shams university&#xD;
      Cairo. Egypt. 24 eligible patients were selected and included in the study to compare healing&#xD;
      ability of diode laser activated irrigation versus conventional root canal treatment using&#xD;
      CBCT&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sample size is 24 , 24 Patients were randomly distributed in 2 groups , one group of patients&#xD;
      received laser activated irrigation LAI during root canal treatment and the other group&#xD;
      received no treatment just conventional RCT. â€¢ Patients were equally divided into 2 groups&#xD;
      (n=12 in each group ) The study in a Single blinded RCT , Numbers for patients will be&#xD;
      generated and distributed randomly in a table on an Excel sheet, and in front of each number&#xD;
      either a letter (C) for control or (I) for intervention will be typed After patients were&#xD;
      selected in the study they will be asked to fill in a consent form , that states that they&#xD;
      are part of a clinical trial and that they may or may not receive a laser activated&#xD;
      irrigation Group A LAI :Disinfection were done by using 5 ml of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite&#xD;
      irrigation for 1 minute. Irrigation will be performed with a 30-gauge needle side vented The&#xD;
      irrigation needles were introduced passively up to 2 mm away the working length. After&#xD;
      irrigation Laser treatment will be performed with a diode laser, at a wavelength of 980 nm&#xD;
      with a repeated pulse mode using a pulse duration of 5sec per canal and a pulse interval of&#xD;
      0.2 ms. The laser irradiation were delivered for 1 minute into the canal up to 1 mm short of&#xD;
      the working length, with circling movements from the apical part moving towards the coronal&#xD;
      part Group B : received mock laser intervention , conventional Root canal treatment with 2.5%&#xD;
      sodium hypochlorite CBCT was taken pre-operative and another one was taken after 12 month ,&#xD;
      both volumetric and linear measurements were calculated&#xD;
