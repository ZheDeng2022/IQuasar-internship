  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, randomized, three-period, two-sequence crossover study&#xD;
      in healthy adult subjects to occur at one site in the United States. This study will evaluate&#xD;
      the relative Bioavailability (BA) of an enasidenib sprinkle formulation, compared to the&#xD;
      reference tablet formulation, when taken in the fasted state. This study will also evaluate&#xD;
      the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of the enasidenib sprinkle formulation after a single oral dose in&#xD;
      the fed state to assess the food effect. The study will consist of a Screening phase, a&#xD;
      Treatment phase, and a Follow-up phone call. Approximately 28 healthy adult subjects (males&#xD;
      or non-pregnant females) will be enrolled.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)1 may participate, providing they meet the&#xD;
             following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Agree to practice true abstinence2 from sexual intercourse or to use highly&#xD;

             and clinical laboratory evaluation (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis)&#xD;
             that are reasonably likely to interfere with the subject's participation in, or&#xD;
             ability to complete the study as assessed by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Subject vital signs are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Tympanic body temperature:35.0 - 37.5°C.&#xD;
