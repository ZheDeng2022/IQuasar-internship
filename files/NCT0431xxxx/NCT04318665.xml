    <textblock>
      Background: Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a principal cause of post-injury&#xD;
      hospitalization, disability, and death throughout the world. TBI is the leading cause of&#xD;
      death and disability among young healthy people under 45 years of age and is predicted to be&#xD;
      the most prevalent and costliest neurological condition in Canada through the year 2031.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TBI is commonly classified into mild, moderate, and severe categories using the Glasgow Coma&#xD;
      Scale (GCS), with &quot;severe TBI&quot; defined as a GCS score ≤ 8. Severe TBI is a clinical&#xD;
      emergency, during which the trauma team works swiftly to provide the appropriate care.&#xD;
      Outcome assessment after TBI is complex and is influenced by pre-injury and injury factors as&#xD;
      well as the patient's response at various stages of recovery. The first 48 hrs in hospital,&#xD;
      despite being the most resource-intensive period, unfortunately result in the highest&#xD;
      mortality. These patients are on life support at the time of their hospital admission and&#xD;
      adequate and reliable clinical examination is impossible. Thus, patients receive treatment&#xD;
      despite lack of a clear understanding of their prognoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Admission Computed Tomographic Perfusion (CTP) can diagnose brain death reliably&#xD;
      in severe TBI patients in early stage upon hospital admission, which is not recognised in the&#xD;
      usual clinical practice due to inadequate reliable clinical examination. In a small&#xD;
      prospective pilot study of 19 patients with severe TBI, admission CTP could predict early in&#xD;
      hospital mortality with 75% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive predictive value&#xD;
      (PPV) and 94% negative predictive value (NPV) and perfect inter-rater reliability (kappa=1).&#xD;
      We propose ACT-TBI study to evaluate CTP as a triage tool to diagnose early mortality at the&#xD;
      time of admission in patients with severe TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To validate admission CTP features of brain death, relative to the&#xD;
      clinical examination outcome, for characterizing early in-hospital mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: To establish the safety and interrater reliability of admission CTP.&#xD;

      Objectives of the ACT-TBI study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with severe TBI,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To validate admission CTP features of brain death, relative to the clinical examination&#xD;
           outcome, for characterizing early in-hospital mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish the safety and inter-rater reliability of features of brain death on&#xD;
           admission CTP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the determinants (age, sex, and GCS score) influencing the variability in&#xD;
           response of CTP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To establish the usefulness of CTP in facilitating timely organ transplantation, if&#xD;
           possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Method The ACT-TBI study is a prospective, multi-centre, cohort study in&#xD;
      patients with severe TBI and will be conducted in 4 different Canadian centres (Winnipeg,&#xD;
      Ottawa, Montreal, and Halifax) over the next 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients meeting eligibility criteria will be identified by a dedicated research nurse&#xD;
      with the help of the trauma team at the time of hospital admission, with the ACT-TBI study&#xD;
      protocol will be activated at the time of their first diagnostic imaging. A deferral of&#xD;
      consent will be obtained like that in the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Examination- The results of initial clinical, laboratory and imaging assessment will&#xD;
      be recorded as per the IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical&#xD;
      Trials in TBI) core and extended models. The clinical examination will occur during a&#xD;
      sedation hold, when possible acknowledging some confounding from effect of residual sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological Examinations Upon hospital admission, at the time of initial diagnostic imaging,&#xD;
      besides the standard diagnostic tests of whole-body CT scan, enrolled patients will undergo&#xD;
      the whole head imaging protocol with CTP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plain computed tomography (CT) of head: As a standard imaging protocol, plain CT of head will&#xD;
      be performed for severe TBI patients. These images will be assessed for the presence of&#xD;
      various lesions (subarachnoid hemorrhage, sub-dural hemorrhage, epidural hemorrhage,&#xD;
      intra-ventricular hemorrhage, cerebral contusions, and edema).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography perfusion (CTP): Besides, a standard imaging protocol, CTP imaging&#xD;
      protocol for whole head will be performed. Images will be acquired following our previously&#xD;
      published protocol. In brief, a total of 40 mL of CT contrast media will be injected at a&#xD;
      rate of 5 mL/sec. A set of axial images with a slice thickness of 5 mm for the perfusion&#xD;
      analysis will be reconstructed. CTP images will only be acquired. The anonymized images will&#xD;
      be transferred and stored in the secured imaging core lab, department of Radiology,&#xD;
      University of Manitoba, for processing and interpretation later. CTP will be processed using&#xD;
      a semiautomatic deconvolution algorithm on a vendor neutral software package (Oleasphere).&#xD;
      CTP will be assessed both quantitatively as well as qualitatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative assessment: brain death will be defined as Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) &lt;5&#xD;
           mL/100g/min and Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) &lt;2 mL/100g in the brainstem.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative assessment: brain death will be defined as matched decrease of CBF and CBV&#xD;
           in the brainstem. The perfusion maps for CBF and CBV will be assessed for binary outcome&#xD;
           of 'dead' or 'not-dead', according to our previously published methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perfusion images will be assessed by the two independent neuroradiologists, who are&#xD;
      blinded to the clinical status of the patient and also to each other's assessment. In case of&#xD;
      disagreement, the expert neuroradiologist opinion will be employed to have a consensus&#xD;
      agreement for the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-perfusion care: Since the prognostic value of CTP has not been established in patients&#xD;
      with severe TBI, the outcomes of CTP will not be made available to the clinical team involved&#xD;
      in patient care. All patients will receive the standard care.&#xD;
