      The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of sub-tenon aflibercept in&#xD;
      combination with either saline or hyaluronidase (HA) in patients with acute Thyroid Eye&#xD;
      Disease (TED) as assessed by the incidence and severity of adverse events from baseline to&#xD;
      day 45.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an exploratory investigation to evaluate use of sub-tenon injected HA or saline&#xD;
      followed by sub-tenon injection of 4 mg aflibercept for the treatment of acute thyroid&#xD;
      disease. The study will prospectively and sequentially enroll a total of twenty-four patients&#xD;
      who meet the study enrollment criteria and will be randomized to one of three treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1: Sub-tenon's injection of saline followed by injection of 4 mg aflibercept&#xD;
           (total volume 1.1 ml) in the worse eye&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2: Sub-tenon's injection of HA followed by injection of 4mg aflibercept (total&#xD;
           volume 1.1 ml) in the worse eye&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group 3: HA injection alone (total volume 1.1 ml) in the worse eye&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will receive bi-weekly sub-tenon injections on day 1, day 14 and day 28 for a&#xD;
      total of 3 treatments. Subjects will be followed for an additional 62 days (until the 90-day&#xD;
      visit) after the last injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of enrollment, patients will undergo a full ophthalmologic examination including&#xD;
      external photography, a 30-2 automated Humphrey visual field, intraocular pressure, ocular&#xD;
      motility and alignment, calculation of the CAS score, smoking status, measurement of blood&#xD;
      pressure, a pre-treatment CT scan, and laboratory work-up (including plasma testing of TSI,&#xD;
      thyroglobulin antibodies, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-8, IFN-g,&#xD;
      TNF-a, IL-1B, TGF-B) and a baseline measurement of systemic VEGF levels). The CAS is a&#xD;
      7-point clinical activity score and includes 1 point for the presence of each of the&#xD;
      following: Redness of eyelids, spontaneous pain, pain when moving the globe, redness of&#xD;
      conjunctiva, swelling of plica and/or caruncle, swelling of eyelid, and chemosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Careful clinical monitoring will follow initial injection including a complete re-evaluation&#xD;
      on day 4 (CAS, motility exam, photos, patient questionnaire, measurement of blood pressure,&#xD;
      and repeat thyroid antibody and cytokine levels). Patients will be re-evaluated in the same&#xD;
      way on day 14, day 28, day 45, and day 60. A post-treatment CT scan will be obtained at day&#xD;
      45. A long-term follow-up visit will occur at day 90.&#xD;

             participation in a clinical study&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Sexually active men* or women of childbearing potential** who are unwilling to&#xD;
             practice adequate contraception during the study (adequate contraceptive measures&#xD;
             include stable use of oral contraceptives or other prescription pharmaceutical&#xD;
             contraceptives for 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device&#xD;
             [IUD]; bilateral tubal ligation; vasectomy; condom plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or&#xD;
             jelly, or diaphragm plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly)&#xD;
