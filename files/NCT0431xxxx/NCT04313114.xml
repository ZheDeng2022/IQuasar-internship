  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will expand an existing, patient-centered, health literacy strategy to&#xD;
      promote longer-term adherence to colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in resource-limited, rural&#xD;
      health clinics via colonoscopy or annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT). In the proposed&#xD;
      2-arm study, both PRIME-CRC and enhanced usual care (control) will incorporate health&#xD;
      literacy evidence-based practices for delivering CRC patient information and counseling to&#xD;
      aid patient decision making for selecting FIT or colonoscopy, including simplified test&#xD;
      instructions. In addition, the PRIME-CRC arm will use a &quot;stepped care&quot; approach for reminding&#xD;
      patients on proper CRC screening preparation for scheduled colonoscopy or completion of&#xD;
      annual FIT. Patients in the PRIME-CRC arm will receive frequent follow-up contact from their&#xD;
      health care provider via audio-recorded, automated call or SMS text, based on patient&#xD;
      preference.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators will expand an existing, patient-centered, health literacy strategy to&#xD;
      promote longer-term adherence to colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in resource-limited, rural&#xD;
      health clinics via colonoscopy or annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Guided by recently&#xD;
      completed trials, the investigators will leverage consumer technologies that are now&#xD;
      available in rural areas and implement a multifaceted approach - designed for scale in&#xD;
      resource-limited federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). While significant gains have&#xD;
      been made to improve CRC screening, compliance with those guidelines is sub-optimal and&#xD;
      disparities remain. In particular, adults who receive care at rural FQHCs that have limited&#xD;
      resources struggle to initiate and maintain annual CRC screening via the most common method,&#xD;
      FIT. Over the past decade, this team has studied the effectiveness of specific interventions&#xD;
      to enhance initial and repeat CRC screening completion among lower income, lower health&#xD;
      literate, racially/ethnically diverse adults in rural FQHC settings. The majority of patients&#xD;
      will complete the initial test (67% - 69%), yet fewer (32% - 40%) complete an annual test in&#xD;
      years 2 and 3. This indicates a &quot;stepped care&quot; approach is needed to promote long-term CRC&#xD;
      screening. The investigators' rural health literacy interventions have until now been limited&#xD;
      to the FIT due to restrictions of state Medicaid coverage and clinical bandwidth of&#xD;
      colonoscopy services available to rural FQHCs. Changes to Medicaid have now expanded the&#xD;
      availability of colonoscopy. The investigators propose a novel intervention guided by&#xD;
      evidence learned from the investigators' previous studies and recent literature - the&#xD;
      Patient-Centered Reminders to Inform, Motivate, and Engage-CRC Screening (PRIME-CRC). In this&#xD;
      proposed 2-arm, randomized control trial (N=1200), both PRIME-CRC and enhanced usual care&#xD;
      arms will at point of care receive CRC patient information and counseling to aid patient&#xD;
      decision making for selecting FIT or colonoscopy utilizing core components including&#xD;
      evidence-based Health Literacy education and counseling, along with printed, simplified CRC&#xD;
      screening information and simplified test instructions. PRIME-CRC will additionally have a&#xD;
      &quot;stepped care&quot; approach for reminding patients on proper CRC screening preparation for&#xD;
      scheduled colonoscopy or completion of annual FIT. Patients in the PRIME-CRC arm will have&#xD;
      frequent follow-up with tailored contact via automated call or SMS text (based on patient&#xD;
      preference) from their healthcare provider (audio recorded or personalized text). The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be completion of either colonoscopy or annual FIT over 3 years. The specific&#xD;
      aims are to: test the effectiveness of the PRIME-CRC intervention to improve CRC screening&#xD;
      completion rates in rural FQHCs compared to enhanced usual care; investigate whether the&#xD;
      intervention can reduce CRC screening disparities by patient health literacy, race or sex;&#xD;
      determine the fidelity of PRIME-CRC components, and explore patient, provider, and healthcare&#xD;
      system barriers to implementation, and evaluate the cost associated with the intervention&#xD;
      from a FQHC perspective. This study extends this team's longstanding collaboration on health&#xD;
      literacy, health disparities, rural health and cancer screening.&#xD;

    <description>Screening Coordinator (SC) will give patients a plain language, literacy appropriate, actionable printed CRC screening handout emphasizing the benefits of CRC screening and screening options; using the low literacy handout as a teaching tool, the SC will briefly counsel patients on CRC screening options prior to seeing their healthcare provider, reviewing the benefits of each, as well as applicable costs. After reviewing the CRC screening pamphlets with a patient, the SC will use shared decision-making techniques using the study CRC materials to aid patients in selecting the test they prefer and that meets their needs - colonoscopy or FIT.</description>

    <description>Colonoscopy year 1: Will receive an automated call recording by PCP 48 hours after the clinic visit to remind them of their choice of colonoscopy; then, one week before the test reminding them to pick up the preparation kit. Those who chose SMS will receive a text message from their PCP with content similar to the voice call. A 3rd reminder call/text will be sent 2 days prior to the test. If no colonoscopy with 3 months, the clinical manager (CCM) will call to determine if they want to switch screening options. The CCM will discuss barriers and option of choosing FIT for 3 years. If they opt to change, they will be mailed a FIT with simplified instructions and then follow the FIT follow-up protocol.&#xD;
FIT year 1: Motivational reminders recorded by their PCP will be sent by automated call or text within 48 hours after the visit and again at 4, 8 and 12 weeks for those who have NOT completed the test. FIT will be mailed year 2 &amp; 3 - follow-up will follow same procedure as year 1.</description>
