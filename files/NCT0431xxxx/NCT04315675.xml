    <textblock>
      HIV is no longer a death sentence, and with adherence to Rapid High Activity Antiretroviral&#xD;
      (HAART) protocol women with HIV can achieve a normal life expectancy. In New Jersey there are&#xD;
      11,724 (32.9%) women living with HIV with Essex county in the lead, and they come they come&#xD;
      from lowest social strata and educational level and are often single mothers. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is test three study interventions: a cognitive health promotion intervention, a&#xD;
      guided imagery intervention and combination of both interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Significance of the study is to improve the functional health and protocol adherence, to&#xD;
      better enable women with HIV to achieve a normal life expectancy. The Methodology is an&#xD;
      intervention study that uses a classic four group pretest post-test experimental design with&#xD;
      random assignment, and the subjects for the study will be 80 women living with HIV. The&#xD;
      interventions will be delivered within a three-week time frame followed by post testing at&#xD;
      the end of the third week in Newark,New Jersey. The results of this study will be used as&#xD;
      preliminary data to support a grant proposal to be submitted to the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health. The Results of this study are important as they will support improved health function&#xD;
      and adherence to treatment protocols for marginalized poor women with HIV to achieve outcomes&#xD;
      on par with men.&#xD;

      Background: Among the more than one million persons in the United States living with&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS, women comprise approximately 25% or 280,000 of persons infected with HIV (CDC,&#xD;
      2015). According to The CDC (2015) in 2010 there were 7800 new cases of HIV in women.&#xD;
      Black/African American Women accounted for 5,300 of these women, followed by 1200&#xD;
      Hispanic/Latino women who were newly diagnosed with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women with HIV/AIDS in the United States largely come disproportionately from minorities&#xD;
      who are marginalized at the lowest strata of society with Black and Hispanic inner city women&#xD;
      accounting for approximately 80% of all cases.The fourth leading cause of death in Black&#xD;
      women, HIV/AIDs is a disease of poor women who count HIV as not the main problem, but one of&#xD;
      more than a dozen life challenges that they encounter in their day to day living. (Hansell,&#xD;
      Hughes, Caliandro, Budin,1999). HIV in women affects the entire family especially the&#xD;
      children of these women who lead a highly deprived and compromised life. The day to day&#xD;
      challenges that these women encounter to stay alive causes them to struggle to maintain their&#xD;
      own health with quality lives and to adequately provide for their children. By comparison men&#xD;
      with HIV tend to come from a higher social stratum have a higher level of educational and&#xD;
      professional attainment. The current treatment for HIV/AIDS is High Activity Antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (HAART) which provides a simple one pill regimen taken daily. This HIV regimen is&#xD;
      highly effective in reducing viral load and an increasing CD4 counts. The HIV disease process&#xD;
      is effectively managed by HAART and mitigates the progression of disease thus rendering it a&#xD;
      chronic disease state. With the effective management of HIV, it is critical for the person to&#xD;
      adhere to the HAART Protocol, as well as manage one's own health status through a better&#xD;
      understanding of health promotion and disease prevention. Purpose: The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to test interventions for women with HIV/AIDS aimed at improving their functional health&#xD;
      status and protocol adherence by promoting positive health behaviors enabling them to achieve&#xD;
      higher functional health. These results will be used as preliminary data for an NIH grant&#xD;
      proposal for a large-scale intervention study on the HAART protocol adherence and the&#xD;
      functional health of women with HIV/AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific aims for this study are focused on women living with HIV are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe patterns of health, wellness, protocol adherence CD4 counts, viral load and&#xD;
           Functional Health Status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the effect of a guided imagery intervention on HAART Adherence, Viral load, CD4&#xD;
           Counts and Functional Health Status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test the effect of a cognitive power intervention on HAART Adherence, Viral load, CD4&#xD;
           Counts and Functional Health and Functional Health Status..&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To test the effect of a combined guided imagery intervention in combination with&#xD;
           Cognitive Power Intervention on HAART adherence, Viral Load, CD4 Counts and Functional&#xD;
           Health Status&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome variables will be generated by the study measures and will include: CD4 counts;&#xD;
      Viral Load; the EF-36v2 Health Survey and the Power as Knowing Participation in Change&#xD;
      (PKPCT)Tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:Women living with HIV/AIDS are largely from medically under-served communities&#xD;
      and are primarily from minority populations. Women living with HIV/AIDS who are adhere to&#xD;
      their HIV treatment protocol need to make choices that promote their functional health and&#xD;
      prevent co-morbidity which will enable them to lead normal lives and become more productive&#xD;
      members of society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conceptual Framework: Barrett's Power as Knowing Participation in Change Theory provides the&#xD;
      framework for this study. Barrett &quot;Power is Knowing Participation in Change conveys the&#xD;
      notion that power is the capacity to participate knowingly in change which is manifest by&#xD;
      awareness, choices, freedom to act intentionally and involvement in creating change. The two&#xD;
      types of power are: power as control and power as freedom. The overall focus in this study is&#xD;
      to aid subjects to effectively deploy their power to best enable the best possible&#xD;
      achievement of improved health function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This study is a quantitative intervention study that tests and compares outcomes&#xD;
      of three interventions and a control group. The design is a classic pretest control group&#xD;
      design that includes three intervention groups that will be compared to a control group.&#xD;
      Within this design subjects are randomly assigned to one of the four study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group One R Pre-test X (Guided Imagery Intervention) Post Test n=20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group Two R Pre-test Y (Cognitive Power Intervention) Post Test n=20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group Three R Pre-test XY (Combination Intervention Post Test n=20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Control Group Post Test n=20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Number of Subjects 80&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Subjects are women with HIV who are compliant on a HAART treatment protocol. With&#xD;
      four groups a sample of 80 subjects is projected with 20 subjects per group. Subjects with&#xD;
      multi-system or debilitating complications, limited cognitive or language will be excluded&#xD;
      from the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumentation/ Study Measures: Background Demographic Questionnaire- baseline data&#xD;
      regarding age, sex, marital status, health status, HIV history, Family structure, treatment&#xD;
      plan. CD4 counts- CD4 measures CD4 cells that are in a human body. CD4 cells play an&#xD;
      important role in the immune system to infection. CD4( Cluster of Differential 4) counts&#xD;
      below 200 place an individual at high risk for serious illnesses. The normal CD4 count in HIV&#xD;
      sero-negative persons ranges between 460 and 1600. CD4 counts are standard in HAART&#xD;
      protocols. Viral Load- Viral load is a blood test that measures how much HIV is in a person's&#xD;
      body. Patients on HIV treatment protocol have been tested for viral load. SF-36v2 Health&#xD;
      Survey- The Optimum TM SF 36v2 Health Survey asks 36 questions to measure functional health&#xD;
      from the patient's perspective. The higher the score the higher the Health Function.The Power&#xD;
      as Knowing Participation in Change Tool (PKPCT is based upon the four dimensions of power&#xD;
      which are: awareness; choices:freedom to act intentionally and involvement in creating change&#xD;
      (Barrett, 2003). Power as knowing participation is being aware of what one is choosing to do,&#xD;
      and doing it intentionally. Awareness and freedom to act intentionally guide choices and&#xD;
      involvement in creating changes. Power is freedom to make aware choices for life situations&#xD;
      including health promoting changes. Free to act as one wishes is critical to power. Awareness&#xD;
      is the focusing of attention on what one perceives to exists. Choices are selections from&#xD;
      possibilities for participating in experiences Freedom to act intentionally is the experience&#xD;
      of one's capacity to do or bring about what one has in mind. Involvement in creating change&#xD;
      is innovative engagement in the unpredictable human-environment mutual process to actualize&#xD;
      some potential. The score range for each scale is 12-84 and for the total scale 48-336. Lower&#xD;
      scores indicate less power and higher scores indicate higher power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: After informed consent is obtained, subjects are randomly assigned to one of four&#xD;
      study groups. Baseline data are collected and for participants in the intervention groups&#xD;
      their assigned intervention begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Guided Imagery- is an intervention based on the mind body connection whereby&#xD;
      thoughts guide the imagination toward a relaxed and focused state. Sessions will be completed&#xD;
      for 21 consecutive days beginning at the baseline with measures again repeated 21 days post&#xD;
      baseline. The Cognitive Power Intervention on Health Function- The cognitive power&#xD;
      intervention on health function uses the subject's power profile to set attainable goals to&#xD;
      act intentionally to create specific changes in one's life aimed at the improvement of the&#xD;
      participants' Health Function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: The analysis will include both descriptive and multivariate analysis to&#xD;
      test for differences between study groups using the .05 level of significance to test for&#xD;
      differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results/Outcomes: These results will provide preliminary data for a large scale NIH grant&#xD;
      proposal. The study will determine if women living with HIV using study interventions are&#xD;
      able to achieve improved health function which ultimately will contribute an improved life&#xD;
      expectancy. These results can be useful as a model to improve health function in women with&#xD;
      chronic diseases (Diabetes, Cancer Cardiac etc.)&#xD;
