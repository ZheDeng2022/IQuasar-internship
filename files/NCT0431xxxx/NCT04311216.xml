  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to identify factors responsible for recurrent shoulder instability&#xD;
      in children. Shoulder instability, i.e. complete or partial dislocation of the shoulder&#xD;
      joint, is common in children, resulting in pain and disability. Recurrent instability can&#xD;
      damage the shoulder joint resulting in the premature development of arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation approaches are preferred over surgical methods for the growing child e.g.&#xD;
      physiotherapy to restore movement and prevent further instability. Existing rehabilitation&#xD;
      procedures are based on addressing factors assumed to be responsible for instability e.g.&#xD;
      physiotherapists may try to increase shoulder stability by building up the shoulder muscles&#xD;
      to compensate for the damaged ligaments. It is evident however that the mechanisms of&#xD;
      shoulder instability are not well understood, as failure rates for physiotherapy are high,&#xD;
      with 70% - 90% of children continuing to suffer recurrent instability. This is an&#xD;
      observational, cross-sectional study of children (aged 8 to 18) presenting with shoulder&#xD;
      instability of any origin, traumatic or atraumatic (n=15) and an age-matched sample (n=15)&#xD;
      with no history of shoulder problems. Muscle activity and movement pattern differences will&#xD;
      be measured using non-invasive 3D motion capture and surface electromyography, to identify&#xD;
      factors responsible for instability. Only a single visit to the site will be required (The&#xD;
      Orthotic Research &amp; Locomotor Assessment Unit (ORLAU) based at The Robert Jones &amp; Agnes Hunt&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in Oswestry.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If investigators better understand the mechanisms associated with instability, physiotherapy&#xD;
      interventions to reduce dislocations and disability can be better targeted. If specific&#xD;
      patterns of activity associated with instability are identified, these could be addressed&#xD;
      through personalised and improved exercise prescription and rehabilitation. Additionally,&#xD;
      causes of instability for which physiotherapy may not be appropriate may be identified,&#xD;
      therefore ensuring patients are referred to the correct service in a timely manner, improving&#xD;
      patient outcomes and allocating physiotherapy resources more appropriately. Participants will&#xD;
      be recruited from musculoskeletal/orthopaedic outpatient clinics. This study is funded by the&#xD;
      Private Physiotherapy Education Foundation.&#xD;

        will include children with (shoulder instability participants) and without shoulder&#xD;
        instability (age matched contols).&#xD;
