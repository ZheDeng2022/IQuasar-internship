      This is an open-label, multi-center, phase I study designed to assess the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose of ribociclib and belinostat in combination. The trial will open with a dose escalation&#xD;
      followed by an expansion cohort at the identified dose. Dose escalation will be open to the&#xD;
      enrollment of patients diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer or ovarian cancer. Dose&#xD;
      expansion will only be open to patients diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that ribociclib plus belinostat will be a well-tolerated and demonstrate&#xD;
      activity in women with metastatic triple-negative breast or recurrent ovarian cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial combines two targeted agents, a CDK inhibitor and a lysine deacetylase (DAC)&#xD;
      inhibitor for use as the first targeted treatment for metastatic triple-negative breast&#xD;
      cancer. This in itself would be a leap forward for women who currently endure sequential&#xD;
      treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapies. However, we will also be using samples from this&#xD;
      trial in NIH-funded research on clonal evolution and geographic heterogeneity in breast&#xD;
      cancer. Blockade of CDK4/6 and of lysine deacetylases (DAC) are both promising treatments for&#xD;
      breast cancer. DAC inhibitors have been shown to have single-agent activity against&#xD;
      triple-negative breast cancer in vivo, possibly through decreasing EMT, decreasing migration,&#xD;
      and decreasing metastasis [6, 7] CDK4/6 inhibitor monotherapy causes cell cycle arrest and&#xD;
      tumor regression in triple-negative breast cancer models. [8, 9] However, neither approach&#xD;
      has been successfully translated into clinical use as a monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several lines of evidence demonstrating that inhibiting DAC increases the&#xD;
      sensitivity of breast cancer to CDK4/6 inhibition. Recently, we showed that inhibitors of&#xD;
      cell cycle progression, including CDKN1A, CDKN1C, CDKN2B, and CDKN2D, are increased by DAC&#xD;
      inhibition in breast cancer cell lines, including triple-negative cell lines. [10] Others&#xD;
      have shown cell cycle arrest by DAC inhibitors due to increases in p21 or decreases in CDK2&#xD;
      and cyclin A. [11-13] We also see an increase in RB1 expression in breast cancer cell lines.&#xD;
      In the TCGA breast cancer analysis, RB1 was frequently down-regulated but not mutated or lost&#xD;
      in triple-negative breast cancer. [14] Therefore, we hypothesized that DAC inhibition would&#xD;
      increase the sensitivity of breast cancer to CDK4/6 inhibition. We first tested this&#xD;
      hypothesis in a small panel of cell lines. We showed and published that all showed synergy&#xD;
      between a CDK4/6 inhibitor (PD-0322991) and DAC inhibitors. [10] Since then, we have tested&#xD;
      the combination of the DAC inhibitor vorinostat and the CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-322991 in a&#xD;
      larger panel of cell lines and have shown at least additivity in most triple-negative cell&#xD;
      lines. Indeed, it seems that those cancers least sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition may benefit&#xD;
      the most from co-treatment with a DAC inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, we investigated ribociclib and belinostat in six triple-negative breast cancer cell&#xD;
      lines. All 6 cell lines showed growth inhibition with belinostat and panobinostat. Synergy&#xD;
      was seen in four of the six cell lines at multiple doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have also recently completed an analysis on a window of opportunity trial of the DAC&#xD;
      inhibitor high-dose valproic acid, in breast cancer.[15] In that study, women were treated&#xD;
      with valproic acid for one week before definitive therapy began. Fifty percent of women with&#xD;
      triple-negative breast cancers had a significant decrease in Ki-67 with one week of valproic&#xD;
      acid, providing proof of principle biologic activity of DAC inhibition in triple-negative&#xD;
      breast cancer. (By contrast, no HER2 positive tumor had a decrease in Ki-67 with valproic&#xD;
      acid treatment.) Given the genomic similarities between serous ovarian cancer and&#xD;
      triple-negative breast cancer seen in the TCGA and pan-cancer analyses [16], we have chosen&#xD;
      to include ovarian cancers in the dose-escalation component to increase accrual rate but not&#xD;
      in the dose-expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither CDK4/6 inhibition nor DAC inhibition have a well-defined predictive biomarker to&#xD;
      determine which cancers will respond and which will not. Because of the complex genomic&#xD;
      effects of inhibition of the 11 DACs and the multiple targets of DACs, including histones,&#xD;
      p53, etc, it is unlikely that a single gene or protein alteration will predict sensitivity.&#xD;
      We have published a method for predicting sensitivity to targeted drugs using genome-wide&#xD;
      gene expression analysis. [17] After demonstrating proof of principle by accurately&#xD;
      predicting sensitivity to vemurafenib, we developed a genomic biomarker for the DAC inhibitor&#xD;
      valproic acid. We then validated that this biomarker predicted sensitivity in vitro and in&#xD;
      vivo. In the window of opportunity discussed above, our genomic signature had an AUC of 0.66&#xD;
      for predicting decreased Ki-67 with one week of treatment with valproic acid. We will develop&#xD;
      a similar multi-gene gene expression based biomarker for the combination of ribociclib and&#xD;
      belinostat.&#xD;
