  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) for epilepsy has yet to be thoroughly&#xD;
      investigated. Hence, the aim of the present study is to examine the effects of MBI on the&#xD;
      psychological wellbeing of people with epilepsy (PWE) using a randomized trial design. Key&#xD;
      outcomes include depression, anxiety and quality of life. Our primary objective was to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of mindfulness-based therapy on anxiety, depression, epilepsy specific&#xD;
      QOL, and life satisfaction in PWE, applying the concept of Reliable Change Index. The&#xD;
      secondary objective was to assess whether the results correlate with the level of&#xD;
      mindfulness. Study results may be used to decide whether it is worth offering mindfulness&#xD;
      training for PWE as an alternative therapy to cope and improve seizure management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a debilitating condition characterized by sudden recurrent episodes of epileptic&#xD;
      seizures. Psychiatric comorbidities are common in people with epilepsy (PWE), and the&#xD;
      presence is associated with increased rates of suicide, healthcare costs, mortality and&#xD;
      reduced quality of life. Studies showed that poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has&#xD;
      been linked to seizure frequency, medication side effects, psychological disturbances and&#xD;
      psychosocial difficulties. Medical therapies aside, psychological interventions like&#xD;
      mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) were proven effective in improving psychological&#xD;
      health as well as seizure control. Recent review was conducted to determine the efficacy of&#xD;
      MBIs for PWE. Although promising results showed reduction in levels of psychological distress&#xD;
      and improvement in quality of life, the extracted findings were based on three articles which&#xD;
      limit the applicability of the findings. More research focusing on MBIs for PWE are required&#xD;
      to make comparisons on its beneficial effects. Hence, this present study aimed to examine the&#xD;
      effects of MBI on psychological wellbeing among PWE using a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study trial recruits 30 participants with epilepsy. Participants are recruited from the&#xD;
      neurology outpatient treatment clinic and those who consented are randomized into either the&#xD;
      intervention active or no-intervention group. All participants receive six weekly-sessions of&#xD;
      mindfulness training that lasted for 2.5-hour. Assessments are conducted at three time-points&#xD;
      (T0: before intervention, T1: immediately after intervention, and T2: at the 6-weeks&#xD;
      followup). The following outcome measures assessing depression (BDI-II), anxiety (BAI),&#xD;
      quality of life (QOLIE-31), mindfulness (MAAS) and satisfaction with life (SWLS) are&#xD;
      collected at all three time-points.&#xD;
