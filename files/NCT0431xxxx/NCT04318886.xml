  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many of the 2.8 million family caregivers (FCGs) of persons with advanced cancer are&#xD;
      underserved, particularly African-Americans and rural-dwellers in the Southern U.S.. Most&#xD;
      have poor access and awareness of community-based palliative care services and have received&#xD;
      no formal support or training despite providing assistance to their relatives an average of 8&#xD;
      hrs/day. Providing intense care and witnessing a close friend or family member struggle with&#xD;
      advanced cancer can result in FCGs experiencing marked distress, particularly as their care&#xD;
      recipients near end of life (EOL). Reports from NCI and NINR caregiving summits, systematic&#xD;
      reviews, and the National Academy of Medicine have highlighted major limitations of cancer&#xD;
      caregiver interventions, including a lack of attention to underserved populations and cost,&#xD;
      poor scalability, over reliance on highly-trained professionals (e.g., nurses, psychologists,&#xD;
      behavioral therapists), lengthy sessions over a short duration, and a lack of demonstrated&#xD;
      impact on patient outcomes and healthcare utilization. To address this gap, the investigators&#xD;
      have developed and tested feasibility and acceptability of a lay navigator-led early&#xD;
      palliative care intervention called ENABLE Cornerstone for rural and minority family&#xD;
      caregivers of persons with advanced cancer in the Southern U.S.. Evolving out of the team's&#xD;
      prior trials and community stakeholder formative evaluation work, this multicomponent&#xD;
      intervention is based on Pearlin's Stress-Health Process Model where lay navigators, overseen&#xD;
      by an interdisciplinary outpatient palliative care team, employ health coaching techniques&#xD;
      and caregiver distress screening to behaviorally activate and reinforce psychoeducation on&#xD;
      managing stress and coping, getting and asking for help, improving caregiving skills, and&#xD;
      decision-making/advance care planning over 6 brief in-person/telephonic sessions plus monthly&#xD;
      follow-up from diagnosis through early bereavement. This proposed hybrid type I randomized&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation trial will determine whether ENABLE Cornerstone compared to&#xD;
      usual care can improve family caregiver (Aim 1) and patient outcomes (Aim 2) and will&#xD;
      evaluate implementation costs, cost effectiveness and healthcare utilization (Aim 3), over 24&#xD;
      weeks with 294 family caregivers and their patients with newly-diagnosed advanced cancer. To&#xD;
      maximize recruitment, the investigators will recruit from two community cancer centers in&#xD;
      Birmingham, AL and Mobile, AL. Our theory-driven, standardized approach is innovative because&#xD;
      it uses lay navigators in collaboration with a palliative care interdisciplinary team to&#xD;
      promote caregiver activation, skills and knowledge enhancement, as opposed to other&#xD;
      difficult-to-implement intervention models that rely mostly on delivery of services by&#xD;
      advanced practice professionals providing lengthy sessions over a short duration. If&#xD;
      effectiveness is established, the ENABLE Cornerstone intervention offers a highly scalable&#xD;
      and reproducible model of formal caregiver support that would be primed for dissemination and&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This hybrid type I randomized effectiveness-implementation trial is designed to answer the&#xD;
      question &quot;Is ENABLE Cornerstone efficacious in enhancing caregiver and patient outcomes?&quot; The&#xD;
      primary aims are to assess the effectiveness of ENABLE Cornerstone over 24 weeks (Primary and&#xD;
      Secondary Aim). The investigators will also explore implementation cost and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness, including healthcare utilization (Aim 3) and other potential&#xD;
      mediator/moderator effects of the intervention on coping, social support, and preparedness&#xD;
      (Exploratory Aim). The study will recruit 294 family caregivers over the age of 21 reporting&#xD;
      that they are the primary unpaid provider of support to a close family member or friend who&#xD;
      has been newly-diagnosed with an advanced stage cancer within the past 60 days. Half of the&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to ENABLE Cornerstone (n=147) which consists of 6 brief,&#xD;
      weekly in-person/telephone sessions followed by monthly follow-up every 4 weeks as needed by&#xD;
      participants. The other half will be assigned to a usual care condition (n=147). The&#xD;
      randomization scheme, stratified by site (UAB and MCI) in block lengths of 8, will be&#xD;
      executed in REDCap, a clinical trials management software program using a computer-generated&#xD;
      algorithm. Assessments will be administered via telephone, by a research coordinator blind to&#xD;
      group assignment. Participants will complete outcome assessments upon enrollment (T1) and at&#xD;
      12 (T2), 24 (T3) and every 12 weeks thereafter. The T2 assessment captures the short-term&#xD;
      outcomes of the most intensive part of the intervention. The T3 assessment will capture the&#xD;
      long-term outcomes of the intervention. Subsequent assessments explore the sustained effect&#xD;
      of ENABLE Cornerstone at the patient's end-of-life and post death. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      whether the intervention affects the &quot;slope&quot; of FCG distress at 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intention to treat (ITT) approach will be used for all analyses. That is, all caregivers&#xD;
      and patients will be included in their respective assigned conditions, regardless of their&#xD;
      degree of participation in the study. Primary data analysis will begin with descriptive&#xD;
      statistics for baseline caregiver and patient characteristics and outcomes. The investigators&#xD;
      will examine balance between study groups with respect to baseline characteristics using&#xD;
      effect sizes such as the standardized mean difference for numerical variables and Cramer's V&#xD;
      for categorical variables. Conceptually relevant baseline factors showing non-trivial&#xD;
      imbalances between groups will be then used as adjusting covariates in the longitudinal group&#xD;
      comparisons. Distributional assumptions will be examined and, when appropriate, we will&#xD;
      employ inferential and modeling procedures robust to distributional assumptions such as&#xD;
      normality. Patterns of missing data will be examined and whether baseline characteristics are&#xD;
      associated with dropout. Conceptually relevant baseline factors predictive of dropout will&#xD;
      then be used as adjusting covariates in the longitudinal group comparisons. Mixed-effect&#xD;
      modeling techniques and covariate adjustment will reduce the impact of missing data, as the&#xD;
      missingness is not assumed completely at random (MCAR) but conditionally (on the covariates)&#xD;
      at random (i.e., MAR, a milder assumption). We will use the latest versions of SAS and R for&#xD;
      all analyses and reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For specific aims 1 and 2, a longitudinal model fitted with linear mixed methods will be used&#xD;
      for each outcome. The focus of inference will be the between-group difference in outcome&#xD;
      change from baseline over 12 and 24 weeks, modeled by a time by group interaction. A random&#xD;
      effect for subject will be fitted to account for covariance among repeated measures on the&#xD;
      same individuals. The fixed-effect part of the model has the form:&#xD;
      Y=b_0+b_1∙Cornerstone+b_2∙Week12+b_3∙Week24+b_4∙Cornerstone×Week12+b_5∙Cornerstone×Week24,&#xD;
      where Y ̂ is the expected value (i.e., the mean) of the outcome according to the predictor&#xD;
      combinations, Cornerstone is a binary indicator of group assignment (1=ENABLE Cornerstone,&#xD;
      0=usual care), and Week24 and Week12 are binary indicators of the follow-up time points. For&#xD;
      the usual care group, the mean outcome at baseline is estimated by the b_0 coefficient, the&#xD;
      mean outcome at Week 12 is estimated by b_0+b_2, and the mean outcome at Week 24 is estimated&#xD;
      by b_0+b_3. For the ENABLE Cornerstone group, the mean outcome at baseline is estimated by&#xD;
      b_0+b_1, the mean outcome at Week 12 is estimated by b_0+b_1+b_2+b_4, and the mean outcome at&#xD;
      Week 24 is estimated by b_0+b_1+b_3+b_5. The overall treatment effect, ∆, will be computed as&#xD;
      the average between-group difference in change from baseline (averaged over Week 12 and Week&#xD;
      24) estimated with a linear contrast, ∆ =(1⁄2)∙(b_4+b_5). From the perspective of&#xD;
      significance testing, the test for the interaction effect, a 2-degree of freedom test, is the&#xD;
      test of difference in change from baseline between the study groups (since the groups are&#xD;
      randomized and the mean outcome at baseline should be similar). If necessary, the team will&#xD;
      conduct covariate adjustment for baseline factors unbalanced between the groups or predictive&#xD;
      of dropout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For specific aim 3, this within-trial analysis will be conducted separately from the&#xD;
      perspectives of healthcare payers and FCGs and patients following current recommendations.&#xD;
      Because the ENABLE Cornerstone intervention potentially affects FCG and patient distress and&#xD;
      QOL and, by consequence, potentially affects healthcare utilization and costs, upfront&#xD;
      implementation costs will be weighed against potential savings in healthcare costs and&#xD;
      effectiveness measured by improvements in quality of life adjusted years (QALY) over the&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;
