  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, non-blinded, multi-center, non-inferiority trial designed&#xD;
      to compare effectiveness and side-effects of methotrexate versus prednisolone as first-line&#xD;
      therapy for pulmonary sarcoidosis..&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a multisystem, granulomatous disorder, most commonly affecting the lungs.&#xD;
      Symptom burden is high, and quality of life (QoL) and social participation are negatively&#xD;
      affected. In patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, treatment is recommended in case of&#xD;
      significant symptoms and/or impaired or deteriorating lung function. Evidence-based treatment&#xD;
      recommendations are limited, outdated and largely based on expert opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prednisone is currently the first-choice therapy in pulmonary sarcoidosis and leads to&#xD;
      short-term improvement of lung function. Unfortunately, prednisone has major side-effects and&#xD;
      is associated with impaired QoL. Methotrexate is presently considered second-line therapy,&#xD;
      and appears to have fewer side-effects. The investigators hypothesize that first-line&#xD;
      treatment with methotrexate is as effective as prednisone, with fewer side-effects and better&#xD;
      QoL.&#xD;

From these 5 answers an index value is derived between 0 and 1, with a higher value corresponding with a better QoL. In the valuation part the patients' general health status is evaluated using a VAS-score from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing a better QoL.</description>

    <measure>The EuroQol five dimensions 5-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 24 weeks after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will complete the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, a standardized instrument to measure health outcomes in two components: health description and valuation. It comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression on a 5-point scale. From these 5 answers an index value is derived between 0 and 1, with a higher value corresponding with a better QoL. In the valuation part the patients' general health status is evaluated using a VAS-score from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing a better QoL.</description>
