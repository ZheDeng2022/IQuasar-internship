      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proteus syndrome is a rare overgrowth disorder. Most people begin to have symptoms between 6&#xD;
      months and 2 years of age. There are very few living adults with this disease. There is also&#xD;
      no known treatment for it. Researchers want to see if a new drug can slow down or stop&#xD;
      overgrowth in people with Proteus syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The learn if miransertib is a safe and effective treatment for Proteus syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 3 and older with Proteus syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical checkup. They will answer questions about their&#xD;
      medical history and current health. They will have a physical exam with vital signs. They&#xD;
      will have an electrocardiogram to measure their heartbeat. They will give blood and urine&#xD;
      samples. They will repeat the screening tests during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take a miransertib pill once a day. They will bring their empty pill&#xD;
      bottles with them to the NIH when they visit. If they can t swallow a pill, researchers will&#xD;
      try to find other ways for them to take the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have X-rays, ultrasounds, and imaging scans. Photos may be taken of their&#xD;
      feet and other parts of the body that have or develop signs of Proteus syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have lung function tests to measure how much and how fast air moves out of&#xD;
      their lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete surveys about their levels of pain, physical functioning, and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have additional tests performed to assess their individual disease. They may&#xD;
      have consultations with other specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation lasts about 4 years. Participants will have 20 30 visits at the NIH.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Proteus syndrome is a rare mosaic overgrowth disorder caused by a somatic gain of function&#xD;
      variant, c. 49G&gt;A, p.(Glu17Lys) in the oncogene AKT1, encoding the AKT1 kinase. The disorder&#xD;
      is progressive, with high morbidity and mortality - there are very few living adults with&#xD;
      this disease. Tissues and cell lines from patients with Proteus syndrome harbor admixtures of&#xD;
      mutant alleles that ranged from &lt;1% - 50%. This variant causes constitutive activation of&#xD;
      AKT1, through Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation. This activation stimulates the AKT/PI3K&#xD;
      pathway, mediating processes including increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis.&#xD;
      The progressive nature of the disorder and the mechanism of disease (gain of function) make&#xD;
      AKT1 an excellent target for therapeutics, specifically repression. The AKT/PI3K pathway is&#xD;
      mutated in numerous cancers as well. Because it is commonly mutated in cancer, pharmaceutical&#xD;
      companies are interested in targeting this molecule with inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ArQule Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., has developed a small molecule, ARQ&#xD;
      092 [miransertib], that inhibits AKT, with an IC50 for AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 that is orders of&#xD;
      magnitude lower than other kinases. This agent has undergone significant development with&#xD;
      animal toxicity studies and is currently in phase I trials in adult participants with&#xD;
      different types of cancer. In addition, we have performed in vitrotesting with miransertib in&#xD;
      cells from patients with Proteus syndrome and demonstrated reduction in AKT1 phosphorylation&#xD;
      at doses in the range of achievable blood levels in humans with low toxicity. We have&#xD;
      completed a phase 0/I study of miransertib in adults and older children with Proteus syndrome&#xD;
      (NIH protocol 16-HG-0014). In this study, we demonstrated that 5 mg/m m^2/day was a&#xD;
      well-tolerated dose which resulted in tissue drug levels consistent with our pre-clinical&#xD;
      data-based pharmacodynamic target. As well, one of the participants from the phase I study&#xD;
      felt so strongly about the benefits of the drug, both from a pain relief standpoint plus&#xD;
      evidence of improvement in one of his skin lesions, that he and his family have requested&#xD;
      continuation of the drug in that trial, as was offered to participants who felt that they had&#xD;
      received significant benefit. This initial Cohort of participants was dosed at levels well&#xD;
      below those tested previously in the oncology setting. In summary, with our phase 0/1trial,&#xD;
      we gained invaluable experience with a number of therapeutic endpoints and showed some&#xD;
      evidence of efficacy in two of six participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We now propose a phase II non-randomized observation study assessing the efficacy of&#xD;
      miransertib through assessment of the hallmark skin lesion of Proteus syndrome, the&#xD;
      cerebriform connective tissue nevus (CCTN). The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the response rate of miransertib as measured by a change in CCTN lesion size&#xD;
      relative to total plantar area from baseline, using blinded independent central review of&#xD;
      lesional photography in at least 10 patients with Proteus syndrome (Cohort 1). Cohorts 2 and&#xD;
      3 will enroll up to 30 additional patients whose non-plantar CCTN Proteus syndrome-&#xD;
      associated lesions will be evaluated to address the secondary and exploratory study&#xD;
      objectives. All participants will be treated with miransertib in continuous, 28-day cycles.&#xD;
      Participants in Cohorts 1 and 2willreceivemiransertib at the starting dose of 15 mg/ m^2QD&#xD;
      for the first three cycles, and then the dose will be increased to 25mg/m^2QD, provided no&#xD;
      clinically significant drug-related toxicity is observed. Participants in Cohort 3 will&#xD;
      receive miransertib at the dose they were on at the time of enrollment if continuing use of&#xD;
      miransertib or at the starting dose for Cohorts 1 and 2 if resuming use of miransertib, not&#xD;
      to exceed 25 mg/m m^2QD. Safety and toxicity data will be gathered on all participants.&#xD;
      Participants will stay on treatment for up to 52 cycles. The final clinical safety follow-up&#xD;
      will be performed 30 days after the last dose.&#xD;
