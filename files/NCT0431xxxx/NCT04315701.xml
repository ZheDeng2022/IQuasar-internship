  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cemiplimab before surgery works in treating patients&#xD;
      with skin cancer that is high-risk and has not spread to other parts of the body (localized),&#xD;
      has come back locally (locally recurrent), or has spread regionally (regionally advanced),&#xD;
      and can be removed by surgery (resectable). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      cemiplimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the pathological partial response (PPR) rate in patients with potentially&#xD;
      resectable cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) treated with neoadjuvant cemiplimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the pathological complete response rate (PCR). II. To estimate the Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version [v]1.1) 9 week objective response rate&#xD;
      (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the RECIST (v1.1) 12 month progression free (PFS). IV. To assess the&#xD;
      toxicity among patients with CSCC treated with neoadjuvant cemiplimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate tumor mutational burden (TMB) and correlate with response to PD-1 blockade&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate PD-L1 expression on CSCC tumor cells and correlate with response to PD-1&#xD;
      blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate CD8+ T cell infiltration into CSCC tumors and correlate with response to&#xD;
      PD-1 blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess other adaptive immune resistance mechanisms in CSCC tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cemiplimab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 21 days for up to 3 cycles (or up to 4 cycles for patients whose disease is&#xD;
      unresectable after 3 cycles) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Within 6 weeks of last dose of therapy, patients with potentially resectable tumors undergo&#xD;
      surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 24 months.&#xD;

             with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive pregnancy test, active pregnancy or nursing / breast-feeding, due to the&#xD;
