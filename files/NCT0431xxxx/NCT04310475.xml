  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People experiencing psychosis might find social interactions stressful and avoid them. This&#xD;
      can result in isolation and can affect relationships, employment and quality of life.&#xD;
      Improving social functioning is a really important aspect of recovery. Facing social&#xD;
      situations after the first episode of psychosis can be very difficult and provoke intense&#xD;
      anxiety. However, research has shown that the earlier intervention is offered, the better the&#xD;
      outcome. Therefore, improving therapies for people experiencing their first episode of&#xD;
      psychosis is a key target for research. Virtual Reality presents a unique opportunity to&#xD;
      bring real-life-type environments into a therapy session to help people to overcome their&#xD;
      distress in social situations and make them feel less anxious. Virtual Reality assisted&#xD;
      Therapy (VRT) provides a 'safe space' to practice strategies and techniques to help people&#xD;
      work towards improving their social functioning, build new ways of coping with stress and&#xD;
      assist them in their recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses a standard CBT model and integrates a Virtual Reality environment into it to&#xD;
      support exposure and behavioural experiments for social difficulties, which are a key&#xD;
      component of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be offered up to 10 sessions including a pre and post assessment session.&#xD;
      Each participant will set one or more SMART goals for therapy (e.g. be able to use public&#xD;
      transport, attend a social gathering or to feel less anxious in social situations) which are&#xD;
      worked on both in the therapy sessions and through homework tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study. The aim is to recruit between 6-10 participants to pilot the VRT&#xD;
      with. The results of this study will inform future research and practice, by helping to&#xD;
      assess if service-users find the new VRT acceptable (e.g. recruitment, retention, drop out&#xD;
      rates, participant experiences), and if it is effective (e.g. reduction in symptoms or&#xD;
      distress, and improvement in social functioning).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is really important that the clinical care of anyone who chooses to participate in the&#xD;
      study is not affected by their participation in this study. The researchers will work closely&#xD;
      with clinical teams to ensure this. Clients who engage with the study will still be eligible&#xD;
      for all aspects of TAU including psychological interventions, should this be appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VR technology and environment has been used extensively before in research studies, which&#xD;
      have proved that it is safe and effective. However, it has not been used within the NHS&#xD;
      context before or embedded within a therapy course before.&#xD;
