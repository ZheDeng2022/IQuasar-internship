    <textblock>
      Real-CHOICE - designed as a prospective, longitudinal, observational, non-interventional&#xD;
      study - will investigate the attitude of patients and physicians towards IV (intravenous)&#xD;
      iron therapy in general and IIM (iron isomaltoside 1000) treatment particularly before and&#xD;
      after IIM treatment in iron deficient patients with or without anemia in the real-world&#xD;
      clinical setting after commercial availability of this product in Switzerland.&#xD;
