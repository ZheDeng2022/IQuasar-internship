  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Griseofulvin is an antifungal agent used in treatment of Dermatophytosis caused by&#xD;
      Microsporum spp. (species), Trichophyton spp., Epidermophyton spp., where topical therapy is&#xD;
      considered inappropriate or has failed. Approved dose of Griseofulvin in Adults (greater than&#xD;
      or equal to 50 kg) in India is 500 to 1,000 mg daily, but not less than 10 mg/kg bodyweight&#xD;
      daily. As per the World health organization (WHO) guidance, Griseofulvin belongs to&#xD;
      Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) Class 2 (&quot;low&quot; solubility-&quot;high&quot; permeability).&#xD;
      A Bioequivalence (BE) study will be conducted in India to estimate in vivo behavior&#xD;
      (Pharmacokinetic characteristics) of Griseofulvin 500 tablets and dose proportionality study&#xD;
      for Griseofulvin 250 mg and 500 mg tablets. This is an open label, randomized, balanced,&#xD;
      three treatment period, three sequence, single dose, crossover study that will evaluate the&#xD;
      bioequivalence of Griseofulvin tablets 500 mg test product (T1) versus Griseofulvin tablets&#xD;
      500 mg reference product (R) as well as dose proportionality of Griseofulvin tablets 250 mg&#xD;
      test product (T2) with Griseofulvin tablets 500 mg T1 in healthy, adult participants under&#xD;
      fed conditions. Eligible participants enrolled will be randomized to either of the three&#xD;
      treatment sequence periods, T1T2R, T2RT1 or RT1T2 according to 1:1:1 ratio. The total&#xD;
      duration of clinical phase will be approximately 20 days from Day-1 to Day 19 including a&#xD;
      washout period of at least 7 days (not more than 14 days) for each treatment period. A total&#xD;
      of 36 healthy, adult participants will be enrolled in this study and the above mentioned&#xD;
      doses of Griseofulvin will be administered under fed conditions. Participants will be&#xD;
      followed up 5 days after last dosing.&#xD;

    <description>Blood samples were collected to measure Cmax at indicated time-points. Pharmacokinetic parameters were measured using standard non-compartmental methods. For Griseofulvin 250 mg (T2), dose-normalized Cmax (observed value multiplied by 2) is reported. Adjusted geometric mean and standard error have been presented for all treatments. Adjusted geometric mean is the antilog (exponential) of the least squares mean of the log-transformed data. Statistical analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters was done using mixed model for evaluation of bioquivalence. Point estimate and 90% confidence interval for the ratio of geometric least square mean of the test Griseofulvin 500 mg (T1) to the reference Griseofulvin 500 mg (R) were calculated for Cmax to assess bioequivalence.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was an open label, randomized,3-treatment,3-period, single dose, crossover study. Bioequivalence between test Griseofulvin tablets (500 milligram [mg]) versus reference Griseofulvin tablets 500 mg and dose proportionality between test Griseofulvin tablets (250 mg and 500 mg) were evaluated in healthy adult participants under fed conditions.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 36 participants were enrolled and received study treatment. The study had 3 periods: Period 1 (Day -1 to Day 5), Period 2 (Day 7 to Day 12) and Period 3 (Day 17 to Day 22) with a washout of atleast 7 days (not more than 14 days) between two subsequent dosing days.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) for Griseofulvin</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected to measure Cmax at indicated time-points. Pharmacokinetic parameters were measured using standard non-compartmental methods. For Griseofulvin 250 mg (T2), dose-normalized Cmax (observed value multiplied by 2) is reported. Adjusted geometric mean and standard error have been presented for all treatments. Adjusted geometric mean is the antilog (exponential) of the least squares mean of the log-transformed data. Statistical analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters was done using mixed model for evaluation of bioquivalence.

        <title>Number of Participants With Abnormal Urinalysis Dipstick Results</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected to assess glucose, ketones, occult blood, protein, urobilinogen and bilirubin by dipstick method. The dipstick test gave results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results can be read as Negative, Trace, 1+, 2+ indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. Clinically acceptable range included 'negative' and 'trace' results. Number of participants with any abnormal urinalysis parameters are presented.</description>
