  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ICU patients often in a strong stress environment. Various invasive procedures such as wound&#xD;
      dressing change, sputum suction,Pull out the thoracic duct etc. At the same time, the&#xD;
      diseases and environmental factors caused patients anxiety, pain, delirium and even a series&#xD;
      of pathophysiological changes which harm life and safety. Fentanyl is an analgesic that acts&#xD;
      on central μ receptors, clinical practice had found that fentanyl could exert analgesic&#xD;
      effects, while it maybe affect patients' hemodynamics, breathing, and nervous system, which&#xD;
      caused hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, delirium and other adverse drug&#xD;
      reactions. These reactions prolonged the mechanical ventilation time and duration time of&#xD;
      patients in hospital, which impact the treatment effect and prognosis of patients.&#xD;
      Butorphanol tartrate is a new type of opioid receptor agonist and antagonist, which can&#xD;
      stimulate the κ receptor, and also certain stimulated and antagonised effects on the μ&#xD;
      receptor. It can be used for analgesia and sedation in patients of ICU. Previous studies&#xD;
      shown that butorphanol can inhibit the inflammatory response and effect myocardial&#xD;
      protective. The analgesic effect of butorphanol were equivalent to fentanyl in patients of&#xD;
      ICU, and the incidence of nausea and vomiting in participants with butorphanol less than&#xD;
      fentanyl. Therefore, the investigators speculate that the analgesia of butorphanol in ICU&#xD;
      patients may unexpected effects. However, butorphanol and fentanyl on the analgesic effect&#xD;
      and prognosis of patients with mechanical ventilation in ICU are lacking currently, and the&#xD;
      investigators no corresponding multi-center clinical study at home and abroad. The research&#xD;
      compare to the analgesic effect of butorphanol and fentanyl in critically ill patients with&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. Effects of butorphanol and fentanyl on mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      duration, sedation depth, duration time of patients in hospital, complications and mortality&#xD;
      in patients with mechanical ventilation. To analyze the high-risk factors affecting the&#xD;
      prognosis of patients with mechanical ventilation in ICU. Found more treatment measures for&#xD;
      analgesia of patients with mechanical ventilation in ICU.&#xD;

      For enrolled patients, the investigators required that inclusion criteria were informed&#xD;
      consent signed.The exclusion criteria were described in detail in the CRF standard. The&#xD;
      recruitment of patients into the group were conducted in each sub-center according to&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria. After the inclusion of patients will registed relevant information&#xD;
      according to the basic data table of patients, disease information table and baseline data&#xD;
      table, and then randomly divide the patients into groups by special statistician&#xD;
      (CRA/CRO).The relevant data in the clinical study were collected by specialized nurses or&#xD;
      data recording team.The daily statistical results need to record and dated by statisticians&#xD;
      in order to track the authenticity and reliability of the data. The statistician should&#xD;
      communicate with the doctor in charge about the situation out the trial plan during the&#xD;
      study. If there is any change in the test plan, it is necessary to mark the measures and&#xD;
      reasons for the change in detail, and sign the signature and date of the statistician and the&#xD;
      responsible doctor in the statistical table of the day. The recorded data of the study should&#xD;
      be updated with electronic documents. Statistical recorder of data need to make weekly&#xD;
      summary, summarize and submit the statistical data of last month at each sub-research center&#xD;
      at the beginning of each month, then the lead hospital will summarize and analyze the data.As&#xD;
      for the problems beyond the experimental schemes in the research process, each branch center&#xD;
      needs to discuss with the lead center. Every three months, progress meetings will be held to&#xD;
      discuss various problems in clinical research and to unify standards for related problems to&#xD;
      ensure the smooth progress of clinical research and the true reliability of experimental&#xD;
      results. SAS 9.4 software was used for statistical analysis. The analysis content included&#xD;
      subject distribution description, baseline index balance analysis, efficacy analysis and&#xD;
      safety analysis.The significance level of the statistical test was α=0.05. In the safety&#xD;
      analysis, the incidence of adverse events and adverse reactions was calculated and the&#xD;
      specific conditions of all subjects with adverse events were listed. The list of vital signs&#xD;
      and normal abnormalities in laboratory examination before and after medication was described,&#xD;
      and the specific conditions of subjects with abnormal conditions before and after treatment&#xD;
      and abnormal conditions before and after treatment were listed in detail.After completing the&#xD;
      statistical analysis, the statistical analyst should record the data and submit it to the&#xD;
      main researcher of the experiment to fill with the general analysis report. All cases,&#xD;
      whether observation or shedding, should be completed in accordance with the requirements of&#xD;
      &quot;case report form&quot;. The case report form were copied three copies with without carbon copy.&#xD;
      After the completion of data entry, the sponsor (the first copy), the unit in charge of the&#xD;
      clinical research (the second copy) and the clinical research unit (the third copy) shall&#xD;
      file it respectively.&#xD;
