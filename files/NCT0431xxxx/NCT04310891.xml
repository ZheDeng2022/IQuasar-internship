  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In radiotherapy, tumour tracking allows us to ensure the radiation beam is accurately&#xD;
      targeting the tumour while it moves in a complex and unpredictable way. Most tumour tracking&#xD;
      techniques require the implantation of fiducial markers around the tumour. Markerless Tumour&#xD;
      Tracking negates the need for implanted markers, enabling accurate and optimal cancer&#xD;
      radiotherapy in a non-invasive way.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will perform a phase I observational trial investigating the feasibility of the Markerless&#xD;
      Tumour Tracking technology. Markerless Tumour Tracking will be integrated with existing&#xD;
      treatment machines to provide real-time monitoring of tumour motion during treatment&#xD;
      delivery. Eligible patients are implanted with fiducial markers, which act as the ground&#xD;
      truth for evaluating the accuracy of Markerless Tumour Tracking. The patients will undergo&#xD;
      the current standard of care radiotherapy, with the exception that kilovoltage x-ray images&#xD;
      will be acquired continuously during treatment delivery and used to calculate online&#xD;
      Markerless Tumour Tracking. Markerless Tumour Tracking determines the mean tumour position&#xD;
      calculated over the most recent 15 seconds and displays shifts exceeding 3 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be a single-institution study recruiting only at RNSH Radiation Oncology&#xD;
      Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this trial investigates feasibility, our focus will be on estimating the proportion of&#xD;
      treatment time in which the Markerless Tumour Tracking is within acceptable limits.&#xD;
