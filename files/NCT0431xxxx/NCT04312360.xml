  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies have shown that patients with right-sided colon cancer have reduced&#xD;
      progression-free and overall survival compared to patients with left-sided colon cancer. At&#xD;
      the same time, patients with right-sided colon adenomas have a higher risk of developing&#xD;
      interval cancers after endoscopic mucosal resection. Dysbiosis and known bacterial drivers&#xD;
      play a significant role in the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer, and may contribute to the&#xD;
      growth of adenomas. Clinical studies have found biofilm formation and positive staining for&#xD;
      Fusobacterium nucleatum (FN) in almost all right-sided colon cancers and adenomas. The&#xD;
      composition of bacteria also in the normal mucosa in these two groups of patients has been&#xD;
      found to be different from healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic preoperative antibiotic local treatment of the biofilm and tumors would&#xD;
      theoretically result in decreased tumor mass, recovery of the mucosa, and a normalization of&#xD;
      the immune response in the treated section of the colon. The oral administration of the&#xD;
      antibiotic metronidazole in mice has shown to lower the tumor load (FN-positive xenograft&#xD;
      tumors) and decrease in intratumoral abundance of the pro-carcinogenic bacteria, FN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of local antibiotic treatment with&#xD;
      fosfomycin and metronidazole on tumor characteristics and the colonic biofilm in patients&#xD;
      with right-sided colon cancer or right-sided colon adenomas. This is a clinical&#xD;
      proof-of-concept intervention study, and the investigators are to our knowledge the first&#xD;
      group to look into local antibiotic treatment of biofilm in patients with colon cancer or&#xD;
      colon adenoma. It is based on a non-randomized trial design with an open label single group&#xD;
      assignment. There are two tracks depending on the pathology of the tumor: 1) patients with&#xD;
      right-sided colon cancer; 2a) patients with right-sided colon adenoma. The intervention is a&#xD;
      therapeutic endoscopy where the antibiotics fosfomycin and metronidazole are sprayed&#xD;
      throughout the right colon section from caecum to the right colon flexure (100ml of gel&#xD;
      contains 800mg of fosfomycin and 200mg of metronidazole). Patients will be included&#xD;
      prospectively from the surgical department of Herlev University Hospital and Zealand&#xD;
      University Hospital once having received oral and written information, followed by signing&#xD;
      the consent. There will be a retrospective cohort of patients with colon adenoma from 2018&#xD;
      (track 2b). The investigators will retrieve the archived adenoma tissue as control tissue. In&#xD;
      Clinical Trial, Track 1 and Track 2a will be registered as two different arms that use the&#xD;
      same intervention, but the results from each arm later on is going to be reported in separate&#xD;
      publications.&#xD;

      Background Dysbiosis and known bacterial drivers play a significant role in the&#xD;
      carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer. Among bacterial drivers, Fusobacterium nucleatum (FN)&#xD;
      and the formation of biofilm on the surface of the colonic epithelium are considered&#xD;
      pro-carcinogenic. The increased permeability of the mucosal layer and the invading bacteria&#xD;
      in the colonic crypts and submucosal space result in genetic and epigenetic changes along&#xD;
      with immune responses that are all important oncogenic factors. Clinical studies have found&#xD;
      biofilm formation and positive staining for FN in almost all right-sided colon cancers and&#xD;
      adenomas. Two studies compared the bacterial growth in normal mucosa from patients with and&#xD;
      without adenoma. They found a different composition of bacteria in the normal mucosa from&#xD;
      patients with adenomas in terms of richness, diversity and bacterial strains, thus indicating&#xD;
      that the bacterial composition in the gut could contribute to the growth of adenomas and&#xD;
      subsequently, adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic preoperative local antibiotic treatment of the biofilm and tumors would&#xD;
      theoretically result in decreased tumor mass, recovery of the mucosal layer, and a&#xD;
      normalization of the immune response in the treated section of the colon. The oral&#xD;
      administration of the antibiotic metronidazole in mice has already been shown to decrease&#xD;
      tumor growth (FN-positive xenograft tumors) as well as a decrease in intratumoral FN&#xD;
      abundance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Medicinal Products In this study a gel containing the antibiotics fosfomycin&#xD;
      and metronidazole will be sprayed endoscopically on the mucosa of the right hemicolon. The&#xD;
      gel will be prepared on site by combining solutions of fosfomycin and metronidazole with a&#xD;
      gel-forming gum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of local antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment with fosfomycin and metronidazole on tumor characteristics and the colonic biofilm&#xD;
      in patients with right-sided colon cancer or right-sided colon adenomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This study is a clinical proof-of-concept intervention study. It is based on a&#xD;
      non-randomized trial design with an open label single group assignment. There are two tracks&#xD;
      depending on the pathology of the tumor: track 1, patients with right-sided colon cancer;&#xD;
      track 2a, patients with right-sided colon adenoma. The intervention is a therapeutic&#xD;
      endoscopy where the antibiotics fosfomycin and metronidazole are sprayed throughout the right&#xD;
      colon section from caecum to the right colon flexure in a gel-forming mixture. Patients will&#xD;
      be included from the surgical department of Herlev Hospital and Zealand University Hospital.&#xD;
      There will be a retrospective cohort of patient with colon adenoma, track 2b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect parameters For patients with right-sided colonic carcinomas and/or adenomas, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that endoscopic, preoperative antibiotic treatment in the right&#xD;
      colon with a gel-forming spray containing fosfomycin and metronidazole will result in&#xD;
      normalization of the colonic epithelium and immune response as well as a reduction in colonic&#xD;
      biofilm formation often seen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial structure and responsibilities The principal investigator (Astrid Bennedsen) is&#xD;
      responsible for the preparation of the protocol, the Case Report Forms (CRFs), coordinating&#xD;
      any meetings of the safety data monitoring committee as well as implementing decisions in the&#xD;
      daily operations of the trial. Along with a team of co-investigators, the principal&#xD;
      investigator will do the screening, recruitment, data collection and writing of the CRFs. The&#xD;
      safety data monitoring committee consists of three members and will be impartial. They will&#xD;
      overview the progress and the safety of the trial. The meetings of the safety data monitoring&#xD;
      committee will take place every six months, but an extra meeting will be held in case of any&#xD;
      severe adverse events or any other serious incidents during the trial. The trial will be&#xD;
      monitored by a local GCP unit. The funding source had no role in the design of this study and&#xD;
      will not have any role during its execution, analyses, interpretation of the data, or&#xD;
      decision to submit results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rules In case of serious side effects or adverse events, the data will be monitored&#xD;
      and the trial stopped if there is any evidence of lack of safety regarding the intervention&#xD;
      and the study drugs. Included are unexpected complications in relation to colon cancer&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study course This study has two tracks depending on the pathology of the colon tumor. When&#xD;
      colon cancer is suspected, patients are referred to a colonoscopy during which biopsies are&#xD;
      taken to confirm pathology indicating adenocarcinoma or benign pathology. There is a&#xD;
      retrospective track 2b, where the investigators will retrieve FFPE adenoma tissue from up to&#xD;
      28 random patients operated with endoscopic mucosal resection in 2018. The trial drugs will&#xD;
      be accounted for - both per site and per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection and enrollment of participants Consecutive patients with endoscopically diagnosed&#xD;
      right-sided colon adenomas or right-sided colon cancer tumors will be eligible for inclusion&#xD;
      in the study. The investigators plan to include 14 patients with colon cancer (track 1) and&#xD;
      14 patients with colon adenoma (track 2a).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, 28 patients with colon adenoma will be included retrospectively (track 2b). The&#xD;
      investigators will retrieve FFPE tissue from the resected mucosa bearing adenoma. They have&#xD;
      had endoscopic mucosal resection performed in 2018 at Department of Surgery, Zealand&#xD;
      University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of patients will be done consecutively according to the Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee's recommendations. Patients who are eligible for inclusion will receive both oral&#xD;
      and written information about the study. At the end of the enrolment meeting the patient may&#xD;
      sign the informed consent if they wish, and may also be given the time needed for&#xD;
      consideration (at least 24 hours). The informed consent will be written in accordance with&#xD;
      the Danish law. Patients will be informed if any changes in the study occur, as this might&#xD;
      influence the patient's willingness to participate or the safety of the participating&#xD;
      patients. The approved document will be updated accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A completed test person&#xD;
&#xD;
      A completed test person is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Track 1: a patient who received the therapeutic endoscopy and had preoperative blood&#xD;
           samples drawn on the operation day. Other than the interview on the day of the&#xD;
           out-patient clinic visit (approximately postoperative day 14) there is no further&#xD;
           study-related physical follow-up of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Track 2a: a patient who received the therapeutic endoscopy and had preoperative blood&#xD;
           samples drawn on the operation day. Other than the telephone interview on postoperative&#xD;
           day 14 there is no further study-related physical follow-up on the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dropout procedure Dropout and withdrawals may happen at any point from the written consent&#xD;
      till the preoperative blood sample on the operation day, and will not have any influence on&#xD;
      the treatment of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating patients can withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. The patients&#xD;
      will be informed of this right in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator can withdraw patients if the investigator feels the safety of the patient is&#xD;
      compromised by the participation in the study. In that case, the investigator must inform the&#xD;
      patient about the reason for withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who withdraw their consent will receive standard treatment. The reason, if stated,&#xD;
      for the withdrawal will be noted in the CRFs. The number of dropouts and withdrawals will be&#xD;
      reported. No further data will be collected from the patients withdrawing from the study;&#xD;
      however, the previously collected data will be part of the final data analysis unless the&#xD;
      patient specifically requests all data to be deleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study interventions and procedures Intervention This is a non-randomized trial with an open&#xD;
      label single group assignment. The intervention is a single therapeutic endoscopy during&#xD;
      which patient´s right colon section will be sprayed with a predetermined volume of two&#xD;
      component solutions, one containing fosfomycin and metronidazole, the other containing a gum&#xD;
      that forms a gel on mixing with the former. During administration, the two components will be&#xD;
      delivered through a dual channel colono-videoscope. The gel will form on the bowel wall and&#xD;
      adhere to the mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Track 1: patients with colon cancer Preoperative procedures - blood samples On the day of the&#xD;
      therapeutic endoscopy study, blood samples are drawn. Blood samples are analyzed for&#xD;
      hemoglobin (Hb), leucocytes and differential counts, c-reactive protein (CRP), thrombocytes,&#xD;
      albumin, creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), transaminases in order to&#xD;
      have baseline information on the patients and to be able to adjust for these variables in the&#xD;
      multivariate analyses. Blood samples will also be analyzed for tumor-specific markers:&#xD;
      carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Samples are also analyzed by means of the nCounter® PanCancer&#xD;
      Immune Profiling Panel (nanoString).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative procedures - therapeutic endoscopy At least 24 hours after the patient has given&#xD;
      informed consent to participating in the study, the patient will be given a bowel&#xD;
      preparation. After 48-72 hours the therapeutic endoscopy will take place. The bowel&#xD;
      preparation procedure will follow the different sites standard guidelines of bowel&#xD;
      preparation using Picoprep. The patient will be offered to be sedated before the endoscopy.&#xD;
      Pictures of the colon will be taken during the endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before spraying the right hemicolon, biopsies will be taken from the central and peripheral&#xD;
      part of the tumor, and biopsies from the macroscopically normal mucosa in the proximal colon&#xD;
      at least 10 cm orally and anally from the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proximal colon will be sprayed with a predetermined volume of the study medication&#xD;
      through a double spray catheter from the ileum to the right flexure using a Video&#xD;
      Colonoscope. The study medication contains fosfomycin and metronidazole, which are mixed in&#xD;
      situ with the gel-forming components formulated on behalf of Reponex Pharmaceuticals A/S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative procedures - pathology Some biopsies taken during the therapeutic endoscopy will&#xD;
      all be directly fixed in Phosphate-buffered (PBS-buffered) formalin and embedded in paraffin&#xD;
      before microscopic assessment and further molecular biological or immunologic tests are&#xD;
      performed. One biopsy from the healthy mucosa, one biopsy from the tumor center and one&#xD;
      biopsy from the tumor periphery will be frozen immediately following the local protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operation On the day of surgery, blood samples will be taken again. They will be analyzed&#xD;
      using the same methods as the preoperative blood samples. Inclusion in the study does not&#xD;
      interfere with the standard surgical protocol for patients with right-sided colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative procedures - pathology The resected colon section will be sent unfixed to the&#xD;
      Pathological Department at the site, where the initial macroscopic assessment is performed:&#xD;
      measuring of the tumor, lymph node assessment etc. One tissue sample from the healthy mucosa,&#xD;
      one tissue sample from the tumor center and one tissue sample from the tumor periphery will&#xD;
      be frozen immediately following the local protocol. The hemicolon will then be&#xD;
      formalin-fixed. The paraffin-embedded tumor samples will be cut according to the standard&#xD;
      protocol before microscopic assessment and further molecular biological or immunologic tests&#xD;
      are performed. The histological assessment will follow the standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge The discharge criteria are the same for patients included in the study as for other&#xD;
      patients on the ward. Discharge is expected to take place on the 3rd postoperative day if no&#xD;
      complications arise. A prolonged hospital stay will be defined as 10 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative out-patient visit - follow-up Patients will be seen after their postoperative&#xD;
      out-patient visit. The investigators will assess the patient's wellbeing and to ensure that&#xD;
      any side effects or adverse reactions to the medicine in the trial are registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Patients will be contacted by telephone 12 months after surgery. There is no&#xD;
      further study-related physical follow-up on patients, as it has no influence on the&#xD;
      endpoints. The investigators will however, read the patient's hospital files after 12 months&#xD;
      to see whether the therapeutic endoscopy has changed the clinical course of the patient, i.e.&#xD;
      if staging and oncological treatment are changed because of the procedure. The patients are&#xD;
      receiving the standard post-operative program with ambulatory follow-up according to the&#xD;
      Danish Colorectal Cancer Group (DCCG) recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Track 2: patients with adenomatous polyps of the colon Preoperative procedures - blood&#xD;
      samples On the day of the therapeutic endoscopy, study blood samples are drawn. They will be&#xD;
      analyzed by the same methods as the preoperative blood samples in Track 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative procedures - therapeutic endoscopy The bowel preparation procedure and sedation&#xD;
      are the same as in Track 1. Pictures of the tumor will be taken during the endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before spraying the right hemicolon, biopsies from the macroscopically normal mucosa will be&#xD;
      taken at least 10 cm orally and anally from the polyp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spraying procedure is the same as in Track 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative procedures - pathology Three of the four biopsies of the normal mucosa taken&#xD;
      during the therapeutic endoscopy will all be directly fixed in PBS-buffered formalin and&#xD;
      embedded in paraffin before microscopic assessment and further molecular biological or&#xD;
      immunologic tests are performed. One biopsy of the normal mucosa will be frozen immediately&#xD;
      following the local protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resection On the day of resection, blood samples will be taken again. They will be analyzed&#xD;
      by the same methods as the preoperative blood samples. During the endoscopic mucosal&#xD;
      resection, biopsies from the healthy colon will be taken: two biopsies 10 cm orally and two&#xD;
      biopsies 10 cm anally from the polyp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative procedures - pathology Three of the four biopsies of the normal mucosa taken&#xD;
      during the operation will all be fixed directly in PBS buffered formalin. One biopsy of the&#xD;
      normal mucosa will be frozen immediately following the local protocol. The resected mucosa&#xD;
      with the adenoma will be send non-fixed to the Pathological Department at the site, where the&#xD;
      initial macroscopic assessment is performed, measurement of the polyp in three dimensions.&#xD;
      The mucosa and the biopsies will be fixed with formalin, and will be cut according to the&#xD;
      standard protocol and paraffin embedded before microscopic assessment and further molecular&#xD;
      biological or immunologic tests are performed. The histological assessment will follow the&#xD;
      standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up On postoperative day 14+/-2, an investigator will call the patient to assess the&#xD;
      patient's wellbeing and to ensure that any side events or adverse reactions to the medicine&#xD;
      in the trial are registered. The Follow-up is as in Track 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Archived FFPE tissue from patients with colon adenoma FPPE tissue blocks from colon adenomas&#xD;
      will be retrieved from the archive of Department of Pathology, Zealand University Hospital.&#xD;
      The tissue blocks will be cut according to standard protocol. They will be analyzed as the&#xD;
      tissue from the resected mucosa of the patients included in track 2a.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathology procedures for both tracks The paraffin blocks will be sectioned in series. In each&#xD;
      step, the section 1 is stained with standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), section 3 is&#xD;
      stained immunohistochemically for CD8 and CD3 (following the local immunoscore protocol), and&#xD;
      section 5 will be stained for CD68 (macrophages). Sections 7, 9 and 11 will be analyzed for&#xD;
      bacterial biofilm using a general bacterial PNA FISH probe. Section 13 will be prepared for&#xD;
      PanCancer IO 360TM Gene Expression Panel (nanoString) analysis following the nanoString&#xD;
      protocol. The remaining sections (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12) remain unstained, and will be kept&#xD;
      at -80°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiology procedures for both tracks In this study tissue samples will be analyzed for&#xD;
      bacteria and biofilm using Fluorescence in situ hybridization and Metagenome sequencing.&#xD;
      These analyzes will be performed at Costerton Biofilm Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments In this study, patients are administered the study drugs in a standard&#xD;
      single dose of 800 mg of fosfomycin and 200 mg of metronidazole. The general dosage guideline&#xD;
      for adults treated with fosfomycin infusions is 6 g*3 per day (in patients with renal&#xD;
      insufficiency and a creatinine clearance of 10 ml/min the suggested dose is 1 g*2 per day).&#xD;
      The general dosage guideline for treatment with metronidazole is 1500 mg as a single&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples The drawing of blood samples will result in some discomfort and may risk&#xD;
      bruising at the site. A total of 8.5mL will be drawn at the sites: Zealand University&#xD;
      Hospital, Roskilde, and Herlev Hospital (3.0 mL Gel + LiHep Tubes + 3.0 mL EDTA Tubes + 2.5&#xD;
      mL PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes). A total of 11.5 mL will be drawn at the site: Zealand University&#xD;
      Hospital, Køge (3.0 mL Gel + LiHep Tubes + 3.0 mL Gel + LiHep Tubes + 3.0 mL EDTA Tubes + 2.5&#xD;
      mL PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic endoscopy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study a full colonoscopy is necessary to deliver the study medication to the mucosa&#xD;
      of the right hemicolon. Also, to assess the effect of the local antibiotic treatment it is&#xD;
      necessary to take biopsies from the healthy mucosa, and if the patient is included in track&#xD;
      1, also the colon cancer tumor. Forty-eight-72 hours before a colonoscopy the patient needs&#xD;
      to be given a bowel preparation (15). There are risks associated with a colonoscopy:&#xD;
      intestinal bleeding, bowel perforation, localized infection, adverse reaction to the&#xD;
      sedatives and generalized bowel infection. Of these, intestinal bleeding and iatrogenic bowel&#xD;
      perforation are the most prominent adverse events associated with a significant mortality&#xD;
      rate and the need for surgical intervention. The risk of accidental bowel perforation has&#xD;
      been estimated to 0.85/1000, and the risk of bleeding has been estimated to 1.64/1000 (16).&#xD;
      However, the complications are less common with colonoscopies that do not involve&#xD;
      polypectomy, such as this study. The colonoscopy will be performed by a trained specialist&#xD;
      surgeon in the out-patient clinic. Patients unable to be sedated due to known allergies or&#xD;
      comorbidities have already been excluded from study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events During and after administration of fosfomycin and metronidazole any adverse&#xD;
      events or intercurrent illnesses will be reported. Patients who have known allergy to&#xD;
      fosfomycin and or metronidazole are excluded from study participation. Treatment with&#xD;
      metronidazole is known to give rise to Antabuse (disulfiram)-like reactions in patients who&#xD;
      continue to drink alcohol. Patients who are currently heavy drinkers are excluded from study&#xD;
      participation. Patients will be orally instructed not to drink alcohol from the day before&#xD;
      the therapeutic endoscopy during the enrollment meeting. This information is included in the&#xD;
      Patient information. A summary of the product characteristics of fosfomycin and metronidazole&#xD;
      will function as reference documents in evaluation of adverse effects. The investigators will&#xD;
      monitor adverse events from the day of the intervention until postoperative day 14&#xD;
      (approximately 19 days in total). Safety of the intervention will be measured by adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All serious adverse events (SAE) will be registered and reported to the sponsor by&#xD;
      investigator within 24 hour after the event has been recorded. All adverse events will be&#xD;
      reported to the Danish Medicines Agency and the local Ethics Committee in an annual report&#xD;
      with a report on patient safety of the trial. All serious adverse reactions (SAR) will be&#xD;
      reported in an annual report together with a report on patient safety to the Danish Medicines&#xD;
      Agency. All SAR will be judged through the product summary if they are a possible suspected&#xD;
      unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR). The investigators are responsible for reporting&#xD;
      all lethal or life-threatening SUSAR to the Danish Medicines Agency and the regional Ethical&#xD;
      Committee as soon as possible and no later than 7 days after knowledge of such reaction has&#xD;
      been received. No later than after 8 days after the reporting, will the Danish Medicines&#xD;
      Agency be informed of the follow-up. All other SUSAR will be reported to the Danish Medicines&#xD;
      Agency and the regional Ethics Committee no later than 15 days after knowledge has been&#xD;
      received by the sponsor and the investigators. The patient will in these situations be&#xD;
      followed until the reaction has terminated either via the outpatient clinic at the hospital&#xD;
      or via contact with the sponsor or the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations The investigators plan to include 14 consecutive patients with&#xD;
      right-sided colon adenoma and 14 consecutive patients with right-sided colon cancer tumor.&#xD;
      The trial will end by the last visit of the last patient. The retrospective cohort of 28&#xD;
      patients with colon adenoma (track 2b) will be matched 2:1 with the prospective 14 patients&#xD;
      with right-sided colon adenoma (track 2a). The investigators estimate a dropout rate of 15%.&#xD;
      Therefore inclusion will stop by the 24th fully evaluable patient. This is a clinical&#xD;
      proof-of-concept intervention study, and the investigators are to our knowledge the first&#xD;
      group to look into local antibiotic treatment of biofilm in patients with colon cancer or&#xD;
      colon adenoma. the investigators expect this number of patients to be sufficient to provide&#xD;
      the necessary experience in implementing the technique and form a basis for future studies,&#xD;
      including their sample size calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using non-parametric statistics or parametric statistics depending on&#xD;
      the distribution of the data. P-values &lt;0.05 are considered significant. Correction for&#xD;
      multiple comparisons will be performed if needed. Descriptive statistics will be used for&#xD;
      baseline characteristics. Both a principal intention-to-treat analysis and a per-protocol&#xD;
      analysis will be performed, along with a standard sensitivity analysis. The effect of any&#xD;
      missing data will be assessed with sensitivity analyses. Missing data will be addressed with&#xD;
      a creation of clinically responsible imputations. The investigators will focus on molecular&#xD;
      signatures discovery using supervised analyses (statistical tests like t-test or Wilcoxon&#xD;
      test) and unsupervised analyses like PCA (principal component analysis) and ICA (independent&#xD;
      component analysis). Statistics will be performed in collaboration with biostatistician&#xD;
      Nicolas Derian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in track 2a, who are diagnosed with cancer after the postoperative&#xD;
      pathological assessment of the polyp, will be included in the intention-to-treat analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and quality assessment In accordance with Danish law on personal data, the&#xD;
      investigators will seek approval for this trial from the Danish Data Protection Agency. Data&#xD;
      handling will be in accordance with the act on processing of sensitive personal information,&#xD;
      the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act. The investigators&#xD;
      will also seek approval for the trial from The Research Ethics Committee and the Danish&#xD;
      Medicines Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from each patient will be recorded continuously and written in forms (CRF) prepared&#xD;
      before the trial begins. During the recruitment meeting, the investigators will use a paper&#xD;
      work sheet for baseline data and inclusion/exclusion criteria. During the therapeutic&#xD;
      endoscopy, the investigators will use paper work sheets for data collection; afterwards data&#xD;
      will be entered into an electronic database using the Easytrial platform. All other data will&#xD;
      be recorded directly to the electronic Easytrial database. The paper work sheets will be&#xD;
      stored identifiable in a locked cabinet at the respective research sites. All collected data&#xD;
      will have source documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be stored as personally identifiable for 10 years, after which they are deleted the&#xD;
      1st of February 2029. Data will be stored in compliance with GDPR and at Teamsite (secure&#xD;
      data storage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient withdraws from the study, the collected data will be anonymized. If the patient&#xD;
      requests the collected data to be deleted, this will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice and quality assessment This trial is performed in accordance with the&#xD;
      Danish Medicines Act §88 section 2 and the order on good clinical practice number 744 of 29th&#xD;
      of June 2006. The trial will be monitored by a Good Clinical Practice (GCP) unit, Capital&#xD;
      Region of Denmark. The existing procedures for quality assurance and control in intervention&#xD;
      studies will be followed through a scheduled monitoring agreement at the beginning, mid-term&#xD;
      and at the end of the project. At auditing, monitoring and/or inspection from the Danish&#xD;
      Medicines Agency, GCP-unit or from other relevant authorities, these will all be allowed&#xD;
      relevant access to the data and information stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The study is performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and&#xD;
      Danish law 593 of 14th June 2011 on the Research Ethics Committee's practices regarding&#xD;
      health research trials. The project has been approved by the department management, the&#xD;
      Danish Data Protection Agency (REG-010-2019), the Regional Research Ethics Committee (number&#xD;
      SJ-753), and the Danish Medicines Agency (2019-000131-51). The study is registered at the&#xD;
      EudraCT (number 2019-000131-51) and will be registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov. The trial&#xD;
      will be monitored by the local GCP Unit. Any modification of the protocol which may impact on&#xD;
      the conduct of the study, potential benefit of the patient or may affect patient safety,&#xD;
      including changes of study objectives, study design, patient population, sample sizes, study&#xD;
      procedures, or significant administrative aspects will require a formal amendment to the&#xD;
      protocol. An amendment will be agreed upon by the study group and will need the approval of&#xD;
      the Ethics Committee as well as other authorities prior to implementation, if suited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in the Surgical Department, Herlev Hospital, and Zealand&#xD;
      University Hospital. It will contribute to the clarification of whether local antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment of the colon tumor and the surrounding normal mucosa has a place in the treatment&#xD;
      of colon cancer and colon adenomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patients are included after they have received oral and written information and after&#xD;
      written consent has been obtained. At any time, the patients can withdraw their consent&#xD;
      without impairing their relationship to the investigator or the doctors involved and without&#xD;
      prejudicing their treatment at the Department. All patients can require further information&#xD;
      about the project from the clinically responsible doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be informed of any additional health information found in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding and insurance DMSc Ismail Gögenur (sponsor), MD Hans Raskov (investigator), MD Mahdi&#xD;
      Alamili (investigator) and MD Astrid Bennedsen (principal investigator) initiated this&#xD;
      project. The investigators and the sponsor have no financial interests or conflicts of&#xD;
      interest in this study. Reponex Pharmaceuticals A/S (Slotsmarken 12, 1.th.DK-2970 Hørsholm)&#xD;
      will distribute the trial drugs and colonoscopes to the participating departments as well as&#xD;
      cover salary expenses for MD Hans Raskov and MD Astrid Bennedsen and the running costs of the&#xD;
      trial. The funding source had no role in the design of this study and will not have any role&#xD;
      during its execution, analyses, interpretation of the data, or decision to submit results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about external funding is included in the written information for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insurance Patients are covered by the already existing insurance for hospitalized patients in&#xD;
      the Surgical Department, Herlev Hospital and Zealand University Hospital (Patient Insurance&#xD;
      Scheme).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication of research findings Positive, negative and inconclusive research results will be&#xD;
      published in international peer-reviewed journals. The Research Ethics Committee and the&#xD;
      Danish Medicines Agency will be informed within 90 days when the last patient has had the&#xD;
      last visit, and a final report will be reported within 12 months in the EUDRA database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No later than 12 months after trial termination, an article including the obtained results&#xD;
      will be submitted for publication in an internationally recognized peer-reviewed journal with&#xD;
      high impact. The investigators expect to get three publications from the study; a feasibility&#xD;
      publication with a detailed description of the methods, a publication of the results of the&#xD;
      intervention on patients with colon cancer and a publication on patients with colon adenoma.&#xD;
      Authorship eligibility will be based on the guidelines of the International Committee of&#xD;
      Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE).&#xD;
