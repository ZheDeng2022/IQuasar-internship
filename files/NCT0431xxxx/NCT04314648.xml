  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite high prevalence, few hospitalized inpatients with opioid or alcohol use disorders&#xD;
      (OAUDs) receive evidence-based treatments while in the hospital or get linked with&#xD;
      appropriate follow-up care, leading to poor clinical outcomes and high readmission rates and&#xD;
      costs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a physician and care manager with&#xD;
      addiction expertise, both members of the Substance Abuse Treatment and Recovery Team (START),&#xD;
      can help improve initiation of treatment in the hospital and linkage to follow-up care upon&#xD;
      discharge. START members have expertise in the treatment of substance use disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      START will work with the medical or surgical team to ensure appropriate care is received.&#xD;
      That care will include therapy, focused discharge planning, and medication treatment options.&#xD;
      START will also help establish a follow-up plan for continuation of treatment after hospital&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess feasibility, the study will enroll 80 patients admitted to the hospital over 5&#xD;
      months in a pilot randomized clinical trial and collect baseline and 1-month follow-up data.&#xD;
      To determine acceptability, the study will conduct semi-structured interviews with 40&#xD;
      providers. Results of this pilot study will inform a larger clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this three-year R34 are to prepare for a clinical trial by (1)&#xD;
      developing the protocol and resources for Substance Use Treatment and Recovery Team (START)&#xD;
      to address untreated opioid or alcohol use disorders (OAUDs) among hospitalized inpatients&#xD;
      and actively link them to follow-up care, and by (2) conducting a pilot RCT to assess (a)&#xD;
      implementation feasibility; and (b) acceptability among patients and providers. The study is&#xD;
      of critical importance to public health because millions of people in the United States need,&#xD;
      but do not receive, treatment for substance-use disorders. OAUDs are of particular concern&#xD;
      because of high rates of morbidity, mortality, hospitalizations, and readmissions, as well as&#xD;
      the increasing incidence of opioid-use disorders and associated medical consequences and&#xD;
      overdose deaths. Moreover, OAUDs are common substance use disorders among medical inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite high prevalence, few inpatients with OAUDs receive evidence-based treatments&#xD;
      while in the hospital. Most physicians and other providers in acute hospital settings are not&#xD;
      trained to assess or manage patients with OAUDs, contributing to low rates of OAUD&#xD;
      identification and treatment initiation. Pharmacotherapies to address OAUDs are effective for&#xD;
      use across medical settings but are seldom initiated in hospitals or recommended as part of&#xD;
      follow-up care. Inpatient hospitalization offers a pivotal opportunity to decrease unmet&#xD;
      need. Starting treatment in the hospital and effectively linking patients with follow-up care&#xD;
      could not only improve outcomes, but also could decrease high rates of hospital readmission&#xD;
      and ultimately lower costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care for hospitalized patients with OAUD-screening, brief&#xD;
      intervention and referral to treatment-is not effective for those with OAUDs, possibly&#xD;
      because it does not include initiation of medication or facilitate linkage to follow-up OAUD&#xD;
      care. Barriers to OAUD treatment for inpatients may include lack of expertise on the medical&#xD;
      team, absence of an organized system for assessing and treating patients with OAUD, patient&#xD;
      ambivalence about treatment, and lack of follow-up after discharge. The START will consist of&#xD;
      an physician and care manager team with OAUD expertise who provide population-focused&#xD;
      monitoring and measurement-based decision-making to support the medical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      START will use evidence-based components, including a motivational interviewing-based&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention, targeted discharge planning, and active referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop the protocol, we will draw from our prior work in primary care and other&#xD;
      evidence-based resources, and obtain input from a stakeholder advisory board comprised of&#xD;
      patients and providers. To assess feasibility, we will enroll 80 patients admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital over 5 months in a pilot RCT and collect baseline and 1-month follow-up data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine acceptability, we will conduct interviews with providers and patients. The&#xD;
      proposed study would be the first to test a consultation-liaison service-based START to&#xD;
      improve care for inpatients with OAUD.&#xD;

    <description>START is a model of care based on Collaborative Care. START is team driven, population-focused, measurement based, and focused on promoting adoption of evidence-based interventions. The purpose of this model is to increase adoption of evidence-based interventions for opioid and alcohol use disorders, and to increase linkage to aftercare.&#xD;
The components of the START intervention are as follows:&#xD;
Triage&#xD;
Engage, Assess, and Plan&#xD;
Treat&#xD;
Communicate and Coordinate&#xD;
