      The objective of this study was to identify and build an algorithm through an imaging process&#xD;
      using a support vector machine (SVM) with the tomography variables of cases with, KC, highly&#xD;
      susceptible corneas to ectasia (HSCE), and healthy corneas and to compare this algorithm to&#xD;
      BAD-D (Belin_Ambrosio Display) and PRFI (Pentacam Random Forest Index). The study included&#xD;
      148 eyes with KC, 351 with healthy corneas, and 88 eyes with HSCE.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were considered to be very asymmetric (VAE-NT) if the diagnosis of ectasia was&#xD;
      confirmed in one eye based on the previously described criteria and the fellow eye had a&#xD;
      normal front surface curvature (topometric) map. Objective criteria for considering normal&#xD;
      topography was applied for defining the cases of VAE-NT, including objective front surface&#xD;
      curvature metrics derived from Pentacam. Normal topography was rigorously considered based on&#xD;
      objective criteria of a maximum curvature Kmax (Steepest Front Keratometry) &lt;47.2 diopters, a&#xD;
      paracentral inferior-superior (I-S value) asymmetry value at 6 mm (3-mm radii) &lt; 1.45, and&#xD;
      keratoconus percentage index (KISA%) score &lt; 60. The cutoff point used to discriminate normal&#xD;
      corneas and VAE-NT from KC corneas was the maximal posterior elevation (&lt; 29 micron. This&#xD;
      cutoff point had been determined in a previous study, using the same instrument and the same&#xD;
      setting (30). The posterior elevation map was displayed with a 5-mm color-coded scale, and&#xD;
      maximal posterior elevation was measured manually using the cursor in the central 5 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included 148 eyes with KC, 351 with healthy corneas, and 88 eyes with suspected KC.&#xD;
      The patients were divided into three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group - Normal eyes (CG): 351 eyes without KC of 351 patients who underwent&#xD;
           LASIK or photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), stable after at least 18 months of&#xD;
           follow-up, without any changes in the posterior elevation at the 18-month Pentacam in&#xD;
           relation to the preoperative exam (surgeries performed in 2012-2018). The inclusion&#xD;
           criteria for being a normal case was to have normal corneas on the general eye&#xD;
           examination in both eyes, including normal slit lamp biomicroscopy, corrected distance&#xD;
           visual acuity of 20/20 or better, overall subjective normal topography and tomography&#xD;
           examinations.. Our objective topographic criteria were: both eyes with a KISA% index of&#xD;
           less than 60%, Kmax of 47.2 D or less, and I-S difference of less than 1.45 D. Because&#xD;
           no truly established tomographic parameter(s)/cut-off(s) for differentiating normal from&#xD;
           keratoconus suspect eyes exist, we adapted our classification for normal eyes to the&#xD;
           recent publication by Ambrósio et al.(31) by adding the criterion of &quot;overall subjective&#xD;
           normal topography and tomography examinations&quot; based on the evaluation of experienced&#xD;
           refractive surgeon (GCAJ). Only one eye was randomly selected for further statistical&#xD;
           analysis. The CG included one eye randomly selected from 323 patients with normal&#xD;
           cornea; one eye was randomly included per patient to avoid selection bias related to the&#xD;
           use of both eyes from the same patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Very assimetric ectasia with normal topography group (VAE-NT G): 88 eyes of 88 patients&#xD;
           with very asymmetric ectasia with normal topography (VAE-NT) in one eye and frank&#xD;
           ectasia (VAE-E) in the fellow eye. The inclusion criteria followed previous studies (28,&#xD;
           32, 33) Eyes in this group with insufficient topographic findings to meet diagnostic&#xD;
           criteria for keratoconus, and following features normal-appearing cornea on slit-lamp&#xD;
           biomicroscopy, keratometry, retinoscopy. These cases were the less affected eye (fellow&#xD;
           eye) of a keratoconic patient was included if the following criteria were met: KISA%&#xD;
           index of less than 60%, I-S difference of less than 1.45 D, and Kmax of 47.2 D or less&#xD;
           (ie, same topographic criteria as in normal eyes, except than in normal eyes, both eyes&#xD;
           of the patient met the criteria). These patients can be considered with corneas highly&#xD;
           susceptible to ectasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Very asymmetric eyes with ectasia (VAE-E): The fellow eyes of the VAE-NT displaying a&#xD;
           KISA% index of greater than 100% and at least one of the following biomicroscopic signs:&#xD;
           Vogt striae, Fleischer ring, or focal stromal thinning. Oculus implemented their own&#xD;
           staging system into the Pentacam software, which should mimic the Amsler/Krumeich&#xD;
           systems: the Topographic Keratoconus Classification (TKC) (34). TKC classifies KC into&#xD;
           four stages (plus four intermediate stages) and identifies other corneal pathologies,&#xD;
           such as corneal refractive surgery or pellucid marginal degenerative (PMD). TKC&#xD;
           classification of Pentacam tomographic index showing algum grau de KC variando de 1-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Keratoconus group (KCG): 148 patients (one eye each) with bilateral clinical KC. The KCG&#xD;
           included one eye randomly selected from 148 patients with keratoconus; one eye was&#xD;
           randomly included per patient to avoid selection bias related to the use of both eyes&#xD;
           from the same patient. The inclusion criteria were the same as for VAE-E, except that&#xD;
           both eyes of the patient met the ectasia criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects underwent complete eye examination as well as refraction assessment,&#xD;
      biomicroscopy, retinoscopy, fundoscopy, topography, and tomography assessment. All patients&#xD;
      were assessed at the Visum Eye Center between January 2012 and January 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee of the Sao Jose do Rio Preto Faculty of Medicine. All patients were&#xD;
      informed about the objectives of the study, and they signed written informed consent forms&#xD;
      before being enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      External validation was conducted with 140 patients, whose data were not included in building&#xD;
      the algorithm. They met the same inclusion criteria as the others, with a total of 82 eyes of&#xD;
      82 patients with healthy corneas, 19 eyes of 19 patients with VAE-NT, and 39 eyes of 39&#xD;
      patients with KC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PENTACAM TOMOGRAPHY: All eyes were examined by rotating Scheimpflug corneal and anterior&#xD;
      segment tomography (Pentacam HR; Oculus GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Image quality was checked so&#xD;
      that only cases with acceptable-quality images were included in the study. An experienced&#xD;
      fellowship-trained corneal specialist (GCAJ) reviewed all the cases so that they were&#xD;
      correctly classified in the KC and VAE-NT groups. The raw data (u12 files) were obtained from&#xD;
      all cases; therefore, the same customized software (version 1.20r118) was used to process all&#xD;
      the export files, and all Scheimpflug variables were directly downloaded from the Pentacam&#xD;
      software using the &quot;call-all&quot; function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATHEMATICAL ALGORITHM: To build the equation extracted from SVM, 58 variables were used,&#xD;
      some of them were extracted from the spreadsheet.. After the construction of these 58 feature&#xD;
      vectors (FV), an SVM-derived index was created, which was called the corneal tomography&#xD;
      multivariate index derived from a support vector machine (CTMVI). Considering that each&#xD;
      patient represents a point on a cartesian plane with 58 dimensions (each coordinate&#xD;
      representing one of the 58 FV), the role of SVM is to find the hyperplane that best separates&#xD;
      the CG, KCG, and VAE-NT G subjects. A hyperplane is algebraically described by a linear&#xD;
      equation; in this case, there are 59 coefficients, 58 of which are related to the FV and one&#xD;
      independent coefficient representing the bias (which is a possible parallel dislocation of a&#xD;
      given hyperplane). The analyzed FV were:&#xD;
