    <textblock>
      Postoperative surveillance of local metabolism of the surgical reconstruction after&#xD;
      esophagectomy by means of Microdialysis. Dialysate is collected continuously for seven&#xD;
      postoperative Days. Results analysed in a blinded fashion and related to the clinical&#xD;
      outcome. Primary endpoint: anastomotic leakage&#xD;

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate Onzurf probe (microdialysis probe) as a monitoring&#xD;
      method for the early diagnosis of complications after surgery in the gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
      Samples taken with Onzurf probe will be analyzed and then compared with routine clinical data&#xD;
      on surgical procedures in gastrointesinala tract. These parameters are: Patient general&#xD;
      condition, endoscopy, radiology and routine clinical samples (global) as CRP (C-reactive&#xD;
      protein), white blood cells, blood gases.The patients are their own controls when the purpose&#xD;
      is to see if you can detect early complications with Onzurf probe and also identify how many&#xD;
      people gets complications after surgery in the gastrointestinal tract. The patients' clinical&#xD;
      routine tests (blood tests, etc.) will serve as control samples, which then will be compared&#xD;
      with results from sampling of Onzurf probe. No interventions will be carried out on the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
