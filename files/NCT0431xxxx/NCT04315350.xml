      The aim of this study is to investigate whether ingestion of curcumin will prevent hepatic&#xD;
      insulin resistance (assessed by homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR))&#xD;
      induced by short-term oral glucocorticoid (prednisolone) administration in overweight and&#xD;
      obese participants. As a secondary endpoint it will be investigated if prednisolone&#xD;
      administration induce or worsen the degree of NAFLD in overweight or obese participants using&#xD;
      magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy (MRS), and if curcumin can ameliorate this effect. Also,&#xD;
      the possible anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin will be elucidated as a range of&#xD;
      inflammatory markers before and after intervention will be measured. Thus, prednisolone&#xD;
      treatment is used as a model of development of pre-diabetes.&#xD;

      AIMS OF STUDY The aim of this study is to investigate whether ingestion of curcumin will&#xD;
      prevent hepatic insulin resistance (assessed by homeostatic model assessment of insulin&#xD;
      resistance (HOMA-IR)) induced by short-term oral glucocorticoid (prednisolone) administration&#xD;
      in overweight and obese participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND The increasing incidence and prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities calls for&#xD;
      research in preventing these diseases. The progression to insulin resistance and increased&#xD;
      blood sugar levels (i.e. prediabetes) and ultimately type 2 diabetes (T2D) in obesity is&#xD;
      believed to be caused by various factors of which low-grade inflammation in adipose tissue&#xD;
      and skeletal muscle tissue seems to inflict insulin resistance initiating metabolic&#xD;
      deterioration towards the type 2 diabetic phenotype. Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound that&#xD;
      can be extracted from the turmeric root, have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties in both in vitro and animal studies. Furthermore, animal studies indicate that&#xD;
      curcumin is a modulator of gut microbiota composition in a metabolic beneficial direction.&#xD;
      Studies have shown positive results in terms of lowering hepatic insulin resistance with&#xD;
      curcumin in rodents and humans (measured by HOMA-IR), and another clinical trial has shown&#xD;
      that curcumin can prevent worsening of HOMA-IR and development of T2D in a prediabetic&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucocorticoids are a group of frequently used compounds, prescribed for a wide range of&#xD;
      diseases and have severe metabolic side effects as insulin resistance, T2D and non-alcoholic&#xD;
      fatty liver disease. Interestingly, curcumin, a phenolic compound extracted from the turmeric&#xD;
      root, and curcumin analogues have been shown to ameliorate glucocorticoid-induced&#xD;
      'dysmetabolism' in rodent studies, but no human data exist. Also, results from both in vitro&#xD;
      and in vivo studies with curcumin have shown promising effects in preventing NAFLD&#xD;
      development, but solid human data are missing. Because of the temporary effects on glucose&#xD;
      metabolism, short-term treatment with glucocorticoids can be used as an investigative model&#xD;
      of these metabolic changes. Previous studies from the research unit performing the current&#xD;
      study, used this setup to investigate changes in glucose homeostasis, incretin hormones and&#xD;
      insulin resistance. Two different mouse studies indicate that curcumin could be beneficial in&#xD;
      terms of preventing the metabolic changes associated with systemic glucocorticoid treatment,&#xD;
      but no human studies have investigated if curcumin can prevent glucocorticoid-induced&#xD;
      increase in HOMA-IR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of curcumin of the metabolic changes&#xD;
      caused by short-term systemic prednisolone in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in&#xD;
      overweight and obese individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants 27 overweight and obese individuals without diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, eligible participants will&#xD;
      undergo baseline assessments before being randomised to one of the following interventions:&#xD;
      1) Two tablets of curcumin (each tablet containing 100 mg curcumin) twice daily in 11 days&#xD;
      and 50 mg of prednisolone once daily in 10 days (capsule); 2) two tablets of placebo-curcumin&#xD;
      twice daily in 11 days and 50 mg of prednisolone once daily in 10 days (capsule); 3) two&#xD;
      tablets of placebo-curcumin twice daily in 11 days and one capsule of placebo-prednisolone&#xD;
      once daily in 10 days. In the end of the 11-day intervention period, end-of-intervention&#xD;
      assessments (similar to baseline assessments) will be performed. If necessary, a follow-up&#xD;
      visit will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information meeting and screening Prior to any protocol-related procedures, an information&#xD;
      meeting will be arranged, and participants will be informed of the possibility of bringing a&#xD;
      person of own choice to the visit. The information meeting is performed in undisturbed and&#xD;
      confidential surroundings. The room is reserved for this purpose, and nobody will interfere&#xD;
      during the meeting. It is not possible for other employees in the department to look into the&#xD;
      room. During this meeting, a member of the research group will explain the purpose,&#xD;
      procedures and possible risks of the study. The member of the research group will have proper&#xD;
      qualifications in terms of medical knowledge, insights in the specific project and&#xD;
      communications skills. It is firstly pointed out that the project is a biomedical trial.&#xD;
      After this, an oral information about the project is given based on the written information.&#xD;
      Questions will be answered as thoroughly as possible. The participant will be informed that&#xD;
      it is possible to have a minimum of 48 hours to evaluate participation from oral information&#xD;
      is given. If he does not want time to evaluate the participation, the informed consent can be&#xD;
      obtained. If he wants time to evaluate participation, a new meeting will be arranged with a&#xD;
      minimum of 48 hours from the information meeting. When the informed consent has been&#xD;
      obtained, screening can be done, either the same day or another day, but with a maximum of&#xD;
      four weeks after obtaining the informed consent. The participant will be informed that it is&#xD;
      possible to withdraw the written consent at any time prior to or during the study. In the&#xD;
      case that significant information about the participants health is found during the trial,&#xD;
      the participant will be able to decline having this information. Information about this&#xD;
      choice is confirmed in the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant wants to know about the results of the trial and the possible consequences&#xD;
      for the participant, he will have the rights to get this information after the end of the&#xD;
      study At screening, height and body weight will be measured, medication and medical history&#xD;
      will be recorded, blood will be sampled for assessment of plasma/serum concentrations of&#xD;
      thyroid-stimulating hormone, creatinine, creatine kinase, electrolytes, aspartate&#xD;
      aminotransferase (ASAT), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase, albumin, bilirubin, gamma-glutamyltransferase, viral hepatitis markers, platelet&#xD;
      count, ferritin and haemoglobin, and albumin-creatinine ratio in the urine will be measured.&#xD;
      A physical examination will be made including evaluation of blood pressure and pulse rate.&#xD;
      Alcohol habits will be evaluated based on The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test&#xD;
      (AUDIT) questionnaire and quantification of the weekly amount of alcohol. An MR safety&#xD;
      checklist will be completed, and an MR information sheet will be given. If all inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are met, dates for baseline assessments and&#xD;
      randomisation visit will be planned within 6 weeks from the screening visit. The participant&#xD;
      will be instructed not to consume curcumin-containing food on a daily basis from screening&#xD;
      until end of trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessments and randomisation visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant is included during COVID19 pandemic, a phone call is done the day before&#xD;
      the visit to ask about recent symptoms of infection, contacts to people with COVID19 symptoms&#xD;
      or people with positive test for COVID19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included individuals will undergo an MRS of the liver (scheduled as close as possible to the&#xD;
      randomisation visit). Before intervention start, both randomisation visit and MRS will be&#xD;
      performed. For MRS, participants are placed in a horizontal position. During the MRS, a&#xD;
      spectroscopy of the liver will be assessed, and an estimation of visceral adipose tissue and&#xD;
      subcutaneous adipose tissue will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last week before randomisation, the subject will collect a stool sample for the&#xD;
      determination of gut bacteria count and subtype. Stool samples will be collected by the&#xD;
      participant at home. Prior to defaecation a disposable collector will be placed in the toilet&#xD;
      from where stool will be transferred to a tube that immediately is transferred to a transport&#xD;
      container and placed at -20°C in the patient's freezer. Prior to transport to Gentofte&#xD;
      Hospital, the transport container is transferred to the cooler bag and at arrival at Gentofte&#xD;
      Hospital the transport container (with the sample tube) is immediately stored in at -80°C for&#xD;
      later analysis. This entails DNA extraction, library preperation, MiSeq 16S rRNA sequencing&#xD;
      and microbiota analysis (relative abundance, alpha/beta diversity, link to phenotype of&#xD;
      interest).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the randomisation visit, the participant will meet in the laboratory around 8 a.m. after&#xD;
      10 hours of fast (including any medication) and refrainment from tobacco or nicotine&#xD;
      supplements use. The participant is allowed to drink water until 8 hours before meeting in&#xD;
      department. Furthermore, the participant will be requested to avoid heavy alcohol intake&#xD;
      (more than 5 units of alcohol per day) and strenuous exercise two days prior to the visit and&#xD;
      instructed to use non-strenuous methods of transportation to the research facility. The&#xD;
      following procedures will be conducted:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the test day is during COVID19 pandemic, the participant is tested for Sars-Cov2 with a&#xD;
      swab procedure in the oropharynx, for immidiate PCR analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A fasting urine sample will be collected, and the participant is asked to empty the&#xD;
           urinary bladder completely&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fasting blood samples will be collected (bone markers, serum markers of muscle&#xD;
           breakdown, biomarkers of NASH and fibrosis, fibroblast growths factors, triglycerides,&#xD;
           cholesterols, liver parameters, HbA1c, inflammatory markers, adipokines, creatinine,&#xD;
           haemoglobin) amounting 25 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. FibroScan: The participant will be lying in a supine position for approximately 10&#xD;
           minutes during which a probe using shear-waves and ultrasound is applied in the right&#xD;
           side of the body below the ribs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, body weight and hip and waist circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A questionnaire is handed out regarding calorie intake and physical activity the day&#xD;
           prior to randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. IOP is measured with icare ic100 tonometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. One cannula will be inserted in the cubital vein for collection of blood samples. The&#xD;
           forearm from which blood samples are drawn will be wrapped in a heating blanket (42°C)&#xD;
           throughout the experiment (for arterialisation of venous blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Blood samples (for analysis of total amino acids, gut hormones, glucose, glucagon,&#xD;
           insulin, C-peptide, urea, FFA) will be measured throughout the OGTT (see Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. At time 0 min, the participant will ingest 75 g of water-free glucose dissolved in 300&#xD;
           ml water over a period of 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. At time 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240 and after the ad libitum meal, hunger,&#xD;
           satiety, fullness and prospective food consumption will be measured by VASs&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. During the last hour (time 180 min - 240 min), REE will be measured in a supine position&#xD;
           by indirect calorimetry to determine oxygen consumption (V02) and carbon dioxide&#xD;
           production (VC02). A flow-through canopy gas analyser will be used, as previously&#xD;
           described.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. At time 240 min, the subject will be asked to provide a new urine sample for measurement&#xD;
           of urea concentration. The participant will be asked to empty the urinary bladder&#xD;
           completely. Urine volume will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. At time ~250 min, the participant will ingest a standardised ad libitum meal consisting&#xD;
           of minced meat, pasta, corn, carrots, peppers, cream, salt and pepper (50 energy (E)%&#xD;
           carbohydrate, 37 E% fat, 13 E% protein). The participant will be instructed to eat as&#xD;
           much as possible until feeling comfortable saturate. The meal should be consumed within&#xD;
           a maximum of 30 minutes and by the end of the meal, time spent eating, weight of the&#xD;
           meal and the total amount of energy consumed will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. A continuous glucose monitor will be applied on the upper arm of the participant. The&#xD;
           sensor is blinded which means that the participant cannot see his blood glucose&#xD;
           excursions during the 14 days period of measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the randomisation visit, the participant will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      three interventions (1:1:1):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Two tablets of curcumin (corresponding to 200 mg) twice daily from day 1 to day 11 and&#xD;
           prednisolone capsule 50 mg (oral) once daily from day 2 to day 11&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Two tablets of placebo-curcumin twice daily from day 1 to day 11 and prednisolone&#xD;
           capsule 50 mg once daily from day 2 to day 11, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Two tablets of placebo-curcumin twice daily from day 1 to day 11 and&#xD;
           placebo-prednisolone capsule once daily from day 2 to day 11 The tablets with curcumin&#xD;
           and placebo-curcumin will appear identical, and the capsules with prednisolone or&#xD;
           placebo-prednisolone will appear identical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supplier of curcumin will also produce placebo-curcumin tablets (Indena Aps, Milan,&#xD;
      Italy). The pharmacy of Region H will be responsible of production and delivery of&#xD;
      prednisolone and placebo-prednisolon. Unblinded site-staff will be responsible for labelling&#xD;
      and blinding of the curcumin and placebo-curcumin tablets and prednisolone and&#xD;
      placebo-prednisolone capsules before the beginning of the intervention period. A person not&#xD;
      otherwise involved in the study will generate a randomisation code using a random list&#xD;
      generator. A randomisation list with randomisation numbers and corresponding treatment will&#xD;
      be made by the unblinded site-staff. A list with randomisation number and corresponding&#xD;
      packages with numbers will be made by unblinded site-staff, so that blinded site staff is&#xD;
      only allocating a randomisation number at the day of randomisation. The list with the&#xD;
      information about randomisation number and corresponding treatment will be kept at Center for&#xD;
      Clinical Metabolic Research at Gentofte Hospital. If a participant develops adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs) that demand knowledge of the content of the intervention, the list will show if the&#xD;
      patient is having any active ingredients. If a participant is excluded of the trial before&#xD;
      end-of-intervention visit, a new subject will be included in the same treatment-arm by taking&#xD;
      over the randomisation number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventional period If the participant was tested for Sars-Cov2-infection at&#xD;
      randomization visit, this test has to be negative before start of intervention. If the&#xD;
      participant is included during COVID19 pandemic, a telephone call is made the day before&#xD;
      intervention start, to ensure the following guidelines are followed: If the participant has&#xD;
      experiences symptoms of COVID19 during the last seven days prior to intervention start or had&#xD;
      close contact with COVID19-patients, intervention will not be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention will start soon after baseline MRS and randomisation visit. During the&#xD;
      intervention period, each participant will fill out a dairy to keep track of any new&#xD;
      concomitant medication, compliance and possible AEs. The participant will be asked to keep&#xD;
      the alcohol and smoking habits they might have had before screening and, thus, not to consume&#xD;
      more than 21 units of alcohol per week. Furthermore, they will be asked to consume no more&#xD;
      than 5 units in one night. The participant will be requested to maintain the level of&#xD;
      physical activity from before intervention during the interventional period. The participant&#xD;
      will be informed that if he feels more hungry than usual, he is allowed to eat extra. At day&#xD;
      5, 6 or 7 in the intervention period, the participant will receive a telephone call from the&#xD;
      investigator or other delegated site staff, checking on AEs, concomitant medication and&#xD;
      compliance, and to answer any questions from the participant. Furthermore, participants are&#xD;
      instructed to contact investigator or other delegated site staff in case of any questions or&#xD;
      intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tablets and capsules are preferably ingested with a meal and a small glass of water.&#xD;
      Should the participant forget to take a dose of curcumin/placebo curcumin, it can be ingested&#xD;
      until 6 hours before the next planned dose. If a dosage is missed, and the next one is&#xD;
      planned within 6 hours, the dosage should be passed, and the incident must be noted in the&#xD;
      diary. Should the participant forget to take a dose of prednisolone/placebo-prednisolone, it&#xD;
      can be ingested until 12 hours prior to the next dose. If a dosage is missed, and the next&#xD;
      one is planned within the next 12 hours, the dosage should med passed, and the incident must&#xD;
      be noted in the diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant is included during COVID19 pandemic: The participant is instructed to&#xD;
      adhere to social distancing and to be aware of COVID19-symptoms, and call site staff in any&#xD;
      case of symptoms during intervention period or if he has had close contact to a person who&#xD;
      had a positive Sars-Cov2-test, and to immediately stop intake of intervention and&#xD;
      self-isolate in this case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-intervention assessments and visit The end-of-intervention visit will be planned on&#xD;
      day 12 after start of intervention. If the participant is included during COVID19 pandemic, a&#xD;
      telephone call is done the day before the visit to ask about recent symptoms of COVID19,&#xD;
      recent contacts to people with COVID19 symptoms or people with positive test for COVID19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool sample collection and MRS will be performed in the period around end-of-intervention&#xD;
      visit, and will be performed as described above under &quot;baseline assessments and randomisation&#xD;
      visit&quot;. Procedures during the end-of-intervention visit are similar to the ones described&#xD;
      above under &quot;Baseline assessments and randomisation visit&quot;. Also, during this day, to check&#xD;
      for any effect of curcumin intervention, physical examination will be performed by a&#xD;
      physician from the research team and additional blood samples (identical with the samples at&#xD;
      the screening visit, except viral hepatitis markers) will be collected (which adds another 5&#xD;
      ml blood samples compared to randomisation visit) and albumin-creatinine ratio in the urine&#xD;
      will be measured. The continuous glucose monitor sensor is removed from the upper arm of the&#xD;
      participant, and the data from the sensor is transferred to a suitable software program.&#xD;
      Again, the questionnaire is handed out regarding calorie intake and physical activity the day&#xD;
      prior to the End-of-intervention day. Compliance will be evaluated (if compliance is&#xD;
      insufficient (missed more than ¼ of planned doses), the participant will not go through&#xD;
      end-of-intervention assessments). If the participant is included during COVID19 pandemic, he&#xD;
      is instructed to continue social distancing for three days after end-of-intervention visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up phone call and visit Between two and four days after last day on treatment, the&#xD;
      participant will receive a telephone call, where the participant is asked about withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms and symptoms of COVID19. Due to COVID19, an extra telephone call is made at day 5-8&#xD;
      after end-of-intervention visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant feels any kind of withdrawal symptoms (tiredness, weakness, abdominal&#xD;
      pain, anorexia, nausea or vomiting), or has had any symptoms of an ongoing infection after&#xD;
      End-of-intervention, a plan of action is made. Judged from the physical examination, blood&#xD;
      tests, results from continuous glucose monitoring, MRS and FibroScan at End-of-intervention&#xD;
      visit, a follow-up visit will be arranged, if it - judged by the investigator - is necessary.&#xD;
      At this follow-up visit (3-4 weeks after End-of-intervention) the investigator can do any or&#xD;
      all of the following tests; physical examination, FibroScan, measurement of IOC, standard&#xD;
      OGTT and blood tests, whichever is judged to be necessary to look into any late effects of&#xD;
      the intervention, and if necessary, another follow-up visit after another 1-3 months. If the&#xD;
      participant had steatosis on both MRS's, the participant will be offered a referral to the&#xD;
      Department of Gastroenterology for further evaluation and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOBANK A research biobank will be established at at Center for Clinical Metabolic Research&#xD;
      at Gentofte Hospital, DK-2900 Hellerup, Denmark, during the experiments to store the blood&#xD;
      tests until analyses. All participants are assigned with a trial number and will on data&#xD;
      sheets and tubes only appear with the trial number. The full name, social security number and&#xD;
      trial number will be stored separately. After the project is completed the biobank will be&#xD;
      terminated. Excess plasma will be stored in another biobank for up to 10 years after the&#xD;
      completion of the study, in case of need of re-analyses or need for further analyses. In the&#xD;
      latter case, a new approval by the Regional Health Research Ethics Committee is required. The&#xD;
      biobanks will be registered with Datatilsynet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CALCULATIONS AND STATISTICS Data will be processed and presented with the use of standard&#xD;
      descriptive statistics. Areas under the curves (AUCs) are calculated by use of the trapezoid&#xD;
      rule. Comparison of normally distributed data is carried out by means of repeated&#xD;
      measurements analysis of variance using linear mixed modeling with &quot;individual&quot; as random&#xD;
      factor. Freidmans test will be used for analysis of non-normally distributed data. P values&#xD;
      ≤0.05 are accepted as statistically significant (significance level, α = 5%). Power of the&#xD;
      study (1-β) is set to 80%, where β (20%) is the risk of accepting a hypothesis that is false.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation: Hansen et al. studied a prednisolone-treated group of healthy individuals,&#xD;
      and found an increase in HOMA-IR of 1.6 (1.3±0.1 vs. 2.9±0.3). The difference is 1.6±SD, but&#xD;
      the value of this SD we unfortunately do not have. Best guess is that it is (maximum) 0.5. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that the intervention group receiving two different kinds of placebo is&#xD;
      comparable to the baseline values in KB Hansens study, both before and after intervention, as&#xD;
      placebo expectedly will not change HOMA-IR. And it is hypothesized that the prednisolone&#xD;
      treated group is comparable with KB Hansens cohort after treatment with prednisolone. The&#xD;
      wish is to achieve a reduction in the increase in HOMA-IR of 50% when ingesting curcumin,&#xD;
      which gives a minimal relevant difference of 0.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P values ≤ 0.05 are accepted as statistically significant (α = 5%) and the power is set to&#xD;
      80%. This results in a sample size of 7 in each of the three treatment groups. . Based on&#xD;
      this, we will include 9 in each of the three treatment groups, as we might have slightly more&#xD;
      variance in HOMA-IR in our population compared to KH Hansen's participants. In case of&#xD;
      drop-outs, we will include new participants until we have 12 completers in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continuous glucose monitoring will provide data for up to 14 days with glucose measures&#xD;
      with frequent intervals 24 hours per day. The CGM will be recording for at least 24 hours&#xD;
      before start of intervention with prednisolon. CGM recordings are regarded successful if at&#xD;
      least 80% of the sensor data are available for analysis. Before analysis, all data will be&#xD;
      reviewed for pressure induced sensor attenuations. From these data, the following&#xD;
      calculations will be made: 1) The risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia will be calculated&#xD;
      as the low blood glucose index (LBGI) and the high blood glucose index (HBGI) using the&#xD;
      EasyGV workbook (www.phc.ox.ac.uk/research/technology-outputs/easygv) 2) coefficient of&#xD;
      variability (SD/mean interstitial glucose level), 3) SD, 4) percentage of time in&#xD;
      normoglycemic range (3,9-7,8 mmol/l), 5) percentage of time in three hyperglycemic ranges&#xD;
      (7.9-10 mmol/l, 10.1-13.9 mmol/l, &gt;13.9mmol/l) and 6) percentage of time in hypoglycemia&#xD;
      (&lt;3.9 mmol/l).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIDE EFFECTS, RISKS AND DISADVANTAGES FOR PARTICIPANTS Curcumin is a polyphenolic compound&#xD;
      extracted from the turmeric root with a very low bioavailability. High doses of Meriva® have&#xD;
      been well tolerated in human trials. However, most studies have been performed with&#xD;
      non-formulated traditional curcumin with lower bioavailability. Nevertheless, high doses of&#xD;
      non-formulated curcumin have not been associated with severe side effects, and are generally&#xD;
      very well tolerated in clinical trials. Panahi et al did a study with NAFLD patients, with&#xD;
      ~50 patients receiving Meriva® 1000 mg daily for 8 weeks (corresponding to 200 mg of&#xD;
      curcumin). There were no reports of side effects, but 7 withdraw because of the perception of&#xD;
      lack of effects. Antiga et. al. did a study with Meriva® 2000 mg daily for 12 weeks, with&#xD;
      only one participant having one adverse event (diarrhoea), but presumably not caused by&#xD;
      Meriva® because of other signs of viral genesis67. Mazzolani did a study with 12 patients&#xD;
      receiving 1200 mg Meriva® per day for 1 year with no reports of AEs. Di Pierro et al. did a&#xD;
      study on overweight participants, with a high dose of phosphatidylserine (a product very&#xD;
      similar to Meriva®) with reports of no side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prednisolone side effects are very well described, and most commonly are weight gain, skin&#xD;
      abnormalities, increased serum glucose levels, insulin resistance, oedema, electrolyte&#xD;
      derangement, myopathy, osteoporosis, infections, reduced symptoms of infections,&#xD;
      haematological abnormalities, psychiatric diseases, mood changes, sleep disorders,&#xD;
      hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and heart failure. But if the participants will experience side&#xD;
      effects, they are unlikely to get severe, when treating only with 50 mg daily for 10 days, as&#xD;
      they are dose and time-dependent, and with the relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      applied. Furthermore, they are all regarded as fully reversible after end of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A side effect from treatment with oral corticosteroids (e.g. Prednisolone) is elevated IOP&#xD;
      which in rare cases can cause the sight-threatening condition, glaucoma. In most cases&#xD;
      elevated IOP is asymptomatic, which is why, it is important to measure in the patient. IOP&#xD;
      can simply and easily be measured with a icare ic100 tonometer. The device is based on a&#xD;
      rebound measuring principle that requires no drops, air or specialized skills for its use,&#xD;
      and therefore not associated with any risk or complications. IOP is measured 3 times in each&#xD;
      eye and the mean is calculated. If this is elevated the patient will be seen by an&#xD;
      ophthalmologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During and right after prednisolone treatment, the participants are more prone to infections&#xD;
      and are likely to have fewer symptoms of infections. Participants will be asked about their&#xD;
      wellbeing and symptoms of infection several times during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant is included during the COVID19 pandemic, several extra restrictions and&#xD;
      assessments are applied in the study, due to the possible increased risk of a severe course&#xD;
      of COVID19 in case of prednisolone treatment. This is applied only to take extraordinary&#xD;
      precautions. Information on these restrictions and assessments is found in the relevant parts&#xD;
      of this protocol. Participants are thoroughly instructed in the relevant changes in the&#xD;
      participant information documents before screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal symptoms (after prednisolone treatment) are most commonly tiredness, weakness,&#xD;
      abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea or vomiting. Due to the short treatment period and&#xD;
      relatively low dose, it is very unlikely these symptoms will occur, but participants will be&#xD;
      asked about these symptoms at the telephone call two to four days after last day on&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRS is safe and not coupled with discomfort or pain. The scanner will be making loud noise&#xD;
      while scanning, but the participant will wear proper ear protection. Some participants may&#xD;
      experience claustrophobia during the scan. If the participant has steatosis on both MRS, he&#xD;
      will be offered a referral to the Department of Gastroenterology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Penetrations of skin (blood puncture and intravenous catheter insertion and insertion of&#xD;
      sensor for continuous glucose monitoring) are associated with mild discomfort and risk of&#xD;
      hematomas. A theoretical complication to skin penetration is superficial phlebitis. The&#xD;
      condition is not dangerous and will be treated with antibiotics should any sign of infection&#xD;
      be present. The risk of superficial phlebitis is small and minimized by following clinical&#xD;
      standards for the insertion of intravascular catheters including double wiping of the&#xD;
      involved skin with disinfectant alcohol and other sterile procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total blood loss will amount to approximately 365 ml distributed over a minimum of 2&#xD;
      weeks, which is not in any way harmful for the participant. Only participants with&#xD;
      haemoglobin &gt;7.5 mmol/l can participate, and all participants are offered iron treatment&#xD;
      after the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL INTEGRITY AND PRIVACY Information regarding participants of&#xD;
      the project will be protected in accordance with the applicable laws of Denmark including the&#xD;
      law concerning the processing of personal data. We will seek approval of the protocol by the&#xD;
      Danish &quot;Datatilsynet&quot; via the The Capital Region of Denmark. The trial will follow the rules&#xD;
      in European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol complies with the Helsinki Declaration (Seventh revision 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPERATING COSTS AND ECONOMY The project is currently not supported by any medical companies&#xD;
      and the responsible physician of the project has no economical affiliations with private&#xD;
      companies, foundations or the like with interests in the research project. When funding for&#xD;
      the project is in place the Research Ethics Committees will be notified.&#xD;

&#xD;
      ADJOURNMENT OF TRIAL Any participant can be withdrawn from the trial at any time, in case&#xD;
      investigator finds it unsafe for the participant to continue. Also, the participant can be&#xD;
      withdrawn if the participant meets any of the exclusion criteria, if compliance is&#xD;
      insufficient (if participant has missed more than ¼ of planned doses, controlled at telephone&#xD;
      call at day 5, 6 or 7 in the intervention period and at the end-of-intervention visit)&#xD;
      evaluated by investigator, or in case exceptional circumstances make it impossible to&#xD;
      complete the study. Likewise, any extraordinary event that makes it impossible to finish the&#xD;
      project will result in termination of ongoing experiments. In all cases, the participant will&#xD;
      be informed about the decision and the reason why. The participant may, at any time during&#xD;
      the trial, voluntarily discontinue participation. In case of drop-outs, we will include new&#xD;
      participants until we have 12 completers in each group.&#xD;

      RECRUITMENT OF PARTICIPANTS Participants are recruited through the following methods: 1)&#xD;
      Advertisement in newspapers or local newspapers or at www.forsøgsperson.dk. 2) Advertisement&#xD;
      through flyers and posters. 3) Participants who participated in studies in the department in&#xD;
      the past and gave consent that they would like to be contacted again in regard to&#xD;
      participation in new studies in the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who responded on advertisements will receive written information on e-mail or&#xD;
      regular mail, whatever is preferred. All participants will also receive the leaflet&#xD;
      &quot;Forsøgspersonens rettigheder i et sundhedsvidenskabeligt forskningsprojekt&quot; from the Ethical&#xD;
      Committee in Denmark, august 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After at least two days, the participant will be contacted by telephone and asked if he wants&#xD;
      to participate in the study. If the participant has any questions, these will be answered as&#xD;
      thoroughly as possible. If the participant is interested in participation, a time and place&#xD;
      for the information visit will be scheduled. During the phone call, the participant is&#xD;
      informed about the possibility to be accompanied by a person of own choice to all the visits&#xD;
      during the trial.&#xD;
