  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine transdermal patch is newly available in Taiwan in June 2017, the trade name is&#xD;
      Transtec, and the available dosages are 35 μg/h and 52.5 μg/h. Taiwan is the first Asia&#xD;
      country which launched Transtec for cancer pain treatment. Although the efficacy of&#xD;
      transdermal buprenorphine has been demonstrated in some randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      studies and also conducted a large scale post-marketing surveillance study in Germany,&#xD;
      therefore the local scientific data is required for Asia experience. Due to above rationale,&#xD;
      this observational study will be initiated in Taiwan, to build up the first real-world&#xD;
      scientific data in Asia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to collect the safety and effectiveness of transdermal&#xD;
      buprenorphine in routine clinical practice, in particular, to collect data in population with&#xD;
      controlled cancer pain and stable titration from previous opioid analgesics in Taiwan.&#xD;

      The objective of this observational study is to collect effectiveness and safety data on the&#xD;
      labelled use of buprenorphine transdermal patches (Transtec 35 μg/h and 52.5 μg/h) under&#xD;
      regular and routine clinical conditions in Taiwan for cancer patients with moderate to severe&#xD;
      cancer pain (NRS Score&gt;=4) and strong opioids are needed for their pain treatment.&#xD;
