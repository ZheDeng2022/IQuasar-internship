      This study determines the Maximum Tolerable Dose (MTD) by maximum BSA percentage treated and&#xD;
      evaluates efficacy of various concentrations of AMTX-100 CF versus placebo (vehicle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I (Part 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately Twenty five (25) subjects with various treatable Body Surface Area (BSA)&#xD;
      involvement of Mild to Moderate Atopic Dermatitis will be enrolled in the study and treated&#xD;
      with 1.1% w/w AMTX-100 CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II (Part 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately One Hundred Twenty (120) subjects with Mild to Moderate Atopic Dermatitis with&#xD;
      various treatable BSA involvement of Mild to Moderate Atopic Dermatitis will be randomized to&#xD;
      be treated with different concentrations of AMTX-100 CF (low concentration (0.11% w/w),&#xD;
      medium concentration (0.33% w/w) and high concentration (1.1% w/w)) or Vehicle (Placebo) in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AMTX-100 CF drug product is formulated as a water-based, topical cream incorporating a&#xD;
      28-amino acid synthetic polypeptide (AMTX-100) as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).&#xD;
      AMTX-100 is a chimeric, cell-penetrating, bifunctional nuclear transport modifier (NTM), that&#xD;
      is engineered to modulate nuclear transport of transcription factors (NF-κB, NFAT, AP-1 and&#xD;
      STAT1) involved in activation of gene expression of key mediators of inflammation (TNFα,&#xD;
      IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, MCP-1, etc.) and metabolic syndrome (ChREBP and SREBP) by importin α/β&#xD;
      complex and importin β, respectively. This further leads to a reduction in pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine/chemokine production and lipid metabolic products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMTX-100 CF is intended for improvement of symptoms associated with mild to moderate Atopic&#xD;
      Dermatitis in adults. This Phase I/II study aims to determine the Maximum Tolerable Dose&#xD;
      (MTD) by maximum BSA percentage treated and to evaluate efficacy of various concentrations of&#xD;
      AMTX-100 CF versus placebo (vehicle).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Part 1 (Phase I):&#xD;
Part 1 of the study is an open-label, dose escalation study to determine the MTD of AMTX-100 CF (1.1% w/w) for the highest treated percentage of the BSA affected with AD. Five (5) cohorts will be sequentially enrolled in the Part 1 of the study. Each cohort will include five (5) patients with eligible, treatable percentages of BSA affected with AD.&#xD;
Part 2 (Phase II):&#xD;
Part 2 of the study is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled, dose ranging study of the safety and efficacy of topically applied AMTX-100 CF in adult patients with Mild to Moderate AD. One hundred twenty (120) patients will be enrolled in 3 groups of AMTX-100 CF along with a placebo (vehicle) group. The patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio with thirty (30) subjects in each group ((Group A: low dose concentration 0.11%, Group B: medium dose concentration 0.33% and Group C: high dose concentration 1.1%) of AMTX-100 CF) and placebo (vehicle 0% w/w)).</intervention_model_description>
