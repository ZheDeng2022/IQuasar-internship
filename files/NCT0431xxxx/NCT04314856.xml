  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&#xD;
      The investigators wish to examine brain distribution of sigma-1 receptors in young adult&#xD;
      males with FXS using 18F-FTC-146 PET. This project will study the distribution of sigma-1&#xD;
      receptors in 15 young (18-30 years) male adults with FXS compared to 5 healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the study, we will measure sigma-1 receptor density in the regions of interest in brain&#xD;
      known to be involved in executive functioning and cognition using 18F-FTC-146 PET. We will&#xD;
      then compare S1R density in areas ROIs not involved in executive functioning and&#xD;
      cognition.This will provide a framework for predicting functional impairment based on&#xD;
      brain-behavior relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two aims. The first aim is to evaluate the reliability of 18F-FTC-146 brain&#xD;
      uptake in healthy controls under test and retest conditions to establish a baseline measure&#xD;
      of S1R density and quantify regional brain uptake of radiotracer in five healthy adults. The&#xD;
      second aim is to characterize S1R density in brains of young adult males with FXS which will&#xD;
      then be compared to healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This would be the very first PET study to image sigma-1 receptor density in participants with&#xD;
      fragile X syndrome, thereby testing whether altered receptor density is present in brain in&#xD;
      fragile X syndrome patients when compared to healthy volunteers. If confirmed, the current&#xD;
      study would provide compelling clinical-translational support for an important&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanism of cognition and executive function. The current study has&#xD;
      considerable potential for advancing the neurobiological understanding of fragile X syndrome&#xD;
      in humans.&#xD;

    <description>Regional brain uptake of [18F]FTC-146 will be analyzed by kinetic modeling with metabolite-corrected arterial input functions to establish stability and reproducibility of [18F] FTC-146 in humans under test and retest conditions.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 6 hours per scan performed on Day 0 (both groups) and Day 7 (healthy volunteers)</time_frame>
    <description>Binding potential provides an estimate of the S1R receptor distribution and affinity of [18F]FTC-146 to the S1R receptors. Binding potential measurements will be compared between participants with fragile X syndrome and control group with healthy volunteers to assess if there is a difference. Binding Potential (BPND) is estimated as the distribution volume ratio (DVR) -1.&#xD;
DVR's of tracers are used in PET receptor studies where the radiopharmaceutical can be specifically bound to receptors; nonspecifically bound to other macromolecular components, or free in tissue (FT). DVR is calculated using a Logan Plot, which uses the dynamic PET images obtained during imaging and compartment modeling to graphically analyze by linear regression pharmacokinetic data for radiopharmaceuticals that undergo 'reversible' uptake.&#xD;
Healthy volunteers will have scans at Day 0 and Day 7, and FXS patients will have a single scan on day 0. All scans will be analyzed.</description>
