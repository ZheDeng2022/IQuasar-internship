  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-centered, three-armed, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study,&#xD;
      namely, the oral trial drug favipiravir tablets plus chloroquine phosphatetablets tablets&#xD;
      group (combined group), the oral trial drug favipiravir tablets group (pirovir group), and&#xD;
      the oral placebo treatment group (control group). The total number of enrolled cases in this&#xD;
      study was set at 150.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment, the clinical data of the subjects were collected, the changes of viral&#xD;
      load and biochemical indicators were detected, and the outcome of the subjects was monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main indicators of efficacy include improvement or recovery of respiratory symptoms and&#xD;
      viral nucleic acid shedding. The rate of progression to severe disease, duration of fever,&#xD;
      peripheral blood index and improvement time of pulmonary imaging were the secondary&#xD;
      indicators to evaluate the efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed at the middle and final stages of the study to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of favipiravir tablets combined with chloroquine phosphatetablets&#xD;
      tablets in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia.&#xD;
