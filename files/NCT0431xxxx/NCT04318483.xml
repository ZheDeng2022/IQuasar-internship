  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cow milk allergy is one of the most frequent food allergy among children. Cow milk protein's&#xD;
      avoidance is needed until spontaneous recovery during the two first years of life. A atypical&#xD;
      clinical form with angio-oedema of hands and feet which is associated with high rate of&#xD;
      lactoserum's IgE might be a hope of an earlier recovery.&#xD;

      Cow Milk allergy is one of the most frequent pediatric food allergy and occurs during the&#xD;
      first months of life. It is due to an inappropriate reaction of immune system against the&#xD;
      human body. Its treatment is the avoidance of the cow milk proteins. Its spontaneous recovery&#xD;
      occurs mostly during the first years of life with the decreasing of the specific IgE and the&#xD;
      clinical tolerance to cow milk proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two shorts cas reports (3 and 5 patients) have described a clinical form of IgE-mediated cow&#xD;
      milk allergy with angio-oedema of hands and feet. This clinical form is associated with more&#xD;
      increasing of specific IgE against lactoserum proteins than caseine's. However it has been&#xD;
      showed that casein is a marker of cow milk allergy persistence. It might be possible that&#xD;
      this atypical form of cow milk allergy progresses favorably towards a restoration of&#xD;
      tolerance earlier than the clinical form without angio-oedema of the extremities&#xD;
