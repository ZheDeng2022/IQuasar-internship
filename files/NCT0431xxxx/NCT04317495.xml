  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective treatment for MDD, but&#xD;
      the overall effect sized of the treatment is equivalent to antidepressant pharmacotherapy,&#xD;
      and responses are highly variable. Given that rTMS is usually given to patients who have&#xD;
      failed pharmacotherapy, a more effective alternative is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study will combine computerized cognitive training (CCT) during standard rTMS&#xD;
      treatments and assess its feasibility, tolerability, and changes in cognitive control&#xD;
      performance and depression symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that agree to the study and meet eligibility will receive standard rTMS&#xD;
      (generally 25-36 daily treatments) along with CCT (starting on day 5 of treatment until the&#xD;
      pre-taper treatment). In addition, to CCT participants will be asked to complete assessments&#xD;
      before and after treatment&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project will also have a registry for participants that are approached to be in the&#xD;
      clinical trial with the CCT but don't wish to be enrolled. Although the registry will be&#xD;
      available for these participants, the information entered into this ClinicalTrials.gov&#xD;
      registration will reflect the clinical trial portion of this project.&#xD;

    New data has caused the principal investigator to decide that the study no longer makes sense&#xD;
    to conduct as it is designed. This is not a suspension of IRB approval.&#xD;

    <description>After having four rTMS sessions without CCT, the patients will perform CCT (starting day 5) during the rTMS session, which typically last from 20-40 minutes. A course of rTMS therapy includes from 25-36 treatments, given daily, until the last 5-6 treatments, given as a 'taper' over 2 weeks. CCT will be paired with rTMS up until the taper begins. In addition, they will have assessments prior to and after the therapy.</description>
