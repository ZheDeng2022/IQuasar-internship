    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of human-animal interaction on reducing anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, worry, and pain and enhancing quality of life in children ages 8-17 years old&#xD;
      with a life threatening cancer and their parent caregivers.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the feasibility of human-animal interaction (HAI) sessions for children with&#xD;
           a life threatening cancer and a primary caregiver, specifically to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To identify and document necessary modifications for a safe and feasible&#xD;
                intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To obtain recruitment estimates and determine potential recruitment barriers&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate elements of implementation fidelity (design, training, delivery/receipt&#xD;
                of treatment, enactment)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To verify safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the preliminary efficacy of human-animal interaction sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  On children with a life threatening cancer for the outcomes of qualify of life,&#xD;
                anxiety, depression, worry, and pain&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  On caregivers of children with a life threatening cancer for the outcomes of stress&#xD;
                and anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To explore mechanisms (reduced salivary cortisol and urinary norepinephrine levels)&#xD;
      associated with 8 weeks of human-animal interaction.&#xD;
