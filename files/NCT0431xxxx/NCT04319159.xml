    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the parent drug&#xD;
      5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and its active metabolite protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) during&#xD;
      photodynamic therapy with 3 tubes of BF-200 ALA 10% gel (Ameluz®) in combination with the&#xD;
      BF-RhodoLED® lamp in the systemic circulation of diseased individuals presenting with actinic&#xD;
      keratosis (AK) on the face/scalp or in the periphery (neck/trunk/extremities) along with&#xD;
      subjects' safety/tolerability during and after treatment.&#xD;

             unlikely to complete the study, or inappropriate in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Prior participation in the study (participation is defined as having been screened).&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. A member of study site staff or sponsor staff directly involved in the conduct of the&#xD;
             protocol or a close relative thereof.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Simultaneous participation in a further clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Reassessment of subjects is allowed once if sunburn, wounds, irritations, bleeding or skin&#xD;
        infections detected at Visit 1 are expected to resolve within the screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Reassessment can be done on the day of the actual treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Dosing day exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Febrile or infectious illness within 7 days prior to Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with sunburn, wounds, irritations, bleeding or other confounding skin&#xD;
             conditions within illumination areas at Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Use of topical NSAIDs inside and outside the treatment field(s) or systemic intake of&#xD;
             NSAIDs within 7 days prior to Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In case a subject meets one of the dosing day exclusion criteria, Visit 2 can be&#xD;
        rescheduled once within 14 days. Meeting any of the dosing day exclusion criteria on the&#xD;
        rescheduled visit will lead to discontinuation of the trial.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Trial was conducted at one site in the USA that recruited subjects. Recruitment of subjects started on 05 March 2020.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>48 subjects were screened for eligibility which was within 2 weeks prior to PDT. 2 of 48 subjects were re-screened due to the COVID-19 implications. 13 subjects were excluded as screening failures and one subject withdrew informed consent before treatment. In total, 32 subjects were treated. In this single-arm study, all participants received identical active treatment. Study data were analyzed primarily overall and additionally according to strata.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Blood samples for ALA analysis for each subject were collected, starting at Visit 1 and then 0.5h prior to BF-200 ALA application for up to 10h afterwards. The concentrations of ALA in plasma were measured by an analytical laboratory using validated, internally standardized liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods.</description>

        <description>Parameter: λz (Elimination Rate Constant); λz denotes the terminal rate constant estimated by linear regression analysis from a range of concentrations in the terminal phase estimated for each treatment and subject by log-linear regression from the linear portion of the logarithmic transformed concentration-time plot. The algorithm will start with the last 3 points with quantifiable concentrations and increases the number of involved points by 1 until the time point after Cmax restricted on time points after removing of the BF-200 ALA gel (all PK samples after the gel is wiped off [after 3h±10 min); λz was only determined in subjects in which the log-linear terminal phase could clearly be defined. Resulting unreliable parameters were flagged accordingly and not used in descriptive statistics. If any pharmacokinetic parameter should have been classified as unreliable, all calculations that use this parameter were considered missing.</description>

          <title>Evaluation of Baseline-adjusted Pharmacokinetic Parameters of PpIX.</title>
          <description>Parameter: λz (Elimination Rate Constant); λz denotes the terminal rate constant estimated by linear regression analysis from a range of concentrations in the terminal phase estimated for each treatment and subject by log-linear regression from the linear portion of the logarithmic transformed concentration-time plot. The algorithm will start with the last 3 points with quantifiable concentrations and increases the number of involved points by 1 until the time point after Cmax restricted on time points after removing of the BF-200 ALA gel (all PK samples after the gel is wiped off [after 3h±10 min); λz was only determined in subjects in which the log-linear terminal phase could clearly be defined. Resulting unreliable parameters were flagged accordingly and not used in descriptive statistics. If any pharmacokinetic parameter should have been classified as unreliable, all calculations that use this parameter were considered missing.</description>
