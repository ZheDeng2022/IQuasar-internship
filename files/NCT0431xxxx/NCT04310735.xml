  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging and facial coding methods to study&#xD;
      individuals who smoke cigarettes. Smoking expectancy (the extent to which one perceives an&#xD;
      opportunity to smoke a cigarette) will be manipulated using instructions, and the&#xD;
      investigators will examine the effects of this manipulation on two primary endpoints under&#xD;
      conditions designed to induce an urge to smoke: (1) brain responses measured using fMRI and&#xD;
      (2) subjective affective responses measured using facial coding. Secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      self-report measures of the desire to smoke and current affect.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants must report smoking at least 6 cigarettes per day continuously for at&#xD;
             least the 12 preceding months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a baseline expired air carbon monoxide (CO) exceeding a cutoff&#xD;
             based upon prior research in order to verify smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals will be excluded if they report that they are actively trying to quit&#xD;
             smoking.&#xD;

          -  Individuals will be excluded if they report that they have had significant&#xD;
             cardiovascular disease (such as heart disease, heart attack, stroke, or angina) or&#xD;
             respiratory disease (such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, or COPD) during the past&#xD;
             year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals will be excluded if they report that they have used any of the following&#xD;
             illicit substances more than 10 times in the previous 30 days: marijuana, cocaine,&#xD;
             opiates such as heroin, methadone, benzodiazepines (such as Valium, Xanax),&#xD;

             responses in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals will be excluded if they have any known risk from exposure to high-field&#xD;
             strength magnetic fields (e.g., pace makers), any irremovable metallic foreign objects&#xD;
             in their body (e.g., braces), or a questionable history of metallic fragments that are&#xD;

&#xD;

             substance other than nicotine based upon a brief structured interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals will be excluded if they report that they are not willing to refrain from&#xD;
             using alcohol and recreational drugs for 24 hours and nicotine for 12 hours before the&#xD;
             experimental lab visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals will be excluded if they currently use nicotine products other than&#xD;

             products).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals will be excluded if they are claustrophobic or are prone to becoming very&#xD;
             uncomfortable in confined spaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
