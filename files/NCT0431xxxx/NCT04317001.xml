      The proposed study seeks to investigate the effects of modafinil on cognitive function in&#xD;
      depression, which holds promise for better treating cognitive impairment in depression, as&#xD;
      well as better understand cognitive dysfunction in MDD from a neural rather than diagnostic&#xD;
      point of view to better classify and treat these disabling symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vortioxetine is the only FDA approved medication for treating cognitive impairment in&#xD;
      depression. This medication, however, takes a minimum of 6-8 weeks to take effect and is only&#xD;
      effective in a subset of patients. Modafinil, has shown some benefit in off-label treatment&#xD;
      of cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders. The effects of modafinil on cognitive&#xD;
      function in both healthy controls and treatment resistant and partially remitted individuals&#xD;
      with MDD have shown promising results. To date, however, studies have focused on modafinil's&#xD;
      potential as an augmenting agent for treatment resistant depressive symptoms, but have not&#xD;
      examined its effects on cognitive function in depression as a primary outcome measure.&#xD;
      Modafinil's ability to treat cognitive symptoms in non-treatment refractory or partially&#xD;
      remitted individuals specifically struggling with cognitive impairment resulting from MDD&#xD;
      have not been assessed. Further, we lack a mechanistic understanding of modafinil's effects&#xD;
      on brain circuitry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research seeks to examine the effects of modafinil on different domains of&#xD;
      cognitive function such as attention, working memory and processing speed, as well as its&#xD;
      underlying effects on brain circuitry in individuals who demonstrate cognitive impairment and&#xD;
      meet criteria for first episode of major depressive disorder. Specifically, this study would&#xD;
      examine the effect of administering low dose modafinil, a drug that has been used off-label&#xD;
      to treat cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders, on cognitive function in major&#xD;
      depressive disorder in a two-session double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to examine the effect of modafinil on domains of cognitive&#xD;
      processing and function in depression as well as the neural mechanisms underlying its effects&#xD;
      using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A secondary aim of this study is to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of modafinil in treating cognitive dysfunction to that of vortioxetine&#xD;
      in an optional phase 2 open-label follow up. In an optional second phase of the study,&#xD;
      participants randomized to the placebo group, will have the option of enrolling in an open&#xD;
      label trial of either modafinil or vortioxetine, the only currently FDA approved medication&#xD;
      to treat cognitive impairment in depression. Study findings may provide the foundations for&#xD;
      future work focused on treating cognitive impairment in depression.&#xD;
