  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to conduct an observational study involving intensive&#xD;
      care unit patients receiving mechanical ventilation and determine if there are differences in&#xD;
      diaphragm thickness ultrasound measurements during expiratory and inspiratory phases in a&#xD;
      controlled and spontaneous mode. For patients receiving sedatives, an additional set of&#xD;
      measurements will be taken during a standard of care interruption of sedatives&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study diaphragm ultrasound measurements at end-expiration and peak inspiration phases&#xD;
      in assist control and pressure support mode in consented patients admitted to the medical&#xD;
      intensive care unit. One-time measurements will be obtained during the first 48hrs that the&#xD;
      patients are receiving mechanical ventilation. In patients receiving sedatives, additional&#xD;
      measurements will be taken after an interruption of sedatives. Measurements will be compared&#xD;
      between modes and on assist-control before and after an interruption of sedatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three consecutive images will be obtained by an investigator that is blinded to the mode&#xD;
      (controlled vs. spontaneous). Once measurements are obtained, a second investigator will&#xD;
      switch to the other mode (controlled vs. spontaneous) and the blinded investigator will&#xD;
      obtain three consecutive images after the patient has adjusted to the subsequent mode (one&#xD;
      minute). Tidal volumes will be matched between modes as close as possible. The order of modes&#xD;
      to ultrasound (controlled then spontaneous or spontaneous then controlled) will be determined&#xD;
      by the non-blinded second investigator. Once the ultrasound measurements are obtained by the&#xD;
      research team, image acquisition is concluded for the enrolled patient. The ventilator will&#xD;
      be programmed back to the original settings determined by the medical ICU team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the end-expiration diaphragm ultrasound measurement will be thicker in&#xD;
      spontaneous mode than controlled mode.&#xD;
