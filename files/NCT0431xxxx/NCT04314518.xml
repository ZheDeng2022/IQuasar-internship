      It is known that if there isn't an efficient exposure to the paternal antigens before&#xD;
      conception, there is an increased risk for the pre-eclampsia (PE) cascade and other pregnancy&#xD;
      complications to take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that maternal immune system that doesn't develop tolerance to the paternal&#xD;
      antigens that the seminal fluid carries, doesn't developed an adequate immune tolerance to&#xD;
      the trophoblast cells and due to that, they are being under greater attack during&#xD;
      placentation. Thus, the cells don't go through a normal differentiation, don't perform normal&#xD;
      pseudo-vasculogenesis and the PE cascade is more likely to be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the maternal immune system and the paternal alloantigens have a role in the development&#xD;
      of PE. Although the specific etiology remains unclear and can be only hypothesized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators aim is to try and prove that there is a difference in the&#xD;
      immunological reactions to semen prior to conception and that these changes are related to PE&#xD;
      and/or other obstetric complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence the investigators aim to study the immune response to semen of women that will be&#xD;
      exposed to the culprit semen for the first time compare to women that have been exposed to a&#xD;
      culprit semen more than once previously (namely more than 1 insemination prior to the time of&#xD;
      evaluation). After that, in a prospective cohort study the investigators would follow those&#xD;
      women through their pregnancies and check for different pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this manner, the investigators are hoping to create a screening tool that will help to&#xD;
      predict pregnancy and fetal complications before conception related to maternal immune&#xD;
      responses of paternal antigens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pathophysiology of preeclampsia (PE) likely involves both maternal and fetal/placental&#xD;
      factors. It has been established that poor placentation followed by oxidative&#xD;
      stress/inflammation and abnormalities in the development of placental vasculature early&#xD;
      during pregnancy may result in relative placental ischemia, which then leads to a release of&#xD;
      antiangiogenic factors into the maternal circulation. Thus, it changes the maternal systemic&#xD;
      endothelial function and cause hypertension and other manifestations of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defects in spiral artery remodeling and trophoblast invasion, two related but separate&#xD;
      processes, are characteristic of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and fetal growth&#xD;
      restriction. Still, the exact etiology of PE remains elusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In normal pregnancies, the cytotrophoblast cells of the developing placenta migrate through&#xD;
      the decidua and part of the myometrium to invade both the endothelium and highly muscular&#xD;
      tunica media of the maternal spiral arteries. In addition to that, they alter their adhesion&#xD;
      molecule expression, a process referred to as pseudo-vasculogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By comparison, in PE, cytotrophoblasts fail to penetrate the myometrial segment and fail to&#xD;
      go through pseudo-vasculogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the spiral arteries fail to develop into large, tortuous vascular channels,&#xD;
      resulting in placental hypoperfusion and ischemia. This defect in deep placentation has been&#xD;
      associated with development of multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes like PE, fetal death,&#xD;
      abruptio placentae, IUGR, Preterm labor etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the possible mechanisms responsible for defective trophoblast invasion of the spiral&#xD;
      arteries is defective differentiation of trophoblasts. The focus on immunologic factors as a&#xD;
      possible contributor to abnormal placental development was based, in part, upon the&#xD;
      observation that prior exposure to paternal antigens is inversely correlated with the risk of&#xD;
      preeclampsia. For instance, nulliparous women, women who change partners between pregnancies,&#xD;
      have long interpregnancy intervals, use barrier contraception and conceive via&#xD;
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection, all of which have less exposure to paternal antigens and a&#xD;
      higher risk of developing PE. Moreover, there are also paternal contributions to PE such as a&#xD;
      new partner, limited sperm exposure and the concept of a &quot;dangerous father&quot; (a father&#xD;
      aged&gt;45, obese and with a familial history of early-onset cardiovascular disease or&#xD;
      hypertension). Last but not least, one of the most significant finding in this field is that&#xD;
      donor sperm pregnancies (artificial insemination) which hold no pre-exposure to paternal&#xD;
      antigens are much more likely to lead to PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, oral sex (with the father's baby) was found to protect against PE, a finding&#xD;
      that from an immunological point of view due may be explained by the relatively greater&#xD;
      exposure of sperm antigen to the mother immune system via the buccal mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking it all together the investigators assume that these putative risk factors cannot be&#xD;
      entirely attributed to the maternal nor the paternal side, but to the encounter between those&#xD;
      two. If there isn't an efficient exposure to the paternal antigens before conception, there&#xD;
      is an increased risk for the PE cascade and other pregnancy complications to take place. This&#xD;
      hypothesis can help in explaining the gap in the process that the investigators already&#xD;
      described. It is possible that maternal immune system that doesn't develop tolerance to the&#xD;
      paternal antigens that the seminal fluid carries, doesn't developed an adequate immune&#xD;
      tolerance to the trophoblast cells and due to that, they are being under greater attack&#xD;
      during placentation. Thus, they don't go through a normal differentiation, don't perform&#xD;
      normal pseudo-vasculogenesis and the PE cascade is more likely to be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several immunological mechanisms that support this assumption:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The interaction between NK cells and extra-villous trophoblast cells: In PE, conflict&#xD;
           between maternal and paternal genes is believed to induce abnormal placental&#xD;
           implantation through increased NK cell activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HLA-G: A gene with few alleles, that can be found both in the placental interface and in&#xD;
           the paternal seminal fluid, has a significant role in inhibiting maternal immune&#xD;
           responses against foreign (paternal) antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regulatory T cells (Treg): Much of present thinking seems to involve a critical role for&#xD;
           Treg in maintaining immunological tolerance during pregnancy. It has been suggested that&#xD;
           during evolution, a mechanism of extra-thymic differentiation of Treg emerged in the&#xD;
           placental to enforce maternal-fetal tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men has a clear evolutionary interest in ensuring that the immune system of his female&#xD;
      partner accepts the semi-allogenic fetus. Due to that, he tries to &quot;prime&quot; the woman's immune&#xD;
      system pre-conception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, it is well established that both the maternal immune system and the paternal&#xD;
      alloantigens have a role in the development of PE. Although the specific etiology remains&#xD;
      unclear and can be only hypothesized. Therapies should aim not to suppress the maternal&#xD;
      immune tolerance system but rather to enhance tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators aim is to try and prove that there is a difference in the&#xD;
      immunological reactions to semen prior to conception and that these changes are related to PE&#xD;
      and/or other obstetric complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence the investigators aim to study the immune response to semen of women that will be&#xD;
      exposed to the culprit semen for the first time compare to women that have been exposed to a&#xD;
      culprit semen more than once previously (namely more than 1 insemination prior to the time of&#xD;
      evaluation). After that, in a prospective cohort study the investigators would follow those&#xD;
      women through their pregnancies and check for different pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this manner, the investigators are hoping to create a screening tool that will help to&#xD;
      predict pregnancy and fetal complications before conception related to maternal immune&#xD;
      responses of paternal antigens. If the investigators hypothesize turn out to be true, it can&#xD;
      cause sperm banks all over the world to change their matching protocols and to test seminal&#xD;
      fluid in the maternal blood sample before putting her through artificial insemination with a&#xD;
      poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the best of the investigator's knowledge evaluation of immunological reaction to paternal&#xD;
      seminal fluid in the mother's blood prior conception has never been tried before.&#xD;
