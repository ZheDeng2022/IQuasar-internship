      Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo Controlled Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of DBI-001 Gel&#xD;
      in Patients with Interdigital Tinea pedis (T. pedis). The primary objective is to observe the&#xD;
      antimicrobial effect of a daily application of DBI-001Gel for 4 weeks in patients with&#xD;
      interdigital T. pedis based on the change from culture positive for a dermatophyte to culture&#xD;
      negative as determined by routine mycology culture.&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. A signed Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)&#xD;
                  authorization form which permits the use and disclosure of subject's individually&#xD;
                  identifiable health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Male or Female Subjects of any race 18 years of age and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Women patients of child-bearing potential must: a. Have negative urine pregnancy&#xD;
                  tests prior to study treatment to rule out pregnancy, and b. Use at least one&#xD;
                  method of birth control that results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per&#xD;
                  year) when used consistently and correctly such as implants, injectables,&#xD;
                  combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence&#xD;
                  or vasectomized partner for the duration of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of interdigital T. pedis T. pedis interdigital&#xD;
                  defined as lesions localized to the interdigital spaces or predominantly&#xD;
                  interdigital, but may extend to other areas of the foot (the non-interdigital&#xD;
                  lesions should not be hyperkeratotic, i.e., characteristic of tinea pedis&#xD;
                  moccasin).&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Provisionally confirmed diagnosis at screening by a positive potassium hydroxide&#xD;
                  (KOH) wet mount at the clinical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. A positive dermatophyte culture from the sample obtained at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. The sum of the clinical signs and symptoms scores of at least one web space&#xD;
                  (Target web space) is at least 4 using the Grading of Signs and Symptoms of T.&#xD;
                  pedis including a minimum score of at least 2 for erythema AND a minimum score of&#xD;
                  2 for either scaling/fissures or pruritus/burning (on a scale of 0-3, where 2&#xD;
                  indicates moderate severity).&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Target web space should have adequate amount of leading-edge scale to provide&#xD;
                  enough scale for KOH, fungal culture and molecular diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               5. Subjects that have not undergone the specified washout period(s) or subjects who&#xD;

&#xD;
               6. Subjects that have not undergone the washout periods for systemic medications or&#xD;
                  who require the use of specific systemic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Treatment of any type of cancer within the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. History of any significant internal disease (which contraindicates use of live&#xD;

&#xD;
               9. Subjects who are known to be allergic to any of the Test Article(s) or any&#xD;
                  components in the Test Article(s) or history of hypersensitivity or allergic&#xD;

              12. Diabetes mellitus Type I or II by medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
              13. Peripheral vascular disease based on medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
              14. Any subject not able to meet the study attendance requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
              15. Subjects who have participated in any other trial of an investigational drug or&#xD;
                  device within 30 days prior to enrollment or participation in a research study&#xD;
