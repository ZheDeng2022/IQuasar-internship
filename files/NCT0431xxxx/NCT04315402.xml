  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The race concordance of providers to their patients impacts a patient's investment and agency&#xD;
      in the patient-provider relationship. The mistrust of medicine within the African American&#xD;
      population remains and patients feel unengaged in their care. Race concordant&#xD;
      provider-patient rela-tionships would improve the equity of patient care in our clinic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients of the obstetrics and gynecology resident clinic at Good Samaritan Hospital have&#xD;
      a poor follow-up rate for their gynecologic and prenatal care visits. In addition, patients&#xD;
      oftentimes voice frustration over the care that they receive and sometimes remark that they&#xD;
      feel their provider was &quot;racist.&quot; These patients often have complex social situations that&#xD;
      cannot be solved in one office visit but perhaps the providers' ability to gain the trust of&#xD;
      the minority patients is inadequate. The residents in the OB/GYN program are 80% white with&#xD;
      no African American representation. If patients are unable to connect with caregivers due to&#xD;
      cross-cultural differences, this could be remedied by training current residents in&#xD;
      cross-cultural communication or re-cruitment of a resident class more representative of the&#xD;
      majority African American patient population. This project will provide perspective on the&#xD;
      minority patients' needs in the provider-patient relationship and allow providers to&#xD;
      reexamine their ability to gain trust with the ultimate goal to increase follow-up rates.&#xD;
      Follow-up rates for prenatal care are directly linked to improved maternal and fetal&#xD;
      outcomes. The investigators goals are threefold: to gain clarity on whether or not a more&#xD;
      diverse resident group would be helpful in gaining the trust of patients, to assess the&#xD;
      current state of the well-established historical and generational mistrust of medical care by&#xD;
      the African American patients of the clinic, and to explore how patient perception of their&#xD;
      provider impacts their rate of follow up in the large community hospital clinic.&#xD;
