  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Though potentially eradicable, cervical cancer is the 3rd most prevalent gynecological&#xD;
      cancer, and the 2nd most prevalent before the age of 45. In France, approximately 1100 women&#xD;
      die from cervical cancer each year, with 5-year survival strongly linked to the stage at&#xD;
      diagnosis (93%, 63%, 35% and 16% for stages IA, IIA, IIIA and IVA). The prevention of&#xD;
      cervical cancer is currently based on the combination of the vaccination of adolescent girls&#xD;
      against the most common high-risk oncogenic human papilloma virus types and routine&#xD;
      Papanicolaou cytology (Pap smears) every three years in women aged 25 to 65 years. The Health&#xD;
      and Social Protection Survey conducted by the Institute for Research and Documentation in&#xD;
      Health Economics in 2012 showed that young women who are not vaccinated have a socio-economic&#xD;
      profile similar to that of women who do not attend cervical cancer screening, mainly: (i) the&#xD;
      least screened women and least vaccinated young women live in low-income families; (ii) a low&#xD;
      level of education is associated with fewer Pap smears; (iii) an absence of pap smears in&#xD;
      mothers in the last three years is associated with less human papillomavirus vaccination in&#xD;
      their daughters. Cervical cancer is the female cancer which, in France, has the highest&#xD;
      proportion attributable to precariousness (21.1%), and for which there are strong territorial&#xD;
      disparities in incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several factors may explain the difficulties in obtaining satisfactory rates of screening,&#xD;
      such as geographical remoteness, the disengagement of general practitioners, economic&#xD;
      constraints, or the geographical origin of women. Several countries such as the Netherlands&#xD;
      have started routinely screening for cervical cancer by testing for human papillomavirus.&#xD;
      This approach appears to be as beneficial as a screening campaign based on the Pap smear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach has also just been validated by the French Health Authority which, in its&#xD;
      public health recommendation dated 11 July 2019, states that &quot;From the age of 30, the High&#xD;
      Authority for Health recommends that the human papillomavirus test replace the cytological&#xD;
      examination in primary screening for cervical cancer.&quot; In addition, this recommendation&#xD;
      states that &quot;Vaginal self-sampling is an alternative to cervical sampling by a health&#xD;
      professional to detect the human papillomavirus test for undetected or under-detected women.&#xD;
      This makes it easier to screen women who never get tested or who do not get tested as&#xD;
      recommended.&quot; Moreover, the French Authority for Health specifies &quot;In addition, complementary&#xD;
      studies should be carried out to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the different&#xD;
      modalities for making these vaginal self-samples available, depending on the specific&#xD;
      populations concerned (French Guyana, Mayotte, women living on the street, in shantytowns,&#xD;
      migrant women, with limited access to health services, etc.)&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two French trials show that when women ignored a letter sent to the home to invite them to&#xD;
      receive a Pap smear, only 16 to 18% of women performed vaginal self-sampling when a kit was&#xD;
      subsequently sent to their home. The delivery of a vaginal swab by a health professional does&#xD;
      not increase adherence to screening compared to a reminder letter for a Pap smear (12% vs.&#xD;
      11.9%). Economic incentives may increase adherence to prevention policies, including those&#xD;
      against human papillomavirus infections. They are often used to combat &quot;present bias&quot;, i.e.&#xD;
      the tendency to seek immediate, even limited, satisfaction rather than greater future&#xD;
      satisfaction. A factorial design will be used to analyze the respective contribution of the&#xD;
      delivery of the vaginal swab to a healthcare professional and an economic incentive of 20€.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the the fact of returning the vaginal self-sampling to a health&#xD;
      professional or an economic incentive will increase the participation of socially&#xD;
      disadvantaged women in cervical cancer screening compared to simply returning it by mail&#xD;
      without an incentive. It also postulate that health professionals will encourage women to&#xD;
      perform a vaginal swab and adhere to the recommendations of the French Health Authority in&#xD;
      case of a positive human papillomavirus test and that socially disadvantaged women will&#xD;
      accept vaginal swabbing as a method of cervical cancer screening. Factors such as&#xD;
      precariousness, life and migration paths, the socio-sanitary context, and the provision of&#xD;
      primary care all play a role in prevention behaviors and may explain the heterogeneity of the&#xD;
      observed effects.&#xD;
