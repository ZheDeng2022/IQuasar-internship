      This Continued Access IDE Study includes a subset of former ALERTS trial (NCT00781118)&#xD;
      patients and provides performance data for a refined Guardian implantable medical device&#xD;
      (AMSG3-E) with a new battery designed to extend device longevity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This Continued Access IDE Study is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center (up to 25&#xD;
      sites) study designed to provide performance assessment of a refined Guardian implantable&#xD;
      medical device (AMSG3-E) through controlled access of a replacement Guardian System to a&#xD;
      subset of former ALERTS patients while waiting for FDA approval of the AMSG3-E. The AMSG3-E&#xD;
      contains a drop-in replacement battery designed to extend the life of the implant to&#xD;
      potentially exceed the previous 3-years implant life. Eligible patients will include those&#xD;
      that exited the ALERTS study and chose to leave the device and/or lead in place. Eligible&#xD;
      patients must also continue to meet ALERTS inclusion criteria and not have developed any&#xD;
      exclusion criteria since exiting the ALERTS study.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the investigator's opinion, subject lacks ability to respond appropriately to&#xD;
             alarms, e.g., illiteracy, poor memory or cognitive function, dementia or other&#xD;
             condition affecting memory function, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known compromised tissue at the site of lead implantation in the apex of the right&#xD;
             ventricle, e.g., prior infarct affecting the RV apex location.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A permanent pacemaker or ICD is already in place or the patient is indicated for ICD&#xD;
             or pacemaker implantation based on the guidelines published by the American College of&#xD;
             Cardiology as Class I and IIa recommendations. Class IIb recommendations are at the&#xD;
             investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject cannot feel the IMD vibration when placed on top of the skin on the left&#xD;

             lead to inadequate compliance to the protocol or confusing data interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has clinical conditions such as heart diseases, difficult-to-control blood&#xD;
             pressure, difficult-to-control insulin-dependent diabetes or serious prior infections&#xD;

             seriously affect the subject's current clinical condition during study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
