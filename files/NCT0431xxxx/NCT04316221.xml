    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized controlled trial, the investigators will evaluate the impact of daily egg&#xD;
      consumption during the complementary feeding period in addition to the local standard of&#xD;
      nutrition care (i.e., intervention group), compared to the local standard of nutrition care&#xD;
      alone (i.e., control group) on the following outcomes, in infants that are ~6-month old at&#xD;
      baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Child development, as measured by global development scores (primary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Growth, as measured by anthropometrics (secondary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diet quality, as measured by the World Health Organization infant and young child&#xD;
           feeding indicators (secondary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that daily consumption of eggs during the&#xD;
      complementary feeding period, in addition to the local standard of nutrition care, will&#xD;
      improve child development, growth, and diet quality compared to the local standard of care&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Approximately 150 million children, or roughly one-quarter of children worldwide,&#xD;
      experience stunting (low height-for-age), while 20% are underweight.1 World-wide,&#xD;
      undernutrition is estimated to be responsible for 2.2 million deaths and 21% of&#xD;
      Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in children less than 5 years of age. 1 The recent&#xD;
      United Nations Sustainable Development Goals call for reducing stunting and wasting in&#xD;
      children &lt;5 years by 40%, which would affect 90 million children worldwide 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The global attention to stunting is based on the premise that any intervention aimed at&#xD;
      improving linear growth may subsequently lead to improvements in the correlates of stunting&#xD;
      2. In children, stunting is consistently associated with poor developmental outcomes3.&#xD;
      However, optimal interventions to concurrently address stunting and child development still&#xD;
      need to be identified3-9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Guatemala, stunting is a serious public health problem10,11. The overall prevalence of&#xD;
      stunting in children under 5 years of age in Guatemala is close to 50% and is even higher&#xD;
      (close to 70%) for indigenous children12. The majority of indigenous families in Guatemala&#xD;
      live on less than $2 (USD) per day and have inadequate access to health and nutrition&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wuqu' Kawoq-Maya Health Alliance (MHA) (http://www.wuqukawoq.org) is a non-governmental&#xD;
      organization, located in Tecpán, Guatemala, working with vulnerable indigenous communities to&#xD;
      provide culturally and linguistically appropriate healthcare services. MHA is currently&#xD;
      collaborating with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics/UNM on projects to address&#xD;
      malnutrition in rural Guatemala.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will specifically focus on evaluating the impact of regular egg consumption from&#xD;
      about 6-12 months of age, in addition to the local standard of nutrition care, as an&#xD;
      intervention to improve development, growth and diet quality in Mayan children. Eggs are a&#xD;
      rich source of nutrients important to child growth and development: essential fatty acids,&#xD;
      choline, vitamins A, and B12, and bioavailable iron, zinc and iodine13. Individual components&#xD;
      of eggs may be associated with improved cognitive development in healthy populations, as&#xD;
      recently reviewed by Wallace14. Eggs are culturally acceptable as part of the typical Mayan&#xD;
      diet, are generally more affordable than other animal-source foods and are relatively simple&#xD;
      to store and prepare15. A recent study found that egg consumption (1 egg/d for 6 months)&#xD;
      reduced stunting in mixed-indigenous rural Andean children in Ecuador by 47% (HR: 0.53; 95%&#xD;
      CI: 0.38-0.88);16 however, child cognitive development was not assessed in this small&#xD;
      intervention study. This study will address a gap in understanding the impact of egg&#xD;
      consumption, combined with other common interventions to address undernutrition in low- and&#xD;
      middle-income settings, on both child development and growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a randomized controlled trial involving children ages ~6 to 12 months&#xD;
      from communities in central Guatemala within Wuqu' Kawoq's catchment area (departments of&#xD;
      Chimaltenango, Sololá, Sacatepéquez, Suchitepéquez) individually randomized to either the&#xD;
      intervention or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The control group will receive the local standard of nutrition care only. The standard&#xD;
           of nutrition care in Guatemala includes the following clinical care, as determined to be&#xD;
           necessary by the MHA medical and nutrition teams: frequent growth monitoring, general&#xD;
           nutrition education, parasite treatment, and multiple micronutrient supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The intervention group will receive an intervention to promote daily egg consumption for&#xD;
           a six month period, in addition to the local standard of nutrition care. Specifically,&#xD;
           intervention group participants will be provided with enough eggs for the infant to&#xD;
           consume one egg, daily, for six months, and also with education on preparation and&#xD;
           consumption of eggs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Timeline: The study will enroll 1200 infants into two study groups: intervention&#xD;
      (n=600 children) and control (n=600 children). The study is powered to detect a difference in&#xD;
      effect size of 0.15 for growth, assuming a 20% attrition rate over the course of the six&#xD;
      month study. The investigators used a smaller effect size than found in previous relevant&#xD;
      literature, because the control group in those studies did not also receive the clinical care&#xD;
      that is part of standard of nutrition care in Guatemala, as will be the case in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a rolling recruitment approach. Approximately 40 infants per month will&#xD;
      be enrolled into each study group. The investigators anticipate 15 months of rolling&#xD;
      recruitment, with final subjects finishing the study at ~21 months after beginning&#xD;
      recruitment. The expected total duration of the study, including data analysis and&#xD;
      dissemination, is approximately 3 years from the date of IRB approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual participants and their caregivers will have approximately 10-12 hours of contact&#xD;
      with the research team over about 6 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study enrollment (visits to recruit, assess eligibility, and complete the informed&#xD;
           consent process) is anticipated to take ~total 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary study data collection time points will be at 0 months (baseline) and 6&#xD;
           months (end of standard of care/egg intervention). It is anticipated that each of these&#xD;
           study data collection visits will last approximately 1-2 hours (~total 2-4 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have six ~60 minute visits with MHA field staff (~total 6 hours).&#xD;
           At those visits, all participants will receive the nutrition standard of care and be&#xD;
           screened for development of an egg allergy. The intervention group will also receive&#xD;
           eggs and egg related education, and answer brief questions about adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Setting: The study will be conducted with communities in Wuqu' Kawoq's catchment&#xD;
      area (departments of Chimaltenango, Sololá, Sacatepéquez, Suchitepéquez) in central&#xD;
      Guatemala. The primary language spoken in this area is Kaqchikel. MHA has been providing&#xD;
      primary care and nutrition services in this area for over a decade and collaborates closely&#xD;
      with Ministry of Health staff and multiple other non-governmental organizations in the&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All recruitment, enrollment and study-related procedures will be conducted in the homes of&#xD;
      the subjects. All study procedures will be conducted by MHA staff. The study will be locally&#xD;
      overseen and approved by MHA's IRB.&#xD;
