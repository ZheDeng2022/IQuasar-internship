      In this study, we will focus on the independent prognostic relevance of the expressions of&#xD;
      CD38, CD4, CD56, CD11b and CD19 markers in immune cells with platelet changes in patients&#xD;
      with newly diagnosed and chronic ITP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), previously called idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, is an&#xD;
      autoimmune disorder characterized by a severe reduction in peripheral blood platelet count.&#xD;
      In healthy individuals, normal platelet count ranges from 150-450 × 109/L, while in&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia counts fall to less than 100 × 109/L ( Provan et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on duration, ITP is differentiated into three phases. Newly diagnosed ITP occurs within&#xD;
      3 months of diagnosis, persistent ITP is present 3-12 months after diagnosis, and chronic ITP&#xD;
      lasts &gt;12 months since diagnosis (Roberto, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autoantibodies against platelet glycoproteins (GPs), including GPIIb/IIIa and GPIb/IX, have&#xD;
      been considered to play a crucial role in ITP (Nomura, 2016) . In addition to platelet&#xD;
      destruction, impaired maturation of megakaryocytes can be associated with reduced platelet&#xD;
      production in ITP (Muna et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, considerable attention has been recently paid to the dysregulation of a new&#xD;
      B-cell subset known as regulatory B cells (Breg) in ITP (Li et al., 2012). This B-cell subset&#xD;
      is characterized by CD19+CD38+ expression, promoting peripheral tolerance and reducing the&#xD;
      function of autoreactive T-helper (Th) CD4+ cells via production of interleukin 10 (IL-10)&#xD;
      (Flores-Borja et al., 2013). So they are an interesting cell population in diseases&#xD;
      characterized by an unbalance in the immune system, such as autoimmune diseases, chronic&#xD;
      infections, cancer and graft rejection.( Horikawa et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ITP, as a result of the defective function of Breg and also Treg (regulatory T) cells,&#xD;
      platelet autoreactive Th CD4+ cells undergo clonal expansion (McKenzie et al., 2013). so the&#xD;
      presence of activated platelet-specific autoreactive T cells that respond to autologous&#xD;
      platelet antigens participating in autoantibody production in ITP via interaction with&#xD;
      autoreactive B cells (Solanilla et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the early 1980s, many studies have documented decreased natural killer (NK) cell&#xD;
      numbers and impairment of NK cell function in the peripheral blood of patients with&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's&#xD;
      syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and type I diabetes (hussein et al., 2017). Furthermore, in&#xD;
      many studies, a correlation has been found between NK cell number and activity with disease&#xD;
      progression or remission in multiple sclerosis (MS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).&#xD;
      (Riccieri et al., 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nk cells are identified by the expression of CD16 and CD56 surface markers, account for 5-15%&#xD;
      of PB cells in healthy individuals .NK cells have a crucial role in the initial defense&#xD;
      against infections in innate immunity and are particularly important in responding to viral&#xD;
      infections (French and Yokoyama., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This finding suggests that CD16+CD56+ NK cells may play a role in the pathogenesis and&#xD;
      prognosis of autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD11b+ monocytes can regulate adaptive immunity by adjustment of different T-cell subsets&#xD;
      (Kusmartsev et al., 2000). Recently showed that monocytes derived from the whole blood of&#xD;
      chronic ITP patients promoted the development of Th CD4+ subset (Zhong et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the majority of these abnormalities can appear as the increased or decreased&#xD;
      expressions of some CD markers in the involved cells, there have been few studies on the&#xD;
      prognostic value of CD markers' expressions in immune cells for ITP.&#xD;
