  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although acute rheumatic fever (ARF) has declined in Europe and North America in incidence&#xD;
      over the past 4 to 6 decades, the disease remains one of the most important causes of&#xD;
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality especially in the developing countries that are home&#xD;
      to the majority of the world's population(1), Incidence rates in these countries still reach&#xD;
      epidemic levels(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, most patients with RHD do not have documented histories of ARF, and they present&#xD;
      with late complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmia, stroke, endocarditis, or&#xD;
      pregnancy-related complications(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiographic screening according to revised jones criteria (2015) (1) is the most&#xD;
      reliable way of detecting RHD in asymptomatic people, and it can identify large numbers of&#xD;
      previously undetected cases(4-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with RHD detected by screening can receive appropriate cardiac care, including&#xD;
      guideline-recommended secondary prophylaxis(7). This may be a cost-effective approach to&#xD;
      managing RHD in groups at high risk in Assiut Governate(8). Nevertheless, large scale&#xD;
      screening has not been undertaken, and studies are underway to determine the best models for&#xD;
      sustainable targeted screening and to evaluate the impact of screening and treatment on&#xD;
      clinical outcomes(9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aimed to determine the role of echocardiographic screening for detecting&#xD;
      undiagnosed RHD, and to estimate the prevalence of RHD in Assiut Governate.&#xD;
