  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is considered an epidemic disease with the 463 million affected patients (between&#xD;
      20-79 years) and it is estimated that 578 million people will have diabetes by 2030 [1].&#xD;
      According to The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) reports, 4,2 million adults were&#xD;
      considered to die due to diabetes and its complications in 2019. Because of this situation,&#xD;
      diabetes treatment is so important. The recommendations for the treatment of DM include&#xD;
      medications and lifestyle management, which includes physical activity (PA), medical&#xD;
      nutrition therapy, smoking cessation counseling, and psychosocial care. PA is an important&#xD;
      aspect of management that directly under the control of the patients. So the investigators&#xD;
      want to interrogate the effect of exercise on blood parameters, blood pressure, body&#xD;
      compositions.&#xD;

      The data of the participants who came to the sports center where is prepared for the diabetes&#xD;
      patients in the hospital will be collected from the past registration files on the electronic&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographic data, blood values and bio-impedance measurements of each patient are&#xD;
      collected coming to the sports center, routinely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who had missing data, patients who did not complete the 3-month exercise program&#xD;
      were excluded from the analysis. All analyses were performed using the Statistical Package&#xD;
      for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22. 0 for Windows. Data are expressed as mean ±&#xD;
      standard deviation. The one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to assess the&#xD;
      distribution of data. Due to their distribution, numerical variables in different subjects&#xD;
      were compared with the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Comparison of variables before and&#xD;
      after the exercise program were compared by the paired t-test (parametric variable) or&#xD;
      Wilcoxon test (non-parametric variable). Probability values were two-tailed, and a p-value of&#xD;
      less than 0.05 was considered as significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All assessments were performed in the clinic at baseline and end of the 3rd month. The blood&#xD;
      samples were collected. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) were measured&#xD;
      with an automatic arm BP monitor before and after every session. Body mass and body&#xD;
      composition, including percent body fat, fat and fat-free mass, were determined using a&#xD;
      bioelectric impedance system with the electrodes in contact with soles and heels of both&#xD;
      feet. At the baseline and end of the third month, the same person repeated all assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients had recruited 3 sessions a week for 3 months (Monday/Wednesday/Friday). Every&#xD;
      session consisted of aerobic exercise protocol and warm-up, cooldown period. Patients aerobic&#xD;
      loading capacity was calculated before the every session using by Karvonen formula as&#xD;
      submaximal loading.&#xD;
