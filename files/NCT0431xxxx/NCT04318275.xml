      This study aims to explore a novel objective measurement for endometriosis-related pain. A&#xD;
      variety of pain symptoms are associated with endometriosis, including dysmenorrhea,&#xD;
      dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia and chronic pelvic pain. However, a clear characterization of&#xD;
      pain typology and topology in populations with endometriosis, other gynecologic pathology, or&#xD;
      a normal pelvis is lacking. Understanding the precise nature of the relationship between pain&#xD;
      and endometriosis is important for the clinical management of affected women, given the body&#xD;
      of evidence indicating that medical and surgical management for pain associated with&#xD;
      endometriosis has been shown to be effective. Evaluating the relationship between pain and&#xD;
      endometriosis, however, is challenging given that pain is difficult to measure and the&#xD;
      mechanism by which endometriosis causes pain is not well understood. While previous studies&#xD;
      have provided important data on the incidence of pelvic pain and endometriosis, little&#xD;
      research has been done to assess both the typology and topology of pelvic pain, pain beyond&#xD;
      the pelvis, endometriosis diagnosis, or severity of pain using operative findings and a&#xD;
      standardized classification system.&#xD;

      A variety of pain symptoms are associated with endometriosis, including dysmenorrhea,&#xD;
      dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia and chronic pelvic pain. However, a clear characterization of&#xD;
      pain typology and topology in populations with endometriosis, other gynecologic pathology, or&#xD;
      a normal pelvis is lacking. Understanding the precise nature of the relationship between pain&#xD;
      and endometriosis is important for the clinical management of affected women, given the body&#xD;
      of evidence indicating that medical and surgical management for pain associated with&#xD;
      endometriosis has been shown to be effective. Evaluating the relationship between pain and&#xD;
      endometriosis, however, is challenging given that pain is difficult to measure and the&#xD;
      mechanism by which endometriosis causes pain is not well understood. While previous studies&#xD;
      have provided important data on the incidence of pelvic pain and endometriosis, little&#xD;
      research has been done to assess both the typology and topology of pelvic pain, and pain&#xD;
      beyond the pelvis, and endometriosis diagnosis and severity using operative findings and a&#xD;
      standardized classification system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, pain has been measured using subjective scales to determine the presence of&#xD;
      pain and its severity. Common scales include the numeric rating scale (NRS), visual analog&#xD;
      scale (VAS), and visual response scale (VRS) While this is important information,&#xD;
      self-reporting is a problematic metric for both diagnostic and research purposes as it&#xD;
      depends on pain history, cognitive and behavioral factors, and can vary over time. Other&#xD;
      measures used in clinical practice, such as the Biberoglu and Behrman (B&amp;B) score,&#xD;
      incorporate both patient and clinician assessments of pain. However, patients describe&#xD;
      symptomatology and gynecologists evaluate tenderness and induration during physical&#xD;
      examination with an exceedingly high risk of bias and inconsistent reproducibility. Over the&#xD;
      past few years, significant advances have been made in the development of valid biomarkers or&#xD;
      surrogate markers for the presence and severity of pain. Measurement of various physiology&#xD;
      parameters like heart rate, heart rate variability and electrodermal activity have shown to&#xD;
      be associated with the presence of pain and can aid clinical interpretation.&#xD;
