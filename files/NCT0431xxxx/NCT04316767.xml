  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Family members of critically ill (ICU) patients are at risk for developing significant&#xD;
      symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress during and after the ICU&#xD;
      experience. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a form of therapy that can help individuals cope&#xD;
      with stressful events in a more active and effective way. This study will examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a smartphone self-care app delivering cognitive behavioral therapy in&#xD;
      decreasing the psychological symptoms suffered by ICU family members. Half of the sample will&#xD;
      receive the self-care app and half of the study sample will receive the usual supportive care&#xD;
      given to family members of ICU patients. The researchers anticipate the self-care app will&#xD;
      diminish the severity of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms experienced&#xD;
      by ICU family members.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family members of critically ill patients suffer symptoms of post-intensive care&#xD;
      syndrome-family (PICS-F), including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      with a diminished quality of life. These symptoms persist long after the episode of critical&#xD;
      illness and can linger for years. Cognitive behavioral therapy has become the primary&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatment of an increasing list of psychological symptoms and disorders,&#xD;
      including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress. For mild-to-moderate symptoms,&#xD;
      mobile technology delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy without input from a clinician has&#xD;
      been found to be feasible and well-accepted with efficacy that rivals face-to-face therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the efficacy of smartphone delivery of&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy via a mobile health app (intervention) on the severity and&#xD;
      prevalence of PICS-F symptoms in family members of critically ill patients. The study will&#xD;
      include family members of critically ill patients admitted to two 26-bed ICUs at the Akron&#xD;
      campus of Summa Health System. A prospective, repeated measures, longitudinal design with&#xD;
      randomization to two groups (control, intervention) will be employed. Primary outcome&#xD;
      measures will include symptoms of PICS-F (anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress),&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, and mental health self-efficacy measured at enrollment, 30&#xD;
      days after enrollment, and 60 days after enrollment. App usage over the course of the study&#xD;
      (number of logins, total time spent with app) will be obtained at the final time point of the&#xD;
      study (60 days after enrollment). A sample size of 60 family members is planned for this&#xD;
      pilot study (30 intervention, 30 control). The sample size was determined according to the&#xD;
      recommendations of Whitehead et al.estimating an a priori small effect size and an attrition&#xD;
      rate of 30% derived from previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine the prevalence and severity of PICS-F symptoms (anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress), health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and mental health&#xD;
      self-efficacy (MHSE) in family decision makers of critically ill patients and their change&#xD;
      over time (enrollment, 30 days, 60 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine differences in PICS-F symptom severity, HRQOL, and MHSE in family decision&#xD;
      makers of critically ill patients receiving a mobile health app (MHapp) intervention compared&#xD;
      to family members receiving standard care and support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Determine the relationship between the dose of the MHapp (total time spent with the&#xD;
      app, total log-ins) over the course of the study (60 days) and changes in PICS-F symptom&#xD;
      severity (anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress), HRQOL, and MHSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis and Statistical Plan: Data will be analyzed using Statistics Package for the&#xD;
      Social Sciences (SPSS, Version 25) software. Descriptive statistics will be used to assess&#xD;
      frequencies and variability of the data, coding inaccuracies, outliers, and missing data. The&#xD;
      statistical plan for each specific aim is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: The investigators will report study variables with descriptive statistics. Change over&#xD;
      time will be examined with repeated measures ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Differences between intervention and control groups will be assessed with student's&#xD;
      t-test. Differences between groups in regard to severity of PICS-F symptoms will be used to&#xD;
      calculate effect size for the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Relationship between total MHapp dose and longitudinal change in study variables will&#xD;
      be examined with Pearson's correlation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human Subjects and Ethical Issues: The research presents no more than minimal psychological&#xD;
      risk or harm, largely from the possibility that answering the questions on the anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, and stress instruments may be distressing for participants. Psychological risk&#xD;
      will be minimized by emphasizing that study participants can stop participating in the study&#xD;
      at any time and are not obligated to answer any question that they find distressing. Family&#xD;
      members who endorse clinically significant symptoms will be referred to their primary care&#xD;
      physician. Family members of patients who die during the study will be referred to local&#xD;
      bereavement support groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a low risk of privacy or confidentiality loss. Risk will be minimized by the&#xD;
      following measures: (a) the only record linking the participant and the research data is the&#xD;
      consent document; (b) consent documents will be kept in a locked cabinet in the locked office&#xD;
      of the PI; (c) data will be entered and stored by the RA on REDCap, a secure, HIPAA-compliant&#xD;
      web-based platform; (d) all data files obtained for analysis will be stored on a&#xD;
      password-protected laptop computer stored in a locked room; and (e) The PI, co-investigators,&#xD;
      and research assistant (RA) are the only individuals with access to the data files.&#xD;
