  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenocarcinoma's of the pancreas and periampullary region (distal bile duct, ampulla of Vater&#xD;
      and duodenum) are cancers with a poor survival. Good preoperative TNM staging is important to&#xD;
      determine the appropriate therapy and prognosis. An important negative prognostic factor is&#xD;
      the presence of para-aortic lymph node (LN) metastases which are regarded as distant&#xD;
      metastases and precluding a curative resection. Determining LN status, however, is&#xD;
      challenging. Ferrotran, (SPL Medical) an ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO)&#xD;
      particle, has proven to be a valuable contrast agent for detecting LN metastases of solid&#xD;
      tumours, like prostate and breast cancer, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to validate USPIO-MRI to pathology in patients with pancreatic or periampullary&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a devastating disease with a dismal prognosis which&#xD;
      has not improved substantially in the past 40 years. A good preoperative TNM staging is of&#xD;
      importance to determine the appropriate therapy and prognosis. An important negative&#xD;
      prognostic factor is the presence of para-aortic lymph node metastases which are regarded as&#xD;
      distant metastases and therefore precludes a curative resection of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In only 33% of cases para-aortic lymph node metastases are detected preoperatively, due to&#xD;
      the low sensitivity of CT and conventional MRI. Moreover, after a curative resection in 70%&#xD;
      of patients liver metastases or a local recurrence of disease occurs usually in the lymph&#xD;
      nodes of the mesenteric root and in the para-aortic lymph nodes. This suggests that at the&#xD;
      time of surgery micrometastases in the liver and lymph nodes were already present.&#xD;
      Determining lymph node status preoperatively, however, is a challenge. Ferumoxtran-10, an&#xD;
      ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particle has proven to be a valuable contrast&#xD;
      agent for detecting lymph node metastases using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in various&#xD;
      types of cancer (also called nano-MRI). With this study we would like to validate the results&#xD;
      of this technique with pathology in patients with pancreatic or periampullary (duodenal,&#xD;
      papilla of Vater or distal bile duct) cancer, i.e. in all patients with adenocarcinoma in the&#xD;
      pancreatic region. Ultimately improved preoperative staging of pancreatic and periampullary&#xD;
      cancer leads to an improved treatment stratification plan. Demonstration of para-aortic lymph&#xD;
      nodes could prevent an unnecessary operation with its associated morbidity and mortality and&#xD;
      therefore improve quality of life. Additionally, if metastatic lymph nodes are present, it&#xD;
      could complement image guided focal therapies on lymph node metastases such as radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective is to improve preoperative staging with 3TESLA (3T) NANO-MRI regarding&#xD;
      the detection of lymph node metastases in patients with a pancreatic or periampullary&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma when compared to a conventional contrast-enhanced CT with histopathology as&#xD;
      gold standard. Other objectives are to improve a) the detection of liver metastases, b) the&#xD;
      delineation of the tumor and c) the determination of local vessel ingrowth by the tumor. A&#xD;
      more fundamentally oriented objective aims to detect &quot;tumor associated macrophages&quot; in a&#xD;
      pancreatic carcinoma with an in vivo 3T NANO-MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a high index of suspicion of pancreatic or periampullary cancer, who are&#xD;
      planned for surgery, but will not receive neo-adjuvant radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be administering the USPIO contrast agent ferumoxtran-10 and between 24 and 36 hours&#xD;
      later will perform a 3 Tesla MRI scan of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity and specificity both on a nodal level and on a patient level of the 3T MRI scan&#xD;
      with USPIO contrast agent for detecting lymph node metastases in pancreatic and periampullary&#xD;
      cancer. Sensitivity and specificity both on a lesion level and on a patient level of the 3T&#xD;
      MRI scan with USPIO contrast agent for detecting liver metastases in pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
      Delineation of the tumor on USPIO-MRI compared to contrast-enhanced CT. Sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of the 3T MRI scan with USPIO contrast agent regarding ingrowth of tumor into the&#xD;
      portomesenteric veins, the superior mesenteric artery and celiac trunc. Detection of tumor&#xD;
      associated macrophages in pancreatic or periampullary adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
