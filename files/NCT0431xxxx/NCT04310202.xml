    <textblock>
      This multi-centre study funded by Oticon Medical AB will be conducted at seven hospitals&#xD;
      across Europe (UK, Spain, Denmark). Patients with a hearing loss and that are already planned&#xD;
      for treatment with a percutaneous (through the skin) bone-anchored hearing system (BAHS) will&#xD;
      be included in the study. A total of 50 patients will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the rate of successful BAHS use after&#xD;
      implantation of the Ponto Biohelix (BHX) Implant system.&#xD;

      This multi-centre study funded by Oticon Medical AB will be conducted at seven hospitals&#xD;
      across Europe (UK, Spain, Denmark). Patients with a hearing loss and that are already planned&#xD;
      for treatment with a percutaneous (through the skin) bone-anchored hearing system (BAHS) will&#xD;
      be included in the study. A total of 50 patients will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the rate of successful BAHS use after&#xD;
      implantation of the Ponto BHX Implant system. The implant, coupled to a skin-penetrating&#xD;
      abutment, is implanted in the bone behind the ear and is later loaded with a sound processor&#xD;
      which transforms sound waves to sound vibrations that can be sent directly to the inner ear&#xD;
      via the skull bone. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the proportion of&#xD;
      implant/abutment complexes providing a reliable anchorage for a sound processor, 3 months&#xD;
      after implantation/surgery.&#xD;
