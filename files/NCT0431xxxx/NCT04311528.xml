      This study will evaluate the immunogenicity of the 9-valent HPV vaccine in post-partum women&#xD;
      age 16-45.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women age 16-45 who are pregnant or who have just delivered will be eligible to participate&#xD;
      in a study involving the 9-valent HPV vaccine. For clarification, women who are pregnant are&#xD;
      eligible to sign consent, but the first vaccine will not occur until after delivery. Vaccine&#xD;
      # 1 must occur within seven days of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to determine the immunogenicity of the vaccine in&#xD;
      postpartum women. The immunogenicity results will be compared to that of non-postpartum women&#xD;
      of the same age, 16-45.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will participate for approximately 12 months and will complete a total of 4 visits&#xD;
      during that time frame.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Able to fully understand study procedures, alternative treatments available, the risks&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder that would contraindicate&#xD;
             intramuscular injections&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is currently immunocompromised or has been diagnosed as having a congenital or&#xD;
             acquired immunodeficiency, HIV infection, lymphoma, leukemia, systemic lupus&#xD;
             erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Is receiving or has received in the year prior to enrollment the following&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapies: radiation therapy, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine,&#xD;
             methotrexate, any chemotherapy, cyclosporin, leflunomide, TNF-α antagonists,&#xD;
             monoclonal antibody therapies (including rituximab), intravenous gamma globulin&#xD;
             (IVIG), antilymphocyte sera, or other therapy known to interfere with the immune&#xD;
             response. With regard to systemic corticosteroids, a subject will be excluded if she&#xD;
             is currently receiving steroid therapy, has recently (within 2 weeks of enrollment)&#xD;
             received such therapy, or has received 2 or more courses of high dose corticosteroids&#xD;

             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received any immune globulin product (including RhoGAM™) or other blood- derived&#xD;
             product within 3 months prior to Day 1 vaccination or plans to receive such product&#xD;
             during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a marketed HPV vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had a fever of &gt; 100° within 24-hour period prior to the Day 1 vaccination&#xD;
