  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As part of the EMPATIA @ Lecco project, task 2.9 and task 4.5 respectively provide for the&#xD;
      refinement and testing of robotic solutions on the market oriented towards patient&#xD;
      empowerment. Within the LARA project, the JACO2 mechanical arm (Kinova Technology, Montreal,&#xD;
      QC, Canada), a medical device, which can perform some functions as if it were the subject's&#xD;
      arm, will be tested. JACO2 can be controlled by joystick, supplied with the system, or by&#xD;
      voice control system, developed by CNR-ITIA to allow use even for those with severe strength&#xD;
      impairments. The trial will involve patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), Becker&#xD;
      Muscular Dystrophy (BMD), Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD), congenital and&#xD;
      Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSH) over the age of 10 years. In literature of the&#xD;
      last decade we find evidence of social and personal benefits deriving from the use of&#xD;
      assistive mechanical arms in daily life activities by patients with disabilities due to&#xD;
      neuromuscular diseases. The results indicate improved quality of life, greater self-esteem&#xD;
      and greater integration into society. In addition to the benefits for the person, it has been&#xD;
      shown that the introduction of assistive technologies in the life of patients can lead to&#xD;
      potential savings on direct and indirect costs of National Health Services. Assistive robotic&#xD;
      arms have a potential user base of approximately 150,000 people only in the United States of&#xD;
      America. This population includes subjects who have partially lost the function of the upper&#xD;
      limb due to degenerative diseases or because of spinal cord injuries or infantile cerebral&#xD;
      palsy. The number of potential users could increase by improving the usability of these&#xD;
      systems that, at the moment, still require a certain functionality of the upper limb, in&#xD;
      general, and of the hand, in particular. It is in fact known that the introduction of&#xD;
      assistive technologies in daily life is not limited so much by the fact that patients do not&#xD;
      accept or profit from them, but rather by the actual possibility of using them effectively.&#xD;
      Therefore, a customization of the functionality of the devices based on needs and wishes of&#xD;
      the patients alongside an improvement in their usability would lead to an increase in&#xD;
      potential users. It is for this reason that usability, together with safety, has become one&#xD;
      of the most studied topics in assistive robotics. In the case of assistive robotic&#xD;
      manipulators, usability problems often concern their control which, even today, takes place&#xD;
      through the use of joysticks that require fine motor skills in the hand. In fact, being&#xD;
      systems with multiple degrees of freedom, that is, equipped with different segments that can&#xD;
      translate (or rotate) in different directions, different buttons are integrated in the&#xD;
      control joysticks in addition to the classic lever with knob. From this emerges the need to&#xD;
      develop alternative joystick control methods that do not involve the use of the hand.&#xD;
