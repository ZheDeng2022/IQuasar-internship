  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate if a cognitive treatment targeting&#xD;
      obsessive beliefs in patients with aggressive obsessions is feasible and effective as an&#xD;
      online treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder who presents with aggressive obsessions (also&#xD;
      known as taboo thoughts e.g. fear of being a pedophile) and mental rituals have shown to&#xD;
      respond less well to treatment. Thus, there is room for further innovation. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this pilot study is to investigate if an internet-based cognitive therapy (I-CT)&#xD;
      is feasible and effective in reducing the frequency and distress of aggressive obsessions.&#xD;
      The study will also investigate if I-CT is associated with any significant side effects.&#xD;
      Another objective of this study is to get a power estimate of the treatment effects for a&#xD;
      subsequent randomized controlled study (RCT). This will be done by using an open pilot study&#xD;
      with repeated measurements.&#xD;

    <description>The treatment is an online cognitive therapy consisting of a structured self-help program over ten weeks, divided into eight modules, administered in an encrypted web platform. The program is based on the treatment manual &quot;The treatment of Obsessions&quot; by Stanley Rachman. In this treatment, the participant is recommended to perform daily exercises in order to identify and modify interpretations made about the importance of their obsessive thoughts. A designated therapist have email contact with the participant within the encrypted platform.</description>
