  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increasing number of children undergo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In MRI, radio&#xD;
      waves and magnetism are used to form images of the body's interior, to diagnose and&#xD;
      monitoring diseases in children. Many children are sedated to be able to collaborate with the&#xD;
      MRI procedure. Sedation and general anesthesia cause the child to some extent to lose the&#xD;
      ability to regulate his or her own bodytemperature. MRI rooms are most often cold due to the&#xD;
      function of the magnet, leading to a risk of hypothermia in young children. Conversely, the&#xD;
      MRI scanner generates radio frequencies that are absorbed by the body and converted to heat,&#xD;
      which especially in small children due to their large surface area can potentially result in&#xD;
      an increase in bodytemperature. In this study we therefore want to investigate changes in&#xD;
      bodytemperature in children who are undergoing MRI- scanning within the Neuroanesthesiology&#xD;
      Clinic. Furthermore, we want to define possible risk factors for possible temperature&#xD;
      changes. Our hypothesis: Children undergoing MRI scanning increase in bodytemperature.&#xD;

      Ear temperature is measured as we are primarily interested in describing temperature changes&#xD;
      in the individual child and because this method is less invasive than the alternatives.&#xD;

    <measure>Delta temperature ∆Tp = post-temperature - pre-temperature. Delta temperature is defined as the average temperature difference between pre-scan and post scan temperature measurement in right and left ear canal of the child before and after MRI scan.</measure>
    <time_frame>Ear temperature scan within 5 minuts before and after MRI right outside the MRI suite.</time_frame>
    <description>The average of the temperature measured in the two ear canals is used if the difference is less than 0.5 degrees. If the temperature difference between the two ear canals exceeds 0.5 degrees, it is assumed that the lowest temperature is an error measurement e.g. due to physical block of the ear canal. In that case, the highest temperature measured in one of the two ear canals is used.</description>
