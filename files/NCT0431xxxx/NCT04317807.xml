  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week study of levetiracetam added to a second generation antipsychotic in early&#xD;
      psychosis patients who have been ill for less than 5 years and continue to experience&#xD;
      psychotic symptoms despite at least 8 weeks of antipsychotic treatment. Levetiracetam&#xD;
      (Keppra) is a medication approved for the treatment of epilepsy; it reduces excessive&#xD;
      activity in the brain. This study will test the hypotheses that adding levetiracetam will&#xD;
      improve psychotic symptoms that are unresponsive to antipsychotic treatment and will protect&#xD;
      the brain from atrophy (volume loss). .&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will complete screening and baseline visits before being randomized in a 2:1&#xD;
      ratio to levetiracetam or placebo added to the antipsychotic medication. They will complete&#xD;
      weekly study visits for the first 4 weeks (Baseline, Weeks 2-4) and then additional visits at&#xD;
      Week 6, 8, and 12. Participants will be studied both by assessing change in symptom severity&#xD;
      and cognitive performance over the 12 weeks as well as using an imaging measure of&#xD;
      hippocampal volume integrity at baseline and week 12. After completing Week 12 or decision to&#xD;
      withdraw prematurely from the study, participants will complete a 9 day medication tapering&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;

    <time_frame>up to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of levetiracetam 500 mg bid vs. placebo on symptoms will be measured by the BPRS total score. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is an 24-item scale that measures positive symptoms, negative symptoms, general psychopathology and affective symptoms. Individual items are scored on a seven point likert scale. A higher score on the BPRS items indicate increased severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compared to placebo, levetiracetam will improve psychotic symptoms measured by the BPRS psychosis subscale.</measure>

    <measure>Compare to placebo, levetiracetam will improve negative symptoms measured by the modified SANS total score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit (week 0), Week 12 visit</time_frame>
    <description>Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) will be the instrument for measurement of negative symptoms. Factor analysis has revealed good construct validity for all items of the SANS scale except the Attention subscale which clusters with measures of cognitive impairment rather than negative symptoms. Two, three and five domain models have been proposed based on factor analysis; this research will use the total score (minus the Attention Subscale) and the two factor solution (avolition and affective expression) to measure negative symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Compared to placebo, levetiracetam will improve cognitive functioning measured by the MATRICS composite score.</measure>

    <description>Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery is the standard tool for assessing cognitive change in trials of cognitive-enhancing agents in schizophrenia. It will be administered at baseline, week 6 and at week 12 to measure whether cognitive function has increased.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will receive 500 mg of levetiracetam twice daily for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, levetiracetam will be gradually decreased and stopped over the next 9 days. Questionnaires will be administered at each visit to examine how participants are responding to the treatment. In addition, a brain scan and cognitive testing will be performed when feasible at the beginning and the end of the study.</description>

    <description>Levetiracetam is an anticonvulsant that is frequently used to treat epilepsy in children and adults due to its superior tolerability, ease of use and excellent safety profile. It is rapidly absorbed and rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier. Levetiracetam does not affect metabolism of antipsychotic drugs and may normalize hippocampal hyperactivity by decreasing excessive glutamatergic and dopaminergic transmission, thereby making it an ideal agent to test the hypothesis that reducing excessive hippocampal activity may enhance treatment of early psychosis and prevent antipsychotic toxicity. Levetiracetam will be administered in 500 mg capsules twice a day.</description>

    <description>The placebo pill (sugar pill) will look just like the levetiracetam pill but does not contain levetiracetam. Placebo will be taken along with optimal antipsychotic medication selected by either the outpatient provider or the hospital staff responsible for the participant's care. Participants will be instructed to take the placebo pill twice daily for 12 weeks.</description>
