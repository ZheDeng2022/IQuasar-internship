  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, 30-day research study that is exploring the effects of two simplified&#xD;
      mindfulness interventions in lung cancer patients aimed to improve their sleep quality and&#xD;
      anxiety regarding sleep. The investigators will be enrolling a total of 20 patients who have&#xD;
      insomnia symptoms. Patients will use a behavioral intervention to help with their sleep.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to implement and examine the outcomes of a simplified relaxation&#xD;
      intervention, Assisted Relaxation Therapy (ART), for lung cancer patients who experience&#xD;
      insomnia symptoms and other sleep difficulties. This intervention includes using a smartphone&#xD;
      application called mPhenomic to monitor adherence to the study protocol. A variety of surveys&#xD;
      will be used to track the interventions' efficacy throughout the study. To test these&#xD;
      interventions, the investigators will recruit participants (n=20) from a weekly oncology&#xD;
      patient list located within the University of Pennsylvania. Participants with a history of&#xD;
      lung cancer who are recruited into the study must have a smartphone. Participants will use&#xD;
      the ART intervention over the course of 2 weeks and will receive surveys at enrollment (D0),&#xD;
      end of intervention (D14) and 2 weeks post-intervention (D30). Missing data will be handled&#xD;
      using imputation methods. The investigators will analyze the data using statistical programs&#xD;
      to determine progress throughout the study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This will be conducted as a parallel group, single-blinded pilot study for reducing insomnia among lung cancer patients. All subjects will participate in some form of insomnia treatment over a fourteen-day period. Participants eligible and enrolled in the study will be randomized into one of the two arms, which consist of the two different ART. Randomization and survey baseline measurements from eligible participants will occur on day -1 and the intervention period will last until day fourteen. On day thirty, two weeks post intervention(s), surveys will be emailed to participants to track any change in sleep quality, respiratory quality, and perception of sleep.</intervention_model_description>
