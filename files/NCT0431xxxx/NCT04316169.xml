      (HCQ/ Plaquenil), inducing apoptosis leading to tumor regression.&#xD;

      Part 1: 3+3 dose escalation of HCQ combined with abemaciclib in advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: HCQ at top-dose level from part one is combined with abemaciclib and endocrine&#xD;
      therapy in HR+/Her 2- advanced breast cancer (ABC) and divided into two cohorts based on&#xD;
      prior exposure to endocrine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dose-escalation cohort: To determine safety and tolerability of HCQ combined with&#xD;
           abemaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dose-expansion cohort: To determine safety and tolerability of HCQ combined with&#xD;
           abemaciclib and endocrine therapy in HR+/Her2- ABC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the clinical efficacy of HCQ in combination with abemaciclib and hormone&#xD;
           blockade in the dose- expansion cohort of advanced ER- positive breast cancer&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the clinical efficacy of HCQ in combination with abemaciclib in the dose-&#xD;
           escalation cohort&#xD;

         16. Patients who previously received chemotherapy must have recovered (Common Terminology&#xD;
             Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade ≤1) from the acute effects of chemotherapy&#xD;
             except for residual alopecia or grade 2 peripheral neuropathy prior to randomization.&#xD;
             A washout period of at least 21 days is required between last chemotherapy dose and&#xD;

&#xD;
         17. Patients who received palliative radiotherapy must have completed and fully recovered&#xD;
             from the acute effects of radiotherapy. A washout period of at least 14 days is&#xD;
             required between end of palliative radiotherapy and first dose of the study drug/s.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. The patient is able to swallow oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;

             stomach or small bowel, or preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a&#xD;
             preexisting chronic condition resulting in baseline grade 2 or higher diarrhea).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Second primary malignancy except most in situ carcinoma (e.g., adequately treated&#xD;
             non-melanomatous carcinoma of the skin) or other malignancy treated at least five&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Taking medications which may lead to interactions with HCQ, including penicillamine,&#xD;
             telbivudine, botulinum toxin, digoxin, and propafenone.&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. The patient has active bacterial infection (requiring intravenous [IV] antibiotics at&#xD;
             time of initiating study treatment), fungal infection, or detectable viral infection&#xD;
             (such as known human immunodeficiency virus positivity or with known active hepatitis&#xD;
             B or C [for example, hepatitis B surface antigen positive]). No screening tests is&#xD;
             required for this criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The patient has a marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval &gt;470 millisecond&#xD;
             using Fridericia's QT correction formula or a personal history of any of the following&#xD;
             conditions: syncope of cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological&#xD;
             origin (including, but not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular&#xD;
             fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest ,family history of Long QT syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients with symptomatic heart failure, uncontrolled arrhythmia, hypokalemia that&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Patient receiving treatment with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers within seven days&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patient receiving treatment with tamoxifen within seven days prior to the first dose&#xD;
             of study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patient receiving treatment with live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose&#xD;
             of study drugs.&#xD;

         17. Patients receiving medications, including herbal supplements, which may prolong the QT&#xD;
             interval.&#xD;
