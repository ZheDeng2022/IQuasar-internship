      (HCQ/ Plaquenil), inducing apoptosis leading to tumor regression.&#xD;

      Part 1: 3+3 dose escalation of HCQ combined with abemaciclib in advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: HCQ at top-dose level from part one is combined with abemaciclib and endocrine&#xD;
      therapy in HR+/Her 2- advanced breast cancer (ABC) and divided into two cohorts based on&#xD;
      prior exposure to endocrine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dose-escalation cohort: To determine safety and tolerability of HCQ combined with&#xD;
           abemaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dose-expansion cohort: To determine safety and tolerability of HCQ combined with&#xD;
           abemaciclib and endocrine therapy in HR+/Her2- ABC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the clinical efficacy of HCQ in combination with abemaciclib and hormone&#xD;
           blockade in the dose- expansion cohort of advanced ER- positive breast cancer&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the clinical efficacy of HCQ in combination with abemaciclib in the dose-&#xD;
           escalation cohort&#xD;

             from the acute effects of radiotherapy. A washout period of at least 14 days is&#xD;
             required between end of palliative radiotherapy and first dose of the study drug/s.&#xD;
&#xD;

             time of initiating study treatment), fungal infection, or detectable viral infection&#xD;
             (such as known human immunodeficiency virus positivity or with known active hepatitis&#xD;
             B or C [for example, hepatitis B surface antigen positive]). No screening tests is&#xD;
             required for this criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The patient has a marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval &gt;470 millisecond&#xD;
             using Fridericia's QT correction formula or a personal history of any of the following&#xD;
             conditions: syncope of cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological&#xD;
             origin (including, but not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular&#xD;
             fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest ,family history of Long QT syndrome.&#xD;

             prior to the first dose of study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patient receiving treatment with tamoxifen within seven days prior to the first dose&#xD;
             of study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patient receiving treatment with live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose&#xD;
             of study drugs.&#xD;

         17. Patients receiving medications, including herbal supplements, which may prolong the QT&#xD;
             interval.&#xD;
