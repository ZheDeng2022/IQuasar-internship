      In this a prospective, blinded, collaboration study between pediatric and adult transplant&#xD;
      departments. Cardiac MRI data on patient with heart transplantations will be collected during&#xD;
      years 2020-2022. Based on sample size calculations, the data has enough power to answer the&#xD;
      question, whether MRI can be used as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for detection of acute&#xD;
      rejection as such or whether it can be used as fist line noninvasive screening tool for&#xD;
      detecting those needing for the more detailed invasive study. A clinical protocol will be&#xD;
      developed to optimize the management and outcome of the patients having cardiac&#xD;
      transplantation aiming to decrease the number of invasive procedures in these patients.&#xD;

      Background Heart transplantation is a treatment for select patients with end-stage heart&#xD;
      failure. Improvements in immunosuppressive therapies and patient management have increased&#xD;
      the life expectancy of heart transplant patients. One-year survivals are 90% and 80%, with 65&#xD;
      % and 49% of pediatric and adult patients surviving 8 - 15 years after transplantation in&#xD;
      Finland, respectively. Despite this success, rejection remains the &quot;Achilles heel&quot; of heart&#xD;
      transplantation. The early detection of acute rejection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy&#xD;
      (chronic rejection) are paramount to avoiding graft loss. Unlike in kidney and liver&#xD;
      transplantation, there are no clinically validated biomarkers for detecting heart transplant&#xD;
      rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy and invasive coronary angiography are widely accepted as the gold standard for&#xD;
      diagnosing acute graft rejection and chronic rejection (vasculopathy) in both pediatric and&#xD;
      adult heart transplant recipients, respectively. However, biopsies are invasive, and they&#xD;
      carry a significant risk of complication regarding that majority of endocardial biopsies are&#xD;
      performed in asymptomatic patients. In addition, the histologic assessment of biopsies is&#xD;
      often subjective. Due to the lack of consensus, biopsy protocols are center-specific and&#xD;
      depend on the experience and personal preference of the transplant team. Helsinki pediatric&#xD;
      transplant protocol can be considered as high-intensity biopsy center. At best, the routine&#xD;
      surveillance biopsies can detect late episodes of moderate to severe rejection in children&#xD;
      with an 8% - 10% annual incidence up to 11 years after transplantation. However, there is no&#xD;
      correlation between the intensity of biopsies and the incidence of rejection or 4-year&#xD;
      mortality in the pediatric population, suggesting the need for other monitoring practices for&#xD;
      rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac MRI. Advanced multimodality imaging techniques, such as cardiac magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI), may provide a future alternative to the monitoring practices for children and&#xD;
      adults following heart transplantation. This has the potential to decrease the frequency of&#xD;
      biopsies and radiation, especially in low-risk patients. Cardiac MRI can assess myocardial&#xD;
      changes over time after transplantation. In heart transplant patients, MRI facilitates the&#xD;
      detection of acute and chronic rejection and allows monitoring of gradual adverse remodeling.&#xD;
      Volumetric assessment of the ventricles can further independently predict hospitalizations&#xD;
      and mortality. The most widely investigated MRI parameters for detecting acute rejection are&#xD;
      the T2 (indicates myocardial edema) and T1 relaxation times (indicates extracellular volume&#xD;
      fraction (ECV) and fibrosis). Further, the assessment of global left ventricular function,&#xD;
      myocardial strain analysis as well as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) have been used for&#xD;
      detection of chronic myocardial changes. Except for LGE and ECV, all of them can be measured&#xD;
      noninvasively without the need for gadolinium contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even biopsy results may fail to predict rejection. A retrospective study of adults found that&#xD;
      T2 time of â‰¥56 ms had a 97% negative predictive value for detecting acute rejection grade &gt;&#xD;
      2. Interestingly, up to 80% of patients with a simultaneous negative biopsy but prolonged T2&#xD;
      relaxation time developed acute rejection in the next 30 days. The study suggested that T2&#xD;
      time measurement may be equal, or even superior to biopsy. However, the use of T2 relaxation&#xD;
      time early after transplantation is limited, as it may be elevated in the first 25 days after&#xD;
      transplantation regardless of the rejection status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast-enhanced MRI with gadolinium may provide additional information to T2 and T1&#xD;
      relaxation times and further limit the need for biopsies. It can identify areas of myocardial&#xD;
      inflammation, scarring, and diffuse fibrosis, as well as assess myocardial perfusion. The&#xD;
      prevalence of late gadolinium enhancement increases with the severity of rejection, whereas&#xD;
      early gadolinium enhancement reflects extracellular space expansion secondary to acute&#xD;
      necrosis and edema. Both myocardial edema (identified on T2- weighted imaging) and early&#xD;
      myocardial contrast enhancement distinguish patients with International Society for Heart and&#xD;
      Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) grade 2R rejection from those with grades 1R and 0R. Further, it&#xD;
      has been reported that late enhancement in serially assessed transplant patients is&#xD;
      associated with major adverse cardiac events and mortality. A recent study in 20 pediatric&#xD;
      heart transplant patients showed that MRI-derived fibrosis markers correlate with the&#xD;
      severity of fibrosis on biopsy. Although replacement fibrosis is irreversible, other MRI&#xD;
      measurements change over time. Therefore, serial imaging can provide insight not only into&#xD;
      disease progression but also on the efficacy of treatment. This is particularly relevant in&#xD;
      acute rejection where the evaluation of myocardial edema with T2 mapping and interstitial&#xD;
      expansion or fibrosis (T1 mapping ) can be accomplished with and without the administration&#xD;
      of contrast agents and could easily limit the number of biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive cardiac MRI imaging can replace traditional invasive diagnostic procedures in&#xD;
      detecting allograft rejection in cardiac transplant patients. This novel imaging strategy&#xD;
      will reduce the cumulative stress and radiation and will guide clinical decision-making in&#xD;
      these severely ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods In this prospective blinded study, cardiac MRI data on new heart&#xD;
      transplantations will be collected during years 2020-2021 (N = 72, including pediatric and&#xD;
      adult patients). Estimated total count of invasive biopsies in the pediatric population is&#xD;
      100-150/2y samples, and the adult numbers will be three times higher (300-450/2y). The risk&#xD;
      of the primary endpoint of acute rejection/immunoactivation is the highest during the first&#xD;
      five years after transplantation. The immunoactivation occurs in 18 % and 10 % of samples&#xD;
      taken &lt;3 months and &gt; 3 months after transplantation, respectively. Cardiac MRI&#xD;
      immunoactivation/rejection findings will be blindly compared with the histological analysis&#xD;
      of invasive endocardial biopsy done by one pathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation (statistical consultation Tero Vahlberg, PhD): Clinically acceptable&#xD;
      sensitivity for cardiac MRI to detect an acute rejection is 80%. Assuming an alpha level of&#xD;
      0.05, marginal error (precision) of 10% for sensitivity and 15% prevalence for rejection, the&#xD;
      required total sample size is 410 samples. For specificity of 80% for cardiac MRI using the&#xD;
      same assumptions, the required total sample size is 72 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The required sample size is 410 biopsies and estimated time needed for data collection is two&#xD;
      years. The data has then enough power to answer the question - whether MRI can be used as a&#xD;
      noninvasive diagnostic tool for detection of acute rejection as such or whether it can be&#xD;
      used as a fist line noninvasive screening tool for detecting those needing more detailed&#xD;
      invasive study. MRI measurements published in adults for the detection of rejection or&#xD;
      myocardial inflammation will be used. The detection of the secondary endpoint of&#xD;
      vasculopathy/chronic rejection will be studied similarly to acute rejection. Cardiac MRI&#xD;
      studies focusing on the vasculopathy findings will be carried out during the annual follow-up&#xD;
      visits (two times during the study period/per patients, total n= 200). The MRI phenotype will&#xD;
      be compared with invasive angiography findings. Advanced echocardiographic measurements will&#xD;
      be further used for clinical, echocardiographic studies done in parallel with the cardiac MRI&#xD;
      studies. The advanced echocardiographic methodology is based on the last 20 years research of&#xD;
      group. Shortly, the methods to be used for functional MRI studies are the same as used in&#xD;
      echo modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects The studies are designed to comply with the Helsinki Declaration and the&#xD;
      Conventions of the Council of Europe on human rights. The results are reviewed and published&#xD;
      anonymously. All clinical studies fulfill the general ethical requirements for clinical&#xD;
      studies. The investigators have obtained following ethical permits from HUS ethical&#xD;
      committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical importance of the study Our project is realistic and timely. This project aims to&#xD;
      promote noninvasive diagnostic strategies to replace traditional invasive procedures reducing&#xD;
      cumulative stress and radiation in this group of severely ill heart transplant patients. This&#xD;
      will be possible by creating a substantial amount of non-invasive research data on the&#xD;
      myocardial mechanisms after transplantation. The investigators acknowledge that this project&#xD;
      is ambitious. Our interdisciplinary research-group has vast experience of working with the&#xD;
      proposed methods facilitating the success of this project. Our study results will build the&#xD;
      foundations for new protocols to optimize the management and outcome of these patients. The&#xD;
      methods the investigators use are validated, and the studies are well designed. The&#xD;
      investigators are convinced that the results of the study will largely improve the clinical&#xD;
      care of these patients. As MRI imaging is less expensive than invasive procedures, this&#xD;
      approach will result in reduced health care costs in the long term.&#xD;
