  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aerodigestive tract cancers are common malignancies. These cancers were ranked to be top-ten&#xD;
      cancer-related deaths in Taiwan. Although many new target therapies and immunotherapies have&#xD;
      emerged, many of the treatment eventually fail. For example, a 30-40% failure rate has been&#xD;
      reported for target therapy, and, even higher for immune checkpoint inhibitors. A reliable&#xD;
      model to more accurately predict treatment response and survival is warranted. The radiomic&#xD;
      features extracted from F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      can be used to figure tumor biology such as metabolome and heterogeneity. It can therefore be&#xD;
      used to predict treatment response and individual survival. On the other hand, genomic data&#xD;
      derived from next-generation sequencing (NGS) can interrogate the genetic alteration of&#xD;
      cancer cells. It can be used to feature genetic identification of the tumor and can also be&#xD;
      used to identify target genes. However, both modalities have their weakness; a combination of&#xD;
      the two may devise a more powerful predictive model for more precise clinical decision. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to recruit patients aged at least 20-year with the diagnosis of&#xD;
      aerodigestive tract cancers for radiogenomic study. Our previous studies have found that&#xD;
      radiomic features derived from 18F-FDG PET can predict treatment response and survival in&#xD;
      patients with esophageal cancer treated with tri-modality method. The investigators also&#xD;
      discovered that radiomics could predict survival in patients with EGFR-mutated lung&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma treated with target therapy. In addition, our study results showed that the&#xD;
      level of PD-L1 expression is associated with radiomics as well. The investigators plan to add&#xD;
      genomic data into radiomics and interrogate cancers from different aspects. The investigators&#xD;
      seek to devise a more precise model to predict the treatment response and survival in&#xD;
      patients with aerodigestive tract cancers.&#xD;

      This is a prospective study and The investigators use the routine pathological specimens for&#xD;
      next generation sequencing (NGS), microsatellite instability (MSI) and immunohistochemical&#xD;
      stains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathological examinations including PD-L1, EGFR status, ALK and ROS-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NGS (Next Generation Sequencing)： Total DNA were extracted from EDTA-peripheral venous blood&#xD;
      and paraffin-embedded tumor specimens with the QIAamp® DNA Blood Mini Kit and QIAamp DNA FFPE&#xD;
      Tissue Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany), respectively. For DNA whole exome sequence,&#xD;
      briefly, tumor and blood DNA were sonicated by Covaris M220 sonicator (Life Technologies&#xD;
      Europe, Gent, Belgium) and then ligated to adaptor for further amplification (Illumina®&#xD;
      TruSeq Exome Library Prep, USA). All of library preparation were performed in the Cancer&#xD;
      Translational Core Facility of Taipei Medical University. After library preparation, all&#xD;
      samples were sequenced using the NextSeq500 system according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions (Illumina, San Diego, USA). After sequencing performance, quality of reads file&#xD;
      (fastq) was assessed by FastQC and then mapped using human Hg19 as the reference. Bam files&#xD;
      were used as input for the Varscan algorithm to identify germline and somatic mutations.&#xD;
      Variants annotated and filtered were manually checked using IGV (Integrative Genomics&#xD;
      Viewer), then confirmed by Sanger sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To calculate the TMB (total mutation burden) per megabase, the total number of mutations&#xD;
      counted is divided by the size of the coding region of the targeted territory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To calculate MATH (mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity), The investigators will first obtain&#xD;
      the MAF (the fraction of DNA that shows the mutated allele at a gene locus) of each tumor&#xD;
      specimen. The MAF distribution will be used to calculate the median (center of distribution)&#xD;
      and the MD (median deviation) of MAFs in a tumor. The MD is determined by obtaining the&#xD;
      absolute differences of all MAFs from the median MAF. Then the median of the absolute&#xD;
      differences is multiplied by a factor of 1.4826 to obtain the MD. The MATH value is&#xD;
      calculated as the percentage ratio of the MD to the median: MATH = (MD/median)×100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSI (Microsatellite instability) Microsatellite instability polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (MSI-PCR) MSI-PCR testing was performed by the Cancer Translational Core Facility of Taipei&#xD;
      Medical University using Promega MSI analysis kit (Promega). The MSI analysis consists of&#xD;
      five nearly monomorphic mononucleotide markers (BAT-25, BAT-26, NR- 21, NR-24, and MONO-27)&#xD;
      for MSI determination. MSI analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's directions&#xD;
      (Promega). Products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis and the investigators&#xD;
      interpreted microsatellite instability at 2 or more of the 5 mononucleotide loci as MSI-high,&#xD;
      microsatellite instability at a single mononucleotide locus as MSI-low, and no instability at&#xD;
      any of the loci as microsatellite stable (MSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The image features of FDG PET the investigators extracted as followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional image parameters include SUVmax, metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total&#xD;
      lesion glycolysis (TLG) of the primary tumor. The traditional FDG PET parameters were&#xD;
      calculated using commercialized software (PBAS, PMOD 4.0). Radiomics (texture analysis) will&#xD;
      be calculated only for pre-treatment FDG PET. The matrices of radiomic analysis include&#xD;
      histogram analysis, Gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)、texture feature coding&#xD;
      co-occurrence matrix (TFCCM)、gray-level run-length matrix (GLRLM)、gray-level size zone matrix&#xD;
      (GLSZM)、neighborhood gray-tone difference matrix (NGTDM)、Texture Feature Coding Matrix&#xD;
      (TFCM)、Texture Feature Coding Co-Occurrence Matrix (TFCCM) and Neighbouring Gray Level&#xD;
      Dependence Matrix (NGLD).&#xD;
