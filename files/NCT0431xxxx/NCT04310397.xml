  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well dabrafenib, trametinib, and spartalizumab works in&#xD;
      treating patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation positive stage IIIB/C/D melanoma, who do&#xD;
      not achieve a pathologic complete response after 8 weeks of dabrafenib and trametinib&#xD;
      treatment. Patients who achieve a pathologic complete response after 8 weeks of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      dabrafenib and trametinib will receive adjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib. Dabrafenib and&#xD;
      trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as spartalizumab, may help the body's&#xD;
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow&#xD;
      and spread. Giving dabrafenib, trametinib, and spartalizumab may help to control melanoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the 12-month relapse free survival (RFS) rate in stage IIIB/C/D melanoma&#xD;
      patients who, after 8 weeks of neoadjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib, do not achieve a&#xD;
      pathologic complete response (pCR) and receive adjuvant dabrafenib, trametinib and&#xD;
      spartalizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of neoadjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib and adjuvant dabrafenib,&#xD;
      trametinib and spartalizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the 12-month relapse free survival (RFS) rate in stage IIIB/C/D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Melanoma patients who, after 8 weeks of neoadjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib, achieve a&#xD;
      pCR and receive adjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the recurrence patterns, distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) in all patients treated on protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess immunological and molecular features of treatment response and resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess circulating markers and correlate them with treatment response and relapse and&#xD;
      toxicity III. To assess the impact of neoadjuvant therapy on surgical resectability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT: Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and&#xD;
      trametinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 cycles in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGERY: Patients undergo surgical resection of melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADJUVANT TREATMENT OF pCR PATIENTS: Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID and trametinib PO QD&#xD;
      on days 1-28. Cycles repeats every 28 days for 44 weeks in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADJUVANT TREATMENT OF NON pCR PATIENTS: Patients receive spartalizumab intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over 30 minutes on day 1, dabrafenib PO BID and trametinib PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for 44 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-4 months for 2 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed clinically detected, node&#xD;
             involved Stage IIIB/C/D melanoma by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) version&#xD;
             8 and surgically resectable disease. The definition of resectability can be determined&#xD;
             by the patient's surgical oncologist and verified via discussion at multidisciplinary&#xD;
             tumor conference attended by melanoma medical and surgical oncology staff. Resectable&#xD;
             tumors are defined as having no significant vascular, neural or bony involvement that&#xD;
             would preclude complete resection or necessitate the use of adjuvant radiation. Only&#xD;
             cases where a complete surgical resection with tumor- free margins can safely be&#xD;
             achieved are defined as resectable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BRAF mutation-positive melanoma (V600E or V600K) based on report from a Clinical&#xD;
             Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) certified laboratory&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have been previously treated in the adjuvant setting with ipilimumab or&#xD;
             interferon alpha or investigational vaccines for melanoma will be eligible for&#xD;
             treatment after a 28 day wash-out period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have previously received anti PD-1 in the adjuvant setting will be&#xD;
             allowed if it has been six months or longer since previous drug exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant will be required to use highly effective methods of contraception&#xD;
             during dosing and for 150-days after stopping treatment with spartalizumab. Highly&#xD;
             effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male&#xD;
                  partner should be the sole partner for that subject&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Placement of a non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system&#xD;
                  (IUS) with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Notes:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Double-barrier contraception: condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                       cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent&#xD;
                       (foam/gel/cream/suppository) are not considered highly effective methods of&#xD;
                       contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Hormonal-based methods (e.g., oral contraceptives) are not considered as&#xD;
                       highly effective methods of contraception due to potential drug-drug&#xD;
                       interactions with dabrafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
             (i.e. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at&#xD;
             least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
             status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she&#xD;
             considered not of childbearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while on treatment and for&#xD;
             150 days after stopping treatment with spartalizumab and should not father a child in&#xD;
             this period. A condom is required to be used by vasectomized men as well during&#xD;
             intercourse in order to prevent delivery of the drug via semen&#xD;
