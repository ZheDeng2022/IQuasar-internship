  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From the 1980s to the late 1990s, highly toxic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus&#xD;
      (MRSA) strains (called community-associated [CA] MRSA) appeared in the community. Although&#xD;
      the prevalence of HA-MRSA (health-related MRSA) infection remained stable between 1998 and&#xD;
      2008, the CA-MRSA (community-related MRSA) infection rate increased. By far, the most common&#xD;
      manifestations of CA-MRSA related diseases are skin and soft tissue infections. Skin and soft&#xD;
      tissue infections (SSTIs) account for at least 90% of CA-MRSA infections. CA-MRSA strains&#xD;
      also cause bone and joint infections, such as osteomyelitis and respiratory infections, such&#xD;
      as pneumonia, sepsis, and urinary tract infections. Given that Staphylococcus aureus can live&#xD;
      in the home as a settler or environmental pollutant, the environment can be used as a medium&#xD;
      for obtaining and transmitting MRSA. In addition, transmission of MRSA between pets and&#xD;
      humans has been proposed, but the directionality is unclear. In this study, we report an&#xD;
      in-depth epidemiological and genomics study of a community-associated methicillin-resistant&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus infection in SSRSH, Zhejiang Province, China.&#xD;

      Eligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inclusion criteria: Patients (Child, Adult) with infections caused by S. aureus from the&#xD;
           sites as follows: blood stream, skin or soft tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, bone and&#xD;
           joint, genitourinary tract, infection of indwelling intravascular device, surgical&#xD;
           wound, respiratory tract (organism grown from sputum and infiltrate on chest X-ray),&#xD;
           peritoneal fluid or other otherwise sterile body fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exclusion criteria: Patients with risk factors for nosocomial or medically related&#xD;
           infections, and patients who have been decolonized (using mupirocin, chlorhexidine or&#xD;
           bleach) in the past month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Isolation rate of staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus&#xD;
           on domestic environment, contact and pets and livestock.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Molecular characteristics of CA-MRSA isolates recovered in Chinese hospitals, home&#xD;
           environments, contacts, and pets and livestock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A MRSA infection was considered to be HA-MRSA by the CDC epidemiologic definitions if, in the&#xD;
      year prior to culture, the subject had surgery, hospitalization, hemodialysis or a stay in a&#xD;
      long-term care facility, if an indwelling vascular catheter was in place at the time of&#xD;
      culture, or if the subject was an inpatient hospitalized for 2 days at the time of culture.&#xD;
      Otherwise, the subject was considered to have a CA-MRSA infection.&#xD;
