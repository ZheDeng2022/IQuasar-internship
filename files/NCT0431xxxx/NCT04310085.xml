      This is a single-centre, open-label, Phase Ib study designed to assess if intravenous&#xD;
      injection of approximately 3200 P. falciparum (NF54 strain) sporozoites can be safely&#xD;
      administered to achieve blood-stage parasitaemia with a kinetics/PCR profile that will allow&#xD;
      for the future characterisation of antimalarial blood-stage activity of new chemical entities&#xD;
      in a relatively small number of participants during early drug development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, malaria-naïve adults, aged 18-55 years, will be enrolled in a maximum of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
      Enrolment into the cohorts will proceed sequentially, with two target levels of parasitaemia,&#xD;
      i.e., 5000 parasites/mL blood in Cohort 1 and 10000 parasites/mL blood in Cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Based on observed levels of parasitaemia in Cohort 1, the target threshold for treatment in&#xD;
      Cohort 2 was maintained at 5,000 p/mL (vs 10,000 p/mL in the protocol)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3-day antimalarial therapy regimen will be further administered and monitored until&#xD;
      parasite clearance. Safety and tolerability will be monitored during the whole study&#xD;
      duration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 16 healthy, malaria-naïve males and females, aged 18-55 years, will be enrolled in a&#xD;
      maximum of 2 cohorts (up to 8 participants per cohort; a participant may be enrolled in one&#xD;
      cohort only). Enrolment into the cohorts will proceed sequentially, with two target levels of&#xD;
      parasitaemia previously achieved in healthy participants enrolled in malaria Volunteer&#xD;
      Infection Studies (VIS) at other study sites, i.e., 5000 parasites/mL blood in Cohort 1 and&#xD;
      10000 parasites/mL blood in Cohort 2. (Based on observed levels of parasitaemia in Cohort 1,&#xD;
      the target threshold for treatment in Cohort 2 was maintained at 5,000 p/mL (vs 10,000 p/mL&#xD;
      in the protocol)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be admitted to the clinical unit in the morning of Day -1 and&#xD;
      inoculated with approximately 3200 P. falciparum sporozoites (NF54 strain) by DVI on Day 1.&#xD;
      Participants will be discharged 2 h post inoculation on Day 1 and will be monitored daily via&#xD;
      phone call from Day 2 until Day 6 to solicit any AEs. Participants will come to the clinical&#xD;
      unit daily from Day 7 until Day 9 and together with the malaria clinical score (see&#xD;
      Attachment 1), the presence of parasites will be assessed once daily by a specific qPCR&#xD;
      targeting the varATS (the acidic terminal segment in Plasmodium falciparum var genes)&#xD;
      multigenic family; this to accurately describe parasite growth even in case PCR positivity,&#xD;
      i.e., a qPCR outcome ≥250 parasites per mL blood, is confirmed this early (very low&#xD;
      probability and with low densities). Participants will be confined to the clinical unit from&#xD;
      Day 10 in the morning. qPCR will be performed and malaria clinical score assessed twice daily&#xD;
      and participants will be administered registered antimalarial therapy, i.e., Riamet®, when&#xD;
      the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cohort 1: ≥5000 parasites/mL blood or earlier if a participant has a malaria clinical&#xD;
           score &gt;6 or at Investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cohort 2: ≥10000 parasites/mL blood or earlier if a participant has a malaria clinical&#xD;
           score &gt;6 or at Investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registered 3-day antimalarial therapy regimen will be further administered and monitored.&#xD;
      qPCR assessments of parasitaemia will be carried out at multiple time points (2, 6, 8, 12,&#xD;
      16, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h) following initiation of Riamet® and malaria clinical score will be&#xD;
      assessed twice daily during confinement in the clinical unit. Safety and tolerability will be&#xD;
      monitored during the whole study duration, specific assessments will be done at periodic&#xD;
      pre-specified time points from Day 10 and for at least 72 h after initiating antimalarial&#xD;
      therapy, i.e., during confinement in the clinical unit (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of note, all participants must consent to receiving antimalarial therapy, i.e., the&#xD;
      registered 3-day Riamet® regimen approved for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Even in the&#xD;
      case of withdrawal from the study, all participants administered the PfSPZ-DVI Challenge are&#xD;
      to receive antimalarial therapy as soon as possible, and to have all appropriate visits and&#xD;
      assessments as required. If an intolerance or contraindication to Riamet® develops, Malarone®&#xD;
      will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon parasite clearance (defined as a qPCR value of 0 parasites per mL blood after initiating&#xD;
      antimalarial therapy) and at least 72 h after initiating antimalarial therapy (estimated to&#xD;
      occur on or before Day 19 and on or before Day 22 for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively),&#xD;
      and if clinically well, participants will be discharged from the clinical unit and will be&#xD;
      followed up for safety assessments, clinical evaluation and malaria qPCR in the clinical unit&#xD;
      at the EOS visit on Day 28. All participants who received antimalarial therapy will be asked&#xD;
      non-leading questions to determine the occurrence of any AEs throughout the study and at the&#xD;
      EOS visit. All participants inoculated with PfSPZ-DVI Challenge will commence antimalarial&#xD;
      therapy no later than Day 24 for both cohorts, regardless if they reach pre-defined&#xD;
      cohort-specific PCR parasitaemia/malaria clinical score thresholds (i.e., 5000 parasites/mL&#xD;
      blood for Cohort 1 and 10000 parasites/mL blood for Cohort 2 and/or a malaria clinical score&#xD;
      ≥6 for Cohorts 1 and 2). Participants who start antimalarial therapy on Day 24 will only be&#xD;
      discharged from confinement at the end of the EOS visit on Day 28. Antimalarial therapy may&#xD;
      be initiated whenever deemed necessary by the Investigators, e.g., if there is a concern&#xD;
      regarding the safety of a study participant. Therapy may be amended according to the treating&#xD;
      physician if the participant does not respond to treatment or the condition worsens.&#xD;

             abuse during the past 12 months or current alcohol or illicit drug abuse or addiction&#xD;
             (positive alcohol breath test or positive drug screen for amphetamines, barbiturates,&#xD;
             benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine or opiates at screening or upon check-in at the&#xD;
             clinical unit); Note: Excessive use of alcohol is defined as an intake of &gt;21 units&#xD;
             per week for males and &gt;14 units per week for females where one alcohol unit is&#xD;
             defined as 10 mL or 8 g of pure alcohol. A single unit is equal to one 25-mL (single)&#xD;
             measure of whisky (alcohol by volume [ABV] 40%), or a third of a pint of beer (190 mL;&#xD;
             ABV 5-6%) or half a standard (175 mL) glass of wine (ABV 12%).&#xD;
&#xD;
             12. Participants are non-smokers or ex-smokers for more than 90 days prior to&#xD;
             screening, or smoke no more than 5 cigarettes per day. If users of nicotine products&#xD;
             (i.e., spray, patch, e-cigarette, etc.), they should use the equivalent of no more&#xD;
             than 5 cigarettes per day. Participants must agree to abstain from smoking while in&#xD;
             the unit; 13. Use of any prescription drugs, herbal supplements (e.g., St John's Wort)&#xD;
             or over-the-counter medication within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)&#xD;
             prior to the PfSPZ-DVI Challenge, or an anticipated requirement for the use of these&#xD;
             during the course of the study (see Section 6.2); Note: If necessary, the incidental&#xD;
             use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol (2 g/day, 10&#xD;
             g/week) may be acceptable at the Investigator's discretion and will be documented in&#xD;
             the eSource system. The use of nutritional supplements during this time that are not&#xD;
             believed to have the potential to affect participant safety nor the overall results of&#xD;
             the study, may be permitted on a case-by-case basis by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             14. Any surgical or medical condition possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g.,&#xD;
             cholecystectomy, gastrectomy, bowel disease), distribution, metabolism or excretion;&#xD;
             15. Personnel (e.g., Investigator, sub-investigator, research assistant, pharmacist,&#xD;
             study coordinator or anyone mentioned in the delegation log) directly involved in the&#xD;
             conduct of the study; 16. Any condition that in the opinion of the Investigator would&#xD;
             jeopardise the safety or rights of a person participating in the study or would render&#xD;
             the person unable to comply with the protocol; 17. Personal history of malaria; 18.&#xD;
             Volunteer has travelled to or lived in a malaria-endemic area within 6 months prior to&#xD;
             planned study enrolment; 19. Plans to travel to malaria-endemic region during the&#xD;
             study period up to last follow-up visit; 20. Previous participation in any malaria&#xD;
             vaccine or Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) study/VIS; 21. Falling in&#xD;
             moderate or higher risk category for a fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular event within&#xD;
             5 years (&gt; 5%) determined by a validated risk estimation system, e.g., SCORE [21]; 22.&#xD;
             Use of systemic antibiotics with known antimalarial activity within 5 half-lives of&#xD;
             PfSPZ-DVI Challenge (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, tetracycline,&#xD;
             clindamycin, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones or azithromycin) or an anticipated&#xD;
             requirement for the use of these during the study period (see Section 6.2); 23.&#xD;
             Receipt of blood or blood-derived products (including immunoglobulin) within 3 months&#xD;
             prior to screening. Receipt of packed RBCs given for an emergent indication in an&#xD;
             otherwise healthy person, and not required as ongoing treatment is not exclusionary&#xD;
             (for example packed RBCs emergently given during an elective surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: In case of an out-of-range clinical laboratory test (according to the clinically&#xD;
        acceptable ranges for study inclusion laboratory tests in Attachment 4), vital sign or ECG&#xD;
        value that will determine a participant's eligibility, or in case of a positive drug&#xD;
        screen, a retest or expert evaluation can be requested. Results of any retest must be&#xD;
        available prior to inoculation. The result of the retest will be considered for participant&#xD;
        eligibility at the Investigator's discretion. Participants can be rescreened at the&#xD;
        discretion of the Investigator.&#xD;
