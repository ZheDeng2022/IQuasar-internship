  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The STI-6129-001 study is a three-stage, multicenter, open-label, dose-finding, phase 1&#xD;
      trial. It is designed primarily to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of STI-6129&#xD;
      by assessing the safety, preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics of this&#xD;
      anti-CD38-Duostatin 5.2 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for the treatment of relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory systemic AL amyloidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients that will be treated with STI-6129 in this trial are relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      systemic AL amyloidosis patients who have received prior lines of treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is composed of three dosing plan stages. The initial stage of this trial is the&#xD;
      dose-escalation stage. A standard dose-escalation 3+3 design will be utilized to identify a&#xD;
      safe maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of STI-6129 in patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      systemic AL amyloidosis. After identification of the MTD, or the finding that the last dosing&#xD;
      cohort is tolerated well (i.e., the maximum practical dose [MPD]), 12 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled to receive STI-6129 treatment at the MTD/MPD level to collect pharmacokinetic data (&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetic (PK) stage) to model a treatment schedule that achieves a stable&#xD;
      effective serum concentration. Results from the dose-escalation stage and the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      stage will be analyzed to develop a treatment dose/schedule for treating 30 additional&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the expansion stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient enrolled will receive up to three 3-week cycles of STI-6129. After the treatment&#xD;
      period, patients will be monitored for up to a year.&#xD;
