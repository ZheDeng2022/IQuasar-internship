  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erbium lasers have been suggested to accomplish corticotomy without flap reflection due to&#xD;
      their attractive advantages. The current trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      laser-assisted flapless corticotomy in accelerating orthodontic tooth movement. The secondary&#xD;
      aim was to evaluate the patients' responses to laser application. It was postulated that&#xD;
      canine retraction after laser-assisted flapless corticotomy would be accomplished within a&#xD;
      shorter period compared with the conventional canine retraction method, with no significant&#xD;
      degree of pain and discomfort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comprehensive orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances usually takes more than 18 months&#xD;
      in mild and severe cases. Prolonged treatment time can cause many adverse effects such as&#xD;
      pain, discomfort, external root resorption, white spots and dental caries. Decreasing the&#xD;
      treatment time for tooth movement has been the focus of both the clinicians and the patients.&#xD;
      For the last few decades, investigators have recommended many treatment approaches intending&#xD;
      to reduce overall treatment time such as low friction and self-ligating bracket systems,&#xD;
      low-level laser irradiation, electrical currents, pharmacological approaches, local&#xD;
      platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection and surgical approaches like dentoalveolar distraction&#xD;
      and selective alveolar decortication or corticotomy&#xD;

    <description>A questionnaire was administered at the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th day after laser application. The questionnaire contained 5 questions (using 4-point Likert ordinal scales) to collect patients' responses on the following questions:&#xD;
Question 1: Do you feel pain during eating? Question 2: Do you feel pain during the day? Question 3: Do you feel pain that can awaken you during the night? Question 4: Do you feel swollen on the surgical side?&#xD;
The possible answers were:&#xD;
1. No 2.Mild 3.Moderate 4. Severe For the first four questions, the higher the score, the worse the feeling was.&#xD;
Question 5: Which one of the following has caused more discomfort to you?&#xD;
1. Extraction of premolars 2. Laser application 3.Both</description>
