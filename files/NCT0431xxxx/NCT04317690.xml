  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to survey a sample of adults who have recently made a decision&#xD;
      about treatment of high cholesterol or high blood pressure or a decision about screening for&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, breast cancer, or prostate cancer. The main goal is to gather evidence of&#xD;
      the validity and reliability of the Shared Decision Making Process scale. Secondary goal is&#xD;
      to gather evidence on the quality of decisions for these common medical situations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study staff worked with a national sampling firm to recruit subjects for five different&#xD;
      medical decisions. The five decisions are (1) treatment of high cholesterol, (2) treatment of&#xD;
      high blood pressure (3) when to start breast cancer screening (4) whether or not to have&#xD;
      prostate cancer screening and (5) which test to have for colorectal cancer screening.&#xD;
      Respondents complete a survey about their experiences talking with health care providers&#xD;
      about the specific clinical decision. The survey measured the amount of shared decision&#xD;
      making, knowledge, preferences, decisional conflict and decision regret. The study will&#xD;
      obtain 500 responses total, or 100 for each decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample is an online non-probability panel of adults living in the United States. In the&#xD;
      survey, participants were screened to meet specific qualifications. After 1 week, a random&#xD;
      selection of 50 respondents are invited to complete the retest instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be conducted separately for each group, and results may be pooled across&#xD;
      cancer screening and medication contexts. First, study staff will examine the descriptives&#xD;
      for the Shared Decision Making Process items. Study staff will also test several hypotheses&#xD;
      to examine validity of the scores such as whether higher shared decision making process&#xD;
      scores are associated with less decisional conflict and less regret. Staff will also examine&#xD;
      retest reliability of the Shared Decision Making Process scale.&#xD;
