  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder which can result in many severe&#xD;
      complications. For patients with hyperparathyroidism, Tc-99m sestamibi imaging is the major&#xD;
      imaging tool for pre-operative localization of the hyperfunctioning gland. However, sestamibi&#xD;
      scan have only limited sensitivity in detecting multigland disease and hyperplastic foci. New&#xD;
      imaging tracer with 18F-fluorocholine (18F-FCH) has showed avidity in parathyroid tissues.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the research data of 18F-FCH PET/CT are only preliminary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of our study is to compare the diagnostic performance of 18F-FCH PET/CT and single&#xD;
      isotope dual phase sestamibi scintigraphy for patients with hyperparathyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From Jan. 1st, 2018 till Dec. 31st, 2019, the investigators will prospectively enroll&#xD;
      patients with biochemical evidence of hyperparathyroidism and intended to receive&#xD;
      pre-operative image study. The patients will receive single isotope dual phase sestamibi&#xD;
      scintigraphy and 18F-FCH PET/CT. Each image will be evaluated by experienced interpreter for&#xD;
      abnormal uptake suspicious for hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland. The reference standard&#xD;
      will be the final surgical results. Diagnostic performance of both sestamibi scan and PET/CT&#xD;
      scan will be measured and calculated.&#xD;

      The investigators conducted a prospective study to investigate the performance of 18F-choline&#xD;
      (FCH) PET/CT and 99mTc- sestamibi scintigraphy in the pre-operative localization of&#xD;
      hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single isotope dual phase Tc-99m sestamibi imaging protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting is not needed before radiotracer injection. No specific drug restriction is needed.&#xD;
      Scan will be conduced by using a dual head gamma camera unit (Infinia Hawkeye; GE Medical&#xD;
      Systems, Milwaukee,Wis), and scans will be interpreted on a work station with the use of&#xD;
      compatible software (Xeleris).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An indwelling intravenous catheter connected to an infusion line and an saline syringe will&#xD;
      be set on each patient. 99mTc-sestamibi (925 +/- 10% MBq) will be injected intravenously&#xD;
      through the infusion line and will be flushed by saline. The image acquisition of the first&#xD;
      phase is to be taken 15 minutes after radiotracer injection. The second phase will be&#xD;
      acquired 2-4 hours after the initial tracer injection. The scintigraphic scan field will&#xD;
      cover from neck to chest. Additional field-of-view will be performed if the patient has known&#xD;
      surgically reimplanted parathyroid gland in the arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two nuclear medicine physicians assess the single isotope dual phase 99mTc-sestamibi&#xD;
      scintigraphy. The investigators have access to the patients' history and interpreted&#xD;
      individually by each reader, with disagreements to be resolved by consensus. Uptake&#xD;
      conspicuity will be evaluated in 4-graded scale. 0. Unable to identify any focal uptake; 1.&#xD;
      Inconspicuous focus; 2. Focal mild uptake; 3. Focal intense uptake. For the determination of&#xD;
      a diagnosis, score 0 and 1 are considered a negative resulte and 2 to 3 a positive result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-FCH PET imaging protocol: Fasting is not needed before radiotracer injection. No specific&#xD;
      drug restriction is needed. Scan will be conduced by using a PET/CT unit (Discovery ST; GE&#xD;
      Medical Systems, Milwaukee,Wis), and scans will be interpreted on a work station with the use&#xD;
      of compatible software (Xeleris).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An indwelling intravenous catheter connected to an infusion line and an saline syringe will&#xD;
      be set on each patient. 18F-FCH (185 +/- 10% MBq) will be injected intravenously through the&#xD;
      infusion line and will be flushed by saline. The injected 18F-FCH dose, injection time,&#xD;
      post-injection residual activity, time of start imaging and time of end imaging will be&#xD;
      recorded on case report form. 18F-FCH PET/CT scan acquisition is to be taken 5 to 10 minutes&#xD;
      after radiotracer injection. The PET/CT (80-120 mA, 120 kVp) scan field will cover from skull&#xD;
      to mid-thigh. Patient with reimplanted focus will be put into the field-of-view. The 18F-FCH&#xD;
      PET/CT scan time will require 35-40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two nuclear medicine physicians assess the 18F-FCH PET/CT images. The investigators have&#xD;
      access to the patients' history and interpreted individually by each reader, with&#xD;
      disagreements to be resolved by consensus. However, the interpreters have no access to the&#xD;
      sestamibi imaging results. For 18F-FCH PET/CT images, uptake conspicuity will be evaluated in&#xD;
      4-graded scale. 0. Unable to identify any focal uptake; 1. Inconspicuous focus; 2. Focal mild&#xD;
      uptake; 3. Focal intense uptake. For the determination of a diagnosis, score 0 and 1 are&#xD;
      considered a negative resulte and 2 to 3 a positive result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference standard is established by surgical pathology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reference standard will be the surgical pathological results. Removed gland will be&#xD;
      histologically confirmed as parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia. For in situ hyperfunctioning&#xD;
      parathyroid glands, the image results will be compared with the surgical results as correct&#xD;
      lateralization (right side or left side), and correct polarity (upper pole or lower pole),&#xD;
      sequentially. For ectopic and reimplanted glands, presence of pathological or biochemical&#xD;
      evidence of hyperfunctioning gland removal of the image suggested lesion will be the&#xD;
      reference standard.&#xD;
