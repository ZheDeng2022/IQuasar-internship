  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain and trismus caused by Anterior disc displacement ADD of temporomandibular joint (TMJ)&#xD;
      are one of the prime concerns for the patients. In the recent times, Inflammatory&#xD;
      Prolotherapy has been studied extensively and has produced promising results. In Inflammatory&#xD;
      prolotherapy low grade inflammation is induced physiologically by injection of an irritant&#xD;
      solution that initiates healing cascade which leads to repair of the joint structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the Present study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of dextrose prolotherapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of ADD in TMJ.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a ginglymodiarthroidal joint located bilaterally in the&#xD;
      preauricular region of head. It is formed by the confluence of multiple skeletal, muscular,&#xD;
      ligament and discal components which work in harmony with each other. Articular disc&#xD;
      functions as a non-ossified bone, allowing complex movements, making it a compound joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any loss in synchronization or harmony of the components of TMJ leads to temporomandibular&#xD;
      disorders. Okeson broadly classified temporomandibular disorders into Masticatory muscle&#xD;
      disorders, Temporomandibular joint disorders. Disc displacements are categorized under&#xD;
      Temporomandibular joint disorders of the condyle-disc complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normally articular disc is positioned over the cranial portion of mandibular condyle at 12&#xD;
      o'clock position when teeth are in occlusion. Abnormal position of disc with respect to&#xD;
      mandibular condyle or mandibular fossa is known as disc displacement. Most common&#xD;
      displacement of disc is in antero-medial direction.1 Disc displacements are of two types:&#xD;
      disc displacement with reduction and disc displacement without reduction. Anterior disc&#xD;
      displacement (ADD) associated with pain require treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Established treatment modalities include use of Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs&#xD;
      (NSAIDS), Anterior repositioning appliances, Physiotherapy, Psychological therapy,&#xD;
      Arthroscopy, Arthroplasty and Arthrocentesis. Newer treatment modalities that are under&#xD;
      research are platelet rich plasma therapy, prolotherapy and stem cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolotherapy, which is also known as regenerative injection therapy, and growth factor&#xD;
      stimulation injection therapy. It can be used to strengthen and repair chronic ligament,&#xD;
      joint, capsule, and tendinous injuries by stimulating proliferation of collagen at the fibro&#xD;
      osseous junctions to promote soft tissue repair and relative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolotherapy has recently emerged as a technique with low cost and minimal side effects for&#xD;
      management of Temporomandibular joint disorders. Prolotherapy is of 3 types - Growth factor&#xD;
      injection prolotherapy, growth factor stimulation prolotherapy and Inflammatory&#xD;
      prolotherapy.2 In the recent times, Inflammatory Prolotherapy has been studied extensively&#xD;
      and has produced promising results. In inflammatory prolotherapy low grade inflammation is&#xD;
      induced physiologically by injection of an irritant solution that initiates healing process.&#xD;
      Dextrose is most common and ideal proliferant used because it is a normal constituent of&#xD;
      blood chemistry, water soluble and injected safely into multiple areas.3&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentration of dextrose solution does not affect the results till the solution is&#xD;
      hypertonic i.e above 10%. However, it is still not clear whether it is irritant effect of&#xD;
      dextrose or mechanical injury caused by needle that produce the desired result .2 Dry&#xD;
      needling can also induce a low grade inflammatory process in the joint. Dry needling has been&#xD;
      proven to be equally beneficial in temporomandibular myofascial pain that involves inserting&#xD;
      a needle into trigger points to inactivate them. Stimulation of these trigger points by&#xD;
      needling alone, produce an analgesic effect by altering somatosensory thresholds .4 So, the&#xD;
      present study has been designed to compare the efficacy of dextrose solution injection&#xD;
      compared to dry needling in ADD of TMJ.&#xD;
