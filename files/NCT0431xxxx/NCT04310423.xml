  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design consists of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of low dose&#xD;
      endotoxin. The low dose endotoxin challenge induces a transient systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      response with normalization of cytokine levels within hours. This &quot;phasic&quot; inflammation is&#xD;
      distinct from chronic (&quot;tonic&quot;) levels of inflammation that may be present with AUD. A total&#xD;
      of 38 non-treatment seeking heavy drinking men and women and 38 light drinking healthy&#xD;
      controls will participate in the study. Recruitment will be monitored to ensure the two&#xD;
      groups are matched by gender. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned, stratified by&#xD;
      gender and BDI-II severity, to receive a single I.V. infusion of either low dose endotoxin&#xD;
      (0.8 ng/kg of body weight) or placebo (same volume of 0.9% saline solution) at the UCLA&#xD;
      Outpatient Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC). All participants will complete&#xD;
      an alcohol cue-exposure paradigm and reward responsiveness assessment 2 hours post infusion,&#xD;
      which is the time of expected peak cytokine response. All participants will also complete an&#xD;
      fMRI alcohol cue-reactivity paradigm at 3 hours post infusion. Plasma levels of&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines [i.e., Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α)],&#xD;
      mood, and alcohol craving, will be assessed at baseline and then hourly for four hours post&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;

      RECRUITMENT: Participants will be recruited from the community through online and newspaper&#xD;
      advertisements. Campaigns in local buses and print publications (e.g., LA Weekly) will also&#xD;
      be implemented. Targeted recruitment will also take place through a lab database of previous&#xD;
      study participants who agreed to be contacted for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TELEPHONE SCREEN: Individuals who call the lab (in response to flyers and advertisements)&#xD;
      expressing interest in the study will receive detailed information about the study&#xD;
      procedures, and if they remain interested they will complete a telephone screen performed by&#xD;
      a trained research assistant for self-reported inclusion and exclusion criteria. Those who&#xD;
      appear eligible will be invited to the laboratory for an initial in-person screening session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INITIAL SCREENING: Prior to conducting any research related procedures, research staff will&#xD;
      conduct the informed consent process, which details the procedures to take place during the&#xD;
      screening visit. Informed consent will be a three part process. First, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to read and provide verbal consent for breathalyzer. If the breathalyzer is above&#xD;
      0.000, the visit will be stopped and the participant will not be compensated. The participant&#xD;
      will be given an opportunity to reschedule the visit for another day. If the breathalyzer&#xD;
      test is negative, the written informed consent form will be reviewed and signed by the&#xD;
      participant and study staff outlining procedures for the initial screening visit. A second&#xD;
      written consent form will be reviewed and signed in the presence of the study physician at&#xD;
      the medical screening visit if the participant is found eligible to continue to that visit.&#xD;
      At the initial screening visit, subjects will be asked to provide a urine sample to test for&#xD;
      drugs of abuse and pregnancy (if female), and will complete a series of individual&#xD;
      differences measures (described in detail below). This visit should take approximately 2&#xD;
      hours. Following the initial in-person screening, the study coordinator will meet with the PI&#xD;
      to determine if the participant is eligible to continue to the medical screening based on&#xD;
      study inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDICAL SCREENING: Those participants who appear to be eligible after the initial screening&#xD;
      visit, will then be scheduled for a second screening visit. This visit will be conducted by&#xD;
      the study physician and will start with a breathalyzer test. If the breathalyzer is above&#xD;
      0.000, the visit will be stopped and the participant will not be compensated. The participant&#xD;
      will be given an opportunity to reschedule the visit for another day. If the breathalyzer&#xD;
      test is negative, the physician will conduct the second written (experimental) consent;&#xD;
      medical history interview and physical exam. In addition, a urine drug screen test will be&#xD;
      repeated. The participant will then be accompanied by research personnel to the CTRC for&#xD;
      blood specimen collection including Comprehensive Metabolic Panel and Complete Blood Count to&#xD;
      evaluate overall health; and EKG to screen for medical conditions that could make study&#xD;
      participation medically unsafe. The study physician will review each participant's medical&#xD;
      history, vital signs, weight, review of systems, and laboratory tests, including liver&#xD;
      function tests (LFTs), drug screen, chemistry screen, and urine pregnancy screen to determine&#xD;
      if it is medically safe for the participant to take the study medication. Any subject who is&#xD;
      excluded from the study will be compensated for their time in the screening session and will&#xD;
      be offered referrals for alcohol treatment in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION/INFLAMMATORY CHALLENGE: Upon arrival to the CTRC, eligibility for the&#xD;
      inflammatory challenge will be reviewed to ensure that none of the exclusion criteria have&#xD;
      been met as described above. A nurse, who will be blind to the condition, will insert a&#xD;
      catheter with a heparin lock into the non-dominant forearm for drug administration and hourly&#xD;
      blood draws. Each participant will be randomly assigned to receive either low-dose endotoxin&#xD;
      (0.8 ng/kg of body weight administered) or placebo (same volume of 0.9% saline), which will&#xD;
      be administered by the nurse as an intravenous bolus. The endotoxin will be derived from&#xD;
      Escherichia coli (E. Coli group O:113: BB-IND 12948 to M.R.I) and will be provided by the&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health Clinical Center as a reference endotoxin for studies of&#xD;
      experimental inflammation in humans. Participants will complete assessments as outlined below&#xD;
      at baseline and every hour for 4 hours post-infusion. One standard meal and one snack will be&#xD;
      provided by the CTRC to each participant during the experimental visit. At the end of the&#xD;
      experimental period, participants will have the catheter removed and will be discharged with&#xD;
      instructions to abstain from consuming alcohol for 24 hours after discharge. A follow-up&#xD;
      phone call by the study physician will be conducted the day after the inflammatory challenge&#xD;
      and again 1-2 weeks later to assess for any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study physician (Dr. Miotto) will be on-call and will manage any adverse events during&#xD;
      the inflammatory challenge. She will consult with Dr. Irwin, Co-I, as needed to manage&#xD;
      adverse events. In the event that significant medical problems are encountered, the blind&#xD;
      will be broken and appropriate medical treatment will be provided. Individuals who meet the&#xD;
      following stopping criteria will discontinue study-related data collection procedures&#xD;
      (cytokine assays and cue exposure paradigm):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &gt;1 SAE at least possibly related to endotoxin administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &gt;2 Grade 3 (severe) adverse events at least possibly related to endotoxin&#xD;
           administration, based on the FDA Guidance Document &quot;Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy&#xD;
           Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials&quot; ALCOHOL&#xD;
           CUE REACTIVITY SESSION (CR): Approximately 2 hours after receiving intravenous endotoxin&#xD;
           (or matched placebo), participants will complete the cue-exposure paradigm. Alcohol cue&#xD;
           exposure will follow well-established experimental procedures. Sessions will begin with&#xD;
           a 3-minute relaxation period. Participants will then hold and smell a glass of water for&#xD;
           3 minutes to control for the effects of simple exposure to any potable liquid. Next,&#xD;
           participants will hold and smell a glass of their preferred alcoholic beverage for 3&#xD;
           minutes. Order is not counterbalanced because of carryover effects that are known to&#xD;
           occur. Participants (who are smokers) will be allowed a smoke break immediately prior to&#xD;
           and immediately after the CR assessment. After every 3 minute period, participants will&#xD;
           rate their urge to drink on the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REWARD RESPONSIVENESS: Approximately 2 hours after receiving intravenous endotoxin (or&#xD;
      matched placebo), participants will complete the reward responsiveness paradigm, including&#xD;
      the Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT) and Reward Responsiveness Scale (RRS). The PRT is a&#xD;
      25-minute task that will be administered at baseline and hour 2. The task assesses behavioral&#xD;
      modulation as a function of reward-based reinforcement (i.e. reward seeking) by asking&#xD;
      participants to respond to stimuli, eliciting a response bias by introducing an asymmetric&#xD;
      reinforcer ratio. The RRS is a self-report questionnaire that measures reward responsiveness&#xD;
      by asking subjects to rate their agreement with various statements on a 4-point Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEUROIMAGING CUE-REACTIVITY (fMRI): Approximately 3 hours after receiving intravenous&#xD;
      endotoxin (or matched placebo), participants will complete a functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI) scan. This scan will include an fMRI visual alcohol cue-reactivity paradigm,&#xD;
      which will follow well-established procedures. The alcohol cues task consists of viewing&#xD;
      visual alcohol, negative, and neutral cues, presented in six 120-s epochs (total scan&#xD;
      duration: 12 minutes), with each epoch consisting of four 24-s blocks (one block of alcohol&#xD;
      cues, one block of neutral cues, one block of negative images, and one block of fixation).&#xD;
      Alcohol blocks will be specific to beverage type (beer, wine, or liquor), with two blocks of&#xD;
      each beverage type. Prior to scanning, participants will rate their craving on a four-point&#xD;
      scale and will also provide ratings of their craving immediately following each cue block.&#xD;

    <time_frame>The cue-reactivity paradigm is conducted 2 hours post-infusion of placebo or low dose endotoxin during the experimental visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol Urge Questionnaire score (alcohol minus water) is the primary outcome for the cue-reactivity paradigm. The Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ) is comprised of eight items rated on a 7-point Likert scale with items related to the subjective experience of alcohol craving. The minimum value is 8 and the maximum value is 56 with a higher score indicating greater subjective alcohol craving. The investigators are primarily interested in whether low dose endotoxin increases cue-induced craving for alcohol in non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers, relative to placebo and compared to light drinking controls.</description>
