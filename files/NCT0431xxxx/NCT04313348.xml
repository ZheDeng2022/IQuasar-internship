  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ugandan women and their children suffer from high maternal mortality (360 for every 100,000&#xD;
      women) and perinatal mortality (41 deaths per 1000 births). Only 58% of pregnant women attend&#xD;
      at least 4 Antenatal Care (ANC) visits (of the recommended 8) and only 70% deliver with a&#xD;
      skilled attendant. The design and evaluation of patient-centered, interventions to engage&#xD;
      social support and improve utilization of ANC and skilled delivery services, with an&#xD;
      overarching goal of improving maternal child health in lower-resourced settings.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 3 Overview. The investigator will pilot test the intervention to assess feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability and preliminary efficacy to improve ANC utilization and skilled births.&#xD;
      Randomization of 120 adult pregnant women of gestational ages â‰¤ 20 weeks of amenorrhea to&#xD;
      standard of care (information giving) (n=40), mHealth SMS intervention (n=40), and mHealth&#xD;
      SMS intervention plus mHealth social support engagement (n=40) will be done. Feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability will be primary outcomes. ANC visit attendance and proportion of births&#xD;
      attended by a skilled provider will be collected for power estimates for future studies,&#xD;
      designed to test the efficacy of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting: This study will take place at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital, Mbarara,&#xD;
      Uganda. Participants will be recruited through the antenatal Clinic, which receives over&#xD;
      30,000 women attending routine antenatal care annually (both normal and high-risk&#xD;
      pregnancies). The hospital conducts over 10,000 deliveries per year. Maternity services,&#xD;
      including delivery, are largely provided free of charge through public hospitals and health&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures: Study participants randomized to either of the intervention arms will&#xD;
      receive the CommCare application (eMobilize-Uganda) that will include message content and&#xD;
      information developed in aim 2. Participants will get adequate instructions on how to use the&#xD;
      application to retrieve information. The times and length for individual login sessions will&#xD;
      be recorded and transmitted to the server. The smart phone will serve as a gateway to display&#xD;
      and visualize intended message content in form of voice, video or text. Once visualization is&#xD;
      complete, login data will then be transmitted from the gateway device to a secure web-based&#xD;
      server for storage or further viewing through a web portal following a prompt to confirm&#xD;
      completion of viewing session and log out to enable submission of data to the server for&#xD;
      review via password access of any device that can access the web. Log-ins during periods of&#xD;
      inadequate cellular reception will be stored for later transmission. Study participants will&#xD;
      be given solar chargers and reminded to charge the phones as needed during enrolment. SMS&#xD;
      will also be sent via CommCare. Application log-ins will be considered as proxies for&#xD;
      accessing information to alter existing predisposing factors (such as negative health&#xD;
      beliefs) that could enable and improve perceived need to seek care. Engagement of social&#xD;
      networks will be to enable service utilization and motivate individuals to seek care through&#xD;
      regular scheduled SMS reminders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Prior to study initiation, a random number generator will be used to determine&#xD;
      arm assignment for study participants. Research assistants will be informed of the arm&#xD;
      assignment at the time of participant enrolment. Study arms will be defined as follows: Arm&#xD;
      1: will only receive the standard of care (information giving), as a &quot;Control arm&quot;. Study&#xD;
      participants in this arm will receive no SMS reminders nor social supporter notifications.&#xD;
      Arm 2, also called &quot;Scheduled SMS arm&quot;: Will receive an mHealth intervention targeted to the&#xD;
      study participant (such as health information on an eMobilize-Uganda application or messaging&#xD;
      and SMS reminders, or a voice call if at high risk). A weekly SMS reminder on the impending&#xD;
      ANC appointment and expected date of delivery at their preferred time and day of the week&#xD;
      will be sent to study participants. The content of the SMS reminders will be customized and&#xD;
      determined by everyone at enrolment. If the participant has no preference, we will suggest&#xD;
      &quot;This is your ANC visit reminder, encouraging you to attend&quot;. This technology is already&#xD;
      integrated and running in Uganda via the Yo! Uganda Gateway. Arm 3: Will receive an mhealth&#xD;
      intervention targeted to the participant plus an intervention targeted to engage the social&#xD;
      supporter. Study participants will receive health information and SMS reminders same as those&#xD;
      of &quot;scheduled SMS arm&quot; above + weekly SMS notifications to the 2 pre-identified social&#xD;
      supporters. Notifications will bear upcoming ANC visit and delivery due date for the study&#xD;
      participant they are supporting for all the study follow-up period (also called the &quot;social&#xD;
      support engagement arm&quot;). Social supporters will be able to personalize the SMS content at&#xD;
      enrolment. They will be advised to assist study participants with any problems that may&#xD;
      affect ANC attendance or facility delivery, but will not be given specific instructions on&#xD;
      what to do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: will be performed in the local language, Runyankole. Quantitative&#xD;
      questionnaire data will be collected from both study participants and their social supporters&#xD;
      at enrolment on the following topics: socio-demographic characteristics: maternal age,&#xD;
      gravidity, parity, gestational age, prenatal and antepartum high-risk morbidities,&#xD;
      depression, health, food insecurity, alcohol use, social support, reproductive health&#xD;
      history, perceptions on pregnancy and delivery. Reports of social support received by study&#xD;
      participants will not specify the source as it could occur from outside the dyad studied&#xD;
      here. Another questionnaire with closed and open-ended questions that explores specific role&#xD;
      of social supporter in study participant's life and pregnancy during study period,&#xD;
      communication or contact with study participant and what things they talked about or did&#xD;
      together, the type of voluntary and requested help or support given to or received by the&#xD;
      study participant during pregnancy towards improving her experience and attendance of&#xD;
      scheduled ANC visits, challenges and experiences to social support will be administered at&#xD;
      exit. At exit (within 2-4 weeks postpartum), a survey will be administered to assess the&#xD;
      understanding, likes, dislikes and challenges, perceived usefulness, ease of use, actual use,&#xD;
      barriers of the mHealth-based, social support intervention model aimed at improving&#xD;
      utilization of maternity services. Other delivery outcomes (having a still birth and or&#xD;
      maternal death), women responding to an SMS notification, number of log-ins to CommCare&#xD;
      application, time between scheduled and actual ANC review, birth preparedness, mode of&#xD;
      delivery, initiation of breastfeeding, 1 and 5-minute Apgar scores (if known), neonatal&#xD;
      weight, need for neonatal or maternal resuscitation, use of assisted ventilation by mother or&#xD;
      neonate, hospital stay and any other reported maternal or neonatal complications will be&#xD;
      documented. ANC attendance and delivery details will be collected by reviewing the routinely&#xD;
      provided ANC cards and postnatal discharge forms provided to confirm self-reports. Women will&#xD;
      be followed for at least 6 months and will receive the standard routine care provided at the&#xD;
      maternity centers. Data will be collected using an online database that will be developed in&#xD;
      CommCare to improve data completeness, management and quality control monitoring. Data entry&#xD;
      verification will include algorithms that automatically check completed forms for missing,&#xD;
      out-of-range, or inconsistent values before a form can be saved on the website. Additionally,&#xD;
      exit in-depth interviews with 30 study participants (15 from each intervention arm) and 10&#xD;
      social supporters will also be conducted to explore the patterns of social support and&#xD;
      mechanisms of effect of the intervention. This selection will be based on the study&#xD;
      participant's prenatal and perinatal outcomes, type of social support, and study participant&#xD;
      characteristics. These interviews with be carried out within the 2-4 weeks postpartum.&#xD;
      Interview guides will be developed with guidance from observed quantitative results, as well&#xD;
      as two theoretical frameworks; the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)&#xD;
      and the HUM. These interviews will last for an hour. To maximize data quality, we will ask&#xD;
      interviewees to describe actual experiences and events wherever possible. Examples of&#xD;
      interview topics will be: (1) Experiences: descriptions of particular experiences with the&#xD;
      telephone and SMS type (the most recent reminder or notification, or telephone received and&#xD;
      what happened as a result, the most or least helpful/useful reminder, notification or&#xD;
      telephone received and what happened as a result, (2) acceptance: advantages and&#xD;
      disadvantages of the mHealth intervention, ease of use, its ability to request or get support&#xD;
      as needed, guidance on what to do, SMS type; problems experienced with the intervention;&#xD;
      ideas for improvement, intention to use in future (3) consequences: changes or lack of&#xD;
      changes resulting from use of mHealth intervention and SMS type; (4) comparisons and&#xD;
      attitude: differences, similarities and attitude across the SMS types and other&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data analysis. I will use summary statistics to compare the health-related and&#xD;
      socio-demographic data for both study participants and social supporters between arms. We&#xD;
      will verify the technical function of the intervention with the following statistics: Number&#xD;
      of successful application log-ins, number of SMS received by the participant over number of&#xD;
      SMS anticipated per protocol, number and type of technical problems encountered, number of&#xD;
      SMS notifications responded to by the social supporters, number of women responding to an SMS&#xD;
      reminder or notification, time between scheduled and actual ANC review. I will assess&#xD;
      acceptability by describing the length of application log-ins, engagement of the application,&#xD;
      number of likes or dislikes for the intervention and reported ease of use. Although not&#xD;
      powered to detect significant differences, I will preliminarily compare maternal health&#xD;
      outcomes between the three study arms to consider power requirements for future larger&#xD;
      intervention studies. These outcomes will include attendance of at least 4 ANC visits,&#xD;
      delivery in presence of skilled personnel, still birth, and maternal death. To do so, I will&#xD;
      fit univariable and multivariable Poisson regression models. The multivariable model will&#xD;
      comprise of those baseline variables whose p-value will be &lt;0.1 from the univariable model. A&#xD;
      study arm will be included in all regression models to control for any potential differences&#xD;
      in ANC or delivery outcomes. The study participant's social support and the social&#xD;
      supporter's characteristics (type of relationship, income status, food insecurity, alcohol&#xD;
      use, gender, previous obstetric history, delivery status, place of delivery, morbidity/health&#xD;
      status, alcohol use, gender and involvement in any health or community group will be assessed&#xD;
      as potential predictors of ANC and delivery outcomes based on potential impact on the&#xD;
      relationship and instrumental support for the study participant. Study participant's social&#xD;
      support will be divided into instrumental and emotional support. Interactions between&#xD;
      instrumental support and food insecurity using the recommended Household Food Insecurity&#xD;
      Access Scale (HFIAS) and income status will also be assessed because of the low resource&#xD;
      nature of this setting which may impede the ability to provide physical support despite the&#xD;
      intension to do so. Data analysis will be conducted in STATA version 13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data analysis: In-depth interviews will be digitally recorded and transcribed.&#xD;
      The goal of the interviews will be to document the participants' experiences of the&#xD;
      mHealth-based social support intervention, mechanisms of effect and or contextual&#xD;
      explanations observed within the quantitative results, acceptance and patterns of social&#xD;
      support. Qualitative analysis will be inductive and categories will be derived from the&#xD;
      different social supporter/ study participant interviews and open-ended questions. These&#xD;
      responses will be transcribed into English and coded using Atlas.ti. Categories will then be&#xD;
      developed and presented with illustrative quotes from study participant and social supporter&#xD;
      data to explain the role, type, challenges, acceptance and experience of the intervention&#xD;
      during the study period.&#xD;
