  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative neurocognitive disorders, including postoperative delirium (POD) and&#xD;
      postoperaive cognitive dysfunction (POCD), are common complications of perioperative&#xD;
      neurocognition in elderly patients undergoing surgery. POD and POCD have short- and long-term&#xD;
      consequences, such as increased hospital stays and costs, augmented morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      as well as higher risk for cognitive decline later in life. Therefore, early prevention and&#xD;
      diagnosis of these conditions is of great importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of psychometric tests have been proposed as cognitive screening tools. Given the&#xD;
      fact that many of them show weaknesses and difficulties in performance, scientists have&#xD;
      sought for more useful alternatives. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is considered to be&#xD;
      a good choice, as it has been successfully applied in the perioperative setting. What's more,&#xD;
      it has been translated and validated for a Greek population with neurological disorders.&#xD;
      Addenbrooke's Congnitive Examination III (ACE III) has been introduced recently into clinical&#xD;
      practice. It is an easy to perform and detailed test that covers several neurocognitive&#xD;
      domains and has shown high sensitivity and specificity in clinical conditions, including&#xD;
      dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Although current literature lacks data concerning its&#xD;
      perioperative use, ACE III could prove useful for screening patients undergoing surgery and&#xD;
      anesthesia on the basis of its favorable characteristics as mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to translate the ACE III (English version 2012) into Greek and&#xD;
      assess its validity in perioperative patients aged &gt;55 years.&#xD;

      In this prospective cohort study, the ACE III will be translated and adapted into Greek by&#xD;
      the researchers according to the relative guidelines for cultural adaptation. Backwards&#xD;
      translation will be performed by a fluent bilingual specialist in order to ensure optimum&#xD;
      reliability of the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following power-analysis, 110 surgical patients and 70 healthy volunteers will be included in&#xD;
      the study protocol after informed consent.. Primary screening of the whole population will be&#xD;
      conducted using the MoCA test by two examiners. Simultaneously, the ACE III will be applied&#xD;
      in order to set baseline measurements for each participant. Healthy volunteers and patients&#xD;
      with MoCA scores at least 26 will form the control group. Retesting of patients and controls&#xD;
      with both questionnaires will be held 48 hours after initial assessment by the same&#xD;
      examiners. One third of the population will be assessed at the above time-points by an&#xD;
      observer to minimize subjectivity of examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total scores and subscores at both time-points will be calculated and comparative performance&#xD;
      of all participants will be assessed after statistical analysis of collected data.&#xD;
