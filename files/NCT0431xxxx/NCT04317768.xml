  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Jordanian children have very poor oral hygiene parameters, and this is reflected as very high&#xD;
      caries prevalence and poor gingival health conditions. This study will focus on children at&#xD;
      social homes in the community in order to establish a baseline reference about their oral&#xD;
      health status, treatment needs, and barriers to dental care. Also, to report the efficacy of&#xD;
      oral health education using audio-visual aids and frequent motivation on oral health status,&#xD;
      treatment needs and barriers to care among children at social homes in Jordan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The oral health status (OHS) for children and adults is a reflection of the whole body&#xD;
      general health status as well as the overall quality of life. Jordanian children have very&#xD;
      poor oral hygiene parameters, and this is reflected as very high caries prevalence and poor&#xD;
      gingival health conditions. Orphans and children who come from broken homes are suspected to&#xD;
      have poorer oral health conditions from their peers in the public due to the different&#xD;
      parameters that can affect their general health in whole and oral health in particular, and&#xD;
      this could affect their quality of life. These parameters can be related to socioeconomic&#xD;
      status, psychological and behavioral conditions, access to care and other factors. The role&#xD;
      of tooth brushing in decreasing dental caries and enhancing the gingival health is&#xD;
      well-established in the literature, and oral health education programs have proven to be&#xD;
      effective in improving the oral health knowledge, attitude and behavior of children. These&#xD;
      programs could be regarded as an effective measure to enhance the oral health status and&#xD;
      establish good routines in childhood which is vital for optimum oral health and provision of&#xD;
      lifelong protection against caries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will focus on children at social homes in the community in order to establish a&#xD;
      baseline reference about their oral health status, treatment needs, and barriers to dental&#xD;
      care. Also, to report the efficacy of oral health education using audio-visual aids and&#xD;
      frequent motivation on oral health status, treatment needs and barriers to care among&#xD;
      children at social homes in Jordan.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a cross-sectional study on a randomly selected group of children from randomly selected social homes in Jordan. Children and/or the care giver (n=500) will answer a questionnaire in an interview about his/her demographics, oral health related habits, the child general health status, the child oral health related quality of life, barriers to getting dental care, treatment needs for those children.&#xD;
A thorough clinical examination will be done to these children by a mouth mirror and explorer at a suitable room in the social home. The investigators will record the baseline oral health status parameters (Caries, gingival health and presence of plaque).&#xD;
For the interventions; A representative sample (25%) will be divided to two subgroups; group one (Study) and group two (Control) which will be matched for age and gender.</intervention_model_description>
