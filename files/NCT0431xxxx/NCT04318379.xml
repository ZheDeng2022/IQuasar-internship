      GC002 is a Phase I trial to evaluate the safety and the immune responses of a lentiviral&#xD;
      based HCV immunotherapy (HCVax™) in chronic HCV patients. Chronic HCV patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled sequentially into low dose and high dose groups. Following the vaccination subjects&#xD;
      who received at least one vaccination will be followed up for safety and immunological&#xD;
      response through week 28. All vaccine recipients will take part in a long-term safety&#xD;
      follow-up for 6 months following the completion of the vaccine series to assess delayed&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccination will first start at low dose. The investigators will enroll low dose group first.&#xD;
      Two subjects will be staggering enrolled every 2 weeks. Following the assessment and review&#xD;
      of prior vaccinations, if no vaccine definitely or probably-related severe adverse event&#xD;
      (grade 3 or above) or SAE occurs the vaccination schedule for low dose and high dose will&#xD;
      continue until complete enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive HCVax™ vaccine at 0, 8, 16 weeks through subcutaneous route.&#xD;
      Following vaccination subjects will have clinical, immunological and virologic assessments&#xD;
      throughout the 28-week study.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Documentation of chronic hepatitis C infection based on serum positivity for HCV RNA&#xD;
             for at least 6 months interval. HCV genotype will be recorded. All genotypes will be&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who are not under DAA treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Liver fibrosis (by Metavir stage F1 or F0) within one year of the screening visit,&#xD;
             documenting extent of liver disease consistent with chronic hepatitis C with evidence&#xD;
             of inflammation and/or fibrosis. Fibrosis scaling is based on an ultrasound based&#xD;
             elastography (FibroScan, Echosen, Paris France) with cutoff of 7.5 kPa or liver&#xD;
             biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Screening laboratory values within institutional normal range, with the exception of&#xD;
             liver enzymes ≤ 3 ULN and bilirubin &lt;1.5 ULN, or judged to be not clinically&#xD;
             significant by clinical investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability and willingness of subject to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Negative pregnancy test on the day prior to each vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Willingness to use adequate contraception by study participants. Subjects must agree&#xD;
             not to participate in a conception process (e.g., active attempts to become pregnant&#xD;
             or to impregnate, sperm donation, or in vitro fertilization), and if participating in&#xD;
             sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, subjects must use a form of&#xD;
             contraception as listed below while on study vaccine and for 60 days after stopping&#xD;
             study vaccine. Women without reproductive potential (i.e., have reached menopause or&#xD;
             undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) or women whose male&#xD;
             partner has undergone successful vasectomy with documented azoospermia or has&#xD;
             documented azoospermia for any other reason, are eligible without requiring the use of&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of decompensated liver disease, including but not restricted to, portal&#xD;
             hypertension as manifested by a known history of gastroesophageal varices, variceal&#xD;
             bleeding, ascites or encephalopathy, histopathologic or clinical evidence of&#xD;
             cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or renal impairment consistent with hepatorenal&#xD;
             syndrome; history of significant other non-HCV chronic liver disease, i.e. alcoholic&#xD;
             hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of hematologic disease (e.g., cryoglobulinemia, lymphoma), renal disease,&#xD;
             dermatologic disease (e.g., lichen planus, porphyria cutanea tarda).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or HIV-1 antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Autoimmune diseases or clinically serious cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
             hepatic, renal or neurologic disease, which in the opinion of the investigator will&#xD;
             compromise ability to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Previous receipt of any HCV experimental vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnancy and breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prior or current systemic cancer chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;

             factors, systemic corticosteroids, interleukins or interferons) within 90 days prior&#xD;
             to study entry. NOTE: Subjects may not be on antiretroviral agents not yet approved by&#xD;
             the FDA as part of a clinical trial or expanded access program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Anaphylaxis or allergy to vaccine components.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             would interfere with adherence to study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any other serious diseases other than HCV infection including current or recent&#xD;
             (within 5 years) cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Liver fibrosis with Metavir stage F2 or above.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects with diabetes mellitus, who are at higher risk for more rapid progression of&#xD;
             fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects who are immunocompromised or immunosuppressed due to disease or medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
