      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suicide is the second leading cause of death for young people ages 10-24 years. There is no&#xD;
      gold standard for evaluating suicidal thoughts and behaviors in young people with autism&#xD;
      spectrum disorder (ASD) or other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Also, youth with ASD/NDD&#xD;
      are often excluded from many research studies. Because of this, researchers need more data.&#xD;
      They want to make sure they are asking the best questions for young people in clinics such as&#xD;
      the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) clinic. They want to make sure they have the&#xD;
      best data to determine if a person is at risk for hurting or killing himself or herself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop and assess the efficacy of a suicide screening tool for people with ASD/NDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Youth ages 8 to 17 who are engaged in assessment or treatment at the NIMH for ASD or other&#xD;
      NDD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill out 4 questionnaires during a 1-hour meeting with study staff. They&#xD;
      will answer questions about how they have been feeling. They will be asked if they think&#xD;
      about or plan to hurt or kill themselves. They will also be asked if they have ever thought&#xD;
      about it or planned it in the past. Other questions will assess their understanding of death.&#xD;
      Participants can take a break if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents of the participants will be asked similar questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will be informed if their child has current thoughts of suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1 week after the initial assessment, parents will be contacted to fill out a follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaire. It will take about 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no gold standard is available for evaluating suicidal thoughts and behaviors in&#xD;
      individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or other Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDD).&#xD;
      Moreover, youth with ASD/NDD are often excluded from instrument validation studies.&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a paucity of sufficiently adapted and validated clinical suicide risk&#xD;
      assessments for use with clients with ASD/NDD. The main objective of this study is to develop&#xD;
      and assess the efficacy of a suicide screening tool for individuals with ASD/NDD. More&#xD;
      specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To assess the sensitivity/specificity of the ASQ in detecting suicide risk in youth&#xD;
      with ASD/NDD by comparing its performance to that of the gold-standard clinician s brief&#xD;
      suicide safety assessment, and legacy measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To test the addition/deletion of candidate items on the sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      the ASQ in detecting suicide risk in youth with ASD/NDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multisite study that will take place at NIH, within the Neurodevelopmental and&#xD;
      Behavioral Phenotyping Service and two other sites: Kennedy Krieger Institute, in Baltimore,&#xD;
      MD and Nationwide Children s Hospital in Columbus, OH. The study population will be patients&#xD;
      at the participating sites, ages 8 to 17, diagnosed with ASD/NDD or enrolled in a clinic or&#xD;
      research clinic that serves patients with neurodevelopmental concerns. This is a newly&#xD;
      proposed study that will incorporate pilot data already collected from protocol 12-M-N034.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective instrument validation study. Potential participants will be&#xD;
      patients presenting to outpatient health clinics at the three study hospitals. Study staff&#xD;
      will consult with a charge nurse , unit coordinator, or someone who knows the roster of&#xD;
      patients in order to identify potential subjects to be approached for consent. Following&#xD;
      informed consent and assent procedures, study staff will administer the following measures to&#xD;
      patients: the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions for Youth with Autism and Intellectual&#xD;
      Disability Candidate Items (ASQ-AID Candidate Items that includes the four ASQ items), an&#xD;
      Understanding Death Assessment, the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire Child Version (SIQ-CV;&#xD;
      About my Life ), and the Study Evaluation Questionnaire. A study team member will ask the&#xD;
      parents/guardians to complete a caregiver corroboration survey: the Ask Suicide-Screening&#xD;
      Questions for Youth with Autism and Intellectual Disability Caregiver Form (ASQ-AID Caregiver&#xD;
      Form). A mental health clinician will fill out supplemental forms: including the Clinician s&#xD;
      Brief Suicide Safety Assessment (BSSA) Form and when applicable, the Clinician Follow-up Form&#xD;
      approximately one month after the initial study visit. One week after data collection, a&#xD;
      study team member will conduct the Parent Follow-up Interview. When resources are not&#xD;
      available at a site the Clinician Follow-up Form and the Parent Follow-up Form will be&#xD;
      omitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the ASQ-AID Candidate Items, which will be tested against the&#xD;
      clinician s BSSA, the SIQ-CV, along with the ASQ-AID Caregiver Form. Secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures include data from the Research Assistant Evaluation Form, Understanding Death&#xD;
      Assessment, and the Clinician Follow-up Form.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be engaged in assessment or treatment in one of the inpatient or&#xD;
             outpatient medical health settings from one of the study site hospitals that are part&#xD;
             of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be verbally fluent and have the ability to communicate verbally.&#xD;
             This will, in part, be determined by one of the patient s clinicians or trained study&#xD;
             staff, who will also be an associate investigator for this study and will already have&#xD;
             routine access to information regarding the patient s verbal fluency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the parent/patient expresses interest in participating in a research study, verbal&#xD;
             fluency will be further confirmed by asking the parents if the child is verbally&#xD;
             fluent (e.g. regularly speaks in sentences), asking the parent if their child will be&#xD;
             able to understand and answer the study questions, and by observing the subject as&#xD;
             they are explaining the study. The observation will entail taking a verbatim language&#xD;
             sample if needed and discussing the decision about whether the child meets this verbal&#xD;
             fluency criteria with a study supervisor if needed. The data collectors will be at&#xD;
             least high school graduates and over the age of 18 and be trained in assessing fluency&#xD;
             level through parent interview and observation. They will also be trained to&#xD;
             understand the presentation of individuals with ASD, as well as in how to respond if&#xD;
             the child is noncompliant or presents with suicidal thoughts and behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 8 years to 17.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English speaking child and parent; may use an Augmentative and Alternative&#xD;
             Communication (AAC) device to assist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A legal guardian must provide permission and participant must sign an assent document&#xD;
             or provide verbal assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation&#xD;
        in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The parent or the legal guardian is unavailable/unwilling to sign consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant will not have prisoner status, e.g. not on probation or house arrest&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Children: Children and adolescents with ASD/NDD are the focus of the study due to the lack&#xD;
        of suicide risk screening tools available for this general population. Clients who do not&#xD;
        speak English will be excluded from the study. Unfortunately, the screening tools that will&#xD;
        be utilized in this study are not available at this time in any other languages besides&#xD;
        English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OTHER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study sites include health clinic or psychiatric units that serve children, adolescents&#xD;
        or adults with ASD/NDD. Currently these sites service suicidal individuals and no validated&#xD;
        instrument with which to assess these vulnerable individuals.&#xD;
