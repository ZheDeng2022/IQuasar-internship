      This study aims to compare the effects of Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy and wet-to-dry&#xD;
      dressing on Stages 3 and 4 pressure injuries, and to investigate the consistency of&#xD;
      Three-Dimensional Wound Measurement Device findings with Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing&#xD;
      Tool scores. This study is a randomized controlled trial. A total of 30 patients with Stages&#xD;
      3 and 4 pressure injuries were included in the study. The patients were divided into two&#xD;
      groups: the experimental group or Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy group and the control or&#xD;
      wet-to-dry dressing group. All patients received 3 rounds of treatment. Data were collected&#xD;
      with a Patient Identification Form, Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing Tool and the findings of&#xD;
      Three-Dimensional Wound Measurement Device. We found that granulation tissue formation was&#xD;
      more significant in the experimental group (p &lt; .05), and that there was more significant&#xD;
      wound shrinkage (p &lt; .05) with a more significant decrease in the Pressure Ulcer Scale for&#xD;
      Healing Tool scores (p &lt; .05). The wounds were assessed with the Tool and the&#xD;
      Three-Dimensional Wound Measurement device. Device measurements were found to be correlated&#xD;
      with Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing Tool Tool findings (p &lt; .05) There was a significant&#xD;
      correlation between device-measured granulation findings and PUSH Tool score results of the&#xD;
      experimental group's third measurements (p &lt; .05). We conclude that Negative-Pressure Wound&#xD;
      Therapy is an effective treatment method for pressure injuries, and Three-Dimensional Wound&#xD;
      Measurement device is an usable wound assessment tool.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pressure injuries are a major health problem in that they are difficult to treat, reduce the&#xD;
      patients' quality of life, and increase length of hospital stay and overall health care&#xD;
      costs. Furthermore, several possible wound healing complications, such as infections, can&#xD;
      lead to mortality. That said, the prevalence of pressure injuries is an important indicator&#xD;
      of quality in hospitals. Pressure injuries do not only impact health, but also cause social&#xD;
      isolation and dependency, resulting in further psychological problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our review of the literature revealed that the incidence of pressure ulcers varies between&#xD;
      0.4% and 38% in hospitalized patients, between 2.2 and 23.9% in intensive care units and&#xD;
      between 0-17% in home care. NPUAP (National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel) reports that the&#xD;
      cost of treating pressure ulcers has been gradually increasing. It was estimated that&#xD;
      treating pressure injuries costs around $11 billion annually in the United States alone.&#xD;
      Treating a pressure ulcer can cost anywhere between $500 to $70,000, the most substantial&#xD;
      fraction being nursing services. In the UK, it costs £1,064 to treat a Stage 1 pressure&#xD;
      injury, and this number can reach £10,551 for more advanced ulcers. This illustrates the&#xD;
      direct link between the stage of pressure injury and the cost of treatment. On average, it&#xD;
      costs the UK healthcare system £1.4-2.1 billion annually to treat pressure ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many products and methods available for pressure ulcer treatment, but the most&#xD;
      well-known and most commonly preferred method is wet-to-dry dressing. That said, researchers&#xD;
      have tried and developed several novel methods for the treatment of pressure injuries&#xD;
      including NPWT (Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy), hyperbaric oxygen therapy, ultrasonography,&#xD;
      hydrotherapy, magnetic field therapy, ultraviolet rays, electrical stimulation, phototherapy&#xD;
      and growth hormone application. Together with these non-invasive treatment methods, surgical&#xD;
      intervention can also be a treatment option, especially for non-healing wounds. The European&#xD;
      and US National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panels' (EPUAP and NPUAP) guidelines recommend NPWT&#xD;
      for deep-tissue pressure injuries, namely Stages 3 and 4, as a supportive tool for&#xD;
      early-stage treatment. This method is based on applying negative pressure to promote wound&#xD;
      healing. Several studies report that NPWT increases granulation tissue formation and reduces&#xD;
      wound area. It is indicated that NPWT provides continuous and effective wound debridement in&#xD;
      the wound area and increases blood supply to the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure injuries are among the most significant current health problems that are handled by&#xD;
      a medical nurse. As the primary caregiver for the hospitalized patient, the nurse must&#xD;
      prioritize preventing wound formation and eliminating any risk factors. If a pressure sore&#xD;
      does form, the primary goal is to plan and implement appropriate care and nursing&#xD;
      interventions in collaboration with the patient and their family to ensure proper wound&#xD;
      healing .&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the nurse's responsibility to keep up with scientific developments in patient care and&#xD;
      try to integrate them into their work. PUSH is a tool that is used for monitoring pressure&#xD;
      ulcers; however, it has yet to become a part of routine practice in Turkey. The&#xD;
      Three-Dimensional Wound Management (3-DWM) device has been used in medical service since&#xD;
      2015, but with only a limited number of studies that evaluate its effectiveness. Currently,&#xD;
      the wet-to-dry dressing method is the most commonly preferred treatment method for wound care&#xD;
      in Turkish healthcare. There are indeed numerous studies that demonstrate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of wet dressings in wound healing. Wet dressings provide the appropriate medium for the&#xD;
      accumulation of patient's own body fluids between wound surface and dressing while preventing&#xD;
      dehydration. This study aims to compare the effects of Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT)&#xD;
      and wet-to-dry dressing on Stages 3 and 4 pressure injuries, and to investigate the&#xD;
      consistency of 3-DWM device measurement findings with PUSH Tool scores.&#xD;

    <description>NPWT was applied three times for Class III and pressure ulcers. An initial pre-treatment measurement was used as a baseline, followed by three post-treatment measurements after each round to evaluate wound healing. A total of four measurements were performed for each subject. Wound healing was measured using the PUSH Tool and the 3DWM device in both groups.</description>

    <description>The wounds were initially evaluated for any necrotic findings and debrided if needed, and then washed with an antiseptic solution. 3-DWM was used to measure the pressure sores by taking pictures.The length and width of wounds were measured with disposable paper rulers. Wound depth was determined in centimeters with a sterile cotton-tip applicator by measuring against a ruler. The wound was closed using a Wound Care Kit that includes foam dressing, film drape, TRAC pad with tubing and a drainage canister. Foam material was placed inside the wound and was attached to the canister through tubing.The canister was attached to the Vacuum-Assisted Closure device, which is a portable device that applies intermittent or continuous negative pressure.The device was operated at 125 mmHg pressure for 5 minutes with and 2 minutes without active vacuum.Wound dressings were changed every 48 hours.Wound area was measured after all three rounds of treatment.</description>
