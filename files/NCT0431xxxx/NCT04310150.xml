      In this prospective open-label randomized trial, 80 patients with elective off-pump coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery were enrolled. After primary suture of aortocoronary&#xD;
      anastomosis, if an area of hemorrhage was identified, patients were randomized to receive&#xD;
      Floseal® or Collastat® (n=40), respectively. The selected agent was applied with compression&#xD;
      of the target area for 1 min. If hemostasis was not achieved, the agent was re-applied for a&#xD;
      further 1 min, and was repeated up to 5 min, after which rescue treatment was applied,&#xD;
      including any conventional surgical methods.&#xD;

      [Patients] A total of 80 patients were enrolled over a 12-month period in a prospective&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial between March 2018 and March 2019. The Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      (IRB) at our site approved the study prior to patient enrollment (Severance Hospital, South&#xD;
      Korea, IRB number; 1-2017-0094), and the study was performed in accordance with the ethical&#xD;
      standards as laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Informed&#xD;
      consent was obtained prior to the operative procedure. The inclusion criteria for enrollment&#xD;
      eligibility specified patients aged 19 years or older, undergoing elective OPCAB surgery with&#xD;
      multi-vessel coronary artery disease. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or had a&#xD;
      known sensitivity to any components of the bovine thrombin preparations or the porcine or&#xD;
      bovine origin materials. The patients who were taking antithrombotic or antiplatelet agents&#xD;
      for more than one week, except for aspirin, or who had hematologic disease were also excluded&#xD;
      from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Procedure and scoring system according to hemostatic status] Baseline complete blood count&#xD;
      with differential, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time,&#xD;
      electrolyte, and hepatic or renal panel were drawn within 24 hours prior to surgery. Patient&#xD;
      enrollment occurred in the operating room when an aortocoronary bypass was finally&#xD;
      determined. After full median sternotomy, heparin (0.7-1.0 mg/kg) was administered to achieve&#xD;
      the target activated clotting time (ACT; &gt;300 sec). In all patients, a saphenous vein or&#xD;
      radial artery grafts were anastomosed to the aorta using the Heartstring device (MAQUET&#xD;
      Holding B.V. &amp; Co. KG, Rastatt, Germany). After identification of an aortocoronary&#xD;
      anastomosis site, patients were offered the allocated treatment regimen for one of the 2&#xD;
      hemostatic agents, Floseal® or Collastat®, using the sealed envelope system. The selected&#xD;
      agent was prepared immediately prior to use after randomization, and was delivered to the&#xD;
      site of bleeding via a single-barrel syringe, and light compression was applied with a wet&#xD;
      gauze until the bleeding stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We defined the scoring system according to hemostasis status including the following details.&#xD;
      At first, the bleeding site was characterized as oozing or pulsatile. The hemostasis status&#xD;
      was graded using the 3 steps method (0: no bleeding, 1: oozing, and 2: active bleeding). The&#xD;
      treatment was applied with pressure to the target area for 1 min. If hemostasis was achieved&#xD;
      within this time, the time to hemostasis was recorded as 1 min. If hemostasis was not&#xD;
      achieved, the treatment was re-applied for a further 1 min. if hemostasis was not achieved&#xD;
      after 5 min, conventional surgical suture was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protamine was administered at the end of the OPCAB procedure. The pericardium was loosely&#xD;
      closed after the surgery, the midline sternotomy was closed in layers, and 2 mediastinal&#xD;
      drains were left in place. Participants in both groups took aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel 75&#xD;
      mg daily from the first postoperative day. Patients with hemoglobin (Hb) values below 60 g/L&#xD;
      always received transfusion therapy. In stable patients with Hb values between 60 and 100&#xD;
      g/L, an evaluation of the patients' clinical status was necessary to determine if transfusion&#xD;
      is warranted (Grade of recommendation: 1C+). Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was&#xD;
      indicated for the following: correction of congenital deficiencies of clotting factors for&#xD;
      which a specific concentrate did not exist; for multiple acquired deficiencies; when the&#xD;
      prothrombin time or aPTT, expressed as a ratio, was greater than 1.5; microvascular bleeding&#xD;
      in patients undergoing massive transfusion; acute disseminated intravascular coagulation in&#xD;
      the presence of ongoing bleeding; together with correction of the underlying cause (Grade of&#xD;
      recommendation: 1C+). The platelet concentrates were indicated if the count was below&#xD;
      50x109/L and there was ongoing excessive bleeding (Grade of recommendation: 2C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Definition of terms and Endpoint] The following definition was used for application of the&#xD;
      agents in the clinical setting: successful hemostasis was achieved when there was cessation&#xD;
      of visible bleeding after completion of the hemostatic agent administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end points were the proportion of patients with complete hemostasis within 5 min&#xD;
      for the aortocoronary anastomosis site treated by hemostatic agents Floseal® or Collastat®&#xD;
      and the proportion of patients with complete hemostasis evaluated at 1, 2, and every minute&#xD;
      up to 5 minutes. Secondary end points were the time required for hemostasis, blood loss in&#xD;
      the operative day, amount of blood products transfused both intraoperatively and&#xD;
      postoperatively, rate of surgical revision for bleeding, total length of intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) stay, and rate of postoperative morbidity/ mortality.&#xD;
