      Protein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) inhibitors demonstrated efficacy in&#xD;
      cholesterol reduction and in the prevention of cardiovascular events. The investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate changes in lipid profile, oxidation markers and subclinical atherosclerosis in&#xD;
      patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) during 12 weeks of treatment with a PCSK-9&#xD;
      inhibitor, Evolocumab®.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies emphasize the role of high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol&#xD;
      (LDL-C) as the main causative factor in atherosclerosis development. Among patients with&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia, those with very high levels of LDL-C exhibit increased prevalence of&#xD;
      subclinical atherosclerosis and a higher atherosclerosis progression, thus leading to a&#xD;
      significantly higher CV risk. Endothelial dysfunction is the earliest stage of the&#xD;
      atherosclerotic process and even a trigger of CV events. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is&#xD;
      widely accepted as an accurate and non-invasive method to assess vascular reactivity and, in&#xD;
      turn, as a surrogate marker of subclinical atherosclerosis and an independent predictor of CV&#xD;
      events. It's well known that hypercholesterolemia has been associated with decreased&#xD;
      endothelial function and increased oxidative stress. Although statin treatment represented&#xD;
      for years the gold standard as lipid lowering therapy, the target LDL-C is not always&#xD;
      achieved, mainly among patients with very high levels of LDL-C. More recently, PCSK-9&#xD;
      inhibitors demonstrated efficacy in LDL-C reduction, in the prevention from CV events and in&#xD;
      atherosclerotic burden regression. Some data showed an effect of PCSK-9 inhibitors on&#xD;
      endothelial function, but no evidence is available on effect on LDL subfractions. Small dense&#xD;
      LDL (sd-LDL) are considered an emerging risk factor for cardiovascular disease due to a&#xD;
      greater atherogenic potential [ ] and are important markers for predicting CV risk.&#xD;
