      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY vaccines when concomitantly administered to healthy subjects 16-18&#xD;
      years of age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As per the recommendation from Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) the study&#xD;
      has been amended to include a new &quot;agar-overlay&quot; serum bactericidal assay using human serum&#xD;
      complement (hSBA). Additional changes include validation of the MenB manual to measure&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the meningococcal group B vaccine, a modification in the definition of&#xD;
      4-fold increase in post-vaccination hSBA titer definition when the pre-vaccination titer is&#xD;
      below the limit of detection, and a modification in the population set to be used for safety&#xD;
      analysis wherein the exposed set is to be used for all safety analyses.&#xD;

    <time_frame>During the 7 days (including day of vaccination) after each vaccination (Administered on day 1, day 61 and day 91)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Solicited local adverse events assessed are injection site pain, erythema, swelling, induration. Any erythema, swelling and swelling is defined as a symptom with a surface diameter equal or greater than 25 millimeter.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of subjects with any unsolicited adverse events, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), AEs leading to withdrawal and medically attended AEs .</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 30 days (including day of vaccination)after each vaccination (Administered at Day 1, Day 61 and Day 91)</time_frame>
    <description>Unsolicited adverse events are defined as any AE reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study. Also, any 'solicited' symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms are reported as an unsolicited adverse event.&#xD;
Any solicited AE that has not resolved within 30 days post vaccination and is reported during clinic visits or safety follow-up calls is entered into the subject's electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) as an unsolicited AE.&#xD;
SAEs are any untoward medical occurrence that result in death, are life-threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, result in disability/incapacity and is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject Medically attended AEs are symptoms or illnesses requiring hospitalization, or emergency room visit, or visit to/by a health care provider.</description>
