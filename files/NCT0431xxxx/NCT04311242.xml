  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by the recurrence of unprovoked seizures&#xD;
      that affects approximately 3.4 million people in the United States (1.2% of the total United&#xD;
      States population) and more than 65 million people globally. The most commonly used&#xD;
      treatments for epilepsy are antiepileptic drugs (AEDs); however, approximately 25% to 30% of&#xD;
      the epilepsy population is considered pharmaco-resistant (characterized by the failure of â‰¥2&#xD;
      appropriately chosen and dosed AEDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research suggests that the intestinal microbiota plays a central role in human health,&#xD;
      and may play a role in a variety of central nervous system disorders, including seizure&#xD;
      susceptibility. The microbiota has been shown to be associated with changes in factors&#xD;
      relevant to neurotransmission, including neurotransmitter signaling, synaptic protein&#xD;
      expression, long-term potentiation, and myelination. In addition to the microbiota's&#xD;
      potential role in general neurotransmission, research suggests that the gut microbiome may&#xD;
      differ between patients with pharmaco-resistant and pharmaco-sensitive epilepsies. Diet has&#xD;
      been explored as an alternative form of therapy for patients with epilepsy, with the&#xD;
      ketogenic diet showing promise as an alternative treatment for patients with drug-resistant&#xD;
      epilepsy.&#xD;
