    <description>CL/f was a measure of the rate at which a drug was metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. CL/f was calculated as Dose/AUC0-inf, where AUC0-inf was estimated by determining the total area under the curve of the concentration versus time curve extrapolated to infinity. AUC0-inf was calculated as AUC0-t + Clast pred/Lambda Z, where Clast pred was the calculated plasma concentration at the last sampling time point at which the measured plasma concentration was at or above the lower limit of quantification (LLQ) and Lambda Z was the apparent terminal rate constant determined from the terminal slope of the log-transformed plasma concentration curve.</description>

For single dose Vz/f = Dose/(AUC0-inf*Lambda Z), where AUC0-inf = (AUC0-t + Clast pred/Lambda Z). Clastpred was the calculated plasma concentration at the last sampling time point at which the measured plasma concentration was at or above the LLQ and Lambda Z = the apparent terminal rate constant determined from the terminal slope of the log-transformed plasma concentration curve.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero Extrapolated to Infinity (AUC0-inf) of Racemic-Praziquantel (Rac-PZQ), R-(-)-PZQ and S-(+)-PZQ</title>
        <description>AUC0-inf was calculated by combining AUC0-t and AUCextra. AUCextra represents an extrapolated value obtained by Clast pred/Lambda z, where Clast pred was the calculated plasma concentration at the last sampling time point at which the measured plasma concentration is at or above the Lower Limit of quantification (LLQ) and Lambda z was the apparent terminal rate constant determined by log-linear regression analysis of the measured plasma concentrations of the terminal log-linear phase.</description>

        <title>Apparent Clearance (CL/f) of Racemic-Praziquantel (Rac-PZQ), R-(-)-PZQ and S-(+)-PZQ</title>
        <description>CL/f was a measure of the rate at which a drug was metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. CL/f was calculated as Dose/AUC0-inf, where AUC0-inf was estimated by determining the total area under the curve of the concentration versus time curve extrapolated to infinity. AUC0-inf was calculated as AUC0-t + Clast pred/Lambda Z, where Clast pred was the calculated plasma concentration at the last sampling time point at which the measured plasma concentration was at or above the lower limit of quantification (LLQ) and Lambda Z was the apparent terminal rate constant determined from the terminal slope of the log-transformed plasma concentration curve.</description>
