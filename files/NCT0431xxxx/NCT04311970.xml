    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a prevalent chronic inflammatory condition of the esophagus&#xD;
      characterized by esophageal eosinophilia that can lead to inflammation and stricture&#xD;
      formation. To assess remission, esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGD) with biopsies are&#xD;
      performed. This can lead to multiple EGDs, which are invasive and costly procedures. EsoCheck&#xD;
      is a promising noninvasive device. It is an encapsulated balloon that can be easily swallowed&#xD;
      and collect cells from the distal esophagus. The primary aim of this study is to determine&#xD;
      the feasibility and safety of EsoCheck compared with standard endoscopy and biopsies in the&#xD;
      assessment of EoE. This will be a prospective cross-sectional study of adult patients&#xD;
      (greater than or equal to 22 years of age) at the University of Pennsylvania with a diagnosis&#xD;
      of EoE scheduled for a clinically indicated upper endoscopy.&#xD;

      Background Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the&#xD;
      esophagus characterized by esophageal eosinophilia that can lead to esophageal remodeling and&#xD;
      stricture formation. To assess remission, upper endoscopy (EGD) with biopsies is performed.&#xD;
      This is an invasive procedure and contributes to cost burden for patients. It is important to&#xD;
      assess non-invasive techniques to sample the cells of the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been a few non-invasive testing modalities suggested, including the esophageal&#xD;
      string test and Cytosponge. These involve swallowing a string or capsule that ultimately&#xD;
      collects esophageal cells. The string test study showed a significant correlation with&#xD;
      traditional biopsy pathology, however, limitations included the string remaining in overnight&#xD;
      and potential contamination from oral flora. Katzka et al showed that the Cytosponge had an&#xD;
      86% specificity with limitations including gelatin allergy, local esophageal abrasions and&#xD;
      similar potential oral contamination as the esophageal string test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another promising device is EsoCheck. This is an encapsulated balloon that can be easily&#xD;
      swallowed and collect cells from the distal esophagus. It is well tolerated and, in Barrett's&#xD;
      esophagus, detected metaplasia with 91.7% specificity. The primary aims of this study are to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility and safety of EsoCheck compared with standard endoscopy and&#xD;
      biopsies in the assessment of EoE. Secondary aims include specific and sensitivity of&#xD;
      EsoCheck as well as specificity and sensitivity of brush cytology given that EsoCheck is a&#xD;
      cytology device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed Description Study design This is a prospective pilot study at the University of&#xD;
      Pennsylvania to evaluate feasibility and safety. Inclusion criteria include patients at least&#xD;
      22 years of age with known EoE diagnosed in accordance with consensus guidelines previously&#xD;
      scheduled upper endoscopy at the University of Pennsylvania. Exclusion criteria include:&#xD;
      known or suspected contraindication for esophageal intubation, esophageal stricture with&#xD;
      inability to pass an endoscope, history of esophageal perforation, history of esophageal&#xD;
      resection, esophageal diverticula, esophageal fistula, pill dysphagia, pill swallowing&#xD;
      phobia, food impaction, esophageal varices, coagulopathy, active anticoagulation or&#xD;
      antithrombotics, active GI bleeding and pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients will be approached for consent until a total of 20 patients are&#xD;
      enrolled. Patients will be approached during the same clinic visit if they meet inclusion&#xD;
      criteria that arranges for the EGD or via telephone up to 2 weeks prior to scheduled EGD.&#xD;
      Charts will be reviewed and patients will be asked medical and surgical history questions to&#xD;
      assess if any exclusion criteria. Written consent will be obtained on the day of endoscopy.&#xD;
      Charts will be reviewed and patients called at 1 week follow up to assess if any adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EsoCheck Description The investigational product is called EsoCheck. EsoCheck is an&#xD;
      encapsulated, inflatable, surface-textured balloon that is pill-sized (16x9mm) attached to a&#xD;
      thin 2.16 mm silicone catheter. The device is swallowed with water. The catheter will be held&#xD;
      without any tension to facilitate easy delivery to the stomach. The balloon is then inflated&#xD;
      by injecting 5 cc of air through the catheter. This will be gently withdrawn until the&#xD;
      tension from the esophageal sphincter is felt by the endoscopist. It is then pulled slowly to&#xD;
      sample the esophagus. The balloon is then deflated while still in the distal esophagus using&#xD;
      a syringe and inverted back into the capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EsoCheck Administration and Upper Endoscopy During the intervention period of the trial,&#xD;
      patients will arrive early for their scheduled endoscopy. This involves swallowing the&#xD;
      balloon device while unsedated. They will then undergo their previously scheduled endoscopy&#xD;
      with standard biopsies taken as well as brush cytology performed as EsoCheck is a cytology&#xD;
      device to best compare histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EsoCheck and Brush Cytology Sample Processing and Handling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After retrieval of the capsule through the mouth, the balloon will be re-inflated, cut from&#xD;
      the capsule at the junction of the balloon and the holding capsule. This will be immediately&#xD;
      placed into a pre-labeled vial of Preservcyt transport medium. Vials will be stored on site&#xD;
      in locked cabinets at room temperature. They will be shipped in small batches with&#xD;
      de-identified patient study numbers and sent to the Cytology Department c/o Dr. Joseph&#xD;
      Willis, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimens will be processed according to the standard operating procedures of the Department&#xD;
      of Pathology at the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. The vial containing the&#xD;
      balloon is vortexed for 5 minutes, after which the balloon is then discarded. After&#xD;
      centrifugation, the vial is then loaded onto the ThinPrep processor along with required&#xD;
      assembly elements - including a pre-labeled slide corresponding to the received specimens.&#xD;
      The ThinPrep filter rotates within the specimen vial creating turbulence that is strong&#xD;
      enough to separate cells, debris and mucus. In cell collection, a vacuum collects cells on&#xD;
      the exterior of the membrane of the filter. In cell transfer, the filter is inverted and&#xD;
      gently pressed against the ThinPrep microscope slide. Slight positive air pressure causes the&#xD;
      cells to adhere to the microscope slide resulting in an even distribution of cells in a&#xD;
      circular area. A ThinPrep slide is then generated and is deposited in an alcohol fixative&#xD;
      bath. The slide is then stained with a Hematoxylin and Eosin stain and cover slipped. After&#xD;
      the ThinPrep slides are made, attempts will be made to prepare cell blocks from the reminder&#xD;
      of the material Cytology brush samples will be analyzed at the University Hospitals Cleveland&#xD;
      Medical Center as well with specimens processed according to the standard operating&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologic and cytologic assessment EsoCheck derived samples will be analyzed at the&#xD;
      University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. ThinPrep slidesare given to a trained&#xD;
      gastroenterology cytopathologist for review. As the ThinPrep technology smears collected&#xD;
      cells onto the slide in a uniform manner using a membrane-based technology, the&#xD;
      cytopathologist will count eosinophils in one quadrant of the ThinPrep slide. These results&#xD;
      will then be compared with the clinical and pathological features of the study individuals.&#xD;
      The cell blocks will also be reviewed and results correlated with the ThinPrep slide results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of brush cytology specimens will be performed at the Department of Pathology at&#xD;
      the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center to include assessing eosinophil count per&#xD;
      high power field (hpf).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologic assessment of esophageal biopsies will be performed as part of standard of care at&#xD;
      the University of Pennsylvania Department of Pathology and will include assessing eosinophil&#xD;
      count/hpf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys: Endoscopists will be surveyed regarding perceived anxiety level and comfort level&#xD;
      during procedure. Patients will be surveyed before and afterwards regarding confidence level,&#xD;
      anxiety level, satisfaction, willingness to undergo it again, and preference of EsoCheck&#xD;
      compared with EGD. This survey will be repeated at a 1 week telephone follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Plan: Baseline and demographic characteristics will be summarized by standard&#xD;
      descriptive statistics (including mean and standard deviation for continuous variables such&#xD;
      as age and standard percentages for categorical variables such as gender). The primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be descriptive statistics of feasibility and patient safety assessed based on&#xD;
      the answers to surveys as listed above. Secondary endpoints include the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of Esocheck with EGD and biopsy as gold standard. Secondary endpoints also&#xD;
      include sensitivity and specificity of brush cytology with EGD and biopsy as gold standard.&#xD;
      All subjects entered into the study will have detailed information collected on adverse&#xD;
      events for the overall study safety analysis&#xD;
