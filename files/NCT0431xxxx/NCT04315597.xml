  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers in this trial want to learn more about the drug Laif® 900 in preventing the&#xD;
      return of signs and symptoms of depressions (also called relapse) in patients suffering from&#xD;
      moderate depression episodes. The study drug Laif® 900 is based on Hypericumextract made from&#xD;
      the plant St. John wort. Patients will be accepted to take part in the study if they have&#xD;
      20-24 points on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) which is a questionnaire helping&#xD;
      the doctor to rate the severity of the depression and includes questions on patient's mood,&#xD;
      sleep difficulties, agitation, anxiety and weight loss. About 400 patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      into the first part of the study and will be treated for 12 weeks with Laif® 900 capsule once&#xD;
      daily. Only patients with an improved HAM-D score by 50% will stay in the study and continue&#xD;
      with the second part of the study which will last for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this second part of the study patients will receive either Laif® 900 capsule once daily or&#xD;
      an inactive tablet (placebo). Neither the treating doctor nor the patient will know which&#xD;
      patient receives the Laif® 900 or placebo. At the end of the study the researcher will assess&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the study drug in prevention relapse of depression episodes and will&#xD;
      also have more information on the safety of the study drug.&#xD;
