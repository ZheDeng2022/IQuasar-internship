  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic catheterizations substituted many traditional surgical procedures with the&#xD;
      advance of transcatheter techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric patients are more liable to fluid overload due to their smaller weights compared to&#xD;
      adults and the risk increases in pediatrics with congenital heart diseases due to lower&#xD;
      tolerability and reserve capacity and some of them may already have a degree of heart&#xD;
      failure. Fluid overload increases the incidence of morbidity and mortality in such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to observe the amount of fluids needed for flushing during pediatric&#xD;
      cardiac catheterization (in ml/kg) and asses its effect on total lung water and PaO2/FiO2,&#xD;
      aiming to develop a useful protocol for the amount of fluids used.&#xD;

      .Objectives: The objective of this study is to assess lung water by comparing the calculated&#xD;
      values of lung score by ultrasound, PaO2/FiO2 ratio and PaCO2 obtained from arterial blood&#xD;
      gases' samples before and after the procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A prospective observational study. Study Method&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Population of study &amp; disease condition Children from 1 month to 6 years undergoing&#xD;
           cardiac catheterization procedures..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at Abo El Reesh Paediatric Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Methodology in details: General anesthesia After interviewing and taking proper history&#xD;
      from the parents, examining the patients, checking all routine investigations, informed&#xD;
      consent will be taken after discussion with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard monitoris will be applied to all patients (electrocardiography, pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      end-tidal Carbon dioxide CO2, non-invasive arterial blood pressure). All patients will be&#xD;
      induced with inhalational induction using 4% sevoflurane in 100% oxygen followed by placement&#xD;
      of a peripheral intravenous cannula. Oral endotracheal intubation will be facilitated by IV&#xD;
      administration of fentanyl (1-2mic/kg) and atracurium (0.5mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical ventilation will be maintained with an inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) of 50%, a&#xD;
      positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, I:E ratio of 1:2 and a peak inspiratory&#xD;
      pressure (PIP) will be set to deliver a tidal volume of 5-8 ml/kg and respiratory rate from&#xD;
      15 to 35 cycle per minute according to the end tidal carbon dioxide CO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After maintenance of anesthesia and before the procedure lung ultrasound examination will be&#xD;
      performed using curved transducer with low frequency (2-5MHz) and will be assessed for the&#xD;
      presence of B lines. Arterial blood gases will be aspirated. After the end of the procedure&#xD;
      and before awakening the patient both arterial blood gases and lung ultrasound examination&#xD;
      will be repeated provided that no complications occurred such as spell or hypertensive&#xD;
      crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance requirements of intravenous fluids will be given by crystalloid solution&#xD;
      (lactated ringer) calculated by the &quot;4:2:1 rule&quot;: 4 ml/kg/h for the first 10 kg of weight, 2&#xD;
      ml/kg/h for the second 10 kg, and 1 ml/kg/h for each remaining kilograms, in addition&#xD;
      preoperative fluid deficits will be replaced calculated by multiplying maintenance&#xD;
      requirement per hour by number of hours infant has not received oral or intravenous fluids&#xD;
      prior to surgery in aliquots of 50% in the first hour and 25% in second and third hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operators will insert intra-vascular sheathes and catheters that will frequently need to&#xD;
      be flushed with heparinized solutions to keep them patent. The amount of the infused&#xD;
      solutions will be calculated. This amount will be correlated to the lung ultrasound score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung ultrasound The lung ultrasound score (LUS) is obtained by scanning 12-rib interspaces&#xD;
      where each hemithorax divided into 6 areas. Each scanning site yields a score denoting the&#xD;
      extent of interstitial pulmonary oedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zero is defined as a complete absence of B-lines in the investigated area. When B-lines are&#xD;
      few in the scanning site, they can be easily counted. When they are more numerous, they tend&#xD;
      to be confluent and it is less easy to clearly enumerate them. To obtain a semi&#xD;
      quantification of the sign, we consider the percentage of scanning site obtained by B-lines&#xD;
      (i.e, the percentage of the white screen compared to the black screen below the pleural line)&#xD;
      and then divided by 10 (i.e, 30% corresponds to about 3 B-lines, 70% corresponds to about 7&#xD;
      B-lines , and so on). This yields lung score in each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scoring system of lung ultrasound:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four ultrasound aeration patterns were defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal aeration (N): Line sliding sign associated with respiratory movement. Moderate loss of&#xD;
      lung aeration (B1 lines) : A clear number of multiple visible B-lines with horizontal spacing&#xD;
      between adjacent B lines ≤ 7 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe loss of lung aeration (B2 lines): Multiple B lines fused together that were difficult&#xD;
      to count with horizontal spacing between adjacent B lines ≤ 3 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White lung,pulmonary consolidation (C): Hyperechoic lung tissue, accompanied by dynamic air&#xD;
      bronchogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LUS will be determined based on four lung ultrasonographs: N = 0, B1 = 1, B2 = 2 , and C = 3.&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a lung ultrasound, and each of the 12 lung areas will be examined.&#xD;
      The final LUS of the patient will be the sum of each regional ultrasound score (ranging from&#xD;
      0 to 36).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic intervention: After maintenance of anesthesia and before the procedure lung&#xD;
      ultrasound examination will be performed and will be assessed for the presence of B lines.&#xD;
      Arterial blood gases will be aspirated. After the end of the procedure and before awakening&#xD;
      the patient both arterial blood gases and lung ultrasound examination will be repeated&#xD;
      provided that no complications occurred such as spell or hypertensive crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Potential risks: No additional risks to the study and any risk is related to the surgical&#xD;
      procedure itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The Statistical Package of Social Science software program (SPSS),&#xD;
      version 21 (Chicago, USA) will be used for all statistical comparisons. Continuous&#xD;
      quantitative normally distributed data will be expressed as means and standard deviations&#xD;
      (SD), while non-normally distributed data will be expressed as median and range. Qualitative&#xD;
      nominal data will be expressed by percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After testing for normality, continuous variables will be compared using t-test or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. Categorical variables will be compared using Chi- squared&#xD;
      test or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Changes over time will be compared using ANOVA&#xD;
      for repeated measures with Bonferroni correction. Correlation between amount of fluids and&#xD;
      lung score will be conducted by pearson's or spearman's methods according to the normality of&#xD;
      data. A p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
