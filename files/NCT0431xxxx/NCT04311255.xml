      In our study we are trying to reach to the more efficient us guided peripheral nerve block&#xD;
      either intercosto-brachial or PPEC 11 that can be combined with us guided supraclavicular&#xD;
      block to effectively anesthetise the surgical site for creation of brachio-basilic fistula as&#xD;
      regarding onset of surgical anesthesia, adequacy of intra-operative anesthesia, the need for&#xD;
      surgical wound infiltration, duration of postoperative analgesia and the failure rate of the&#xD;
      fistulae.&#xD;

      -  Type of Study: Randomized Prospective trail&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Setting: Ain Shams University Hospitals, Cairo, Egypt&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Period: 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Method: Patients will be subdivided randomly into two groups :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (SI) : 25 ml of bupivacaine 0.5 % for us guided supraclavicular block plus 10 ml of&#xD;
      lidocaine 2% for us guided intercostobrachial nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group(SP) : 25 ml of bupivacaine 0.5 % for us guided supraclavicular block plus10 ml of&#xD;
      lidocaine 2% for us guided PECll block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following local university ethical committee approval, informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
      Details of the anesthetic technique and the study protocol will be fully explained at the&#xD;
      preoperative visit, and written consent will be obtained from each patient before inclusion&#xD;
      in the study. The patients has to have normal prothrombin (PT) and partial thromboplastin&#xD;
      (PTT) times before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pre-induction room the patients will be taught how to assess their own pain score&#xD;
      using the numerical rating scale (NRS) (0-10; 0 = no pain, 10 = worst imaginable pain) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival at the operating room, standard monitoring will be established with five lead&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure measurement and pulse oximeter. After&#xD;
      insertion of a 20-gauge intravenous cannula in the non operated arm, an intravenous&#xD;
      crystalloid solution will be administered. Supplemental oxygen will be supplied through nasal&#xD;
      cannula. The oxygen flow will be set at 3 L/ min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 1-2 md midazolam intravenous as premedication before the block. All&#xD;
      blocks will be performed by one of the authors, The patients will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      one of the two groups, either supraclavicular-intercostobrachial group(SI Group) ,or the&#xD;
      supraclavicular-Pec 11 group(SP Group) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient in SI Group is placed in a semi-sitting position by elevating the head of bed 45&#xD;
      degrees with the patients head turned to the opposite site to be blocked. The skin of the&#xD;
      neck and the upper chest and axilla and medial upper arm will be prepared in an aseptic&#xD;
      fashion. Ultrasound examination of the supraclavicular area will be performed using a 38-mm&#xD;
      high frequency (9-12 MHz) linear array transducer with the in-plane approach, will receive 25&#xD;
      ml of 0.5% bupivacaine in the supraclavicular area ,then the operated arm will be abducted&#xD;
      and externally rotated, and the elbow flexed to 90°. Ultrasound examination of the medial&#xD;
      upper arm will be performed using a 38-mm high frequency (9-12 MHz) linear array transducer&#xD;
      and the intercosto-brachial nerve is identified and blocked using 10 ml of lidocaine 2% . The&#xD;
      patient in SP Group will also have supraclavicular block that will be performed in the same&#xD;
      way as the previous group and then patient is placed in the supine position with the arm&#xD;
      abducted 90 degrees position to receive Peg 11 lock by injecting 10ml of lidocaine 2% between&#xD;
      pectoralis minor and serratus anterior at 3rd rib level using a 38-mm high frequency (9-12&#xD;
      MHz) linear array transducer with the in-plane approach. The sensory and motor blocks will be&#xD;
      evaluated every 5 min for 30 min or until blocks will be complete. An adequate surgical&#xD;
      anesthesia will be defined as a motor score of ≥1 , with an absence of pinprick sensations in&#xD;
      the area of all the four terminal nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The zero time for onset of sensory and motor blocks will be the completion of the LA&#xD;
      injection. Sensory block assessment (0, no block 1, loss of sensation of pinprick 2, loss of&#xD;
      sensation of touch) will be performed in the innervations of the four nerve areas, radial&#xD;
      (radial dorsum of the hand), median (thenar eminence), ulnar (hypothenar eminence),and&#xD;
      intercostobrachial (medial upper arm) corresponding to the nerve distributions in the forearm&#xD;
      and hand using the pinprick test, and will be compared with the same stimulation on the&#xD;
      contra-lateral arm. The degree of motor block will be evaluated by thumb abduction (radial&#xD;
      nerve), thumb adduction (ulnar nerve), and thumb opposition (median nerve), using a 3-point&#xD;
      scale (0 =normal motor function, 1 = decreased motor strength, 2 = complete motor block). The&#xD;
      onset times of the sensory block (the time between the end of the LA injection and the total&#xD;
      abolition of the pinprick response) and motor block (time between the end of the LA injection&#xD;
      and complete motor block) will be recorded for each nerve. Patients who will not achieve&#xD;
      satisfactory levels of anesthesia and will need intraoperative local infiltration will be&#xD;
      recorded .Patient in whom the block failed and local infiltration is not enough will receive&#xD;
      general anesthesia (propofol 2mg/kg plus fentanyl 1ug/kg and atracurium 0.5mg/kg ) with&#xD;
      laryngeal mask airway inserted for mechanical ventilation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain will be assessed by one of the authors using a visual analog scale (0, no&#xD;
      pain; 10, worst pain imaginable). Analgesic for the first complain of pain will be&#xD;
      standardized and consisted of 500 mg of oral or intravenous paracetamol given for a pain&#xD;
      score of 4 of visual analog scale.The time to first analgesic requirement will be also&#xD;
      recorded by the same author.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and blood pressure will be&#xD;
      measured before the supraclavicular block and 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min after the block&#xD;
      and thereafter every 60 min for 2 h postoperatively. University of Michigan Sedation Scale&#xD;
      (UMSS) (1, awake and alert; 2, sedated, responding to verbal stimulus; 3, sedated, responding&#xD;
      to strong physical stimulus; 4, not arousable) will be measured first as baseline before the&#xD;
      block then at the same time points for measuring vital signs post-block .&#xD;
