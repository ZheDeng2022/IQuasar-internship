  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project's overall aim is to develop, deliver, and evaluate an innovative fall prevention&#xD;
      program for ambulatory and non-ambulatory people with multiple sclerosis. The program will&#xD;
      use a comprehensive intervention approach to address a variety of fall risk factors, and&#xD;
      utilise self-management strategies. Specific aims are to 1) develop a fall prevention&#xD;
      program, that addresses diverse fall risk factors and utilises self-management strategies,&#xD;
      for ambulatory and non-ambulatory people with multiple sclerosis using a co-design process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) To examine acceptability and feasibility of the co-designed fall prevention program, and&#xD;
      feasibility of recruitment and data collection procedures 3) To determine if the fall&#xD;
      prevention program is effective in reducing falls in ambulatory and non-ambulatory people&#xD;
      with multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) To identify change processes that can explain the potential effects of the fall prevention&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In line with the recommendations for complex interventions, the fall prevention program will&#xD;
      be developed and evaluated using quantitative and qualitative methods, and evaluation of&#xD;
      feasibility, process and outcome will occur. The program will be developed in a co-design&#xD;
      process with people with multiple sclerosis and health professionals and evaluated in a&#xD;
      feasibility study and in a randomised controlled trial. MS specific representatives from the&#xD;
      patient organisation Neuro Sweden will be involved in program design and implementation. The&#xD;
      intervention group will receive the fall prevention program and a brochure about falls and&#xD;
      fall risk factors. The control group will receive a brochure about falls and fall risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fall Prevention Strategy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Directly after the intervention and at 12 months after the end of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The scale includes 14 fall prevention strategies. Participants report whether they currently use or have used the strategies to manage falls risk. If they are using it, they rate strategy effectiveness on a scale of 0-10. If they are not using it, they identify why (e.g., forgot, didn't think it would work, don't know how). This instrument produces three outcome indicators: (a) number of strategies used (pre and post intervention), (b) percent change in use for each individual strategy, and (c) the average effectiveness (self-rated)for the strategies used.</description>

    <description>Falls will be monitored via an online short message service (SMS). A SMS will be sent once a week (to avoid recall bias) asking &quot;Have you fallen within the last week?&quot; Participants answering &quot;yes&quot; will be contacted with questions regarding the circumstances of the fall.</description>

    <description>29-item self-report measure with 20 items associated with a physical scale and 9 items with a psychological scale. Items ask about the impact of multiple sclerosis on day-to-day life in the past two weeks. All items have 5 response options: 1 &quot;not at all&quot; to 5&quot;extremely&quot;. Each of the two scales are scored by summing the responses across items, then converting to a 0-100 scale where 100 indicates greater impact of disease</description>

The Frenchay Activities Index consists of 15 items and the score is based on the frequency with which an activity has been performed during the previous 3 or 6 months. The total score ranges from 0 (inactive) to 45 (very active).</description>
