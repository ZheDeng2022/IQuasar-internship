  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa) subjects retain a limited capacity for endogenous&#xD;
      glucose production (EGP). To date, the origin of residual EGP in GSDIa patients is unknown.&#xD;
      Either increased glycogen debranching or lysosomal glycogen breakdown can account for&#xD;
      residual EGP in GSDIa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovative treatments for GSDIa (e.g. AAV8-mediated gene therapy and mRNA therapy) are being&#xD;
      developed.Therefore, longitudinal minimally-invasive monitoring of outcomes after therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions in GSD Ia subjects becomes warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to test the feasibility of EGP quantification in adult GSDIa&#xD;
      subjects by stable isotopes after a single oral [6,6-2H2]glucose dose. Secondary objectives&#xD;
      are to compare EGP assessed by a single oral [6,6-2H2]glucose dose (a) in GSDIa patients&#xD;
      versus matched healthy participants, (b) among GSDIa patients, (c) in the pre-prandial state&#xD;
      versus the fed state, (d) in the controlled hospital setting versus the home setting. Data&#xD;
      collected from the continuous glucose monitoring data will also be compared&#xD;

      Study design: An investigator-initiated human pilot-study. Study population: Ten adult&#xD;
      subjects with GSDIa and ten age and gender-matched healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Three experiments will be performed for each subject. During the first in&#xD;
      hospital experiment, two oral D-[6,6-2H2]glucose loads will be performed 2 hours before&#xD;
      breakfast and at lunchtime, respectively. The third oral D-[6,6-2H2]glucose load will be&#xD;
      performed at home (random time). Capillary blood samples will be collected on filter paper at&#xD;
      specific time points after each oral D-[6,6-2H2]glucose load. During the experiments,&#xD;
      subjects will be monitored by subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).&#xD;
