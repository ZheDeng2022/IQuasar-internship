  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase I trial designed to determine the phase 2 recommended dose (RP2D)&#xD;
      of belinostat in combination with nivolumab with or without ipilimumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overall, the trial will assess dosing and safety of two regimens in the study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The double regimen: belinostat in combination with nivolumab;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The triplet regimen: belinostat in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab. The trial&#xD;
           will consist of two parts: Part 1 will establish the RP2D of belinostat in combination&#xD;
           with nivolumab (doublet regimen) and Part 2 will assess the safety of the RP2D of&#xD;
           belinostat in combination with nivolumab (doublet regimen) and ipilimumab (triplet&#xD;
           regimen). In Part 1, the recommended phase 2 dose of belinostat will be determined by&#xD;
           using an single-patient accelerated titration design confirmed by a modified 3+3 design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the RP2D of belinostat is confirmed in Part 1, Part 2 will open to the expansion of the&#xD;
      doublet regimen and begin assessing the triplet regimen. The assessment of safety for the&#xD;
      triplicate regimen will follow a Bayesian approach as described in the Statistical Analysis&#xD;
      section and Appendix 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the expected contrast in toxicity profiles between immediate toxicity from belinostat&#xD;
      at various dose levels and immune mediated toxicity from the doublet and the triplet&#xD;
      regimens, the definition of dose-limiting toxicities and the DLT evaluation periods will&#xD;
      differ for each regimen (doublet vs. triplicate). Patients will be managed according to the&#xD;
      regimen administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Hypotheses: Belinostat in combination with nivolumab alone and with ipilimumab is&#xD;
      safe and effective in patients with previously treated metastatic or advanced carcinomas with&#xD;
      or without ARID1A loss of function (lof) mutations.&#xD;
