      The purpose of this study is to investigate the anti-viral effects of low-dose AZM treatment&#xD;
      in patients with asthma and COPD with an exacerbation history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that long-term treatment with low dose AZM modulates the immune&#xD;
      response to viral infections, with an increased interferon release, in patients with asthma&#xD;
      and COPD with an exacerbation history. In addition, the investigators expect a decrease in&#xD;
      inflammatory cells and mediators, and changes in bacteria, measured in samples from the&#xD;
      lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of the participants will receive azithromycin on top of their regular asthma/COPD&#xD;
      treatment, while the other half will receive placebo on top of their regular asthma/COPD&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma and COPD are responsible for considerable global morbidity and healthcare costs,&#xD;
      primarily driven by exacerbations, i.e. acute flare-ups. Hence there is a clear need for&#xD;
      better interventions preventing exacerbations. A majority of exacerbations are driven by&#xD;
      infections, and in particular viral infections. Importantly, the anti-viral defense in asthma&#xD;
      and COPD seems compromised, with a relative inability to combat infections, but also a&#xD;
      disproportionate inflammatory response to infections, i.e. an increased immunoreactivity&#xD;
      involving release of epithelial 'alarmins', such as IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin&#xD;
      (TSLP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term low dose macrolides have been shown to reduce exacerbations in both diseases and&#xD;
      are increasingly used clinically, but the mechanism of action is unknown. Macrolides have&#xD;
      anti-viral properties in vitro, however their anti-viral properties have not been established&#xD;
      in patients with asthma and COPD during exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the anti-viral and anti-inflammatory effects in&#xD;
      the airways, as well as the effects of azithromycin on the lung microbiome. In order to study&#xD;
      these effects, the key endpoints in this trial will need to be obtained from bronchoscopic&#xD;
      sampling of bronchial brushes, bronchial biopsies and BAL. But performing bronchoscopies&#xD;
      during acute exacerbations, when patients are infected with respiratory viruses, is difficult&#xD;
      in view of safety. Therefore, this study on in vitro rhinovirus responses of human bronchial&#xD;
      epithelial cells before and after in vivo treatment with macrolides represents a novel model&#xD;
      to study treatment effects on immunoreactivity during exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that long-term treatment with low dose AZM modulates the immune&#xD;
      response to viral infections, with an increased interferon release, in patients with asthma&#xD;
      and COPD with an exacerbation history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also speculate that AZM treatment leads to a decreased release of the&#xD;
      epithelial alarmins (e.g. IL-33 and TSLP) in response to viral infection, in patients with&#xD;
      asthma and COPD with an exacerbation history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, treatment effects of low dose AZM on functional and compositional changes of&#xD;
      bacterial communities of the respiratory- and gastrointestinal tract, and their association&#xD;
      with changes in immunoreactivity will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial offers the opportunity to study potential biomarkers and surrogate endpoints, but&#xD;
      also to identify the anti-inflammatory effects of azithromycin on a mechanistic level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. It includes a enrolment&#xD;
      period of maximum 4 weeks, with a bronchoscopy before and after 12 weeks of treatment (500mg&#xD;
      azithromycin or placebo, 3 times per week).&#xD;
