  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People nowadays tend to have irregular diet and routine due to the stress at work. This&#xD;
      condition may cause intestinal microflora imbalance, and in the long term may lead to&#xD;
      constipation, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, gastric ulcer and other gastrointestinal diseases.&#xD;
      Helicobacter pylori infection, which can trigger gastrointestinal inflammation and ulcer, is&#xD;
      commonly treated by antibiotics. This treatment, however, can reduce the diversity of the&#xD;
      intestinal microflora, causing diarrhea, flatulence and nausea. Clinical trials showed that&#xD;
      probiotics and prebiotics supplementation could regulate gastrointestinal function, including&#xD;
      alleviating constipation, ameliorating antibiotic-associated diarrhea and flatulence,&#xD;
      enhancing the effect of H. pylori treatment, and restoring the balance of intestinal&#xD;
      microflora. This Probiotics product is a supplement containing several types of probiotics&#xD;
      and prebiotics which has been marketed for years. This project aims to observe the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Probiotics product consumption by H. pylori-infected patients in relieving&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal symptoms and restoring their intestinal microflora.&#xD;
