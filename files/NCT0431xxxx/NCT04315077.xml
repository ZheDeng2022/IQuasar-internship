    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to examine the effects of Oceanix supplementation on&#xD;
      isometric mid-thigh pull force kinetics and salivary immunoglobulin A (indice of immune&#xD;
      function) following a one-week intense resistance training protocol. The study will be&#xD;
      carried out in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel manner. Subjects will&#xD;
      be stratified into quartiles based on peak force achieved in the isometric mid-thigh pull&#xD;
      assessment during screen and prior to baseline testing. Subjects from each quartile will be&#xD;
      randomly divided by into treatment and or placebo conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomization, subjects will be baseline tested on isometric mid-thigh pull and&#xD;
      salivary immunoglobulin A. Following baseline testing, subject will be given their respective&#xD;
      supplement conditions and will be instructed to consume one serving (25mg) a day for 21&#xD;
      consecutive days. For days 1 through 14 subjects will be asked to refrain from resistance&#xD;
      training. Subjects will undergo a five day intense resistance training protocol will on day&#xD;
      15 to day 19. Subjects will complete follow-up testing in a manner identical to baseline on&#xD;
      day 20 and 21 (24- and 48-hours post completion of the training protocol).&#xD;

      assessment during screen and prior to baseline testing. Subjects from each quartile will be&#xD;
      randomly divided by into treatment and or placebo conditions. Supplement conditions will be&#xD;
      provided in visually identical capsules and containers. Supplement compliance will be&#xD;
      determined via supplement logs and collection of supplement containers on day 21. Subjects&#xD;
      will be instructed to refrain from consuming other nutritional supplements for the duration&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomization, subjects will be baseline tested on isometric mid-thigh pull and&#xD;
      salivary immunoglobulin A. Following baseline testing, subject will be given their respective&#xD;
      supplement conditions and will be instructed to consume one serving (25mg) a day for 21&#xD;
      consecutive days. For days 1 through 14 subjects will be instructed to consume their&#xD;
      condition with their first meal of the day, and they will asked to refrain from resistance&#xD;
      training during this time frame. Subjects will undergo a five day intense resistance training&#xD;
      protocol will on day 15 to day 19, and they will be instructed to consume their condition&#xD;
      approximately 30 minutes prior to the training session. Subjects will complete follow-up&#xD;
      testing in a manner identical to baseline on day 20 and 21 (24- and 48-hours post completion&#xD;
      of the training protocol) consuming their condition approximately 30 minutes prior to their&#xD;
      arrival at the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The five day resistance training protocol will consist of two lower-, two upper-, and one&#xD;
      full-body workout. Exercise sets performed on the first four days of the protocol will be&#xD;
      targeted will repetition maximum loads such that sets will be perform to or near muscular&#xD;
      failure. On the fifth day of the protocol, subjects will perform sets of bodyweight rear foot&#xD;
      elevated split squats to failure for a total of 10 sets (5 sets with each leg in an&#xD;
      alternating fashion). Subjects will be instructed to maintain the cadence set on an audible&#xD;
      metronome, which will be set at one second downward and one second upward. Failure for these&#xD;
      sets will be defined as 1) volitional muscle failure or 2) failure to complete two&#xD;
      consecutive repetitions at the prescribed metronome cadence. Subjects will rest for one&#xD;
      minute between sets. Prior to all training sessions, subjects will perform a dynamic warm-up,&#xD;
      and following all training sessions, subjects will complete a cool down with static&#xD;
      stretching of the targeted muscle groups with the session. All warm-up, resistance training,&#xD;
      and cool down sessions will be supervised by trained research personnel. All training&#xD;
      sessions will be separated by at least 24-hours.&#xD;
