      It is very important to understand the influence of drug interactions of patients in clinical&#xD;
      anesthesia. However, there were only a few quantitative studies on the pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      different drug combinations and patient responses. In recent years, the investigators have&#xD;
      innovatively utilized the response surface models in patients receiving painless&#xD;
      gastro-intestinal endoscopies. Appropriate pharmacodynamic models of clinical anesthesia for&#xD;
      these procedures provide observation, evaluation, and prediction of the pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      effects of a combination of clinical anesthetics to such patients. Patients with endoscopic&#xD;
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and bronchoscopy often have a need for painless&#xD;
      service, but current clinical studies of using a pharmacodynamic model were lacking in these&#xD;
      patients. The investigators therefore design a two-year prospective, observational project to&#xD;
      investigate the optimal drug concentration combinations for the shortest wake-up time,&#xD;
      adequate analgesia, and appropriate depth of anesthesia for sedative endoscopic ERCP and&#xD;
      sedative bronchoscopy using pharmacodynamic models. Multidimensional surface charting will be&#xD;
      performed by inputting diversified parameters to predict the drug interactions of the model&#xD;
      groups. In this prospective, observational study, the investigators plan to enroll 40 ASA&#xD;
      Class Forty ASA Class II-III, aged 20-80 adult patients who require sedative ERCP and&#xD;
      bronchoscopy. Moderate to heavy sedation will be performed only after patients' inform&#xD;
      consents and approval of the institutional ethics committee. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      complete this series of studies within two years: The first year: ERCP(10 patients) and&#xD;
      broncoscopy (10 patients). The second year: ERCP(10 patients) and broncoscopy (10 patients).&#xD;
      Using response surface models, this study will offer us novel information about patients&#xD;
      during procedures which may substantially increase the anesthesia quality and outcome of&#xD;
      sedative ERCP and broncoscopy. Physiological signals such as anesthesia depth, drug&#xD;
      concentrations and dosages, alertness/sedation score, heart rate, blood pressure, peripheral&#xD;
      oxygen saturation, and physical activity responses during painless procedures will be&#xD;
      collected and then the above data will be applied to the response surface models. Then the&#xD;
      investigators will find the most appropriate anesthetic response surface which may delineate&#xD;
      the effects of drug combinations, and will further improve the anesthesia safety and quality&#xD;
      for painless ERCP and bronchoscopy patients.&#xD;

    <description>Pharmacodynamic response surface model is a mathematic model which provides information about when and what extent the patient will response to a specific physiological condition (pain, respiratory depression, anesthesia depthâ€¦.) in a given combination drug concentration pairs. The calculated plasma or effect concentration of specific medications will be used to train iteratively by non-linear regression to find the optimal parameters to construct a new response surface model. Then the model will be validated by the observation data to see the accuracy and efficacy of the model.</description>

    <description>Model predictions were evaluated at the emergence period of moderate sedation or general anesthesia. Model predictions of OAA/S ranging from 0% to 100% were made every 10 seconds from once the anesthetics were terminated to 10 minutes after the time of each patient's wake up. Model predictions were compared with observations with graphical and temporal analyses</description>
