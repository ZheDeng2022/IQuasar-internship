  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood mortality is decreasing worldwide. However, many sub-Saharan countries still have&#xD;
      high children under 5 mortality rates. The MORDOR trial in Niger, Tanzania, and Malawi&#xD;
      demonstrated a near 14% decrease in all-cause child mortality following biannual azithromycin&#xD;
      in children 1-59 months. Current trials in Burkina aim to replicate these results from the&#xD;
      MORDOR study with mass azithromycin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conducted an individually randomized placebo-controlled trial in Burkina&#xD;
      Faso called the Gut and Azithromycin Mechanisms in Infants and Neonates Trial (GAMIN:&#xD;
      NCT03676751) to evaluate the effect of a single dose of azithromycin (20 mg/kg) on potential&#xD;
      mediators of the effect of azithromycin on all-cause mortality and to evaluate changes in the&#xD;
      gut microbiome longitudinally (results pending). Here, the investigators propose to conduct&#xD;
      an expansion of the original GAMIN trial. In GAMIN II, the investigators will evaluate 450&#xD;
      additional 1-59 month old children longitudinally for 6 months with a focus on stool&#xD;
      collection and malaria status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the effect of a single dose of azithromycin for children aged 8 days-59&#xD;
      months on malaria. The investigators hypothesize that a single dose of azithromycin will&#xD;
      result in a reduced malaria status within the treatment group compared to the placebo group&#xD;
      after a 14 day period within children ages 8 days-59 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in Nouna Town in northwestern Burkina Faso.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' previous MORDOR I research demonstrated a significant reduction in&#xD;
      all-cause child mortality after biannual mass azithromycin distribution. In three sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa countries, (including Niger, Tanzania, and Malawi) mass azithromycin treatment over 2&#xD;
      years resulted in a 14% reduction in child mortality. Moreover, 1 in 5-6 deaths were shown to&#xD;
      be averted within Niger alone1. Similar findings were demonstrated in a previous study for&#xD;
      trachoma control in Ethiopia with mass azithromycin distribution. This study in rural&#xD;
      Ethiopia noted a nearly 50% decrease in all-cause childhood mortality5. However, neither of&#xD;
      these studies evaluated the longitudinal impact azithromycin has on the gut microbiome. The&#xD;
      MORDOR II trial in Burkina Faso will further evaluate the efficacy of biannual azithromycin&#xD;
      treatment. The under-5 child mortality rate in Burkina Faso is approximately 110 per 1,000&#xD;
      live births. Major causes of child mortality in this area are infectious mostly due to&#xD;
      malaria, diarrhea, and upper respiratory tract infections. In addition, malnutrition&#xD;
      contributes to a high burden of child mortality and morbidity within this region as well. By&#xD;
      treating underlying conditions, the use of routine antibiotic treatment could reduce diverse&#xD;
      health outcomes leading to morbidity and mortality. The investigative team proposes to&#xD;
      conduct this study alongside the MORDOR II trial in the town of Nouna where a majority of&#xD;
      childhood deaths are attributable to infectious causes and malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization is considering adopting the presumptive use of azithromycin and&#xD;
      other antibiotics as a recommendation to reduce childhood mortality in areas with a high&#xD;
      infectious disease burden. Many questions remain unanswered surrounding the use of mass&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment in areas with high child morbidity and mortality. This study will add to&#xD;
      the current knowledge of mass azithromycin distribution from our previous MORDOR I research.&#xD;
      The investigators propose to evaluate how azithromycin will impact childhood growth and to&#xD;
      assess the changes that occur in the intestinal microbiome following a single dose of&#xD;
      azithromycin treatment. The goal is to contribute more scientific literature that could&#xD;
      assist future guidelines regarding antibiotic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of antibiotics on the gut microflora is unclear. Longitudinal studies have been&#xD;
      recommended to further investigate the role of antibiotics on the microbiome. The&#xD;
      investigators propose a longitudinal study designed to improve our knowledge about the&#xD;
      changes in the intestinal microbiome following the course of a single dose of antibiotic in a&#xD;
      setting with high childhood mortality and morbidity. More specifically, the investigators&#xD;
      propose to follow 450 children for a 6-month time period that are between the ages of 8 days&#xD;
      old and 59 months old. Children in this age bracket are at the highest risk for mortality&#xD;
      from infectious causes, and furthermore, they are at the highest risk for malnutrition. This&#xD;
      group of children would receive the greatest benefit from this intervention. The causal&#xD;
      changes in the microbiome are vastly understudied in regards to changes in the gut microbiome&#xD;
      following a course of antibiotics. Additionally, this study will provide valuable data on the&#xD;
      effect of azithromycin for malaria status within 2 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
