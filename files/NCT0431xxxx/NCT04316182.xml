  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cabozantinib, a small molecule directed to vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, MET&#xD;
      and AXL, has shown to significantly improve the overall survival (OS) over placebo in the&#xD;
      randomized phase 3 CELESTIAL trial in patients who had up to two lines of prior systemic&#xD;
      therapy (including sorafenib) with progression on at least one in comparison to patients who&#xD;
      received best supportive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although cabozantinib shares similar targets with sorafenib/regorafenib, they present&#xD;
      different toxicity profile. While the most common grade 3-4 Adverse Events reported for&#xD;
      sorafenib were fatigue (4%), diarrhea (8%), hand-foot reaction (8%) and hypertension (2%);&#xD;
      the most frequent grade 3-4 Adverse Events for cabozantinib were hand-foot reaction (3.6%),&#xD;
      hypertension (3.4%) and elevation of AST (2.6%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, regorafenib, ramucirumab and cabozantinib are approved by European&#xD;
      Medicines Agency (EMA) as second-line treatment approved by EMA until now. However, more than&#xD;
      40% of candidate patients to 2nd line do not meet the RESORCE criteria or REACH-2 trial and&#xD;
      are only candidates to cabozantinib treatment. However, investigators do not have safety data&#xD;
      about those patients who are treated with other treatments than sorafenib in first line&#xD;
      neither data about the real impact of sorafenib-intolerant patients according to the RESORCE&#xD;
      trial definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, investigators propose to explore the role of cabozantinib in patients who&#xD;
      were not considered in the CELESTIAL trial.&#xD;
