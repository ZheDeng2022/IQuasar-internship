  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single patient expanded access protocol to investigate the effects of a second dose&#xD;
      of facilitating cell-enhanced hematopoietic stem cell product.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been established as an important&#xD;
      therapeutic option for patients with a variety of inherited metabolic disorders (IMD). The&#xD;
      potential life-threatening complications of conventional myeloablative HSCT have limited its&#xD;
      application. Additionally, conventional HSCT is only available to the small minority of&#xD;
      medically suitable candidates who have histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical&#xD;
      siblings to donate bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor mobilized peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow will be processed via a novel&#xD;
      technology to deplete mature immune cells while retaining hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and&#xD;
      graft facilitating cells (FC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A now-standard reduced intensity, nonmyeloablative recipient conditioning regimen will be&#xD;
      used to promote mixed allogeneic chimerism, thereby significantly reducing morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These two enhancements are intended to significantly improve the benefit:risk ratio of HSCT&#xD;
      for patients with IMDs. If successful, transplantation will become a more feasible option for&#xD;
      patients without HLA-identical siblings to donate stem cells, and could be offered to&#xD;
      patients early in disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective for the study is to establish chimerism following reduced intensity&#xD;
      conditioning with no grade III/IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The primary endpoint we&#xD;
      will follow is production of the missing enzyme at ≥ 10% of the normal level at day 180&#xD;
      post-transplant as for investigational new drug (IND) 14070. This expanded access protocol&#xD;
      details the approach to providing a second dose of the product.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject was previously enrolled and qualified for transplant under IND 14070. Subject must&#xD;
        be free from infection and have normal liver, kidney, heart and pulmonary function to&#xD;
        proceed to a second transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient must have adequate function of other organ systems as measured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl and creatinine clearance ≥60 cc/min/1.73m2. Newborns must&#xD;
                  have a creatinine clearance &gt; 25 cc/min. For babies &lt; 3 months of age, the raw&#xD;
                  value on GFR must be &gt; 1 cc/kg/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hepatic transaminases (ALT/AST) 2.5 x normal, bilirubin &lt;2.0mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Normal cardiac function by echocardiogram or radionuclide scan (ejection fraction&#xD;
                  or shortening fraction &gt;80% of normal value for age)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pulmonary function tests (PFT) demonstrating forced expiratory volume at one&#xD;
                  second (FEV1) of &gt;50% of predicted for age. If child is too young or unable to&#xD;
                  perform PFTs, crying vital capacity result of &gt;50% of normal value for age or&#xD;
                  resting pulse oximeter &gt;92% on room air or clearance by pulmonologist will be&#xD;
                  required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient, and parent, or legal guardian must have given written informed consent&#xD;
             according to FDA guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient must have a minimum life expectancy of at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Female patients of childbearing potential cannot be pregnant or&#xD;
             lactating/breast-feeding and must be either surgically sterile, postmenopausal (no&#xD;
             menses for the previous 12 months), or must be practicing an effective method of birth&#xD;
             control as determined by the investigator (e.g., oral contraceptives, double barrier&#xD;
             methods, hormonal injectable or implanted contraceptives, tubal ligation, or partner&#xD;
             with vasectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Recipient screening to include glomerular filtration rate (GFR), chest X-ray (CXR),&#xD;
             hepatic and renal chemistries, coagulation studies, pulmonary function testing, and&#xD;
             ECHO if clinically relevant, chimerism testing, type and screen, and enzyme levels&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Uncontrolled seizures, apnea, evidence of recurrent or uncontrolled aspiration, or&#xD;
             need for chronic mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject must not have had previous radiation therapy that would preclude total body&#xD;
             irradiation (TBI) (as determined by radiation therapist)&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Subject who are pregnant, as indicated by a positive serum human chorionic&#xD;
