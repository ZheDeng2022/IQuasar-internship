  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In standard care for patients diagnosed with a primary or secondary (metastasis) cerebral&#xD;
      tumor, there is currently complex clinical situations in which the clinic and Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imagery (MRI) do not allow for the medical team to arrive at a conclusive&#xD;
      diagnosis. The therapeutic proposition requires then a delay in additional follow-up of at&#xD;
      least 3 months in order to clarify the situation, with a potential delay in diagnosis and&#xD;
      therefore therapeutic care. The contribution of cerebral molecular imagery could allow for&#xD;
      new additional information to be brought in or to increase the confidence index in the&#xD;
      diagnosis in order to comfort the therapeutic collective attitude proposed in the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary meeting (MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4-dihydroxy-6-18F-fluoro-L-phenylalanine (18F-FD0PA), dopamine precursor amino-acid,&#xD;
      Position Emission Tomography (PET), allows for the studying in vivo of the proteic&#xD;
      transmembrane transport in gliomatous tissue; active transport happens through a&#xD;
      sodic-independent canal, increased in malicious transformations, and in which kinetics can&#xD;
      give an indication regarding the development of the primary tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In MRIs, tumor tissue growth after injecting the contrast product translates to a rupture in&#xD;
      the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), while tumor extraction from the radiopharmaceutical is&#xD;
      independent of the state of integrity of the BBB and whose only function is metabolic tissue&#xD;
      activity. This method of imagery thus appears as a promising contribution to conventional&#xD;
      imagery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, different to 18F-FDG (18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose),&#xD;
      similar to the largely used glucose in oncologic molecular imagery, exploration of harmful&#xD;
      glioma in 18F-FDOPA, is not compromised by background noise activity, and is almost useless&#xD;
      in a healthy cerebral cortex, with the exception of striatal physiological fixation used as a&#xD;
      level of reference. The best performances in terms of positive and negative predictive value&#xD;
      were defined in the literature with a tumor/striatum threshold of 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the latest and current European recommendations, turning to PET when caring for&#xD;
      high-level gliomas patients can be proposed in the evaluation of therapeutic responses.&#xD;
      However, very few studies have evaluated the in-practice current clinical contributions of&#xD;
      PET and put it into perspective with classic clinical radiological data.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis rests on the fact that 18F-FDOPA PET imagery can modify decisions&#xD;
      regarding the treatment of patients during oncologic neurological MDM. It's a matter of&#xD;
      measuring the frequency in attitude and situations changes in which these changes most often&#xD;
      occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, the study will have the objective, during patient follow-up, to evaluate the&#xD;
      pertinence of these changes in decisions, as well as the usage of PET in relation to clinical&#xD;
      situations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The differential diagnosis between radionecrosis or pseudo-progression and recurrence&#xD;
           before newly appeared contrast zones in patients diagnosed a high glioma level or&#xD;
           metastasis and treated by radiotherapy; either with or without chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The evaluation at the end of treatment with introductory level temozolomide (TMZ) (6th&#xD;
           cycle) after adjuvant radio-chemotherapy of a high-level primary cerebral tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The evaluation of the response under anti-angeogenic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefit of this study is an improvement in the patient's care. Indeed, the&#xD;
      additional information provided by Position Emission Tomography (PET) could allow for&#xD;
      healthcare professionals to more precociously test for recurrence and thus diminish the delay&#xD;
      in therapeutic care. Conversely, the PET could allow for healthcare professionals to avoid&#xD;
      over-treatment of patients for whom the MRI would wrongly indicate a recurrence. Furthermore,&#xD;
      imagery by PET should bring a new level of additional information allowing for an increase in&#xD;
      the confidence index when being diagnosed, thus comforting the collective therapeutic&#xD;
      attitude proposed in the MM.&#xD;
