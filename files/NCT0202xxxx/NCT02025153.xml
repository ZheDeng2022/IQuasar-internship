  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether central sensitization is a mechanism of CPSP (chronic postsurgical pain)&#xD;
      in women who will develop CPSP compared to women with no CPSP after hysterectomy. This&#xD;
      mechanism is illustrated by a higher pain score in experimental pain models such as tonic&#xD;
      heat stimulation, increased evoked mechanical temporal summation and increased wound&#xD;
      hyperalgesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain affects 9% of Singapore population resulting in major socioeconomic burden.&#xD;
      Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) that persists for over 3 months could be related to nerve&#xD;
      injury making this a strategic model to study the transition of acute to chronic pain. CPSP&#xD;
      occurs in up to 50% after surgery and up to 32% after hysterectomy. Over 600000&#xD;
      hysterectomies were performed in the US in 2003 making CPSP a significant problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will perform this prospective cohort study to determine whether increased&#xD;
      central sensitization and negative psychological experience are involved in the transition of&#xD;
      acute to chronic pain after hysterectomy. Investigators will recruit 444 women undergoing&#xD;
      hysterectomy and employ validated physical pain testing including tonic heat stimulation,&#xD;
      mechanical temporal summation and wound hyperalgesia which had been shown to be related to&#xD;
      central sensitization. Pain catastrophizing (negative thoughts of pain) and state trait&#xD;
      anxiety scoring will be assessed for the impact of negative cognitive-affective experience on&#xD;
      CPSP. A phone survey will be performed at 4 months to determine the primary outcome of CPSP.&#xD;
      Arterial spin labeling will be used to delineate cerebral blood flow using arterial spin&#xD;
      labeling, functional connectivity and structural connectivity to evaluate insula-anterior&#xD;
      cingulate cortex differences in 30 women with CPSP compared to 30 women without CPSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to evaluating whether central sensitization, negative psychological experience&#xD;
      and activation of brain regions are different in women with CPSP after hysterectomy, the&#xD;
      results of this study will elucidate potential mechanisms of CPSP development that will guide&#xD;
      in future studies on potential novel therapeutic targets.&#xD;

    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Upon recruitment till 6 months post hysterectomy</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will be done via Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) questionnaire. Pain catastrophizing refers to the negative thought processes patients have when they are exposed to pain or painful experiences. The PCS is a 13-item scale, with each item rated on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (all the time). It is broken into three subscales being magnification (0-12), rumination (0-16), and helplessness (0-24). A higher value in each subscale indicates a higher tendency to that subscale (worse outcome).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mechanical Temporal Summation as measured by von Frey filament</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (before surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will be done via Mechanical Temporal Summation assessment before surgery. A 180 gram von Frey filament is applied on the subject's forearm. Patient will then be asked to rate the pinprick pain score on a verbal rating scale, 0-100. Following this, 10 consecutive touches at random locations are applied with a 1 second interstimulus interval and within a 1 cm diameter circle. The patient will then be asked to rate the 10th pain score (0-100). The Mechanical Temporal Summation Score is obtained by the difference between the 11th pain score and the 1st pain score. If the score is greater than zero, the patient is implied to have presence of Mechanical Temporal Summation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>State Trait Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will be done via State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) before surgery. STAI is a self-reported tool for assessing anxiety via two sub-scales, each containing 20 items on: i) the state anxiety sub-scale measuring transient anxiety at the time of scoring; and ii) trait anxiety measures dispositional anxiety or anxiety in general.&#xD;
Each item in STAI is rated on a 4-point scale: 1 (Not at all) to 4 (very much so). A higher value in each subscale indicates a higher tendency to that subscale (worse outcome on having greater state anxiety or trait anxiety).</description>
