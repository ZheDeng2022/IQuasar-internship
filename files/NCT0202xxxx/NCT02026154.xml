      The study objective is to clarify the grounds of heart exertional dyspnoea stenocardia in&#xD;
      patients with well-controlled stage I or II hypertension according to European Society of&#xD;
      Hypertension, without changes in epicardial coronary arteries in CT coronary angiography and&#xD;
      normal resting echocardiography result, and to assess of potential early markers of heart&#xD;
      hypertrophy and failure in patients with hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is to allow for identification of patients with hypertension, in whom an early&#xD;
      introduction of pharmacological treatment of heart failure HF should be considered.&#xD;
      Evaluation in the detection of asymptomatic myocardial dysfunction will include potential&#xD;
      heart failure markers such as: cardiotrophin 1, cystatin C, serum syndecan-4, collagen III&#xD;
      N-terminal propeptide [PIIINP], NT-proBNP, IL1RL1 and modern echocardiography methods in&#xD;
      order to increase the effectiveness of prevention, diagnosis and treatment optimalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and study plan about 100 persons (age 30-70 years old) will be included in the&#xD;
      study, patients with stage I or II primary hypertension according to the European Society of&#xD;
      Hypertension: Group A- 15 patients without symptoms of heart failure Group B- 30 patients&#xD;
      with exertional dyspnoea Group C - 40 patients with overt heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group B (patients with exertional dyspnea/stenocardia) we will include only patients who&#xD;
      have undergone CT coronary angiography without any identified changes in the epicardial&#xD;
      coronary arteries, which will facilitate answering the presented purpose of research.&#xD;
      Patients in groups A and B with normal resting echocardiography and treated with a maximum of&#xD;
      2 antihypertensive drugs (an ACE inhibitor or a sartan as therapy base), according to the&#xD;
      following regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACEI/ARB + diuretic ACEI/ARB + calcium channel antagonist Group C - treatment in accordance&#xD;
      with the standards for heart failure. Each patient will be informed about the objectives of&#xD;
      the study and give written consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing informed consent patients will have performed the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interview and documentation analysis,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiography at rest and during submaximal exercise on a bicycle ergometer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Levels of markers: cystatin C, cardiotrophin-1, Procollagen III N-Terminal Propeptide&#xD;
           (PIIINP), Syndecan 4 (SDC4) and NT-proBNP, IL1RL1. Each patient will be informed about&#xD;
           the objectives of the study and give written consent to participate.&#xD;
