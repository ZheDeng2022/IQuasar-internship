      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pomalidomide after combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine, daunorubicin&#xD;
      hydrochloride, and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Pomalidomide may kill cancer cells by stopping blood flow to the cancer and by&#xD;
      stimulating white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Giving more than one drug (combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy) and pomalidomide may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pomalidomide when given at the time of early&#xD;
      lymphocyte recovery following intensive induction timed sequential therapy (TST) with&#xD;
      cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside), daunorubicin hydrochloride (daunorubicin) and etoposide&#xD;
      (AcDVP-16) in patients with newly diagnosed intermediate- and poor-risk acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety, tolerability and toxicity of pomalidomide given at the time of&#xD;
      early lymphocyte recovery following induction AcDVP-16 chemotherapy in adults with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed intermediate- and poor-risk acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety, tolerability and toxicity of pomalidomide given as a continuation&#xD;
      therapy following induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy in adults with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      intermediate- and poor-risk acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To document responses (complete remission [CR], CR with incomplete count recovery [CRi],&#xD;
      partial remission [PR]) to AcDVP-16 followed by pomalidomide at the time of lymphocyte&#xD;
      recovery in newly diagnosed adults with intermediate- and poor-risk acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (AML) and high-risk MDS, including duration of response, disease-free and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Correlative pharmacodynamics studies: a) to characterize the effects of pomalidomide on&#xD;
      the functional dynamics of different lymphocyte subpopulations (effector T [Teff], regulatory&#xD;
      T [Treg], natural killer [NK] cells) and its impact on tumor-associated antigen&#xD;
      (TAA)-specific T cell immunity when given following induction and as a maintenance; b) to&#xD;
      examine for the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) before and after pomalidomide&#xD;
      administration during induction and continuation therapy; c) to examine cereblon expression&#xD;
      in primary leukemia cells at diagnosis and in sorted T cells prior to and after pomalidomide&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pomalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive cytarabine intravenously (IV) continuously and daunorubicin&#xD;
      hydrochloride IV on days 1-3 (patients may otherwise receive idarubicin hydrochloride IV over&#xD;
      10-15 minutes on days 1-3 if daunorubicin hydrochloride is unavailable), and etoposide IV&#xD;
      over 3 hours on days 8-10. At the time of early lymphocyte recovery (after day +14), patients&#xD;
      also receive pomalidomide orally (PO) for 10-21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION: Patients achieving CR or CRi receive cytarabine based treatment at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating investigator, with possible regimens comprising cytarabine IV&#xD;
      continuously on days 1-3, and 10-12 and daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1-3, or high-&#xD;
      or medium-dose cytarabine IV every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5 for 1-4 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTINUATION: Patients achieving CR or CRi who did not undergo allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant receive pomalidomide PO daily on days 1-21 beginning 6 weeks following blood count&#xD;
      recovery. Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.&#xD;

          -  Patients with known active central nervous system leukemia should be excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial; patient receiving intrathecal chemotherapy prophylaxis should not&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to pomalidomide (e.g. lenalidomide, thalidomide) or other agents used in&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The development of erythema nodosum if characterized by a desquamating rash while&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any other medical condition that in opinion of investigator would place patient at&#xD;
