      Acute gastroenteritis is a common disease especially in children. With bronchiolitis and&#xD;
      influenza, she participated widely in weight of winter epidemics that causes problems every&#xD;
      year our health care system, particularly in the pediatric emergency and inpatient since they&#xD;
      are the second leading cause of hospitalization in children. The main symptoms of viral acute&#xD;
      gastroenteritis are diarrhea and vomiting which exposes children to the risk of sometimes&#xD;
      severe dehydration, the most common cause of hospitalization. There is no specific treatment&#xD;
      for these infections. At most, there is a vaccine against severe rotavirus diarrhea (Rotarix&#xD;
      ® and RotaTeq ®), but does not yet official recommendations to use in France. The treatment&#xD;
      of acute gastroenteritis virus is symptomatic and is generally based on the use of oral&#xD;
      rehydration solutions (ORS) whose administration is limited by the frequent presence of&#xD;
      vomiting. Until now, no treatment has demonstrated its effectiveness on vomiting due to acute&#xD;
      gastroenteritis virus in children. Conventional anti-emetics, widely prescribed, are&#xD;
      ineffective in practice, very few studies in this indication and encumbered side effects.&#xD;
      Several drugs have long been used in children to fight against severe vomiting associated&#xD;
      with the administration of anti-cancer chemotherapy, such as granisetron (Kytril ®) and&#xD;
      ondansetron (Zofren ®). The mechanism of action of these molecules is well known. They act&#xD;
      both on the enteric nervous system by blocking serotonin receptors. Several&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trials suggest that ondansetron is effective in reducing the number of&#xD;
      vomiting in children emergency consultant for acute gastroenteritis. However, the method used&#xD;
      in these tests and the number of children enrolled has not yet demonstrated the efficacy of&#xD;
      ondansetron on the number of admissions, the number of emergency and return the cost /&#xD;
      benefit ratio of this treatment. In addition, several studies reported the occurrence of&#xD;
      watery stools more frequently in children treated with the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence that ondansetron is well tolerated and effective for reducing the severity of&#xD;
      vomiting during acute gastroenteritis pediatrics winter could support the use of this&#xD;
      treatment in routine pediatric emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a clinical trial, multicenter, controlled versus placebo whose main objective&#xD;
      is to evaluate the efficacy of ondansetron to decrease the intensity of vomiting in children&#xD;
      with acute gastroenteritis during winter emergencies Upon arrival to the emergency room after&#xD;
      signing. Consent, an ECG is performed in eligible patients. Children meet all the criteria&#xD;
      for inclusion and non-inclusion receive, at random, one of two treatments: ondansetron&#xD;
      (active) or placebo. The study does not alter the usual care of the child to the emergency&#xD;
      room. After passing emergency, patients will be followed in the study for 8 days, through a&#xD;
      phone call home to J3 and J7. The total duration of patient participation in the study is 8&#xD;
      days, including 4 hours emergencies (usual transit time to emergencies).&#xD;

      Outside the study drug administration, it will be in the framework of the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An electrocardiogram inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A stool specimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A fill two questionnaires, one of which during the passage of emergency and the other&#xD;
           during two phone calls within 7 days after the departure of emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be done in addition to the balance necessary to support the patient.&#xD;
