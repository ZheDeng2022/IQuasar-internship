  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide better care and preventive services for people with both depression and diabetes,&#xD;
      the investigators propose to develop and test whether interventions to reduce depressive&#xD;
      symptoms can be integrated into routine diabetes clinics in India. The investigators will&#xD;
      gather feedback from patients in India through focus group discussions and individual&#xD;
      interviews so they can culturally-adapt a model of combined depression and diabetes care. The&#xD;
      investigators will then evaluate the effectiveness and costs of this care model in a trial at&#xD;
      four diabetes clinics in India. It is expected that results from this study can guide how to&#xD;
      incorporate mental health care into routine diabetes clinics in low-resource settings.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that targeting both depression and diabetes control has important&#xD;
      synergistic benefits. Since diabetes patients in India tend to access specialists (government&#xD;
      or private) for their diabetes and other health care needs, they at least have a point of&#xD;
      contact with the health system which can be leveraged to also reduce depressive symptoms. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to assess if interventions for depression can be integrated into routine&#xD;
      diabetes care delivery with only modest modifications. The integrated multi-condition&#xD;
      (depression and diabetes) intervention model merges experiences from TEAMCare and an ongoing&#xD;
      trial of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction in India (CARRS Trial) and involves: 1.&#xD;
      enhancing the role of care coordinators and training them in disease management; 2.&#xD;
      integrating 'intelligent' technology; and 3. weekly physician oversight to review&#xD;
      poorly-controlled cases and make responsive treatment adjustments. The investigators propose&#xD;
      to take this model from research to practice using an implementation sciences approach. The&#xD;
      investigators will first gather formative qualitative data and endeavor to make the&#xD;
      intervention more patient-centered, develop locally-understandable educational materials, and&#xD;
      identify ways to overcome stigma of mental health disorders and facilitate trustful&#xD;
      therapeutic relationships between care coordinators and patients and their families. The&#xD;
      investigators will then evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention&#xD;
      model in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Combined Improvement of Depressive Symptoms and CVD Risk Factors</measure>
    <time_frame>24-months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The sustained (24-month) percentage (%) of participants achieving the outcome in each arm for combined depression and CVD risk factor improvements (≥50% reduction in SCL-20 score AND ≥1 of: ≥0.5% reduction in HbA1c, ≥ 5 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP), or ≥10mg/dl reduction LDL-c).</description>

    <measure>Measures of &quot;Common Effect&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-intervention, 24 months post-intervention, 36 months post-intervention (post-hoc follow up)</time_frame>
    <description>The measure of common effect is a modeled composite estimate of patients achieving simultaneous improvements at 12, 24, and 36 months in the continuous measures for the 4 main outcomes of the trial: depression (20-item Symptoms Checklist [SCL-20] score), glycemia (percentage points in hemoglobin A1c), blood pressure (mmHg of BP), and lipids (mg/dl of LDL-cholesterol).The components of the common effect were standardized differences in each continuous outcome. At each time point, the z-score of each outcome was computed. Next, a model was run to examine the average difference between treatment (intervention) and control in the average level of the standardized outcomes. The estimates are z-score differences in the composite continuous measures of the SCL-20, hemoglobin A1c, systolic BP, and LDL-cholesterol and so, if the intervention group was significantly different (or lower) than the values for the usual care group (control arm), then, the estimates would be negative.</description>

    <description>To stimulate and motivate sustained, effective self-care, patient education materials and behavioral activation techniques that are adapted for the Indian population will be used by care coordinators. Behavioral activation strategies are brief, structured psychological interventions that are based on extensive theoretical and clinical literature, can be delivered by non-specialist providers, can be combined with antidepressant medications, and emphasize reinforcing behaviors to produce improvements in thoughts, mood, and quality of life.</description>

    <description>Senior psychiatrist and endocrinologist/diabetologist will be involved in weekly offline case review meetings with care coordinators. Case review meetings will be structured: the decision-support electronic health record will help prioritize cases that are new (within 3 weeks of randomization); have moderate/severe depression symptoms (based on Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9) ≥6 weeks after most recent treatment changes, or continued poor HbA1c, home glucose, BP, or LDL-c control in past 4 weeks; or have not been reviewed for 3 months. Based on patient indicators and current therapies, physicians will recommend treatment changes (initiation, increases, or simplification of medication regimens) which will be communicated by care coordinators to patients and their usual care providers.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Once informed consent was obtained, a blinded outcomes assessor conducted a detailed baseline assessment. Following this, blinded study staff assigned participants to receive intervention or usual care using a password-protected web-based data management system (Interactive Web Response System [IWRS]).</recruitment_details>

        <title>Measures of &quot;Common Effect&quot;</title>
        <description>The measure of common effect is a modeled composite estimate of patients achieving simultaneous improvements at 12, 24, and 36 months in the continuous measures for the 4 main outcomes of the trial: depression (20-item Symptoms Checklist [SCL-20] score), glycemia (percentage points in hemoglobin A1c), blood pressure (mmHg of BP), and lipids (mg/dl of LDL-cholesterol).The components of the common effect were standardized differences in each continuous outcome. At each time point, the z-score of each outcome was computed. Next, a model was run to examine the average difference between treatment (intervention) and control in the average level of the standardized outcomes. The estimates are z-score differences in the composite continuous measures of the SCL-20, hemoglobin A1c, systolic BP, and LDL-cholesterol and so, if the intervention group was significantly different (or lower) than the values for the usual care group (control arm), then, the estimates would be negative.</description>

        <title>Cost Utility in the Treatment Arm and Usual Care Arms</title>
        <description>The ratio of total costs, which include health expenditures by participants plus clinic or study costs to deliver the intervention and the relative gain or loss in health utilities (measured by the health utilities index). The within-trial cost-utility of intervention was compared to usual care, an incremental cost-utility ratio will be calculated [net costs to net utility: costs(intervention) - costs(control) / utility(intervention) - utility(control)]. The chosen measure of utility is the closest option to a global measure, the quality adjusted life year [QALY] and is calculated as the sum of mean survival time [life years] x utility scores at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months.</description>
