  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Study to evaluate the VioOne Oral Fluid Sample Collection Device (herein referred to as&#xD;
      VioOne Device) will consist of several sub-studies as described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Recovery Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine the percent recovery of cotinine spiked into the oral fluid of&#xD;
      non-smokers collected with the VioOne Sample Collection Device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample collection&#xD;
&#xD;
           Oral fluid will be collected per the VioOne package insert from five individuals&#xD;
           self-reported to be non-smokers. The samples collected will then be individually spiked&#xD;
           with cotinine to concentrations of 0, 5, 10, 15 or 25ng/mL. Two sets of each&#xD;
           concentration will be prepared. One set will be stored at 2-8Â°C prior to testing and one&#xD;
           set will be shipped per routine shipping conditions and tested upon return.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each sample will then be tested in duplicate with the Calbiotech Cotinine ELISA assay&#xD;
           and the percent recovery will be calculated for each level by comparing the detected&#xD;
           concentrations to the spiked concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data Analysis Percent recovery will be calculated for each level by comparing the&#xD;
           detected concentrations to the spiked concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Sensitivity/Accuracy Study The study goal is to show that the Calbiotech Cotinine ELISA is&#xD;
      capable of distinguishing smokers from nonsmokers when oral fluid samples collected with the&#xD;
      VioOne Sample Collection Device are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample Collection A minimum of two study sites will participate in this study.&#xD;
           Approximately 218 individuals will be enrolled in this study. At least 58 collected&#xD;
           samples must be from self-declared smokers. Oral fluid samples will be collected from&#xD;
           individuals, who will give the informed consent and self-report in an anonymous fashion&#xD;
           whether or not the individual is a smoker and number of cigarettes smoked per day on&#xD;
           average. Two samples will be collected from each individual for this study. One sample&#xD;
           will be collected using the VioOne Collection Device and one will be collected using a&#xD;
           commercially available saliva collection cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There will be no age, gender or race criteria for enrolling the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Testing All samples collected with the VioOne Sample Collection Device will be tested&#xD;
           with the Calbiotech Cotinine ELISA and the neat saliva samples collected with the saliva&#xD;
           collection cups will be tested by GC/MS, the latter being the gold standard method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data Analysis The GC/MS results will be used as the gold standard for assessing the&#xD;
           clinical sensitivity and specificity of the assay using oral fluid samples collected&#xD;
           with the VioOne Oral Fluid Collection Device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Assay Specificity Study Beverages and Household materials will be tested for interference&#xD;
      in the detection of cotinine in oral fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample Collection Oral Fluid samples will be collected from individuals self-reported as&#xD;
           non-smokers and the resulting sample/buffer matrix will be pooled.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The pool will be divided into 15 aliquots and individually spiked each of the following&#xD;
           14 compounds. One aliquot form the pool will remain un-spiked. Each spiked aliquot will&#xD;
           then be further divided into three aliquots. One aliquot will remain spiked with the&#xD;
           compound only, one aliquot will be further spiked with 5ng/mL of Cotinine and one&#xD;
           aliquot will be further spiked with 15ng/mL Cotinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Testing Each sample will then be tested in duplicate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following compounds will each be spiked at a final concentration of 10% unless&#xD;
           otherwise noted:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sugar Water Alcohol (Ethanol) Toothpaste Whole Blood (10mg/mL) Cranberry Juice Hydrogen&#xD;
           Peroxide Baking Soda Sodium Chloride Orange Juice Cola Cough Syrup Antiseptic Water&#xD;
           Hemoglobin (10mg/mL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data Analysis Results will be compared to the expected performance as measured in the&#xD;
           precision study. (the precision study does not require the use of collected human oral&#xD;
           fluid)&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Assay Specificity Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of potential food and other oral cavity contaminants will be evaluated in a timed&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ten individuals self-reported to be non-smokers will be recruited for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           One sample will be collected using the VioOne Sample Collection Device from each&#xD;
           individual immediately prior to the start of the study. Each individual will then be&#xD;
           given a piece of hard candy to consume. Additional samples will be collected with VioOne&#xD;
           immediately post consumption, ten minutes post consumption then every thirty minutes up&#xD;
           to three hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After all samples are collected each sample will be divided into two aliquots. One&#xD;
           aliquot will be spiked with 5ng/mL cotinine and one aliquot will be spiked with 15ng/mL&#xD;
           cotinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Testing Each sample/spike/time point will be tested in triplicate&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data Analysis Results will be compared to the expected performance as measured in the&#xD;
           precision study. (the precision study does not require the use of collected human oral&#xD;
           fluid)&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Stability of sample in sample collection buffer A study will be performed to establish the&#xD;
      stability of samples stored in sample collection buffer at various temperatures over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
           Oral Fluid samples will be collected from individuals self-reported as non-smokers and&#xD;
           the resulting sample/buffer matrix will be pooled.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The pool will be split into three aliquots. One aliquot will be spiked with 7.5ng/mL&#xD;
           cotinine, one aliquot will be spiked with 10ng/mL cotinine and one aliquot will remain&#xD;
           non-spiked.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each one of the spikes and the non-spike will be aliquoted into four tubes and stored at&#xD;
           -20 oC, 2-8oC, room temperature and 37oC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each sample will be tested in eight replicates at Day 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample is considered stable at the test time point when the 95% confidence interval for&#xD;
      the cotinine concentration at a given day for the sample overlaps that of Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. ELISA and Device Stability&#xD;
&#xD;
      A long term stability study will be performed to establish the stability and expiration&#xD;
      dating of the Calbiotech Cotinine ELISA assay along with the VioOne Sample collection Device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
           At each testing time point, samples from three individuals will be collected. Each&#xD;
           individual will provide three samples- one with each of three lots of VioOne Sample&#xD;
           Collection Devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The resulting sample/buffer matrix obtained from each lot of VioOne Sample Collection&#xD;
           Device will be pooled (a total of 3 individual samples per pool and a total of 3 pools).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The resulting pools will then be divided into two aliquots. One aliquot will be spiked&#xD;
           with 5ng/mL cotinine and 25ng/mL cotinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each spiked sample will be tested in eight replicates over a period of 21 months. Over&#xD;
           the course of testing, three ELISA assay lots will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Calbiotech Cotinine ELISA assay and the VioOne Sample Collection Device are considered&#xD;
      stable when the samples tested at each time point produce results within the 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval for the cotinine concentration overlaps that of Day 0.&#xD;
