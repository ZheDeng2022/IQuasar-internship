  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal is designed to examine the impact of bariatric surgery on the health of&#xD;
      patients and their families. The shared environment of spouses/cohabitating partners suggests&#xD;
      that patients' families are exposed to the extensive diet and lifestyle changes required of&#xD;
      patients following bariatric surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this proposal are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collect clinical data (e.g., weight, blood pressure, body composition, blood sample), as&#xD;
           well as monitor physical activity and eating patterns, before and after bariatric&#xD;
           surgery (Adults Only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analyze clinical data, physical activity and eating patterns to determine how the health&#xD;
           of patients and their families change after one family member completes bariatric&#xD;
           surgery (Adults Only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the feasibility of recruiting patients, spouses/partners and their children.&#xD;
