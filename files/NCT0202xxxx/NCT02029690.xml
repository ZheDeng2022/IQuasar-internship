      A study of ADI-PEG 20 (pegylated arginine deiminase), an arginine degrading enzyme in&#xD;
      patients with histologically proven advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), advanced&#xD;
      peritoneal mesothelioma (in dose escalation cohort only), non-squamous non-small cell lung&#xD;
      carcinoma stage IIIB/IV (NSCLC), metastatic uveal melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),&#xD;
      glioma and sarcomatoid cancers&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Weekly ADI-PEG 20 will be cohort dose escalated (18, 27 and 36 mg/m2), with pemetrexed 500&#xD;
      mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 both given every 3 weeks. Subjects may receive a maximum of 6,&#xD;
      3-week cycles of ADIPemCis for a total of 18 weeks of treatment. Subjects with NSCLC may&#xD;
      receive 4 to 6, 3-week cycles as per local institutional policy. Those subjects completing&#xD;
      ADIPemCis treatment may continue on ADI-PEG 20 monotherapy if they have SD or better.&#xD;
      Subjects with NSCLC may continue to receive pemetrexed as per local institutional policy&#xD;
      along with ADI-PEG 20 and/or continue on ADI-PEG 20 monotherapy after pemetrexed is also&#xD;
      discontinued.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically proven advanced MPM, advanced peritoneal mesothelioma (for dose&#xD;
             escalation cohort only) or non-squamous NSCLC (stage IIIB/IV) who have not been&#xD;
             treated with prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy, except that NSCLC subjects with EGFR&#xD;
             mutant or ALK positive must have had an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) or ALK&#xD;
             inhibitor and progressed or been shown to be intolerant of therapy prior to enrolling&#xD;
             in this trial, if such ALK inhibitor and EGFR targeted therapy are approved and&#xD;
             available in the country in which patients are being enrolled OR Histologically proven&#xD;
             metastatic uveal melanoma who have not been treated with prior chemotherapy (MTD&#xD;
             cohort only), OR Histologically proven HCC who have failed (PD and/or side&#xD;
             effects-been intolerant of) treatment with sorafenib. Failure is defined as having&#xD;
             progressed radiographically on, or been intolerant to prior systemic therapy.&#xD;
             Intolerance is defined as discontinuation due to an AE(s) on prior systemic therapy&#xD;
             that was unacceptable to the treating physician and / or patient, with or without dose&#xD;
             interruption and modification. Failure requires at least 14 days of treatment with&#xD;
             sorafenib, except for a subject that has had a severe allergic reaction to sorafenib&#xD;
             at any time, even less than 14 days of treatment with sorafenib and thus it would be&#xD;
             imprudent to re-challenge them with that agent. Cirrhotic status of Child-Pugh grade&#xD;
             A-B7 must be present. Child-Pugh status should be determined based on clinical&#xD;
             findings and laboratory data during the screening period (Appendix E). Subjects on&#xD;
             anti-coagulants are to receive 1 point for their INR status, as they are presumed to&#xD;
             have a &lt;1.7 baseline PT/INR.&quot;, OR Histologically proven high-grade glioma who have&#xD;
             failed (PD and/or side effects) treatment with radiotherapy ± temozolomide, OR&#xD;
             Sarcomatoid cancer of any line.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. ASS1 deficiency (defined as ≤50% ASS expression) demonstrated on tissue specimen&#xD;
             (cytospin samples are acceptable) by immunohistochemistry (IHC). For subjects&#xD;
             previously treated with chemotherapy, this specimen may have been obtained before that&#xD;
             chemotherapy. A new tissue specimen obtained after most recent chemotherapy is not&#xD;
             required. Thus ASS1 deficiency is required for entrance into the study. If tissue is&#xD;
             not available to determine ASS1 deficiency, then tissue must be obtained by biopsy to&#xD;
             determine ASS1 status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Measurable disease as assessed by modified RECIST for MPM and by RECIST 1.1 criteria&#xD;
             for peritoneal mesothelioma, NSCLC, uveal melanoma, HCC, glioma and sarcomatoid&#xD;
             carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECOG performance status of 0 - 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Predicted life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons), targeted therapy, or immunotherapy&#xD;
             (except for uveal melanoma) the previous four weeks before study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Symptomatic brain or spinal cord metastases (patients must be stable for &gt; 3 months&#xD;
             post radiotherapy or surgery) for subjects with mesothelioma, NSCLC, uveal melanoma&#xD;
             excludes subjects with HCC or glioma).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Major thoracic or abdominal surgery from which the patient has not yet recovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Serious infection requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics at the time of&#xD;
             study entrance, or an infection requiring intravenous therapy within 7 days prior to&#xD;
             the first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
