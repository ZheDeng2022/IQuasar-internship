  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visiting anxious and fearful children is an inevitable prospect of the daily work of every&#xD;
      dentist who treats pediatric patients. Dentists have been using a wide variety of&#xD;
      non-pharmacological and some pharmacologic techniques to assist them in the management of&#xD;
      children with anxiety. One strategy which seems promising for pain control in stressful&#xD;
      medical situations is teaching the child to use behavioral and cognitive coping skills or a&#xD;
      combination of both techniques. An alternative technique to non-pharmacologic approaches in&#xD;
      children being anxious and lacking in cooperative ability is sedative technique such as&#xD;
      nitrous oxide conscious sedation. As there is lack of studies comparing conscious sedation&#xD;
      and combinations of cognitive-behavioral strategies in eliminating children's uncooperative&#xD;
      behaviors and dental anxiety, the aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      inhalation sedation with Nitrous Oxide-Oxygen conscious sedation and cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      therapy to reduce dental anxiety in preschool children.&#xD;
