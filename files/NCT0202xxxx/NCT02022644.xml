      This is a dose-toleration study designed to investigate and determine the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose of nanoliposomal irinotecan in adults with recurrent high-grade glioma when administered&#xD;
      directly into the tumor using a process called convection-enhanced delivery. (CED)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      High grade gliomas (HGG) are the most common brain tumor in adults, with 15,000 new&#xD;
      cases/year in the USA. Despite progress made using combination therapies including surgery,&#xD;
      radiation and/or chemotherapy, the treatment of HGG remains challenging with a typical median&#xD;
      survival of 6-12 months for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GB) and&#xD;
      24-36 months for patients with anaplastic astrocytoma. The time to tumor progression of&#xD;
      patients with recurrent GBM is nine weeks and the median survival is 25 weeks, while for&#xD;
      recurrent anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), the time to tumor progression is 13 weeks and the&#xD;
      median survival is 47 weeks. More recently, single-agent Avastin has been seen to improve&#xD;
      6-month progression-free survival (PFS-6) to 42.6% as well as increase Median Overall&#xD;
      Survival to 9.3 months in patients with recurrent GBM. However, chemotherapy treatment for&#xD;
      malignant gliomas has limitations given the low activity of available antineoplastic agents,&#xD;
      the emergence or de-novo presence of resistance to such agents, the sensitivity of the brain&#xD;
      to irreversible damage from a therapeutic modality, and the compromised delivery of these&#xD;
      agents to partially privileged intracranial sites. Effective agents with novel mechanisms of&#xD;
      action need to be evaluated in HGG which account for these limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these limitations in mind, this study directs attention to two particularly appealing&#xD;
      delivery modalities which may improve the efficacy of neuro-oncologic chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents: liposomes (liposomal irinotecan) and convection enhanced delivery (CED). Liposomes&#xD;
      are typically composed of double chain phospholipid amphiphiles (chemical compounds with&#xD;
      combined hydrophilic and lipophilic properties) in combination with cholesterol, forming&#xD;
      spheroidal bilayer membrane structures that encompass an aqueous internal domain. Based on&#xD;
      structural/pharmacologic features, distinct liposome classes have been developed to package&#xD;
      various therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. From the circulating bloodstream,&#xD;
      liposomes are able to diffuse across the blood brain barrier (BBB) due to their lipophilic&#xD;
      characteristics. An example is liposomal irinotecan which may reduce the toxicity of&#xD;
      irinotecan to healthy tissues while maintaining or increasing its anti-tumor potency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CED improves chemotherapeutic delivery to brain tumors intraparenchymally by utilizing bulk&#xD;
      flow, or fluid convection, established as a result of a pressure gradient, rather than a&#xD;
      concentration gradient. As such, CED offers markedly improved distribution of infused&#xD;
      therapeutics within the central nervous system (CNS) compared to direct injection or via drug&#xD;
      eluting polymers, both of which depend on diffusion for parenchymal distribution.&#xD;
      Additionally, CED obviates the challenges of systemic agents crossing the blood brain barrier&#xD;
      while minimizing systemic exposure and toxicity. Through the maintenance of a pressure&#xD;
      gradient from the delivery cannula tip to the surrounding tissues, CED is able to distribute&#xD;
      small and large molecules, including high molecular weight proteins, to clinically&#xD;
      significant target volumes centimeters rather than millimeters in diameter. Although&#xD;
      developed independently, work combining the two delivery options, liposomes and CED, is&#xD;
      presently underway in an effort to improve treatment efficacy in the treatment of CNS&#xD;
      malignancies. This clinical trial is a step in this direction with a prospective, single-arm,&#xD;
      open-label trial that delivers liposomal-irinotecan and gadolinium (which provided real time&#xD;
      imaging of delivery) by CED in patients with recurrent malignant glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Added to this logic is support from a recent preclinical study at the University of&#xD;
      California, San Francisco (UCSF) which compared routes of delivery for liposomal irinotecan&#xD;
      (CED versus IV) and showed superior anti-tumor activity of CED administration in treating&#xD;
      mice with intracranial glioblastoma xenografts. In total, such results indicate that&#xD;
      liposomal formulation plus direct intratumoral administration of therapeutic are important&#xD;
      for maximizing the anti-tumor effects of irinotecan and support the current clinical trial&#xD;
      evaluation of this therapeutic plus CED route of administration combination.&#xD;
