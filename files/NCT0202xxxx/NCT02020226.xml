      The Primary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the cardiac safety of TH-302 in patients with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of TH-302&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate whether there is an association between plasma exposure to TH-302 and its&#xD;
           active metabolite, Br-IPM, and effects on cardiac repolarization&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the safety and antitumor activity of TH-302 in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
           tumors&#xD;

      This is an open-label study in patients with advanced solid tumors treated with TH-302 to&#xD;
      assess safety, pharmacokinetics, and potential effects on cardiac repolarization and&#xD;
      antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dose of 480 mg/m2 of TH 302 will be administered by IV infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1,&#xD;
      8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Evaluations of safety, PK, and ECG parameters of cardiac&#xD;
      repolarization will be performed on Study Day 1 and Day 2 of Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycles will be repeated every 28 days, until toxicity, progressive disease, patient or&#xD;
      investigator decision to discontinue treatment, or until a maximum of six treatment cycles.&#xD;
      Patients who are clearly benefitting from the treatment based on anti-cancer disease control&#xD;
      and tolerability will be able to continue to receive drug past 6 cycles after discussion with&#xD;
      the Sponsor. Tumor assessments will be performed after every 2 cycles during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for conducting this study is based on (a) prior data demonstrating the clinical&#xD;
      benefit in advanced solid tumors as defined by tumor response or stable disease for at least&#xD;
      4 months, (b) tolerability of TH-302 at the proposed dose, and (c) a requirement to perform a&#xD;
      dedicated ECG study to address the clinical evaluation of the potential for QT/QTc interval&#xD;
      prolongation of TH-302.&#xD;
