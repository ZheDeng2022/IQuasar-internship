      Prospective, two-arm, randomized study of the effectiveness of the BTL-9000 HFT in achieving&#xD;
      3 cm or greater average waist circumferential reduction in HFT group of subjects relative to&#xD;
      the base line and 1 cm or greater reduction relative to the average waist circumferential&#xD;
      reduction of the Placebo group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized, blinded, two-arms study of waist circumferential reduction following&#xD;
      5 once-a-week treatments. One arm is the HFT group of 64 subjects who are treated with the&#xD;
      BTL-9000 HFT and the other arm is the Placebo group of 38 subjects treated with the sham&#xD;
      device. The objective of the study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the BTL-9000 HFT&#xD;
      treatment in achieving average post-treatment waist circumference reduction of 3 cm or&#xD;
      greater across the waistline relative to the baseline assessment and of 1 cm or greater than&#xD;
      the average waist circumferential reduction of the Placebo group.&#xD;
