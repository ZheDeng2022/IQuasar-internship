  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a non-randomized, consecutive enrollment, 10-year follow-up study of patients who are&#xD;
      treated with the Ascension速 HRA. Its purpose is to measure and document the outcomes&#xD;
      associated with implanting the Ascension HRA prosthesis. Patients will be periodically&#xD;
      assessed to collect data related to safety and effectiveness endpoints at the following&#xD;
      intervals: preoperative, surgery/immediate post-op, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 year, 5&#xD;
      year, and 10 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At each assessment interval, information on complications and adverse events will be&#xD;
      collected. In addition, shoulder joint range of motion will be collected, and implants will&#xD;
      be evaluated radiographically to determine joint position and assess implant with regards to&#xD;
      radiolucencies, subsidence and subluxation (migration). Patient satisfaction with regard to&#xD;
      the effect of the implant on shoulder function, joint pain, and overall satisfaction will be&#xD;
      assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS). Furthermore, if there are any implant revisions&#xD;
      during the 10-year follow-up for any of the patients enrolled in the study, the implant&#xD;
      and/or surrounding tissue will be harvested if possible and submitted for histopathological&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
