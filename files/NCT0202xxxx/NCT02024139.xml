      This study investigates whether chewing sugar-free chewing gum can reduce pain associated&#xD;
      with braces treatment. The study collects pain scale records for 10 consecutive days after&#xD;
      placement of braces. No changes to patients routine braces treatment is done. All materials&#xD;
      used are available over the counter.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To characterize the intensity and dynamics of pain experienced by patients following&#xD;
           orthodontic appliance placement and activation using a set of Visual Analogue pain scale&#xD;
           diaries&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether chewing sugarless gum 3 times per day (and using a non-analgesic&#xD;
           mouthwash) reduces orthodontic pain compared to only using a mouthwash (placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain from orthodontic treatment affects most if not all orthodontic patients. Learning more&#xD;
      about the nature and timing of pain will help clinicians give patients a more scientific,&#xD;
      evidence-based informed consent. If chewing gum was found to reduce pain, then we would have&#xD;
      validated a common clinical advice with scientific evidence. We will also have established a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological option for pain reduction with orthodontic treatment. If chewing gum was&#xD;
      not found to reduce pain (or was found to increase it), then we can advise our patients&#xD;
      against using it and advise clinicians against recommending it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comprehensive fixed upper and lower orthodontic treatment scheduled&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age of patient between 10-35&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Partial engagement of teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of functional or extra-oral appliances&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients on regular pain medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient experiencing chronic pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients unable to consume sugarless gum because of health reasons e.g. phenyl ketone&#xD;
           urea o Patients with mental or cognitive impairments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Assignment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For our sample size estimation we used a standard deviation of 20 (taking into consideration&#xD;
      several previous studies of other investigators), an effect size of 15, a significance level&#xD;
      of 0.05, and a power of 0.8. It indicates the need for 58 subjects in total. Based on this,&#xD;
      our goal is to include 80 subjects in anticipation of possible drop-outs. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two groups: a chewing gum group and a control mouthwash group.&#xD;
      Study kits will be numbered according to a random number table. Forty kits will contain&#xD;
      instructions and supplies for the chewing gum group and forty will contain instructions and&#xD;
      supplies for the control group. Assignment is done immediately after orthodontic appliances&#xD;
      are placed. Operators will be blinded to the group assignment as it is done by a separate&#xD;
      investigator. This investigator will administer to the patients the consent forms and give&#xD;
      them instructions according to their group assignment. The investigator will give the&#xD;
      participants a pre- randomized study kit containing a VAS booklet and either enough servings&#xD;
      of chewing gum and a container of mouthwash or a container of mouthwash only with&#xD;
      corresponding verbal and written instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will provide to the chewing gum group subjects with enough servings of Wrigley's extra&#xD;
      sugar-free chewing gum (with some extra pieces as backup). The chewing gum used is Mentos 3D&#xD;
      which contains both sorbitol and xylitol (non-hard coated type used). The mouth wash used for&#xD;
      both groups is Plax SensitiveTM fluoride containing mouthwash which is alcohol free and&#xD;
      causes significantly less burning sensations than regular mint mouthwashes. The mouthwash&#xD;
      will be supplied to the subjects in unlabeled containers so as to work as a placebo. The&#xD;
      subjects will not be told that this is a regular mouthwash with no pain reducing effects.&#xD;
      Each of the two groups' subjects are ignorant to what the other group is receiving and&#xD;
      whether they are in a control group or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VAS pain scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VAS pain scale used in the study comprises a 100mm horizontal line where one end&#xD;
      indicates &quot;no pain&quot; and the other end indicates &quot;worst possible pain&quot;. The patients will mark&#xD;
      each pain scale after fitting their teeth together. During the first day, patients will mark&#xD;
      a scale every 3 hours until bedtime starting immediately after appliance placement. For the&#xD;
      following 9 days, patients will mark 2 pain scales per day, one scale when they wake up and&#xD;
      one at bedtime. The patient places a mark on the scale according to their judgment of the&#xD;
      amount of pain they experience. The response is then measured to the nearest 0.5mm and can be&#xD;
      used as pseudo-numerical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VAS booklet:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Booklets are uniquely identified by a serial number and the patients phone number. Each&#xD;
      booklet will be pre-randomized and assignment to either the gum group or the control group.&#xD;
      The group assignment and serial number are indicated on the booklet cover. After instructions&#xD;
      are given, the booklet cover is removed and kept in a closed container. The group assignment&#xD;
      is only initially known to the investigator who administers the instructions. The remaining&#xD;
      pages of the booklet will only be identified by the serial number of the participant with no&#xD;
      mention of the group assignment. This way the group assignment is kept secret from both the&#xD;
      operators who place the appliances, and the measurement investigator who will later measure&#xD;
      the patients' responses. The booklet will contain space for participants to indicate if they&#xD;
      have taken any non-study related medication (e.g. an analgesic). A copy of the booklet is&#xD;
      included will this document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the study is double blinded. Operators placing the appliances do not know which&#xD;
      group the patient belongs to because assignment is done after appliance placement. The&#xD;
      investigator measuring the patient responses does not know the group assignment because it is&#xD;
      not indicated on the VAS booklet. The patients can be considered to be blinded because they&#xD;
      are not aware of what the other group is receiving or that they are using a standard&#xD;
      mouthwash that does not affect pain. After all measurement are done the booklet covers are&#xD;
      reunited with their respective booklets for statistical data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Compensation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive an electric toothbrush as an incentive for completing the study.&#xD;
