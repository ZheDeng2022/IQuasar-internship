  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine how changes in levels of obesity-related&#xD;
      hormones in the gastrointestinal tract following Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding&#xD;
      (LAGB) surgery may lead to a decrease in appetite and weight loss. Learning exactly how the&#xD;
      Lap Band works may help us to develop new, less invasive treatments for morbid obesity. This&#xD;
      knowledge may also lead to the development of preventive, cost-effective treatment&#xD;
      strategies. As a control subject, participants will provide a comparison for changes in these&#xD;
      hormones with medical weight loss compared to weight loss after LAGB surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The expected duration of participation in the study is up to 6 months before bariatric&#xD;
      surgery depending on participants' weight loss and insurance company requirements. A total of&#xD;
      10 patients will take part in this control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures and tests will be done before surgery: routine standard tests&#xD;
      required to be involved in the obesity surgery program (history and physical, blood work,&#xD;
      ECG, nutritional assessment, psychological assessment and sleep study). During preoperative&#xD;
      evaluation participants will be started on a medical weight loss diet with instructions&#xD;
      provided by the program's endocrinologist, nurse practitioners and dietitians with the weight&#xD;
      loss goals as stipulated by insurance companies and have a series of additional laboratory&#xD;
      tests (blood work) done to test the hormonal response to weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This blood work, which is drawn after eating a standardized meal, is the only experimental&#xD;
      procedure of the entire study. We will be measuring several hormones associated with obesity&#xD;
      including ghrelin, obestatin, peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY3-36), adiponectin, Glucagon-like&#xD;
      peptide-1 (GLP-1), oxyntomodulin, leptin, insulin, glucose and pancreatic polypeptide (PP).&#xD;
      Measurements will be done at 4 time intervals before surgery: at enrollment, +1-month,&#xD;
      +3-months, and +6-months. This will allow us to look at hormone levels as participants&#xD;
      gradually lose weight. If a participant reaches the insurance-dictated weight loss before 6&#xD;
      months, study participation will cease to allow the individual to proceed with surgery&#xD;
      scheduling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to fast overnight prior to each visit. An intravenous line will&#xD;
      be placed at 0800, all subjects will be fed a standard breakfast (35% fat, 15% protein, and&#xD;
      50% carbohydrate) consisting of 25% of estimated caloric needs for weight maintenance, which&#xD;
      they will consume in 30 minutes or less. Blood will be taken beginning 30 minutes before the&#xD;
      standardized meal, then at time 0, then 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the meal for total&#xD;
      ghrelin, pancreatic polypeptide, PYY3-36, active GLP-1, insulin, glucagon, leptin,&#xD;
      oxyntomodulin, and glucose. An extra fasting sample will be obtained for lipids and total&#xD;
      adiponectin. Three-quarters of a cup (148 mL) of blood will be drawn for analysis at each&#xD;
      visit. Additionally, subjects will be asked to complete a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) three&#xD;
      times during each research visit by placing a single vertical mark across a 100 mm in length&#xD;
      line, with words anchored at each end, expressing the most positive and the most negative&#xD;
      rating, to assess hunger, satiety, and fullness. Each visit will last approximately 4 hours.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Preoperatively (baseline) and at 1-, 3- and 6-months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Our primary outcome measures the mechanism of action of the adjustable band in producing weight loss from the time of surgery to visit timepoints at plus one, 3 and six months following LAGB placement. Changes in appetite and hunger will be measured in the form of a validated clinical analogue scale from baseline to 1, 3 and 6 months post-surgery. Statistical analysis will be performed to look for changes in blood levels of gut hormones (total ghrelin, PYY3-36, total adiponectin, active GLP-1, glucose, glucagon, insulin, leptin, oxyntomodulin, and pancreatic polypeptide) measured before and after a standardized meal from baseline values to 1, 3, and 6 months post-surgery.</description>

      Each time these hormone assays are performed, aliquots of plasma will be frozen at -80C:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total immunoreactive ghrelin - Plasma will be assayed in duplicate for immunoreactive&#xD;
           ghrelin concentration using a commercial radioimmunoassay (RIA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipids - Plasma total cholesterol, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C will be measured&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose and insulin - Plasma glucose concentrations will be measured in triplicate using&#xD;
           the glucose oxidase method. Plasma insulin will be measured in duplicate using a&#xD;
           modification of a double antibody radioimmunoassay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adiponectin and other gut hormones - Adiponectin, PYY3,36 and GLP-1 will be measured&#xD;
           using a commercial RIA. Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) will be measured using a commercial&#xD;
