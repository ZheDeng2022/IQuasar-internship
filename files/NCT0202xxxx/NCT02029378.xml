    <textblock>
      Guillian-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is the most frequent cause of acute neuromuscular weakness in&#xD;
      the Western World and can occur at any age. GBS is a rpadily progressive 'inflammatory'&#xD;
      disorder of the perihperal nerves often leading to sever paresis of the limbs. Most GBS&#xD;
      patients also have sensory disturbances (tingling or dull feeling) and pain. Some patients&#xD;
      also have double vision or problems with swallowing. GBS mau also involve the respiratory&#xD;
      muscles, leading to insufficient ventilation and admission to an intensive care unit. GBS&#xD;
      pateints have a vairable prognosis; 20-30% require mechnical ventilation for a period ranging&#xD;
      from weeks to months, 20% are unable to walk after 6 months nad 3-5% dies. Progression of&#xD;
      weakness in GBS is usually rapid and reaches its peak within 4 weeks in the majority of&#xD;
      patients, but many develop their maximum deficit within 2 weeks. Thereafter, the patients&#xD;
      have a variable prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GBS is a treatable disorder. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 2g/kg administered in 5 days&#xD;
      was shown to be effective when administered within the first two weeks after onset of&#xD;
      symptoms, and is considered the treatment of choice by most experts in the field. Although&#xD;
      the standard treatment for GBS is a single course of IVIg (2g/kg administered in 5 days),&#xD;
      many patients fails to recover abd remain with substantial disability. Patients with GBS and&#xD;
      especially those with a poor prognosis potentially may benefit from more powerful abd when&#xD;
      possible a more mechanistically rational therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent experimental evidence suggests that complement activation palys a crucial role in the&#xD;
      development of neuromuscular weakness in GBS making complement inhibitors and regulators&#xD;
      attracive therapeutic targets. Our hypothesis is that Eculizumab, with its function as a&#xD;
      complement inhibitor, will be very effective in preventing progression of weakness in&#xD;
      patients with GBS.&#xD;
