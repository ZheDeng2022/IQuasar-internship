  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, taking ipilimumab&#xD;
      with degarelix before surgery to remove the prostate, followed by more degarelix and&#xD;
      ipilimumab after the surgery, will have on prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of a multimodality approach&#xD;
      combining hormones and immunotherapy in prostate cancer populations that are considered&#xD;
      incurable and standardly treated with hormones alone, and represent clinical states prior to&#xD;
      development of castration-resistant disease. There are 2 cohorts. The first will use&#xD;
      ipilimumab and degarelix prior to and following radical prostatectomy in men with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed, oligometastatic, castration-sensitive disease. The second cohort will include men&#xD;
      who have already received definitive local therapy with radical prostatectomy but have since&#xD;
      experienced biochemical and/or metastatic recurrence.&#xD;
