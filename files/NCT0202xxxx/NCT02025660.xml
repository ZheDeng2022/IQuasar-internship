      Study Hypothesis Enhancement of Th-1 response with the help of a poly TLR agonist (Mw) is&#xD;
      likely to increase survival in patients with severe sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To study whether immunomodulation with Mycobacterium Mw helps in improving&#xD;
      survival and the recovery of organ function in patients with severe sepsis. This will be&#xD;
      assessed with the help of the following&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality in the two arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily SOFA scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ventilator free days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time-to-vasopressor withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ICU length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital length of stay METHODS This will be a proof of the concept study to assess the&#xD;
           effect of Mycobacterium w in combination with standard therapy versus standard therapy&#xD;
           alone on the inflammatory profile in sepsis due to gram negative infection. A total of&#xD;
           25 patients will be enrolled in each group. The patients will be randomized in balance&#xD;
           to receive either test drug or its placebo along with the standard of care&#xD;

      This will be a proof of the concept study to assess the effect of Mycobacterium w in&#xD;
      combination with standard therapy versus standard therapy alone on the inflammatory profile&#xD;
      in sepsis due to gram negative infection. The study will be conducted in the respiratory&#xD;
      intensive care unit at PGIMER, Chandigarh, over a period of 1 year. A total of 25 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled in each group. The patients will be randomized in balance to receive either&#xD;
      test drug or its placebo along with the standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the standard therapy for sepsis, patients randomized to test arm will receive&#xD;
      single daily dose of 0.3 ml of Mw intra-dermal for 3 consecutive days while patients&#xD;
      randomized to control arm will receive single daily dose of 0.3 ml of Mw-placebo intra-dermal&#xD;
      for 3 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration Study duration for each patient will be 28 days. Follow up period is included&#xD;
      in the study duration of 28 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outlines and Timing of Visits Eligible patients will be enrolled after due consent and&#xD;
      randomized to one of the treatment arms. The enrolled patients will be monitored for any&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) throughout the study period. All&#xD;
      patients will continue to receive standard therapy till considered requisite&#xD;
