      This is a psychosocial/behavioral study and does not involve administration of any treatment&#xD;
      or diagnostic procedures. We will use a randomized trial to test the hypothesis that a&#xD;
      decision analysis model that provides individualized estimates of quality-adjusted&#xD;
      disease-free survival for each of the treatment options for clinically localized prostate&#xD;
      cancer will lead to higher quality treatment decisions congruent with a patient's values&#xD;
      leading to improved decisional regret and treatment satisfaction. In this trial, all patients&#xD;
      would be evaluated at baseline for their utilities for various clinically important health&#xD;
      states. The control arm will receive counseling regarding treatment options using standard&#xD;
      patient-physician interactions and nomogram-predicted probabilities of treatment outcome for&#xD;
      the various treatment options and they will be unaware of the decision analysis&#xD;
      recommendation. The treatment arm would be counseled using standard patient-physician&#xD;
      interactions and they would also be provided with a personalized treatment recommendations&#xD;
      based on the decision analysis model prior to treatment selection. The primary endpoint of&#xD;
      this study will be regret-free survival at 2 years after treatment. There will be a 1:1&#xD;
      randomization. A random permuted design will be used to assure approximate balanced number of&#xD;
      patients in the two groups over time.&#xD;

      Following institutional review board approval for this study and after informed consent from&#xD;
      patients is obtained, men referred to our institution for treatment of clinically localized&#xD;
      prostate cancer will be interviewed at baseline following diagnosis but prior to making a&#xD;
      treatment decision, by a research study coordinator whom we will train in utility assessment.&#xD;
      At that initial interview, the patient's utilities will be assessed, in a private&#xD;
      consultation room, for each important post-treatment health state that he potentially may&#xD;
      enter. The states we would assess include living with untreated prostate cancer, impotence,&#xD;
      urinary dysfunction, bowel dysfunction, rising PSA following definitive local therapy, and&#xD;
      metastatic prostate cancer. We will also record characteristics of the patient's disease&#xD;
      (pretreatment serum PSA, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason grade), demographics (age, race,&#xD;
      level of education, employment, marital status) and comorbidity. Patient-reported urinary,&#xD;
      bowel, and sexual function/bother will be assessed at baseline using a short form version of&#xD;
      a 48-item validated HRQOL instrument for localized prostate cancer. All patient information&#xD;
      will be entered into a secure, HIPAA-compliant database accessible only to the principal&#xD;
      investigator, research study coordinator(s), data manager, and biostatistician. All patient&#xD;
      identifying information will be removed prior to data analysis and will not be included in&#xD;
      any publication or presentation that results from this study. For all patients, the&#xD;
      quality-adjusted disease-free survival for each treatment modality will be calculated using&#xD;
      the decision analysis model. For the decision analysis arm of the trial, this information&#xD;
      will be conveyed to the patient and the physician prior to treatment decision. These patients&#xD;
      will also receive standard treatment counseling. For the control arm, both patients and&#xD;
      physicians will be unaware of the decision analysis recommendation and the patients will&#xD;
      receive standard treatment counseling alone. After the patient has made a treatment decision&#xD;
      he will be given a short questionnaire to assess decisional conflict. If after one month no&#xD;
      treatment decision information is available, a letter and form requesting treatment&#xD;
      information along with the decisional conflict questionnaire will be sent to patients. At 6,&#xD;
      12, and 24 months following the treatment decision, the patient will be sent a brief&#xD;
      validated questionnaire which will measure his regret of treatment choice, treatment&#xD;
      satisfaction, decisional conflict and current health state utility using validated&#xD;
      instruments. A short form version of a 48-item validated questionnaire will also assess his&#xD;
      HRQOL for urinary, bowel and sexual function/bother domains at these time intervals.&#xD;
      Approximately two weeks after receiving each follow-up questionnaire and/or letter, a member&#xD;
      of the study group will contact the patient by telephone if we have not received the&#xD;
      completed questionnaire. S/he will inquire about any difficulties with the questionnaire and&#xD;
      will remind the patient about sending it back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study (decisional regret) and secondary endpoints (treatment&#xD;
      satisfaction, decisional conflict, and current health state utility) will be assessed by&#xD;
      means of a patient-reported questionnaire using validated instruments assessed at 6, 12 and&#xD;
      24 months after randomization. A decision analysis model will be developed using a Markov&#xD;
      modeling approach. Using Treeage DataÂ® pro suite, the model will incorporate cancer outcomes,&#xD;
      treatment-related morbidity probabilities derived from nomograms, and patient-specific&#xD;
      utilities to estimate the quality-adjusted disease-free survival for each treatment option.&#xD;
      In the model, all patients will begin with localized prostate cancer with no evidence of&#xD;
      metastases. A 6-month transition cycle will be used for the Markov model. Bootstrap&#xD;
      simulation with replacement will be utilized to derive mean utilities and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals. Sensitivity analyses will be performed by varying the disease progression rates&#xD;
      and utilities within their 95% confidence intervals. To investigate if the decision analytic&#xD;
      model, compared to standard interactions alone, will influence treatment choice and lead to&#xD;
      higher quality treatment decisions that are congruent with a patient's values, an&#xD;
      intent-to-treat analysis will be conducted on patients who did and did not receive the&#xD;
      decision analysis recommendation with decisional regret as the primary endpoint. In a planned&#xD;
      secondary analysis, we will analyze both arms of our trial and test the hypothesis that a&#xD;
      patients who chooses a treatment strategy that did not appear to maximize his&#xD;
      quality-adjusted disease-free survival (i.e. not the one the decision analysis would have&#xD;
      yielded) will be at increased risk of regret. This will be conducted by identifying patients&#xD;
      in both arms who choose the treatment that is also recommended by the decision model. The&#xD;
      probability of selecting the decision analytic treatment strategy (which is also the&#xD;
      probability of selecting the highest quality treatment decision congruent with a patient's&#xD;
      values) will be investigated using a logistic regression model with covariates that include&#xD;
      treatment arm, an indicator variable to define patients whose baseline treatment choice&#xD;
      matched the decision analysis model, an interaction between the treatment arm and this&#xD;
      indicator variable, as well as other clinically relevant baseline covariates and two way&#xD;
      interactions. Testing for an interaction between treatment arm and the indicator variable&#xD;
      will allow us to test if the effect that knowledge of the decision analytic model has on the&#xD;
      probability of selecting the highest quality treatment decision is different for patients&#xD;
      whose baseline treatment choice matched the decision analysis model compared to patients&#xD;
      whose baseline treatment choice did not match the decision analysis model. Each patient will&#xD;
      also have the following outcomes measured at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months following&#xD;
      their treatment: decisional regret, decisional conflict, treatment satisfaction, health state&#xD;
      utility score, and HRQOL for urinary, bowel, and sexual function domain scores. All scores&#xD;
      will be standardized such that each patient's score is between 0 and 100. Baseline decisional&#xD;
      regret scores, informed decision scores, and treatment satisfaction scores will be set at&#xD;
      100, indicating no decisional regret, a high degree of feeling as though an informed decision&#xD;
      was made, and high treatment satisfaction. Scores for health state utility and HRQOL domains&#xD;
      will also be obtained at baseline. Based on each patient's final treatment choice, we will&#xD;
      also calculate the difference between the number of quality adjusted life years based on the&#xD;
      decision analysis model and the final treatment choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each response, separate linear mixed models that include both fixed and random effects&#xD;
      will be applied. To meet the distributional assumptions of this model, responses may be&#xD;
      transformed prior to model fitting. Fixed effects that will be included in the model are&#xD;
      clinically relevant baseline and time dependent covariates and two way interactions as well&#xD;
      as linear or quadratic time trends. In particular, a covariate for treatment arm, an&#xD;
      indicator variable to define patients who chose the decision analytic model based treatment&#xD;
      choice, and an interaction between these two variables will be included. In this case, the&#xD;
      interaction will allow us to test if the effect that knowledge of the decision analytic model&#xD;
      has on various responses is different for patients who chose the decision analytic model&#xD;
      treatment choice compared to patients who did not chose the decision analytic model treatment&#xD;
      choice. A covariate for the difference between the number of quality adjusted life years&#xD;
      based on the decision analysis model and the final treatment choice and an interaction&#xD;
      between this variable and the treatment arm indicator variable will also be included in the&#xD;
      model to examine if the effect that knowledge of the decision analytic model has on various&#xD;
      responses is effected by the theoretical degree of mistake. To fully account for the&#xD;
      variation in subject specific trajectories over time, a random intercept will be included in&#xD;
      this model although linear and quadratic random effects will also be considered if&#xD;
      appropriate. In addition, the residual covariance structure for each model will also be&#xD;
      investigated to avoid misspecification and invalid inferences. In particular, correct&#xD;
      specification of the covariance structure will be investigated using different ways to model&#xD;
      the measurement error (due to variation in the measurement of the response) and serial&#xD;
      correlation (due to decreasing correlation between measurements over time). For instance,&#xD;
      structures for serial correlation will be investigated using a semi-variogram. Although the&#xD;
      problem of a misspecified covariance structure can and will be avoided by using a robust&#xD;
      variance estimator when making inferences about the fixed effects of interest based on the&#xD;
      marginal model, misspecification also leads to an inability to properly account for the&#xD;
      effect of missing data, a common occurrence in longitudinal studies. Note that once an&#xD;
      appropriate model is fit to each response of interest, inference regarding the fixed&#xD;
      treatment and covariate effects on the response will be based on marginal models using the&#xD;
      robust variance estimator to protect against model misspecification of the covariance&#xD;
      structure. Statistical significance of fixed effects will be based on a 0.05 significance&#xD;
      level. As this study is exploratory, no attempt will be made to account for multiple&#xD;
      comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As discussed previously, missing data is a common problem in longitudinal studies. Typically,&#xD;
      patients who drop out of the study are not comparable to patients who remain in the study at&#xD;
      all times. Consequently, the likelihood of dropout is correlated with the underlying&#xD;
      unobserved data. To account for this problem, pattern mixture models will also be fit in&#xD;
      addition to the previous models that ignore the effect of missing data on resulting&#xD;
      estimates. Pattern mixture models are based on fitting separate linear mixed model to each of&#xD;
      the seven dropout patterns that can occur in the data such that a separate time trend is&#xD;
      estimated for each pattern. The marginal treatment effect is then calculated by a weighted&#xD;
      average of the pattern-specific treatment effects, with weights given by the probability of&#xD;
      occurrence of the various patterns. Because the estimated marginal treatment effects rely on&#xD;
      the extrapolation of fitted average profiles to time points where data is not observed,&#xD;
      sensitivity analyses will also be performed to examine the robustness of the results to&#xD;
      alternative assumptions. For instance, rather than estimating a separate time trend for each&#xD;
      pattern, the model could be simplified so that drop-out pattern is used as a covariate in the&#xD;
      model. In this case, the time trend within a pattern is unstructured but parallel across&#xD;
      patterns. If estimated marginal treatment effects agree among the different models that are&#xD;
      investigated, this will suggest that the results are not artifacts of the particular model&#xD;
      used to account for dropout.&#xD;
