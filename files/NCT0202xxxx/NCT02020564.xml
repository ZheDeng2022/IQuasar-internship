  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the effectiveness of a technique&#xD;
      designed to improve processing speed (i.e. the amount of time it takes to process&#xD;
      information) in a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) population. The study is designed to study how&#xD;
      well this technique can help people with TBI increase their processing speed and their&#xD;
      ability to function better in everyday life.&#xD;

      The current proposal is designed to apply this treatment protocol to a large sample of&#xD;
      individuals with moderate to severe TBI with documented impairment in PS. The goals of the&#xD;
      trial are to (a) test the efficacy of this treatment protocol within a TBI population, (b)&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of the treatment on everyday functioning, (c) evaluate the longer-term&#xD;
      efficacy of the treatment, and (d) examine the utility of booster sessions in facilitating&#xD;
      longer-term treatment effects. Individuals with moderate to severe TBI, with documented&#xD;
      impairment in PS, will be randomly assigned to a treatment group or a control group. Both&#xD;
      groups will undergo baseline, immediate post-treatment and long-term follow-up assessment&#xD;
      consisting of: (1) a standardized neuropsychological battery and (2) an assessment of global&#xD;
      functioning examining the impact of the treatment on daily activities. This design will allow&#xD;
      us to assess the efficacy of SPT in persons with TBI and evaluate its impact on everyday&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
