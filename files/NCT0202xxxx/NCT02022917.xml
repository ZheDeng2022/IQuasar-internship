    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the feasibility of postoperative platinum-based chemotherapy plus&#xD;
      adjuvant and maintenance bevacizumab after neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval&#xD;
      surgery in patients with extensive stage IIIC or IV ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the feasibility of administering adjuvant carboplatin,&#xD;
      paclitaxel, and bevacizumab without unacceptable significant AE in patients with epithelial&#xD;
      ovarian cancer after neoadjuvant carboplatin/cisplatin, and paclitaxel and interval&#xD;
      cytoreductive surgery, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer. This study will&#xD;
      also investigate progression free and to assess the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Simon minimax two-stage design is employed to determine permit early stopping when a&#xD;
      moderately long sequence of initial adverse events occurs. Under this two-stage design, 13&#xD;
      subjects are enrolled at the first stage. If there are &gt; 3 subjects discontinue treatment due&#xD;
      to significant AE in the stage-1, then stop the trial. Otherwise, the second stage is&#xD;
      implemented by including the other 14 subjects. The treatment safety will be evaluated and&#xD;
      ensured by the occurrence rate of significant AE (or non AE). In stage-1, postoperative&#xD;
      adjuvant cycles 2-6 will be observed for defined significant AE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' or physicians' decision of discontinuation not because of the above-defined&#xD;
      significant AEs or due to cancer progression should not be counted as an end-point event.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. clinically significant proteinuria. Urine protein should be screened by urine&#xD;
             protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR). The UPCR has been found to correlate directly with&#xD;
             the amount of protein excreted in a 24 hour urine collection. Specifically, a UPCR of&#xD;
             1.0 is equivalent to 1.0 gram of protein in a 24 hour urine collection. Obtain at&#xD;
             least 4 ml of a random urine sample in a sterile container (does not have to be a 24&#xD;
             hour urine). Send sample to lab with request for urine protein and creatinine levels&#xD;
             [separate requests]. The lab will measure protein concentration (mg/dL) and creatinine&#xD;
             concentration (mg/dL) The UPCR is derived as follows: protein concentration&#xD;
             (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL). Patients must have a UPCR &lt; 1.0 to allow participation in&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
