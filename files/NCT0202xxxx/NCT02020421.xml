  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for rehabilitation of patients with aphasia after stroke is&#xD;
      conventional speech and language therapy (SLT). Due to economic realities on most stroke&#xD;
      units, SLT can often not be given with optimal intensity in the first weeks after the stroke.&#xD;
      Developing new adjuvant therapies which may render SLT sessions more effective is thus one&#xD;
      approach to improve rehabilitation outcome. Recent functional imaging studies in post-stroke&#xD;
      aphasia have shown that the recruitment of brain regions in the unaffected hemisphere seems&#xD;
      to be an inferior strategy for recovery of language function as compared to re-activation of&#xD;
      brain regions in the vicinity of the infarct. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such&#xD;
      as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) are new methods to modulate brain activity. Evidence from our own&#xD;
      feasibility study in sub-acute stroke suggests that these new techniques, when applied in&#xD;
      conjunction with conventional SLT, may help to normalize brain activation patterns and might&#xD;
      yield better rehabilitation outcome than SLT alone. With NORTHSTAR, we propose a multicenter&#xD;
      proof-of-concept study to investigate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of these new&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation methods as adjuvant therapies for subacute post-stroke&#xD;
      aphasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal is to determine the most effective brain stimulation modality to decrease inhibition&#xD;
      onto the left side of the brain. We will assess if a combination of brain stimulation and&#xD;
      speech and language therapy will improve language recovery. We will quantify language&#xD;
      recovery (expressive and comprehensive skills) using specific tests, commonly used by speech&#xD;
      and language therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will invite patients recently admitted to the stroke unit of the study centers to&#xD;
      participate in our research project. Once patients consent to our study we will randomly&#xD;
      assign them to one of three experimental groups. For 12 days, all groups of patients will be&#xD;
      setup with brain stimulation during their usual rehabilitation sessions. Two of those groups&#xD;
      (treatment groups) will each receive a different type of brain stimulation (rTMS and tDCS),&#xD;
      in the third group, patients will not receive real stimulation (placebo group). By comparing&#xD;
      the extent of aphasia recovery between groups, we will determine the benefits attributable to&#xD;
      brain stimulation relative to SLT alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that any type of non-invasive brain stimulation in combination&#xD;
      with conventional SLT results in better aphasia recovery at 1 and 30 days after end of&#xD;
      treatment than SLT with sham stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that tDCS in combination with SLT is non-inferior to rTMS in&#xD;
      combination with SLT but both are superior to SLT with sham stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that there will be no difference in the frequency of adverse&#xD;
      events between the treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To test the hypothesis that there is a differential influence of attention, time to&#xD;
      treatment, infarct location and bilingualism on the treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 5: To test the hypothesis that the extent of functional and structural connectivity&#xD;
      between the stimulation site over the triangular part of the right inferior frontal gyrus and&#xD;
      the left hemisphere primary language centers determines effectiveness of the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional information: The eligibility criteria have been selected such that the resulting&#xD;
      study population will reflect a typical clinical population of aphasic stroke patients.&#xD;
      Stroke location and aphasia type are thus not inclusion or exclusion criterion but will be&#xD;
      documented in order to ensure a similar distribution between treatment groups and allow for&#xD;
      subgroup analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional information: All patients will receive 45 minutes of model-oriented individualized&#xD;
      aphasia therapy administered by a certified therapist and focused on the individual specific&#xD;
      linguistic problems as determined by the therapeutic team according to SLT best-practice&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): Using a figure-of-8 shaped electromagnetic coil, a&#xD;
      rapidly changing (1Hz) magnetic field is applied to the scull over the target stimulation&#xD;
      site (Broca Area's homologue in the non-dominant hemisphere, non-dominant BA45). At a&#xD;
      frequency of 1Hz, these currents have been shown to interfere with normal neuronal activity&#xD;
      by down regulating it. The suppressive effect of 20 minutes of 1Hz rTMS with a stimulation&#xD;
      intensity that would elicit muscle contractions (motor evoked potentials, MEP) when applied&#xD;
      over the motor cortex (resting motor threshold, RMT) lasts about 45 minutes. SLT sessions&#xD;
      will be given immediately following the stimulation procedure. For sham-stimulation, the coil&#xD;
      will be placed over the inter-hemispheric fissure at the vertex and stimulation will be&#xD;
      performed with low intensity (10% RMT). This will cause similar skin sensations as real&#xD;
      stimulation but will not induce currents in language relevant areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS): For tDCS a 5 cm2 sponge electrode (cathode)&#xD;
      will be placed over the target area (Broca Area's homologue in the non-dominant hemisphere)&#xD;
      and the anode on the forehead over the contralateral eye. A direct current of 2mA will be&#xD;
      applied between electrodes. A negative current applied to the brain area under the cathode&#xD;
      will cause a decrease in resting membrane potential of the underlying neurons thus reducing&#xD;
      their excitability. tDCS will start immediately before the SLT session and last throughout&#xD;
      the session. tDCS only evokes a tingling sensation on the skin when turned on and off. For&#xD;
      sham stimulation the current will be turned on for 30 seconds to elicit a typical skin&#xD;
      sensation and then turned off for the duration of the therapy. The same will be done at the&#xD;
      end of the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Localization of stimulation sites: Stimulation sites will be localized using a modification&#xD;
      of the surface distance measurements (SDM) method. Study centres will send the patient's&#xD;
      T1-weighted MRI to the study coordinating centre. Surface renderings of the MRI will be&#xD;
      generating using the 3D-Tool. Reference measures relative to the nasion-inion line will be&#xD;
      identified on these reconstructions and sent to the participating centre. The person&#xD;
      preparing the stimulation can verify the distances on the real patient's head and determine&#xD;
      the respective stimulation site. The method has an accuracy of approx. 8 mm for localizing&#xD;
      Broca's Area when compared to neuronavigation. Having designed the study with broad and&#xD;
      cost-effective applicability in mind, we chose this approach although the centres do have&#xD;
      advanced neuronavigation available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of resting motor threshold (RMT): The RMT will be defined iteratively as&#xD;
      previously described over the right M1 prior to each treatment session. Within M1 the&#xD;
      position which elicits the highest MEP-Amplitude in the left first dorsal interosseus muscle&#xD;
      (FDI) with 80% or higher stimulator output will be maintained and stimulation intensity will&#xD;
      be reduced first in 5% intervals until less than 5 consecutive MEPs with amplitude greater&#xD;
      50µV in 10 stimulation trials are obtained. Stimulation intensity will then be set up in 5%&#xD;
      intervals until 5 consecutive MEPs with amplitude greater 50µV in 10 stimulation trials are&#xD;
      obtained. The intensity at this point is used as RMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR imaging procedures: MRI will be performed on a 3T SIEMENS MAGNETOM TrioTim syngo MR B17.&#xD;
      We will acquire volumetric data-sets with 1mm resolution comprising one T1-weighted image for&#xD;
      determination of stimulation site (ADNI-MPRAGE, 10 minutes, 192 sagittal slices, 1mm&#xD;
      thickness, TR 2300 ms, TE 2.98ms), fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences (axial&#xD;
      FLAIR, 3.5 minutes, 60 slices, 2mm thickness, flip angle 150 deg, TR 900ms, TE 70ms) for&#xD;
      infarct localization and quantification of infarct volume followed by two 10 minute resting&#xD;
      state fMRI sequences (BOLD MOSAIC 64, 10 minutes, 34 slices, 4mm thickness, 90deg flip angle,&#xD;
      TR 1810ms, TE 30ms) and a 10 minute diffusion sequence (63 slices, 2mm thickness, TR 8400ms,&#xD;
      TE 90ms, 64 directions)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and study instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will use three tests of elementary language function as primary outcome&#xD;
      variables (verbal fluency, comprehension and picture naming) for which comparable age-matched&#xD;
      norms for all languages (English, French and German) of the participating countries exist.&#xD;
      Language specific test batteries as well as the Bilingual Aphasia Test (BAT) will be used as&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures and for classification of aphasia types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of a single test for aphasic impairment validated in all three languages,&#xD;
      measures of aphasic impairment will only be considered as secondary outcome measures. Each&#xD;
      participant will be assessed with a test battery that is commonly used by the majority of&#xD;
      speech and language therapists in the corresponding languages: the Aachen Aphasia Test (AAT)&#xD;
      in German; the Protocole Montréal-Toulouse 86 (MT) in French; and the Western Aphasia Battery&#xD;
      (WAB) in English. The tests will be repeated 1 and 30 days after the last treatment session.&#xD;
      In addition the Bilingual Aphasia Test (BAT) will be used, in order to validate its&#xD;
      sensitivity to detected changes in language performance during aphasia recovery for future&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the following tests will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Testing (baseline) - before treatment: Demographics (including education) and medical&#xD;
      history questionnaire, Neurological exam, cognitive testing (MoCA), NIHSS, CETI, Barthel&#xD;
      Index, modified Rankin scale After each treatment session: Assessment of adverse events (AE)&#xD;
      and serious adverse events (SAE) 1 and 30 days after last treatment session: Neurological&#xD;
      exam, cognitive testing (MoCA), NIHSS, Communicative Effectiveness Index (CETI), Barthel&#xD;
      Index, modified Rankin scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 - I Patients treated with any type of non-invasive brain stimulation will show a&#xD;
      significantly larger increase in picture naming, token-test or semantic verbal fluency scores&#xD;
      than any sham treated patients at 1 day and 30 days after last therapy session&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 - II tDCS will not be inferior to rTMS but superior to sham stimulation with respect to&#xD;
      treatment effects at 1 day and 30 days after last therapy session&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - III There will be no difference in the frequency of AE/SAE between treatment groups&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - I Both treatment groups will show a larger increase in the global test scores than&#xD;
           sham-groups at 1 day and 30 days after last treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 - II Patients with lesions in the anterior MCA-territory (frontal and basal ganglia) will&#xD;
      show greater treatment effects in verbal fluency than patients with lesions in the posterior&#xD;
      MCA territory at 1 day after last session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 - III Patients with lesions in the posterior MCA territory (temporo-parietal) will show&#xD;
      greater treatment effects in Token test than patients with lesions in the anterior MCA&#xD;
      territory at 1 day after last session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 - IV There will be differential influence of attention, time to treatment, infarct location&#xD;
      and bilingualism on the improvement in picture naming, token-test and semantic verbal fluency&#xD;
      in the three treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 - V Time series of BOLD-signal fluctuations measured in the triangular part of the right&#xD;
      inferior frontal gyrus will be 2-VI fractional anisotropy values in transcallosal fiber&#xD;
      tracts between primary language areas will be correlated with improvement in clinical outcome&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test these hypotheses, the following primary outcome variables will be derived&#xD;
      from the primary outcome measures: difference between semantic verbal fluency test scores at&#xD;
      baseline and and 1 and 30 days after completion of the treatment period (dSF1, dSF30),&#xD;
      difference between picture naming test scores at baseline and 1 and 30 days after completion&#xD;
      of the treatment period (dPN1, dPN30), difference between Token test scores at baseline and 1&#xD;
      and 30 days after completion of the treatment period (dTT1, dTT30) and a cumulative number of&#xD;
      AE and SAE during 10 days of therapy (AE1) and during the 30 days follow-up period (AE30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome variables will be: Percent difference of global aphasia test scores at&#xD;
      follow-ups (1 and 30 days after completion of the treatment period) relative to baseline&#xD;
      (dAT1, dAT30). The stratification variables will be TRT: treatment (levels: any stimulation,&#xD;
      sham), STT: stimulation type (levels: rTMS, tDCS, sham) and LOC: infarct location (levels:&#xD;
      MCA-ant, MCA-post).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned statistical tests for primary and secondary outcome variables are ANOVA for between&#xD;
      group effects with the respective stratification variables as factors as required by each of&#xD;
      the hypotheses. A significance level of P&lt;0.01 corrected for multiple comparisons will be&#xD;
      accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confounding variables: sex, age, intelligence, socioeconomic status and aphasia type have&#xD;
      been shown to correlate with initial aphasia severity but NOT with recovery. We will thus&#xD;
      control for these variables by randomization. Multivariate analysis: We will use multiple&#xD;
      regression to test whether time of therapy onset after stroke, attention, bilingualism and&#xD;
      infarct location are differentially correlated with recovery in the treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting state fMRI data will be analyzed following a previously published protocol for&#xD;
      functional connectivity in language networks. Time series of BOLD-signal fluctuations within&#xD;
      the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis, seed region) will be correlated with&#xD;
      signal fluctuations in the non-infarcted gray matter of the left hemisphere on voxel by voxel&#xD;
      basis using the MATLAB toolbox for functional connectivity implemented in SPM. We expect&#xD;
      interhemispheric connectivity of the right inferior frontal gyrus with left hemisphere&#xD;
      language cortex to be higher in those patients who will show the greatest response to&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffusion Tensor Imaging data will be analyzed following our previously established protocol.&#xD;
      Transcallosal fibers will be traced between homotopic primary language regions in both&#xD;
      hemispheres and fractional anisotropy will be measured within those traced fibre bundles as&#xD;
      surrogate marker of fibre tract integrity as previously described. FA values will then be&#xD;
      correlated with clinical primary outcome measures in each treatment group to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that fibre tract integrity predicts therapeutic response.&#xD;
