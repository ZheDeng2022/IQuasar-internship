  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been a significant increase in the number of prescriptions being filled for Custom&#xD;
      Compounded Pain Creams. This study serves to evaluate the patient perception and satisfaction&#xD;
      with this type of pain therapy allowing us to identify any statistically relevant&#xD;
      relationships that may exist between this type of therapy and patient pain perception. A&#xD;
      secondary goal would be to identify any significantly relevant relationships that may exist&#xD;
      between this change in pain perception (if any) and the patients overall sense of well-being.&#xD;
      The investigators' null hypothesis is that greater that 85% of people will see an significant&#xD;
      decrease in perceived pain levels and greater than 85% increase in patient overall sense of&#xD;
      well being.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the level of pain perceived by chronic neuropathic&#xD;
      and/or inflammatory pain patients using a compounded transdermal pain cream as a pain&#xD;
      management solution. Our goal is to identify statistically relevant relationships existing&#xD;
      between this type of pain therapy and patients' perceived pain levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary goal of this study is to identify any statistically relevant relationships&#xD;
      between this change in pain perception (if any) and the patient's perception of overall&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an observational study with a cohort observational model study design. Patients&#xD;
      whom have been prescribed a compounded pain cream regimen as a new pain therapy but have not&#xD;
      yet begun the regimen will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will work with local prescribing neurologic, orthopedic and pain clinic physicians to&#xD;
      identify patients who will be beginning this type of therapy in the near future. Prior to&#xD;
      administering their first dose, the participants will need to complete the consenting&#xD;
      process. Participants may opt to review and complete the informed consent form with their&#xD;
      doctor or with a member of the pharmacy research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The custom survey entitled MLP-001-PC will be administered throughout the 12 week study at 4&#xD;
      week intervals (baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not be required to come to the pharmacy to complete the subsequent surveys.&#xD;
      They can be mailed or emailed at the participant's discretion. Any patient whom opts to&#xD;
      receive their survey via mail or email will need to indicate so on their patient information&#xD;
      form and provide a signature at that time stating that all surveys will be completed on one's&#xD;
      own behalf (See Attachment 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participants opt to receive their surveys by mail, we will ask that they return their&#xD;
      survey to the pharmacy either in person or in the stamped envelope that will be provided.&#xD;
      Participants receiving their surveys by email, will need to return their completed surveys in&#xD;
      person, by mail or by email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will follow up with the patients at 3 and 6 days after the distribution of the surveys to&#xD;
      remind them to complete and return the surveys. Surveys which are not completed within one&#xD;
      week of the respective follow-up date will be excluded from the study for that respective&#xD;
      follow-up interval. These participants will still be encouraged to complete the next survey&#xD;
      for the next follow-up date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is projected to last one year from enrollment of the first subject to completion of&#xD;
      the last subject's participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All results from the baseline and follow-up surveys will be scored and the data will be&#xD;
      compiled on site. Statistical analysis (Multinomial Regressional Analysis) will be performed&#xD;
      to identify all statistically relevant correlations. All data will be summarized and&#xD;
      concluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://ClinicalTrials.gov, as&#xD;
      required by U.S. Law.&#xD;
