    <textblock>
      The primary trial objective is to determine the efficacy of KPT-330 (selinexor) in&#xD;
      participants with advanced or metastatic gynaecological cancers by disease control rate&#xD;
      (complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for at least 12&#xD;
      weeks, assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version&#xD;
      1.1.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Two-stage Phase 2 study in 3 separate gynecological cancer cohorts, with an additional set of&#xD;
      participants in the ovarian cohort randomized into 2 different treatment regimens. The study&#xD;
      is divided between a Primary Treatment Phase and a Maintenance Phase with each phase&#xD;
      supported by a separate database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 - Three parallel cohorts of participants with ovarian (Cohort A), endometrial (Cohort&#xD;
      B), or cervical (Cohort C) carcinoma were enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 - Based on the observed tolerability and efficacy profile in the ongoing ovarian&#xD;
      cohort (Cohort A), 2 additional treatment schedules will be explored to optimize the dosing&#xD;
      schedule in a participant population with ovarian carcinoma.&#xD;

    <description>Disease Control Rate (DCR) was defined as the point estimate of the percentage of participants who had complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for at least 12 weeks, assessed according to RECIST v1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeters (mm). PR was defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. Participants without documented disease progression were censored on the date of last radiologic assessment.</description>

    <description>EORTC QLQC30: Disease specific indication that rates overall QoL in cancer participants. It consists of 30 general questions from 3 domains; 1) global health status, 2) functioning scales (physical, emotional, cognitive, social and role functioning), 3) symptom scales (fatigue, nausea, vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulty). Out of 30 questions, 28 questions were scored using scale of 1 to 4, represented answers of 'not at all', 'a little', 'quite a bit', and 'very much'; remaining 2 questions contributed to global health status were scored on scale of 1 to 7, represented range of 'very poor' to 'excellent' that evaluated overall health and QoL. All scales and single-item measures range from 0 to 100, where higher score represented higher response level. Higher score for functional scale, global health status and symptom scale represented high level of functioning, high QoL, and high level of symptoms or problems, respectively.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 116 participants were enrolled out of which 2 participants discontinued the study before the start of the treatment (1 participant due to death and 1 participant due to other reason).

          <description>Participants with ovarian carcinoma who were platinum refractory or platinum resistant and had received at least one line of chemotherapy for relapsed disease received a dose of 50 milligram per meter square (mg/m^2) of selinexor oral tablets twice weekly (BIW) (doses at least 36 hours apart) with light meal and 120 milliliters (mL) of water in a 4-week treatment cycles. After 12 weeks of treatment, a dose of 60 mg/m^2 of selinexor oral tablets BIW were administrated if the participants had no major toxicity. During dose reduction, participants received a minimum dose of 35 mg/m^2 once weekly (QW). This treatment continued until progression of disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity or any discontinuation criteria or withdrawal of consent by the participant, or non-compliance by the participant with protocol requirements.</description>

        <description>Disease Control Rate (DCR) was defined as the point estimate of the percentage of participants who had complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for at least 12 weeks, assessed according to RECIST v1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeters (mm). PR was defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. Participants without documented disease progression were censored on the date of last radiologic assessment.</description>

        <population>Analysis was performed on modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population that included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, had measurable disease per RECIST at baseline, and had at least 1 post-baseline efficacy follow-up information.</population>

During dose reduction, participants received a minimum dose of 35 mg/m^2 QW.

After 12 weeks of treatment, a dose of 60 mg/m^2 of selinexor oral tablets BIW were administrated if the participants had no major toxicity. During dose reduction, participants received a minimum dose of 35 mg/m^2 QW. This treatment continued until PD or unacceptable toxicity or any discontinuation criteria or withdrawal of consent by the participant, or non-compliance by the participant with protocol requirements.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not it is considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as an AE that meets one or more of the mentioned criteria, i.e., fatal, life threatening (places the participants at immediate risk of death), required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or important medical events. TEAE was defined as any AE (serious/non-serious) with onset or worsening of a pre-existing condition on or after the first administration of study medication through 30 days following last dose or any event considered drug-related by the investigator through the end of the study.</description>

        <description>EORTC QLQC30: Disease specific indication that rates overall QoL in cancer participants. It consists of 30 general questions from 3 domains; 1) global health status, 2) functioning scales (physical, emotional, cognitive, social and role functioning), 3) symptom scales (fatigue, nausea, vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulty). Out of 30 questions, 28 questions were scored using scale of 1 to 4, represented answers of 'not at all', 'a little', 'quite a bit', and 'very much'; remaining 2 questions contributed to global health status were scored on scale of 1 to 7, represented range of 'very poor' to 'excellent' that evaluated overall health and QoL. All scales and single-item measures range from 0 to 100, where higher score represented higher response level. Higher score for functional scale, global health status and symptom scale represented high level of functioning, high QoL, and high level of symptoms or problems, respectively.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, End of treatment (EOT) i.e., 30 days after last dose of study drug administration (up to 31 months)</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was performed on mITT population that included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, had measurable disease per RECIST at baseline, and had at least 1 post-baseline efficacy follow-up information. Here, 'Overall number of participants analyzed' signifies participants with available data for the outcome measure and &quot;Number analyzed' signifies number of participants with available data for specified categories.</population>
