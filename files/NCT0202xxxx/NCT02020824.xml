  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality is currently used as a therapeutic strategy in common phobia as agoraphobia&#xD;
      or acrophobia, since it permits to have a better control (on occurrence of events or on the&#xD;
      environment) during the therapy than in &quot;in vivo&quot; therapy. Our hypothesis here is that we can&#xD;
      improves the therapeutic effects of the virtual exposure by giving control to acrophobic&#xD;
      patients during their exposure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is based on the exposure of acrophobic patients to virtual environments. During the&#xD;
      study, several groups of patients will be distributed according to different conditions:&#xD;
      exposure to anxiogenous virtual environments and exposure with the ability to control and&#xD;
      secure the anxiogenous virtual environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest of this project is to improve therapy by exposure to virtual reality. Our&#xD;
      project offers a systematic therapeutic approach (using virtual reality and the concept of&#xD;
      control) where current therapy are too often approximate. We aim to demonstrate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the control of virtual environments on symptomatic and psychophysiological&#xD;
      levels, to evaluate the adoption of these methods in the couple patients-caregivers and also&#xD;
      to understand the brain mechanisms (including those prefrontal) involved in this therapy.&#xD;
