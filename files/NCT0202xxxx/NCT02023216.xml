    <textblock>
      Gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) is a common condition among preterm infants, due to several&#xD;
      physiological promoting factors. To limit the potentially harmful widespread of&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment, a step-wise approach, which firstly applies conservative&#xD;
      strategies, is currently considered the best choice to manage GER in the preterm population.&#xD;
      Among the most common conservative strategies, postural measures seem to represent an&#xD;
      effective measure to reduce GER features in symptomatic preterm babies, whereas feed&#xD;
      thickening is almost ineffective. Non-nutritive sucking (NNS) is a care strategy largely&#xD;
      applied in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) settings. The act of swallowing is both&#xD;
      reported to trigger the onset of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs),&#xD;
      thereby eliciting to GER episodes, and to promote the esophageal clearance of refluxate.&#xD;
      Hence, a possible effect of NNS on GER features might be hypothesized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational, prospective and explorative study primarily aims to explore the effect of&#xD;
      NNS, applied by means of a pacifier, on acid and non-acid GER features, evaluated in&#xD;
      symptomatic preterm infants (gestational age ≤32 weeks) undergoing a diagnostic combined pH&#xD;
      and multiple intraluminal impedance (pH-MII). The secondary aim of this study is to evaluate,&#xD;
      in the subgroup of patients with recurrent GER-related apneas, the effect of NNS on&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory events, defined as bradycardias and total, central, obstructive, mixed&#xD;
      apneas and detected by a simultaneous polysomnographic monitoring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to several promoting factors related to the physiological immaturity of the&#xD;
      gastro-intestinal tract, gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) is a frequent condition among preterm&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GER clinical presentation may vary within a wide range of symptoms, being vomiting,&#xD;
      regurgitations and cardiorespiratory events, such as apnoeas or bradycardia, the most common&#xD;
      in the preterm population. Particularly, apneic episodes are inversely related to the&#xD;
      gestational age (GA) and might be associated with such pathological events as hypoxia,&#xD;
      hypercapnia or pressure variability, which seem to negatively affect the long-term&#xD;
      neurological development of preterm babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined pH and multiple intraluminal impedance (pH-MII) is currently considered the best&#xD;
      choice for GER diagnosis in preterm infants. While pH monitoring is limited to the detection&#xD;
      of acid reflux, combined pH-MII effectively identifies both acid and non-acid GER, which is&#xD;
      predominant in preterm babies. Moreover, thanks to its multichannel probe, combined pH-MII&#xD;
      allows to evaluate the height reached by the refluxate within the esophageal lumen and to&#xD;
      distinguish retrograde fluid bolus movements (reflux) from the anterograde ones (swallows).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last decade, GER pharmacological treatment has increasingly widespread in NICUs. The&#xD;
      provision of anti-histamine2 (H2) blockers and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) in the preterm&#xD;
      population, however, might lead to such adverse effects as an increased incidence of&#xD;
      necrotizing enterocolitis and infections. Hence, to avoid a useless and potentially harmful&#xD;
      pharmacological overtreatment, a step-wise approach, firstly promoting conservative&#xD;
      strategies, is currently considered the most advisable choice for GER management in&#xD;
      symptomatic preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postural and dietetic interventions represent the most common conservative strategies and&#xD;
      their efficacy in improving GER symptoms and features has been largely investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As we assessed in a previous pH-MII study, both prone and left-side positions were more&#xD;
      effective than the right-side or the supine ones to determine a significant improvement in&#xD;
      both acid and non-acid GER features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feed thickening is widely employed to reducing vomiting and regurgitations in symptomatic&#xD;
      term infants; with regard to the preterm population, however, little data is currently&#xD;
      available. We have previously investigated the efficacy of thickened fortified human milk on&#xD;
      preterm infants suffering from GER symptoms (frequent regurgitations, desaturations,&#xD;
      bradycardia), observing no benefits. Furthermore, standard human milk fortification itself&#xD;
      has been shown to increase GER frequency in preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to anti-regurgitation (AR) formulas, we have recently evaluated the effectiveness&#xD;
      of a specific AR formula, thickened with amylopectin and specifically tailored for preterm&#xD;
      infants' nutritional needs; the tested thickened formula effectively reduced the number of&#xD;
      acid GERs, but no difference was observed in the frequency of non-acid GERs and in the mean&#xD;
      esophageal acid exposure, which is known to be the main determinant for the development of&#xD;
      gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Thus, according to these preliminary data, feed&#xD;
      thickening seem to be almost ineffective in improving GER symptoms and features in preterm&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-nutritive sucking (NNS) is part of the routine neonatal care, being widely applied in&#xD;
      NICU settings. NNS has been showed to positively influence gastric secretion, gut motility&#xD;
      and to improve the digestive process. NICU hospitalization and the need for respiratory&#xD;
      support, however, might delay the transition from tube feeding to full oral feeding, thereby&#xD;
      increasing the length of hospital stay and negatively affecting the mother-neonate&#xD;
      relationship. Over two decades ago, in their meta-analysis Schwartz et al. showed beneficial&#xD;
      effects of NNS in reducing time to attain full oral feeding as well as the length of&#xD;
      hospitalization. These results have been further confirmed in a recent review by Harding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of NNS on GER, however, has not been yet clarified. It has been previously shown&#xD;
      that the swallowing enhances the occurrence of lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations, which&#xD;
      are known to represent a trigger stimulus for reflux episodes. On the other hand, the act of&#xD;
      swallowing appears to promote the esophageal clearance of refluxate; hence, a possible&#xD;
      influence of NNS on GER might be hypothesized. In a pH-metric study, performed by Orenstein&#xD;
      et al. on infants younger than 6 months, NNS seemed to have a worsening effect on GER when&#xD;
      applied in the prone posture, whereas in the seated position was associated with an&#xD;
      ameliorative outcome; this controversial result, however, cannot be extended to the preterm&#xD;
      population. To date, the efficacy of NNS by means of a pacifier on preterm infants&#xD;
      symptomatic for GER has been preliminary evaluated only by Zhao et al., reporting an&#xD;
      improvement of overall GER features (number of refluxes, reflux index, total time at pH&lt;4)&#xD;
      and a faster time of gastric emptying in the NNS group. However, this study was performed by&#xD;
      pH monitoring, so that the effect of NNS on non-acid GER has not been evaluated yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the buffering effect of milk feeding on gastric pH, and being the acidity of gastric&#xD;
      juice GA-dependent, non-acid GERs represent a major percentage (70%) of the overall reflux&#xD;
      episodes in the preterm population. Moreover, as we have recently observed, non-acid reflux&#xD;
      is the main responsible for the occurrence of GER-related apneas. Hence, a beneficial effect&#xD;
      on GER-related apneas and subsequent hypoxic episodes, potentially harmful for preterm&#xD;
      infants, could be supplied by conservative strategies effective in decreasing non-acid GERs&#xD;
      features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this observational, prospective, exploratory study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of NNS on GER pH-MII features in preterm infants (GA ≤32 weeks) symptomatic for GER&#xD;
      (i.e. suffering from frequent regurgitations, feeding difficulties, failure to thrive and/or&#xD;
      post-prandial desaturations) for which a 24-hour pH-MII monitoring for GER diagnostic&#xD;
      evaluation has been scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim of this study is to assess, by means of a simultaneous non-invasive 6-hour&#xD;
      polysomnographic recording, the effect of NNS on total, central, obstructive, mixed apneas&#xD;
      and on cardiorespiratory events within the subgroup of patients with recurrent desaturations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall thirty preterm infants (GA ≤32 weeks) will be enrolled if suffering from&#xD;
      moderate/severe GER symptoms and if a diagnostic 24-hour pH-MII monitoring has been scheduled&#xD;
      to evaluate GER features, according to our clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 24-h pH-MII monitoring each infant will receive eight meals, four of which will be&#xD;
      followed by NNS treatment with a pacifier. The sequence of NNS application will be&#xD;
      consecutively alternated in study participants. For each evaluation, a minimum of 2 hours of&#xD;
      NNS post-prandial treatment is required. The healthcare assistants (i.e. medical staff and&#xD;
      nurses) will inspect the correct application of NNS, recording the effective time of pacifier&#xD;
      usage and regularly checking the pacifier position in relation to the pH-MII probe and&#xD;
      polysomnographic flow sensor, to avoid possible interferences. Due to their immaturity, the&#xD;
      enrolled patients might show an ineffective sucking, potentially losing the pacifier. In this&#xD;
      case, the healthcare assistants will offer the pacifier to the babies up to a maximum of four&#xD;
      times for each postprandial period; measures to fix the pacifier will be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pH-MII device in use for this study (Comfortec pH-MII Sandhill Scientific) is a&#xD;
      nasogastric probe with seven rings, composed by six dipolar impedance channels and one&#xD;
      antimony electrode responsible for pH detection and placed in the middle of the distal&#xD;
      impedance dipole. Due to these characteristics, pH-MII is able to measure the esophageal&#xD;
      height reached by refluxate and to identify the direction of esophageal bolus movements,&#xD;
      thereby distinguish between a retrograde flow (reflux) and an anti-retrograde flow (swallow).&#xD;
      Esophageal probe length will be determined using Strobel's formula: [baby length (cm) x 0.252&#xD;
      + 5)] - 13%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impedance monitoring detects a GER episode (MII-GER) if there is a sequential drop in&#xD;
      impedance values to less than 50% of the baseline, starting distally and propagating&#xD;
      retrogradely to at least the next two more proximal measuring segments (about 4.5 cm above&#xD;
      the lower esophageal sphincter (LES)). A GER episode is then defined as acid or non-acid&#xD;
      according to its pH: the MII episodes with a pH lower than 4 are defined as acid MII-GERs,&#xD;
      whereas the MII episodes with a pH≥4 are defined as non-acid MII-GERs. GERs migration height&#xD;
      is the maximum distance from the LES reached by the esophageal refluxate. An acid GER episode&#xD;
      is recorded by pH monitoring as a pH drop to less than 4; to be detected by the pH sensor,&#xD;
      the pH drop has to last at least 5 s. The total percent time of esophageal exposure to a pH&#xD;
      &lt;4 is named Reflux Index (RIpH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the pH-MII recording will be automatically acquired on a portable Sleuth Sandhill&#xD;
      Scientific system and then stored in a personal computer containing a specific software&#xD;
      (BioVIEW Analysis Sandhill Scientific, version 5.0.9). Data analysis will be performed by the&#xD;
      aforementioned software and confirmed by direct visual evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the subgroup of patients with recurrent desaturations, a simultaneous non-invasive 6-hour&#xD;
      polysomnographic monitoring, comprehensive of two meals (one followed by NNS and the other&#xD;
      not), will be performed to evaluate a possible effect of NNS on apneic episodes (total,&#xD;
      central, obstructive, mixed) and cardiorespiratory events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The polysomnographic device in use for this study (System Plus, Micromed, Mogliano Veneto,&#xD;
      Italy) measures the oral/nasal airflow by a flow transducer placed below the nostrils,&#xD;
      whereas abdominal movements are detected by a band placed around the abdomen which is&#xD;
      connected to a respiratory inductance plethysmography. Each oral/nasal flow cessation ≥5&#xD;
      seconds will be considered an apneic episode; apneas are then classified as central (CA:&#xD;
      absence of both oral/nasal flow and movements of the abdominal wall), obstructive (OA:&#xD;
      abdominal movements with an inadequate oral/nasal flow) and mixed (MA: components of both CA&#xD;
      and OA). Apneas included in periodic breathing patters will be ruled out from the analysis.&#xD;
      Systemic oxygen saturation is recorded by means of a pulse oximeter sensor, placed on the&#xD;
      infant's foot. Cardiorespiratory events will be characterized as hypoxic episodes, defined as&#xD;
      the occurrence of SatO2 &lt;80%, and/or bradycardia, defined as pulse rate &lt;100 bpm. The&#xD;
      polysomnographic recording is automatically acquired in a computer connected to the&#xD;
      polysomnographic device. The number of total apneas, CA, OA, MA and cardiorespiratory events&#xD;
      will be traced down and visually analyzed by the sub-investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed by SPSS 20 (Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows. Differences between NNS and control&#xD;
      periods in terms of GER frequency and features, number of apneic and bradycardic episodes&#xD;
      will be tested by Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test. The level of significance is set at 0.05.&#xD;
