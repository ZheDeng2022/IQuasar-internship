      This is a minimal risk correlative clinical blood-drawing protocol. The objective of this&#xD;
      lead in pilot component is to determine whether Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC's) can be&#xD;
      captured using the novel mesenchymal-marker based Near Infrared-Emissive Polymersomes&#xD;
      (NIR-EPs), the PSMA-based NIR-EP, and the epithelial EpCAM-based NIR-EP. If successful, the&#xD;
      capture method will be evaluated further in the larger comparative study.&#xD;
