      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Change in Fatigue Assesment Score (FAS) between the first visit (baseline) and 28 (+maximum&#xD;
      7) days after oral administration of 100 000 E vitamin D (Cholecalciferol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effect of oral administration of vitamin D on serum vitamin D levels (25-Hydroxy-Vitamin&#xD;
           D = Colecalciferol), PTH, Calcium, and Phosphate as compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy of vitamin D (Colecalciferol) administration on fatigue using the short&#xD;

      1. General Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a randomized, double blind, mono-centric, placebo-controlled interventional&#xD;
           study of the effects of oral vitamin D supplementation on self-reported fatigue. Overall&#xD;
           80 patients with proven vitamin D deficiency (20-Hydroxy-Vitamin D ≤ 20 µg/L) who&#xD;
           fulfill all the eligibility criteria will be randomized and enrolled to receive vitamin&#xD;
           D or placebo in 1:1 ratio. All patients must sign an informed consent prior to enrolment&#xD;
           and meet eligibility criteria. All patients will be recruited at the Medical Outpatients&#xD;
           Department of University Hospital Zürich.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening, Part 1: Consecutive patients consulting the Medical Outpatients Department,&#xD;
           complaining of fatigue, will be asked to participate in the study. Basic questionnaire&#xD;
           for fatigue will be applied to confirm fatigue symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening, Part 2: In positive case, the patients will be asked to sign an informed&#xD;
           consent. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview&#xD;
           (M.I.N.I.) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) will be administered to exclude depression,&#xD;
           sleep disorders and major psychiatric disorders respectively. Thereafter blood will be&#xD;
           tested according to table 1. Patients with vitamin D levels below 20 µg/L will undergo&#xD;
           randomization. Participants will be informed about their results of vitamin D levels by&#xD;
           the telephone, a treatment appointment within 2 weeks after screening will be arranged&#xD;
           for participants with vitamin D levels ≤ 20 µg/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit A (within 2 weeks after randomisation): Routine clinical examination will be&#xD;
           performed. Baseline Fatigue assessment scale (FAS) score will be documented, following&#xD;
           by blood and urine samples according to table 1 to measure the baseline vitamin D-, PTH-&#xD;
           and Calcium levels. Blood samples will undergo centrifugation. Blood and urine samples&#xD;
           will be frozen at -80°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Oral Vitamin D preparation or placebo will be administered according to the protocol in&#xD;
           a double blinded manner. The drug administration will be done by an independent person&#xD;
           e.g. a physician assistant or study nurse directly observing the drug intake. During the&#xD;
           administration, procedures are implemented which ensure that the subjects cannot&#xD;
           distinguish between placebo and verum (identical appearance, taste and smell).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit B ( 4 weeks after Visit A + maximum 7 days): Patients will undergo the same&#xD;
           Assessment of Fatigue by filling out FAS questionnaire. Additionally, a short&#xD;
           self-developed test Fatigue course assessment (FCA) will be applied to evaluate&#xD;
           symptomatic response. Thereafter blood and urine samples will be taken to document&#xD;
           biochemical response: Vitamin D-, PTH-, phosphate and calcium levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Vitamin D status of the subjects will be monitored by standard clinical chemical&#xD;
           parameters. Safety assessments will include pre- and post-treatment measurement of vital&#xD;
           signs, clinical laboratory assessments, and the recording of adverse clinical events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Selection of study population / Subject recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be informed about the study at a regular medical visit at the medical&#xD;
           outpatients department USZ. Potential subjects will be provided with the participant&#xD;
           information sheet and fill in the basic questionnaire for fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After informed consent has been obtained, all study-specific information will be&#xD;
           collected to determine if a patient meets the inclusion criteria without violating any&#xD;
           of the exclusion criteria. A total number of 80 subjects will be enrolled, with an&#xD;
           enrolment goal of 12 subjects per month. Recruitment will take place in the medical&#xD;
           outpatient department (Klinik und Poliklinik für Innere Medizin) of the University&#xD;
           Hospital in Zurich. If monthly enrolment goals cannot be achieved, announcements will be&#xD;
           posted on the university's announcement boards and on the internet page of the USZ&#xD;
           medical department. Patients will receive no financial compensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrolling subjects in this study are&#xD;
           described in the following sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prior and Concomitant Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to the inclusion/exclusion criteria (see above), chronic intake of concomitant&#xD;
           medication is not allowed, except oral contraceptives. Intake of Vitamin D preparations&#xD;
           during the last 8 weeks before the start of the trial protocol and during the trial is&#xD;
           not allowed. Vitamin preparations or herbal medicine should be withheld during the study&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sporadic medication with e.g. NSAID or paracetamol for symptomatic treatment of&#xD;
           intercurrent viral infections or occasional headaches is allowed. All concomitant&#xD;
           medications have to be recorded on the CRF. Subjects taking additional vitamin D&#xD;
           preparations drugs the study course will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Randomization and blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
           Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A randomization procedure will be used to avoid a bias in the assignment of the study&#xD;
           subjects to the two treatment groups (oral vitamin D, oral placebo). Randomization&#xD;
           lists, preparation of study drugs and placebo, labelling and drug accountability will be&#xD;
           done by the hospital pharmacy (Kantonsapotheke Zürich). The randomisation list will be&#xD;
           preserved by the hospital pharmacy. The oral intake will be directly observed by a&#xD;
           physician assistant or study nurse. As placebo and verum are manufactured having&#xD;
           identical appearance, taste and smell, study participants can not differ between placebo&#xD;
           and verum.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be assigned to treatment groups based on a randomization list/schedule&#xD;
           prepared by the hospital pharmacy prior to the trial. Patients will receive a&#xD;
           randomization number. Randomized patients who terminate their study participation for&#xD;
           any reason regardless whether the study medication was taken or not, will retain their&#xD;
           randomization number. The next patient will be given the next randomization number.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An Emergency Code Break preserved in a sealed Emergency Code Envelope will be available&#xD;
           to the investigator. This envelope with the Code Break should only be opened in&#xD;
           emergency situations when the identity of the investigational product must be known by&#xD;
           the investigator in order to provide appropriate medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Treatment / Dosage and administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment groups (40 participants in each&#xD;
      group): Group I: oral vitamin D; Group II: oral placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I (oral vitamin D): 100 000 E Vitamin D (Colecalciferol) will be applied as a&#xD;
           single dose as two capsules containing 50 000 E each.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group II (oral placebo): 2 placebo capsules will be applied as a single dose The drug&#xD;
           preparations will be delivered and labelled by the hospital pharmacy according to&#xD;
           standard operating procedures and GMP guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the study finalisation, the placebo group will be offered a treatment with Vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Study drug information Vitamin D used in this study is 2 capsules containing 50 000 E&#xD;
      Cholecalciferol each, prepared by the university hospital pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo will be prepared by the university hospital pharmacy in a capsule of identical&#xD;
      appearance, taste and smell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Packing and Labeling Study medication (oral Vitamin D and placebo) will be provided by the&#xD;
      hospital pharmacy, labelled and packaged according to Swiss guidelines and EU-GMP guidelines.&#xD;
