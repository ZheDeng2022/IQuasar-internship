      The purpose of the study is to learn more abou how the immune system responds to the&#xD;
      chickenpox vaccine in adults who had never had chickenpox as a child and were then vaccinated&#xD;
      as an adult. The study aims to learn more about the strength and duration of the protection&#xD;
      provided by the vaccine in adults, and to observe the immune response to an additional dose&#xD;
      of chickenpox vaccine in adults who had received the vaccine at least 5 years earlier. This&#xD;
      is especially relevant to workers in a hospital who may be exposed to chickenpox.&#xD;

      The population will be employees who were previously evaluated in the pre-employment phase by&#xD;
      the Occupational Health Clinic (OHC) of Colorado Children's Hospital (CHC) from 2004 until&#xD;
      2009 and were found to be seronegative for varicella antibody at that time and were thus&#xD;
      vaccinated per CHC protocol. Additionally, a matching number of comparator subjects who were&#xD;
      positive for varicella antibody at the pre-employment phase will be selected from the same&#xD;
      pool (2004-2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject participation will last up to 6 months. Subjects will be enrolled into one of two&#xD;
      study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 consisting of 50 subjects who tested seronegative for varicella antibody and&#xD;
           received varicella vaccine to meet employment criteria at least 5 years previously; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 consisting of 50 subjects who had natural varicella infection and thus tested&#xD;
           seropositive for varicella antibody at least 5 years previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 subjects will receive 1 additional dose (lifetime total will be 2 or 3) of varicella&#xD;
      vaccine (Varivax) and participate in a total of 4 study visits over a period of 6 months.&#xD;
      Before receiving the dose of varicella vaccine at Day 1, Group 1 subjects will be given the&#xD;
      CDC Vaccine Information Sheet for varicella vaccine. Study staff will review this with the&#xD;
      subject to assure understanding prior to administering vaccine. Vaccination will occur after&#xD;
      eligibility criteria have been confirmed and completion of a urine pregnancy test -with a&#xD;
      negative result - on females of childbearing potential. Following administration of the&#xD;
      varicella vaccine, the subject will be observed in the clinic for at least 15 minutes for&#xD;
      safety. Blood (60 ml per sample) will be collected from all Group 1 subjects on Day 1&#xD;
      immediately prior to vaccination, and at Day 7(±2), Day 30(±7) and Day 180(±14) in order to&#xD;
      measure VZV-specific antibody, antibody avidity, and cell-mediated immunity by the methods&#xD;
      indicated above. Subjects receiving a third lifetime dose of Varivax will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a diary for 5 days after vaccination to track anticipated and unanticipated&#xD;
      reactions to the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 subjects, the comparator group, will receive no vaccine and will only participate in&#xD;
      the first visit for a blood draw. Blood (60 ml) will be collected from Group 2 participants&#xD;
      only at Day 1. Subject information to be recorded includes age; gender; varicella vaccine&#xD;
      history at the OHC; age vaccinated (calculate interval since vaccination); the number of&#xD;
      doses (1 vs 2) received; and any exposure to varicella or HZ (including involvement in any&#xD;
      CHC outbreak work-up).&#xD;
