      The purpose of this study is to determine whether group visits with added behavioral&#xD;
      activation (BA) for depression will have a greater clinical impact than our standard group&#xD;
      visits without BA for depression in reducing the risk of future coronary events as measured&#xD;
      by the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk engine and depression symptoms&#xD;
      as measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) after 6 months.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Nearly 33% of the 24.5 million people in the US with diabetes mellitus (DM) have&#xD;
      co-morbid depression. Since 65% of patients with DM die from cardiovascular disease (CVD),&#xD;
      concomitant control of CVD risk factors along with glycemic control is crucial to prevent&#xD;
      adverse outcomes. However, co-morbid depression makes DM and CVD risk factors harder to&#xD;
      control. We demonstrated that a pharmacist-led group visit model consisting of: 1)&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy management for DM, hyperlipidemia and hypertension, 2) self-management&#xD;
      education, 3) case management and 4) behavioral strategies for DM and CVD self-care&#xD;
      behaviors, was more efficacious in improving hyperglycemia and CVD risk factors compared to&#xD;
      standard primary care controls in a general DM population and also for patients with DM and&#xD;
      co-morbid depression. For participants with DM and depression there was also a&#xD;
      non-significant trend toward improvement in depression despite the lack of depression&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to determine whether group visits with added behavioral&#xD;
      activation (BA) for depression (cases) will have a greater clinical impact than our standard&#xD;
      group visits without BA for depression (active control) in reducing the risk of future&#xD;
      coronary events as measured by the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk&#xD;
      engine and depression symptoms as measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) after 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PLAN/METHODS: The goal is to conduct a randomized-controlled pilot trial (n=25 in&#xD;
      each arm) to evaluate the clinical effect of added BA to our group intervention in patients&#xD;
      with DM and depression who have a Hemoglobin A1c&gt;=8% and a PHQ-9 depression score &gt;=10 and at&#xD;
      least one additional CVD risk factor such as tobacco use, hyperlipidemia or hypertension not&#xD;
      at American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association guideline recommended goals.&#xD;
      The interventions in both arms will consist of 4 weekly group visits of 2-hour duration&#xD;
      followed by monthly booster group visits for 6 months to prevent relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1) To examine the effects of our group visit model with and without added BA therapy on&#xD;
           the 10-year UKPDS coronary event risk, and PHQ-9 depression scores after 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2) To examine the acceptability and adherence to our group visit model with and without&#xD;
           added BA therapy by way of focus groups and attendance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1) To explore mediating factors of our group visit model with added BA therapy that are&#xD;
           associated with improvement in CVD risk and depression&#xD;
