      Hypothesis: To identify new gene mutations that can be related to patients with idiopathic&#xD;
      male factor infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To detect possible genetic abnormalities in families with more than one&#xD;
      sibling with male infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To evaluate using next generation DNA sequencing in cases of infertility&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infertility involves about 15% of couples who attempt to conceive and the male factor&#xD;
      accounts for about half of the cases. Idiopathic, azoospermia, or oligozoospermia, which may&#xD;
      be genetically based, constitute a significant number of male infertility cases.In the recent&#xD;
      years, there is increasing recognition of the genetic abnormalities as a cause of male&#xD;
      infertility. Genetic factors contribute up to 15 - 30% of male infertility cases. These&#xD;
      abnormalities may be numerical chromosomal abnormality; the most common is Klinefelter&#xD;
      syndrome, or structural e.g. Y-chomosome microdeletion, DNA mutations or mitochondrial DNA&#xD;
      mutations. They account for 5%-10% cases of oligozoospermia, to 15%-25% cases with&#xD;
      non-obstructive azoospermia. In azoospermia, sex chromosome abnormalities are predominant.&#xD;
      However, autosomal structural chromosomal abnormalities are the chief genetic cause of&#xD;
      oligozoospermia and may be balanced or unbalanced. In a substantial proportion of cases (32%&#xD;
      of infertile men, or 1.5% of the male population), the underlying causes are unknown&#xD;
      (idiopathic infertility). While cytogenetic studies have been successful in revealing some&#xD;
      causes most non-obstructive azoospermic men are still idiopathic. They are believed to carry&#xD;
      unknown autosomal mutations based on studies of familial male infertility that often involves&#xD;
      two or more siblings.Regulation of the complex process of spermatogenesis depends on the&#xD;
      cooperation of many genes which are expressed at various stages of differentiation, where&#xD;
      mitotic, meiotic cell divisions, and postmeiotic development finally lead to the spermatozoa.&#xD;
      Identification of genes playing a crucial role in spermatogenesis is mainly based on the&#xD;
      observations of rodents, particularly the mouse model. In humans, such identification remains&#xD;
      largely unavailable because of the difficulty in gaining access to tissue samples from a male&#xD;
      gonad and the limited possibilities of functional verification in humans. Hence the genetic&#xD;
      causes of male infertility have not yet been well recognized. Next-generation sequencing&#xD;
      (NGS) is an effective tool for Mendelian gene identification. So far, more than 30 Mendelian&#xD;
      disease genes have been identified using NGS, including recessive and dominant diseases. NGS&#xD;
      data can also be used to discover linkage and homozygosity intervals, as well as determine&#xD;
      copy number number of specific intervals (Becker et al. 2011, Krawitz et al. 2010). 15, 16&#xD;
      The two major branches of next-generation DNA sequencing are whole-exome (WE) and whole&#xD;
      genome (WG) sequencing. While WGS is more comprehensive and useful for population genetics or&#xD;
      for diseases in which complex non-exonic inheritance is suspected, WES remains a more&#xD;
      powerful, cost-effective tool for detecting rare mutations within a patient population. Our&#xD;
      use of WGS or WES will depend on the nature of the patients recruited for the study. In cases&#xD;
      where depth of coverage requirements are high, WES would be better-suited as it allows for&#xD;
      4-6 exomes to be covered at such depth for the same cost of 1 genome at 30X. This would aid&#xD;
      in sampling rarer alleles within the population and discovering novel mutations in patients&#xD;
      that are not present in their unaffected family members. This is especially useful in cases&#xD;
      of diseases where wide allelic heterogeneity may exist, as patients who test negative for the&#xD;
      most common mutations may have a novel mutation that would otherwise have been undetectable&#xD;
      by traditional methods. Multiple members of the same family may be affected by infertility&#xD;
      with similar or different presentations of testicular failure with different&#xD;
      histopathologies. In the presence of normal karyotyping and Y-chromosome microdeletion, we&#xD;
      are usually left with unknown genetic abnormality. Genetic causes of male factor infertility&#xD;
      can be broadly assumed to be a result of either de novo mutations inherited by the patient&#xD;
      from one of his parents or from polymorphisms circulating in the population. In both cases, a&#xD;
      search for potential genetic causes for infertility must rely on comparison of the DNA&#xD;
      sequence of the patient with a controlled fertile member of his family.&#xD;
