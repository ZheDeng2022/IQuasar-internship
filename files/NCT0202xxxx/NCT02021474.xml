      BACKGROUND Migraine headaches affect more than 28 million persons in the United States&#xD;
      (Foundation). Approximately 25% of women and 9% of men experience migraine headaches&#xD;
      (Rasmussen BK, 1991) (Lipton RB, 1993) (Ramadan NM, 2002). Individuals with migraine&#xD;
      headaches lose an average of 4 to 6 working days each year resulting in a total annual loss&#xD;
      nationwide of 64 to 150 million workdays. It is estimated that the direct and indirect cost&#xD;
      of migraines is nearly $17 billion (Hu XH, 1999) (RK., 1999). Headache is responsible for&#xD;
      approximately 2% of all visits to emergency departments (Goldstein JN, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Migraine headaches are typically described as recurring, unilateral headache with untreated&#xD;
      attacks lasting from 4 to 72 hours. The international headache Society Classification of&#xD;
      Headaches list the following diagnostic requirements for migraine headache: at least two of&#xD;
      the following features: your lateral location, throbbing character, worsening pain with&#xD;
      routine activity, and moderate to severe intensity and at least one of the following&#xD;
      features: nausea and/or vomiting and photophobia and phonophobia (Society, 1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT There is no cure for migraine headaches. The treatments for migraine headaches are&#xD;
      typically divided into non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments. The non-pharmacologic&#xD;
      treatments are designed to target those actions and behaviors known to trigger migraine&#xD;
      headaches. The non-pharmacologic treatments include: regular sleep patterns, regular&#xD;
      exercise, and the avoidance of known triggers. Triggers for migraine headaches can include:&#xD;
      red wine, aged cheeses, exposure to chemical odors i.e. perfumes and cleaners. Non-&#xD;
      pharmacologic therapies also include relaxation training, biofeedback, cognitive - behavioral&#xD;
      therapy, hypnosis, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, cervical manipulation, and&#xD;
      hyperbaric oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacologic treatments for migraine headaches are typically divided into abortive&#xD;
      therapies and prophylactic therapies. The abortive therapies are usually divided into&#xD;
      nonspecific medications used to treat migraines: analgesics/NSAIDS (acetaminophen, aspirin,&#xD;
      ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, ketorolac), and narcotic analgesics (meperidine and butorphanol),&#xD;
      adjunctive therapy (metoclopramide, prochlorperazine). Migraine specific abortive therapies&#xD;
      include ergotamine derivatives (ergotamine, caffeine plus ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) and&#xD;
      the Triptans (Sumatriptan, Naratriptan, Rizatriptan, and Zolmitriptan) (Aukerman, 2002).&#xD;
      Unlike the abortive therapies, which are taken to treat an existing headache, prophylactic&#xD;
      therapies are taken (usually daily) to reduce the frequency and intensity of migraine&#xD;
      headaches. Prophylatic, or preventive medications are generally divided into the first-line&#xD;
      agents and second-line agents. First-line therapies for migraine prophylaxis in adults&#xD;
      include propranolol (Inderal), timolol (Blocadren), amitriptyline, divalproex (Depakote),&#xD;
      sodium valproate, and topiramate (Topamax) (Modi &amp; Lowder, 2006). Agents that could be used&#xD;
      as second-line therapy for migraine prophylaxis in adults (listed by evidence of&#xD;
      effectiveness) include gabapentin (Neurontin), naproxen (Naprosyn) or naproxen sodium&#xD;
      (Anaprox), timed-release dihydroergotamine mesylate (DHE-45), candesartan (Atacand),&#xD;
      lisinopril (Zestril), atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Toprol XL), nadolol (Corgard),&#xD;
      fluoxetine (Prozac), verapamil (Calan), magnesium, vitamin B2 (riboflavin), coenzyme Q10,&#xD;
      hormone therapy (estradiol topical gel [Estrogel]), and botulinum toxin type A (Botox)&#xD;
      injections (Modi &amp; Lowder, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATHOGENESIS OF MIGRAINE Despite extensive research in the area of migraine headaches, the&#xD;
      precise pathogenesis of migraine remains unknown. The list of potential candidates for the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of migraines is extensive. For many years the excepted pathogenesis of migraine&#xD;
      headaches was that they were due to extracerebral vasodilation. This theory proposes that the&#xD;
      auras associated with migraine headache were due to an initial vasoconstriction which is&#xD;
      followed by a vasodilatation of extracerebral vessels which resulted in the pain of a&#xD;
      migraine headache. Others (Blau, 1984) have proposed that migraine is a primary neurological&#xD;
      disturbance with secondary vasomotor changes. Migraine is likely a multi-genic condition with&#xD;
      a complex pathophysiology in which both central and peripheral components of trigeminal pain&#xD;
      pathway play a role in the signs and symptoms. In the past two decades the trigeminal&#xD;
      vascular system (TVS) has been proposed as a possible component of migraine attacks. Nitric&#xD;
      oxide has also been proposed as a potential mechanism for migraines, supported by the&#xD;
      production of typical migraine headaches in migraneurs treated with nitroglycerin (NTG).&#xD;
      5-hydroooxytryptamine (5-HT) has been implicated in migraine pathophysiology. The role for&#xD;
      5-HT metabolism in migraine is supported by a low central 5-HT disposition associated with&#xD;
      increase in 5-HT release during an attack (Panconesi, 2008). Weir and Cader (2011) have&#xD;
      proposed that channelopaties may play a role in migraine headaches, especially those with a&#xD;
      genetic association. Cortical spreading depression has been implicated as a cause for&#xD;
      migraine aura (Weir 2011). The Neurogenic inflammation (NI) theory proposes that,&#xD;
      vasodilation and plasma protein extravasation in tissue receiving trigeminal innervation&#xD;
      occurs when vasoactive peptides are released from nerve endings (Buzzi, 2005). Burstein, et&#xD;
      al., 2011 has proposed that peripheral sensitization is a major contributor to&#xD;
      hypersensitivity in many painful syndromes including migraine headaches. In this state&#xD;
      primary afferent nociceptive neurons exhibit increased responsiveness to external stimuli at&#xD;
      the original site of inflammation or injury. A large number of chemical mediators produced at&#xD;
      a site of inflammation or tissue injury can promote excitation and sensitization of&#xD;
      nociceptors. These chemical mediators include bradykinin, histamine, serotonin (5-HT), and&#xD;
      prostaglandins. Cytokines (interleukins 1, 6 and 8 [IL-1, IL-6, IL-8] and tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor alpha [TNF-alpha]) are inflammatory mediators known to promote peripheral&#xD;
      sensitization (Burstein, et al., 2011). Central sensitization which occurs in two distinct&#xD;
      phases, the initiation phase and the maintenance phase may play a role in migraine headache.&#xD;
      This sensitization is mediated by the excitatory amino acid glutamate and neuropeptides such&#xD;
      as substance P and neurotrophic factors. The enhanced neuronal excitability in central&#xD;
      sensitization involves the phosphorylation of intracellular and extracellular kinases and the&#xD;
      enhanced production of cyclooxygenase. The list of chemical mediators involved in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of migraine is extensive. The scientific investigations required to elucidate&#xD;
      the exact mechanisms responsible for migraine headaches continues as an important part of&#xD;
      ongoing clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLUCOSE METABOLISM AND MIGRAINE The relationship between migraine headaches and hunger is an&#xD;
      accepted and well documented phenomenon. Missing meals can precipitate or trigger a migraine&#xD;
      in susceptible individuals. Shaw et al., 1977 showed that migraine patients had impaired&#xD;
      tolerance to glucose during migraine attacks compared with control studies. There was an&#xD;
      elevation of plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels during the migraine attacks. Growth hormone&#xD;
      and cortisol were elevated and insulin was depressed during attacks. Patients with migraine&#xD;
      have impaired insulin sensitivity (Rainero, et al., 2005). During the oral glucose tolerance&#xD;
      test (OGTT), glucose plasma concentrations were significantly higher in migraineurs than in&#xD;
      controls. Insulin sensitivity (measured by ISI-stumvoll and OGIS-180 indexes) was&#xD;
      significantly altered in migraine. Cavestro et al. (2007) reported that headache patients had&#xD;
      elevated blood glucose levels when compared to controls. They also documented that insulin&#xD;
      levels were elevated in migraineurs when compared to control patients and other headache&#xD;
      patients. Additional studies are needed to explore the role of impaired glucose metabolism in&#xD;
      migraine including the role that glucose metabolism may play in the development of new&#xD;
      therapies for migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROLE OF HISTAMINE IN MIGRAINE In 2003, Gazerani, et al. demonstrated a correlation between&#xD;
      migraine, histamine, and immunoglobulin E. Serum samples were collected (for histamine levels&#xD;
      and Immunoglobulin E levels) from 70 patients (18 - 58 years) with migraine during an attack&#xD;
      and during remission and from 45 healthy volunteers. The migraine patients were divided into&#xD;
      two groups according to their history of allergies (60% having a history of allergies and 40%&#xD;
      without a history of allergies). Plasma histamine levels were significantly elevated (P ≤&#xD;
      0.0001) in patients with migraine both during symptom-free periods (Error! Reference source&#xD;
      not found.) and during migraine events (Error! Reference source not found.) when compared to&#xD;
      the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RATIONALE FOR THE USE OF STUDY DRUG IN THE TREATMENT OF STUDY DISEASE In 1991, Guerrero,&#xD;
           et al. carried out an initial study that provided evidence for the beneficial effects of&#xD;
           histamine in migraine prophylaxis (Millan-Guerrero RO, 1999). Their data showed that&#xD;
           subcutaneous administration of low doses (1-10 ng) of histamine induced significant&#xD;
           relief from migraine symptoms, with no secondary effects. The possible mechanisms of&#xD;
           histamine migraine prophylaxis, can be explained by histamine control of mast cells; the&#xD;
           antidromic stimulation of trigeminal nerve endings induces the release of substance P&#xD;
           and other neuromodulatory peptides, which in turn stimulate the release of histamine&#xD;
           from mast cells. In meningeal blood vessels, activation of H1-receptors by histamine,&#xD;
           results in vasodilatation and plasma protein extravasation, causing neurogenic&#xD;
           inflammation (Akerman S, 2002). Krabbe and Olesen (Krabbe AA, 1980) and Lassen et al.&#xD;
           (Lassen LH, 1995) showed that on migrainous subjects, intravenous administration of&#xD;
           relatively high doses of histamine (0.5 mg/kg per minute for 20 min) caused an immediate&#xD;
           headache during the infusion, followed by a delayed migraine attack which was abolished&#xD;
           by pre-treatment with the H1-R antagonist, mepyramine. However, degranulation of mast&#xD;
           cells and neuropeptide release from C fiber endings are inhibited by the histamine at&#xD;
           low-concentration interaction with H3-receptors (H3-R), and probably reflects a local&#xD;
           feedback circuit between C-fiber nerve endings and mast cells, which control neurogenic&#xD;
           inflammation (Dimitriadou V, 1994) (Arrang J-M, 1983) (Arrang J-M G. M.-C., 1987)&#xD;
           (Placeholder21). Guerrero, et al. proposed that the administration of low doses of&#xD;
           histamine, to achieve and maintain low-circulating concentrations, may lead to a&#xD;
           selective interaction of histamine with H3-R. Histamine could constitute a new&#xD;
           therapeutic drug in migraine prophylaxis that acts by limiting the excessive&#xD;
           inflammatory response involved in migraine pathophysiology.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients of any race, 18 to 65 years of age inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a history of migraine (with or without aura) according to the Headache&#xD;
             Classification Committee of the IHS. Migraine attacks have to have had an onset before&#xD;
             age 50 and have to have been present for at least 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with 4-20 qualified migraine attacks per month over the past three months&#xD;
             prior to Screening, as well as during the four weeks of the Baseline Phase will be&#xD;
             eligible for entry into this study. The interval between two qualified migraine&#xD;
             attacks should be at least 24 hours to be counted as distinct migraine attacks. A&#xD;
             qualified migraine attack without aura is defined as a headache that lasts 4-72 hours&#xD;
             (if untreated or unsuccessfully treated) or if successfully treated. This attack has&#xD;
             at least two of the following characteristics: unilateral location, pulsating quality,&#xD;
             moderate or severe intensity that inhibits or prohibits daily activities or&#xD;
             aggravation by routine physical activities such as walking up stairs. In addition, at&#xD;
             least one of the following symptoms must be present during the headache: nausea,&#xD;
             vomiting, or photophobia and phonophobia. A qualified migraine attack with aura must&#xD;
             fulfill the same criteria as the headache attack, plus have an associated aura as&#xD;
             defined by the Migraine Criteria of the Headache Classification Committee of the&#xD;
             International Headache Society. An aura alone that requires acute migraine treatment&#xD;
             will also be considered a migraine attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Male and female patients will be eligible for enrollment. Females should be either of&#xD;
             non-childbearing potential by reason of surgery, radiation, menopause (one year post&#xD;
             onset), or of childbearing potential and practicing a medically acceptable method of&#xD;
             contraception (eg, abstinence, a barrier method plus spermicide, or IUD) for at least&#xD;
             one month before study randomization and for two months after the end of the study,&#xD;
             and have a negative serum B-hCG at Screening. Pregnant and/or lactating females are&#xD;
             excluded. Those women using hormonal contraceptives must also be using an additional&#xD;
             approved method of contraception (eg, a barrier method plus spermicide, or IUD)&#xD;
