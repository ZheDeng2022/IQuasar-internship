      The aim of this study is to develop and follow a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
      (HIV)-infected adults who are starting HIV drugs at health facilities in Kenya. Blood and&#xD;
      urine samples will be collected from all participants in order to establish a sample bank of&#xD;
      samples in order to further the understanding of the levels of inﬂammatory biomarkers and&#xD;
      coagulation biomarkers in African patients and the effect of taking HIV drugs on these&#xD;
      biomarkers. This study will enroll and follow 685 men and women who are starting HIV drugs&#xD;
      and collect blood and urine specimens from them at 4 study visits. These samples will be&#xD;
      frozen and stored for future testing related to inﬂammatory and coagulation biomarkers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biomarkers have been investigated as predictors of HIV disease progression, i.e. development&#xD;
      of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) deﬁning diagnoses or death. There are limited&#xD;
      data on the levels of these biomarkers among HIV-infected individuals in sub Saharan Africa&#xD;
      and on the effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation on these levels. In addition,&#xD;
      further work is needed to examine the association between such markers and various&#xD;
      complications associated with HIV as well as mortality in sub Saharan Africa. The overall aim&#xD;
      of this study is to develop a cohort of HIV-infected adults who are initiating ART at health&#xD;
      facilities in Kenya and to establish a sample bank of plasma and urine samples in order to&#xD;
      further the understanding of the levels of inﬂammatory biomarkers (IBM) and coagulation&#xD;
      biomarkers (CBM) in African patients and the effect of ART initiation on these biomarkers.&#xD;
      The study objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To recruit, establish and follow a cohort of HIV-infected individuals who are eligible&#xD;
           for initiation of ART through 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain blood and urine samples on all cohort participants at baseline, months 2, 6,&#xD;
           and 12 for future HIV and related research&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the demographic and disease characteristics of cohort participants and&#xD;
           associations with various biomarkers&#xD;

    <description>The study will be a prospective cohort study of HIV-infected adults initiating ART at 4-8 health facilities in Nyanza Province, Kenya. Participants will be asked to take part in four visits over a 12 month period.&#xD;
At each study visit, participants will be asked questions related to demographic characteristics, medical history, including history of/recent medical conditions, family medical history, TB history and smoking status. Participants will also have their height (at baseline visit only) and weight measured for calculation of BMI and blood pressure reading. Blood and urine specimens will be collected and stored at each study visit for future testing.</description>
