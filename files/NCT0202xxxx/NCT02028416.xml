  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acquired Aplastic anemia is one of the most frequent reason of bone marrow failure in East&#xD;
      (Pakistan).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first treatment option is Allogenic Bone Marrow transplantation which is an&#xD;
           expansive treatment option and also require a full matched HLA identical donor, hence&#xD;
           hardly 25% of our affected patients get opportunity for BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second line treatment option caters a large chunk of patients (severe and non-severe&#xD;
           AA) along with those who lack HLA identical donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously many protocols had been used in past for ATG+CsA Treatment, this treatment&#xD;
      protocol especially addresses the two different regimens of ATG to study its efficacy,&#xD;
      durability and long-term effects. Following doses would be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CsA+ATG @ 10mg/kg for 3 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CsA+ATG @ 10mg/kg for 5 days&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aplastic Anaemia (AA) is characterized by pancytopenia with hypo-cellular bone marrow in the&#xD;
      absence of dysplasia, infiltration or fibrosis. The recommended first-line treatment options&#xD;
      include Allogenic Bone Marrow Transplantation with HLA matched sibling donor. However, due to&#xD;
      non-availability HLA matched identical sibling donor or due to other co-morbids and age,&#xD;
      second choice of treatment is Anti Thymocyte Globulin (ATG) and Cyclosporin (CsA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rabbit ATG (Fresenius) has never been tested for the treatment of aplastic anaemia in&#xD;
      Pakistani population before. We propose this investigator initiated trial which will will&#xD;
      compare two different protocols of Rabbit ATG-Fresenius, 10mg/kg for 3 days and 10mg/kg for 5&#xD;
      days along with CsA in Pakistani patients suffering from AA. The subjects will be Non-severe&#xD;
      (NSAA) and severe AA (SAA) who are not the eligible candidate for Allogenic Bone Marrow&#xD;
      Transplantation. Patients will be randomized into two equal arms with same biological&#xD;
      characteristics. Both arms will be treated with ATG-Fresenius and CsA in same doses with two&#xD;
      different duration of treatment. They will later continue with CsA for at least 12 months and&#xD;
      if response achieved, will be tapered more slowly over next 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point is to document the number of doses required by each of the two dose&#xD;
      schedule to produce a response, achieve a nadir absolute lymphocyte count of 200 cmm.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are short term safety of ATG-Fresenius, change in absolute neutrophil&#xD;
      count from the baseline in both arms, change in platelet count from the baseline, change in&#xD;
      absolute reticulocyte count, Number of blood units required till 8 weeks and 26 weeks, Number&#xD;
      of platelet doses required till 8 weeks and 26 weeks, relapse, response rates at 6 and 12&#xD;
      months, clonal evolution to PNH, myelodysplasia or acute leukaemia. Long-course CsA will be&#xD;
      assessed separately for its efficacy in reducing late events of relapse and evolution by&#xD;
      comparison to historical control data.&#xD;
