  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled study. The study&#xD;
      was planned to provide key efficacy and safety data for the approval of roxadustat in the&#xD;
      treatment of anemia associated with CKD. Participants assigned to roxadustat treatment were&#xD;
      administered roxadustat orally as a combination of tablets of different strengths.&#xD;
      Participants assigned to darbepoetin alfa treatment were administered darbepoetin alfa&#xD;
      subcutaneously or intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consisted of 3 study periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening period: up to 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment period: 104 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 12 to 28</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline assessment was defined as the value on day 1. The EQ-5D-5L is a self-reported questionnaire, used as a measure of respondents' health related quality of life (HRQoL) and utility values. The EQ-5D consists of the descriptive system and the VAS. The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems. The VAS records the respondent's self rated health status on a graduated (0-100) scale, where the endpoints are labeled 'best imaginable health state' and 'worst imaginable health state' with higher scores for higher HRQoL.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants of ≥ 18 years of age with a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, with kidney disease outcomes quality initiative stage 3, 4 or 5, anaemic and not receiving dialysis; with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 60 milliliter per minute per 1.73 meter square (mL/min/1.73 m^2) were enrolled in this study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to roxadustat or darbepoetin alfa. Randomization was stratified by 4 factors: region, screening hemoglobin (Hb) values (Hb ≤ 8.0 g/dL versus &gt; 8.0 g/dL), history of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or thromboembolic diseases and screening eGFR (&lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 versus ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 ).</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants received roxadustat orally according to the tiered weight-based approach, with starting dose of 70 milligram (mg) given three times weekly (TIW) to participants weighing between 45 kilogram (kg) up to 70 kg and 100 mg given TIW to participants weighing more than 70 kg up to 160 kg. Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of ≥ 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline of ≥ 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

        <description>Baseline SF-36 PF was defined as the SF-36 PF value on Day 1.The SF-36 is a Quality of Life (QoL) instrument designed to assess generic health concepts relevant across age, disease, and treatment groups. The SF-36 contains 36 items that measured eight scales: (1) physical functioning; (2) role limitations due to physical health problems; (3) bodily pain; (4) social functioning; (5) general health perceptions; (6) role limitations due to emotional problems; (7) vitality, energy or fatigue; and (8) mental health. Each scale is transformed into 0-100 score, with higher scores indicating better health status. The SF-36 PF consisted of 11 questions that focused on health and ability to do usual activities, with higher scores indicating better health status.</description>

Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of &gt;= 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline of &gt;= 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

        <description>Participants were analyzed during the efficacy emergent period. The efficacy emergent period was defined as the evaluation period from the analysis date of first dose intake up to EOT Visit or last non-missing Hb assessment (for participants who died during the treatment period). For participants who had experienced more than one RBC transfusion, only their first event was used. Data reported was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier estimate for cumulative proportion and the 95% confidence interval was calculated with Greenwood's formula.

        <description>Participants were analyzed during the efficacy emergent period. The efficacy emergent period was defined as the evaluation period from the analysis date of first dose intake up to EOT Visit or last non-missing Hb assessment (for participants who died during the treatment period). For participants who had received more than one IV iron, only their first event following study treatment was used. Data reported was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier estimate for cumulative proportion and the 95% confidence interval was calculated with Greenwood's formula.

Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

        <description>Baseline SF-36 PCS was defined as the SF-36 PCS value on day 1.The SF-36 is a QoL instrument designed to assess generic health concepts relevant across age, disease, and treatment groups. The SF-36 contains 36 items that measured eight scales: (1) physical functioning; (2) role limitations due to physical health problems; (3) bodily pain; (4) social functioning; (5) general health perceptions; (6) role limitations due to emotional problems; (7) vitality, energy or fatigue; and (8) mental health. Each scale is transformed into 0-100 score, with higher scores indicating better health status. The PCS was calculated based on all 8 scales and ranged from 5.02-79.78. For each of these above scales, higher scores always indicated better health status.</description>

Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of &gt;= 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline of &gt;= 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

          <description>Baseline FACT-An AnS was defined as the FACT-An AnS value on day 1. Together with the functional assessment of cancer therapy - general (FACT-G), the AnS is referred to as the FACT-An Total. The AnS scale contains 13 fatigue specific items (the fatigue score) plus 7 items related to anemia. The Anemia AnS score range is 0 to 80. Higher scores indicated better QoL.</description>

        <description>Baseline assessment was defined as the value on day 1. The EQ-5D-5L is a self-reported questionnaire, used as a measure of respondents' health related quality of life (HRQoL) and utility values. The EQ-5D consists of the descriptive system and the VAS. The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems. The VAS records the respondent's self rated health status on a graduated (0-100) scale, where the endpoints are labeled 'best imaginable health state' and 'worst imaginable health state' with higher scores for higher HRQoL.</description>

            <description>Participants received roxadustat orally according to the tiered weight-based approach, with starting dose of 70 mg given TIW to participants weighing between 45 kg up to 70 kg and 100 mg given TIW to participants weighing more than 70 kg up to 160 kg. Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of &gt;= 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline of &gt;= 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

            <description>Participants received roxadustat orally according to the tiered weight-based approach, with starting dose of 70 mg given TIW to participants weighing between 45 kg up to 70 kg and 100 mg given TIW to participants weighing more than 70 kg up to 160 kg. Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of &gt;= 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline of &gt;= 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Each Scheduled Measurement in Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c)</title>
        <description>Percentage of change from baseline to each study visit were calculated for HbA1c. Baseline assessment was assessment from Day 1 visit. If baseline value was missing, the value from screening visit was used. In case of missing data, no imputation rules were applied.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 12, 28, 36, 44, 60, 84, 104 and EOS (up to 108 weeks)</time_frame>

            <title>Roxadustat</title>
            <description>Participants received roxadustat orally according to the tiered weight-based approach, with starting dose of 70 mg given TIW to participants weighing between 45 kg up to 70 kg and 100 mg given TIW to participants weighing more than 70 kg up to 160 kg. Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of &gt;= 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline of &gt;= 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

            <title>Darbepoetin Alfa</title>
            <description>Participants received initial dose of darbepoetin alfa based upon the weight [either 0.45 mcg/kg of body weight, as a single subcutaneous or IV injection once weekly or 0.75 mcg/kg of body weight, as a single subcutaneous injection once every 2 weeks] as per EU SmPC along with IV iron supplementation according to the standard of care. Dose-adjustment was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of &gt;= 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline of &gt;= 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which darbepoetin alfa dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL.

            <description>Participants received roxadustat orally according to the tiered weight-based approach, with starting dose of 70 mg given TIW to participants weighing between 45 kg up to 70 kg and 100 mg given TIW to participants weighing more than 70 kg up to 160 kg. Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of &gt;= 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline of &gt;= 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

            <description>Participants received roxadustat orally according to the tiered weight-based approach, with starting dose of 70 mg given TIW to participants weighing between 45 kg up to 70 kg and 100 mg given TIW to participants weighing more than 70 kg up to 160 kg. Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of &gt;= 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline of &gt;= 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

            <description>Participants received initial dose of darbepoetin alfa based upon the weight [either 0.45 mcg/kg of body weight, as a single subcutaneous or IV injection once weekly or 0.75 mcg/kg of body weight, as a single subcutaneous injection once every 2 weeks] as per EU SmPC along with IV iron supplementation according to the standard of care. Dose-adjustment was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of &gt;= 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline of &gt;= 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which darbepoetin alfa dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL.

        <description>Annualized eGFR slope over time was estimated by a random slopes and intercepts model using all available eGFR values (one baseline and all post-treatment values up to EOT period or start of dialysis adjusted on baseline Hb, region, CV history at baseline and the interaction terms (baseline eGFR by timepoint and baseline Hb by timepoint). All assessments collected after initiation of dialysis (acute or chronic) were excluded from the analysis. Baseline assessment was the assessment from day 1 visit.

Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of &gt;= 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline of &gt;= 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL.

Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of &gt;= 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline of &gt;= 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

        <description>For participants who had doubled their serum creatinine or had chronic dialysis or renal transplant more than once, only their first occurrence during safety emergent period was used. The safety emergent period was defined as the evaluation period from the analysis date of first drug intake up to 28 days after the end of treatment taking into account the different dosing frequencies of the study treatments. Data reported was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier estimate for cumulative proportion and the 95% confidence interval was calculated with Greenwood's formula.

        <description>For participants who had at least 40% decrease in eGFR from baseline, chronic dialysis or renal transplant during the safety emergent period, only their first occurrence was used. The safety emergent period was defined as the evaluation period from the analysis date of first drug intake up to 28 days after the end of treatment taking into account the different dosing frequencies of the study treatments. Data reported was analyzed by kaplan-meier estimate for cumulative proportion and the 95% confidence interval was calculated with Greenwood's formula.</description>

          <description>Participants received roxadustat orally according to the tiered weight-based approach, with starting dose of 70 mg given TIW to participants weighing between 45 kg up to 70 kg and 100 mg given TIW to participants weighing more than 70 kg up to 160 kg. Dose-titration was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of ≥ 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline of ≥ 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which roxadustat dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL. Participants received roxadustat for up to a maximum of 104 weeks.</description>

Dose-adjustment was performed based upon regular measurement of Hb levels until participants achieved central Hb value of ≥ 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline of ≥ 1.0 g/dL at two consecutive study visits, separated by at least 5 days. Once target Hb level was reached participants entered maintenance period during which darbepoetin alfa dosage was adjusted every 4 weeks to maintain participants Hb level within the target range of 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL.
