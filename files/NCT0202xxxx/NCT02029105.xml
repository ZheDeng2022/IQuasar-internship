    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators analyzed the efficiencies of hyaluronan, osteopontin,&#xD;
      C-ERC/mesothelin, N-ERC/mesothelin and syndecan-1 serum levels, both individually and in&#xD;
      combination, in distinguishing malignant pleural mesothelioma patients from patients with&#xD;
      metastatic malignant pleural diseases, benign pleural diseases, and benign asbestos pleurisy.&#xD;

      In the year 2002, a database for the pleural diseases was constructed to be prospectively&#xD;
      filled in the department. The findings, outcome features and characteristics of follow-up for&#xD;
      all cases with pleural diseases have been recorded in this database. The patient data,&#xD;
      including epidemiological characteristics, smoking status, history of other diseases and&#xD;
      co-morbid conditions, previous asbestos exposure, medications and additional physical and&#xD;
      radiological examination findings, including computed tomography scans, both serum and&#xD;
      pleural fluid laboratory investigational data and indications of invasive procedures, were&#xD;
      recorded in the database mentioned above. The methods employed in the diagnosis of patients;&#xD;
      any complications; characteristics such as the stages of diseases, treatments, and course of&#xD;
      treatments; and results were also recorded in the database. From the date of the first&#xD;
      database establishment, a &quot;tissue, blood, serum, and fluid specimen bank&quot; was constructed;&#xD;
      tissue, blood, serum and pleural fluid samples of patients, which had been taken at the&#xD;
      beginning of diagnosis process, were stored in this bank at -80°C. The blood, serum, and&#xD;
      pleural fluid samples of patients were stored during the diagnosis process, and if conducted,&#xD;
      pleural tissue samples taken during invasive procedures were also stocked.&#xD;

    <measure>Serum N-ERC/mesothelin, C-ERC/mesothelin, hyaluronan, osteopontin and syndecan -1 level in the patients with mesothelioma, metastatic malignant pleural diseases, benign pleural diseases, and benign asbestos pleurisy.</measure>
    <time_frame>From January 2004 to December 2010</time_frame>
    <description>The levels of N-ERC/mesothelin, C-ERC/mesothelin, hyaluronan, osteopontin, and syndecan-1 in the serum samples were established by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) at the Division of Pathology, Department of LABMED, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.&#xD;
All analyses were performed in duplicate by researchers who were unaware of the patient diagnoses. The human N-ERC/mesothelin and osteopontin. ELISA kits were supplied by Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co. Ltd. Japan; the C-ERC/mesothelin ELISA kit was supplied by (MESOMARK™) FDI Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc.; the hyaluronan ELISA kit (Ref. 029-001) was supplied by Corgenix company; and the syndecan-1 ELISA kit (catalog no. 950.640.096) was supplied by the Diaclone company. Analyses were conducted using a sensitivity TM XS Microplate Sample Processor manufactured by Bio-Tek Instruments Inc (Vermont, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The C-ERC/mesothelin levels were determined at nanomolar levels due</description>
