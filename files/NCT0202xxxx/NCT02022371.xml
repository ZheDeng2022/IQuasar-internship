      The purpose of this study is to carry out very detailed genetic testing on prostate cancer&#xD;
      cells. The reason to do this is because researchers do not fully understand&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How prostate cancer develops&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Why some cancer cells spread and others do not&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Why some cancer cells respond to treatment and others do not&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers and doctors know that 1 in 3 of the male population over the age of 50 has cancer&#xD;
      cells in their prostate. However, most of these men will never know they have it and it will&#xD;
      not affect their quality of life or their life expectancy. However, some cancers can be&#xD;
      aggressive. These are more likely to spread outside of the prostate and cause problems.&#xD;
      Doctors do not have an accurate way to tell the difference between aggressive cancer and&#xD;
      those which will not cause any problems. Even within one prostate some tumours are aggressive&#xD;
      and others do not cause a problem during the lifetime of a patient. In fact, even within one&#xD;
      tumour, different cells may behave differently. In other words, one part of the tumour may be&#xD;
      aggressive and spread, whilst another part of the same tumour does not. This project will try&#xD;
      to find out more about what makes different tumours and different parts of the same tumour&#xD;
      aggressive or harmless.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to find out what makes some cancer cells spread and others stay where they&#xD;
      are. For the investigators to do this they need to collect fresh samples of cancer tissue&#xD;
      from the prostate and from different areas of a tumour within the prostate. This is because&#xD;
      biopsies used to diagnose or exclude cancer by the hospital laboratory are not good enough to&#xD;
      give investigators detailed genetic information. These biopsies have been put into a chemical&#xD;
      called formalin which reduces the quality of the genetic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are therefore asking patients who are undergoing prostate biopsies as part of&#xD;
      their normal care to allow them to take additional biopsies for the purpose of this study.&#xD;
      This may be the first time patients are having biopsies. Or, patients may be having biopsies&#xD;
      after treatment that has been given for the cancer and the doctors are concerned the&#xD;
      treatment is not working.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a genetic disease, caused by mutations in genes that lead to increased cell&#xD;
      proliferation and survival. Importantly, the genetic changes vary dramatically between&#xD;
      individual prostate cancer patients and the specific combination of mutations within a&#xD;
      patient's cancer is thought to determine tumour aggressiveness and clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personalized medicine approaches aim to decipher the genetic code of a patient's tumour in&#xD;
      order to identify cancers which will behave aggressively and need treatment. However,&#xD;
      extensive intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH) has been discovered in several solid tumour types,&#xD;
      complicating the identification of the relevant genetic changes as they may not be present&#xD;
      throughout the entire tumour and are likely to be missed by tumour biopsies. ITH is thus a&#xD;
      major hurdle for the implementation of personalized cancer treatment approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have developed genetic technologies that allow them to measure ITH in solid&#xD;
      tumours and they now want to apply these to patients with prostate cancer to define the&#xD;
      extent and the clinical importance of ITH in this disease which is currently unknown. This&#xD;
      will involve looking at the control of genes in the cancer cells which make some tumours more&#xD;
      aggressive than others. This may help in predicting which tumours are important and need to&#xD;
      be targeted and those that could be left so that too much tissue damage does not occur as a&#xD;
      result of therapy. Finding out why some cancer cells spread and others do not may also help&#xD;
      to identify novel molecular targets that could be used to prevent the development of&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with suspected prostate cancer usually have scans and then prostate biopsies. These&#xD;
      biopsies are needed by the pathologist to make a proper diagnosis and cannot be used for full&#xD;
      genetic analysis. So, investigators will ask patients whether they would be willing to give&#xD;
      some extra samples of tissue while undergoing these routine biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defining ITH in prostate cancer will provide important insights into the genetics of prostate&#xD;
      cancer development and metastatic progression and is a key prerequisite for the development&#xD;
      of reliable personalized cancer medicine approaches. Thus this study will significantly&#xD;
      advance researchers' efforts to predict which tumours are dangerous and in need of urgent&#xD;
      treatment and those that could safely be left untreated which would spare these patients the&#xD;
      unnecessary side effects. Investigators think that this research work will have a major&#xD;
      impact on the use of next generation sequencing in the management of prostate cancer through&#xD;
      an in-depth understanding of how common are differences between and within individual cancer&#xD;
      lesions. Investigators also want to find out whether these differences, if they exist, are&#xD;
      important in tumour development and spread to other areas. Investigators think that the&#xD;
      characterization of these differences will allow them to successfully use this information to&#xD;
      group patients undergoing treatment using molecular 'signatures' so that treatment is&#xD;
      targeted rather than applied in a 'sledge-hammer' approach. Investigators believe that&#xD;
      without studies like PROGENY, doctors will instead rely on data from single tumour biopsies&#xD;
      which can be misleading since single biopsies may not have sampled the most aggressive tumour&#xD;
      area. Finally, investigators think that PROGENY will reveal how prostate cancers evolve over&#xD;
      time and which of these changes lead to metastases and ultimately kill the patient. These are&#xD;
      called phylogenetic studies and will help work out the main (or 'trunk') genomic changes from&#xD;
      later events in 'branches'. This may allow researchers to focus their drug discovery efforts&#xD;
      on the common 'trunk' genomic changes.&#xD;
