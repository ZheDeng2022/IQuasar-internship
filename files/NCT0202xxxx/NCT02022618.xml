      Objectives: To analyze the influence on the presence of target organ damage renal, cardiac&#xD;
      and vascular of peripheral and central blood pressure, retinal vessels caliber, oxidative&#xD;
      stress and polymorphisms of genes VAV-2-3 in hypertensive subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: A cross- sectional design we will performed . Population: 486 hypertensive&#xD;
      patients. Target organ damage will be assessed by tests recommended in 2013 European&#xD;
      guidelines of hypertension. Blood pressure office and ambulatory, retinal caliber&#xD;
      vassels,oxidative stress and polymorphisms VAL -2-3 will be measurement.&#xD;

      Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM): The ABPM will be performed on a day of standard&#xD;
      activity, with an adequate cuff for the size of the patient's arm. A control system,&#xD;
      SpaceLabs 90207 model (Spacelabs Healthcare, Issaquah, Washington, USA), validated according&#xD;
      to the protocol of the British Hypertension Society, will be used [57]. The records in which&#xD;
      the percentage of valid readings will be 80% of the total and with valid readings at all&#xD;
      times were considered to be valid. Furthermore, for the records to be evaluable, at least 14&#xD;
      measurements will be required during the daytime period, or at least seven during the&#xD;
      nightime or rest period. The monitor will be scheduled for obtaining blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements every 20 min during the daytime period and every 30 min during the rest period.&#xD;
      The average and dispersion estimators of SBP and DBP were calculated during the 24-h, daytime&#xD;
      and nightime periods, defined based on the diary reported by the patient. The patient&#xD;
      completes a form specifying bedtime and wake-up time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) and Home arterial stiffness index (HASI): Arterial&#xD;
      stiffness will be evaluated by the ambulatory and home arterial stiffness indices (AASI and&#xD;
      HASI). For AASI and HASI estimation, the regression slope of diastolic on systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure will be computed for each individual on the basis of 24-hour ABPM (AASI) and also&#xD;
      HASI readings over 6 days. AASI as well as HASI were defined as one minus the respective&#xD;
      regression slope of DBP on SBP [58]. AASI will also computed from waking or sleeping blood&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of retinal vessels: Retinography will be performed using a Topcon TRC NW 200&#xD;
      nonmydriatic retinal camera (Topcon Europe B.C., Capelle a/d Ijssel, The Netherlands),&#xD;
      obtaining nasal and temporal images centered on the disk. The nasal image with the centered&#xD;
      disk will be loaded into the developed software, AV Index calculator (Ciclorisk SL,&#xD;
      Salamanca, Spain, registry no. 00/2011/589). The software automatically recognizes the disk&#xD;
      and draws two external concentric circles which delimit area A, between 0 and 0.5 disk&#xD;
      diameters from the optic disk margin, and area B, between 0.5 and 1 disk diameters from the&#xD;
      margin. The software first identifies the limits of the different vessels, after which it&#xD;
      automatically recognizes arteries and veins, and makes multiple measurements of the diameter&#xD;
      of the section of the vessels circulating through area B. It finally estimates the mean&#xD;
      caliber of veins and arteries in mm, and these measurements are summarized as an&#xD;
      arteriole-venule ratio, AVIx. An AVIx of 1.0 suggests that arteriolar diameters will be on&#xD;
      average the same as venular diameters in that eye, whereas a smaller AVR suggests narrower&#xD;
      arterioles. We used the pairs of main vessels in the upper and lower temporal quadrants,&#xD;
      rejecting all other vessels, to improve reliability and increase efficiency of the process,&#xD;
      analyzing measures for each quadrant separately and together to estimate the mean measure in&#xD;
      each eye. [64].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory:Determining the concentration of superoxide and catecholamines (adrenaline and&#xD;
      noradrenaline) in plasma and urine anion will be determined by ELISA (CatCombi ELISA, IBL,&#xD;
      Deventer, The Netherlands), following the manufacturers instructions. Superoxide dismutase&#xD;
      activity in plasma will be also assessed using ELISA kits (Cu-Zn superoxid-dismutase ELISA,&#xD;
      IBL), and the urinary excretion and plasma levels of lipid peroxides by measuring products&#xD;
      react with thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) (OxiSelect TBARS Assay Kit, Cell Biolabs, Inc., San&#xD;
      Diego, CA 92126).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a sample of DNA from peripheral blood erythrocyte polymorphisms of VAV and VAV-2-3 genes&#xD;
      in all study subjects are studied. To this end, 10cc of venous blood obtained with&#xD;
      anticoagulant (EDTA: ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal assessment: The kidney damage will be assessed by measuring creatinine plasma&#xD;
      concentration, the glomerular filtration rate was estimated by CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney&#xD;
      Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) [59] and the MDRD-IDMS (Modification of Diet in Renal&#xD;
      Disease-Isotopic Dilution Mass Spectrometry) [60] equation and proteinuria were assessed by&#xD;
      the albumin/creatinine ratio following the 2007 European Society of Hypertension/European&#xD;
      Society of Cardiology Guidelines criteria [2]. Subclinical organ damage was defined as plasma&#xD;
      creatinine between 1.3 - 1.5 mg/dl in men and 1.2 - 1.4 mg/dl in women, glomerular filtration&#xD;
      rate below 60 ml/min or albumin/creatinine ratio &gt; 22 mg/gr in men and 31 mg/ gr in women.&#xD;
      Renal disease was defined as plasma creatinine of 1.5 mg/dl or higher in men and 1.4 mg/l in&#xD;
      women or albumin/creatinine ratio &gt; 300 mg/24 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac assessment: The electrocardiographic examination will be performed with a General&#xD;
      Electric MAC 3.500 ECG System (Niskayuna, New York, USA), that measures automatically the&#xD;
      voltage and duration of waves and estimates the criteria of the Cornell voltage-duration&#xD;
      product (Cornell VDP) [61] to assess the LVH by the following equation: Men ((RaVL + SV3) *&#xD;
      QRS) and women ((RaVL + SV3) * QRS + 6). LVH will be defined as the voltage-duration product&#xD;
      &gt; 2,440 mm/ms [2] and Sokolow and R avl &gt; 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulse wave velocity (PWV): These parameters will be estimated using the SphygmoCor System&#xD;
      (AtCor Medical Pty Ltd., Head Office, West Ryde, Australia). Using the SphygmoCor System (Vx&#xD;
      pulse wave velocity), and with the patient in the supine position, the pulse waves of the&#xD;
      carotid and femoral arteries were analyzed, estimating the delay with respect to the ECG wave&#xD;
      and calculating PWV. Distance measurements were taken with a measuring tape from the sternal&#xD;
      notch to the carotid and femoral arteries at the sensor location [62].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of vascular structure by carotid intima media thickness (IMT): Carotid ultrasound&#xD;
      to assess C-IMT will be performed by two investigators trained for this purpose before&#xD;
      starting the study. The reliability of such recordings was evaluated before the study, using&#xD;
      the intraclass correlation coefficient, which showed values of 0.97 (95%CI: 0.94-0.99) for&#xD;
      intra-observer agreement on repeated measurements in 20 subjects, and 0.90 (95%CI: 0.74-0.96)&#xD;
      for inter-observer agreement. According to the Bland-Altman analysis, the limit of&#xD;
      inter-observer agreement was 0.02 (95% CI: -0.05-0.10), while the limit of intra-observer&#xD;
      agreement was 0.01 (95% CI: -0.03-0.06). A Sonosite Micromax ultrasound device paired with a&#xD;
      5-10 MHz multi-frequency high-resolution linear transducer with Sonocal software will be used&#xD;
      for performing automatic measurements of carotid IMT in order to optimize reproducibility.&#xD;
      Measurements will be made of the common carotid after the examination of a 10-mm longitudinal&#xD;
      section at a distance of 1 cm from the bifurcation, performing measurements in the anterior&#xD;
      or proximal wall, and in the posterior or distal wall in the lateral, anterior and posterior&#xD;
      projections, following an axis perpendicular to the artery to discriminate two lines: one for&#xD;
      the intima-blood interface and the other for the media-adventitious interface. A total of 6&#xD;
      measurements will be obtained of the right carotid, with another 6 measurements of the left&#xD;
      carotid, using average values (average carotid IMT) and maximum values (maximum carotid IMT)&#xD;
      automatically calculated by the software [63]. The measurements will be obtained with the&#xD;
      subject lying down, with the head extended and slightly turned opposite to the examined&#xD;
      carotid artery. The average IMT will considered abnormal if it measured 0.90 mm, or if there&#xD;
      will be atherosclerotic plaques with a diameter of 1.5 mm or a focal increase of 0.5 mm or&#xD;
      50% of the adjacent IMT [2].&#xD;
