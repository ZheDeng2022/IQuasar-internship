      Clinical trial phase III, prospective, controlled, randomized, open.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize work that patients with chronic coronary occlusion and poor myocardial&#xD;
      viability who failed to recover ventricular function after subjecting coronary&#xD;
      revascularization with new techniques of recanalization, could achieve an improvement of&#xD;
      ventricular function if given further regenerative treatment with mononuclear cells from&#xD;
      autologous bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis we designed a prospective, randomized clinical trial in patients with&#xD;
      recanalized chronic occlusions and ventricular dysfunction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open label prospective clinical trial in which all patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with chronic coronary occlusion in the Cardiology Department of Hospital Reina Sofía in&#xD;
      Cordoba and Hospital Puerta del Mar in Cadiz, who meet inclusion criteria and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion shall include and express their accordance with trial participation by signing the&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      66 patients who did not improve ventricular function measured by Magnetic resonance at least&#xD;
      3 months after revascularization of chronic coronary occlusion will be included . The 66&#xD;
      patients will be randomized in one to one ratio to an intervention group that received bone&#xD;
      marrow mononuclear cells by intracoronary autologous (0.5 to 1 x 10 9 total cells) and a&#xD;
      control group who receive only conventional medical treatment. The two groups of patients&#xD;
      will be followed, in the clinical trial, for 6 months. Once the test is complete, they will&#xD;
      follow according to standard clinical practice of Cardiology hospital for at least 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed by clinical and Magnetic resonance methods. All patients will be&#xD;
      medically treated similarly with ACE inhibitors or angiotensine 1 receptor (AT1) receptor&#xD;
      antagonists of angiotensin II, beta-blockers and diuretics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective os the study is to determine the efficacy of intracoronary infusion of&#xD;
      mononuclear cells from autologous bone marrow in patients with chronic coronary occlusion&#xD;
      previously revascularized with stents in terms of improved ventricular function determined by&#xD;
      magnetic resonance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To confirm, in view of the obtained results, the suitability of the proved protocol for&#xD;
           the treatment of chronic coronary occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study changes in functional class (I-IV NYHA) of these patients compared with the&#xD;
           control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the safety of treatment, the analysis of possible cardiac events during the&#xD;
           6-month follow-up in the clinical trial and 24 months of additional clinical follow-up&#xD;
           (death, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization) compared with the control&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
