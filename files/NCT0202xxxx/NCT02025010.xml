  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is comparing the safety and effectiveness of abiraterone acetate alone, followed&#xD;
      by the addition of prednisone (when the participant's disease worsens or the physician feels&#xD;
      it would lessen symptoms of toxicity) versus the current approved treatment regimen which&#xD;
      involves the concomitant use of prednisone in conjunction with abiraterone acetate.&#xD;
      Additionally, this study is also examining why participants stop responding to treatment with&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate by evaluating blood and tissue.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Participants will be treated with abiraterone acetate (AA) in 28-day cycles.&#xD;
           Participants will be monitored (weekly for the first two cycles, then on Day 1 of each&#xD;
           subsequent cycle) for symptoms of persistent or severe mineralocorticoid excess&#xD;
           (including hypertension, hypokalemia). For participants who experience symptoms of&#xD;
           persistent or severe hypertension or hypokalemia as detailed in the above schema,&#xD;
           prednisone 5 mg by mouth twice daily will be added. We will monitor for other symptoms&#xD;
           of AA toxicity to include fluid retention and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For participations who tolerate AA monotherapy without the addition of prednisone to&#xD;
           manage symptoms of persistent or severe mineralocorticoid excess, prednisone 5 mg by&#xD;
           mouth twice daily will be added at Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) progression.&#xD;
           Participants will be continued on study until symptomatic or radiographic progression or&#xD;
           taken off study for another reason as detailed in protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will undergo pre-treatment and progression tumor biopsies. Participants&#xD;
           will also undergo pre-treatment and progression tumor biopsies for assessment of&#xD;
           possible mechanisms of AA resistance. After the progression biopsy is performed,&#xD;
           protocol therapy will be discontinued. Participants who stop protocol therapy before&#xD;
           receiving four cycles of AA will not be asked to undergo the second biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlative Studies: Participants will undergo assessment of serum corticosteroid&#xD;
           intermediates and Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) at baseline and subsequent&#xD;
           treatment visits for correlation with symptoms of mineralocorticoid excess.&#xD;
