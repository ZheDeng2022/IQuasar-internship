    <textblock>
      Rationale: Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is a rare disorder characterized by &gt;20&#xD;
      fluid-filled hepatic cysts. Polycystic livers are present in the combination with renal cysts&#xD;
      as a manifestation of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), or isolated in&#xD;
      the absence of renal cysts as autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD or PCLD).&#xD;
      PLD patients are confronted with symptoms caused by the mass effect of their polycystic liver&#xD;
      every day for the rest of their life. There is no standard therapeutic option for symptomatic&#xD;
      PLD patients. Current options are fairly invasive or their efficacy is only moderate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data in our research lab have shown that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) inhibited&#xD;
      the proliferation of polycystic human cholangiocytes in vitro through the normalization of&#xD;
      the intracellular calcium levels in cystic cholangiocytes. The investigators also found that&#xD;
      daily oral administration of UDCA for 5 months to polycystic kidney disease (PCK) rats, an&#xD;
      animal model of ARPKD that spontaneously develops hepato-renal cystogenesis, resulted in&#xD;
      inhibition of hepatic cystogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that UDCA is an effective therapeutic tool in reducing liver&#xD;
      volume in PLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: First, to demonstrate whether UDCA-therapy is effective in reducing total liver&#xD;
      volume in PLD patients. Second, the investigators want to assess if UDCA modifies quality of&#xD;
      life. Finally, the investigators want to assess safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: International, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial Study population: 34&#xD;
      subjects (18 ≤age ≤ 80 years) suffering from symptomatic polycystic liver disease with&#xD;
      underlying diagnosis of (PCLD or ADPKD), defined as ≥ 20 liver cysts on CT-scan and liver&#xD;
      volume of ≥ 2500. Symptomatic is defined as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group- Performance&#xD;
      Score (ECOG-PS) ≥ 1 and having at least three out of ten PLD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The patients will be randomized (1:1) into two groups. One group of patients&#xD;
      will receive 15-20mg/kg/day UDCA for 24 weeks. The other group will receive standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study endpoint: Proportional change of total liver volume in UDCA treated patients&#xD;
      versus non treated patients, as assessed by CT at baseline and 6 months.&#xD;
