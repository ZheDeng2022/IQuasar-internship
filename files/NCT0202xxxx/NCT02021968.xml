  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses can cause dengue illness ranging from a mild illness to life-threatening&#xD;
      disease. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the protective effectiveness of a dengue&#xD;
      virus vaccine in healthy adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are 4 types of dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4); each can cause dengue&#xD;
      illness ranging from a mild illness to life-threatening disease. More than 2 billion persons&#xD;
      in tropical and subtropical regions of the world are at risk for acquiring dengue, which is&#xD;
      why development of a dengue vaccine is a top public health priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of a single dose of TetraVax-DV-TV003&#xD;
      (TV003) vaccine to protect against infection with rDEN2∆30, an attenuated candidate DENV-2&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy adults with no history of previous infection with a flavivirus&#xD;
      (any of a group of viruses that includes the dengue virus). Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either the TV003 vaccine or placebo vaccine on Day 0 (study entry). At&#xD;
      Day 180, all participants will receive an injection of the &quot;challenge&quot; virus, rDEN2∆30, an&#xD;
      attenuated (weakened) DENV-2 vaccine. For at least 30 minutes after each vaccination,&#xD;
      participants will remain in the study clinic to be monitored for any adverse effects of the&#xD;
      vaccines. Participants will record their temperature at least 3 times a day for 16 days after&#xD;
      the first and second vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to vaccination visits at Day 0 and Day 180, participants will attend study visits&#xD;
      at Day 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, 150, 182, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194,&#xD;
      196, 201, 208, 236, 270, and 360. At all study visits, participants will give a medical&#xD;
      history and undergo a blood collection; at most study visits, participants will undergo a&#xD;
      physical examination. Female participants will have a pregnancy test at select study visits.&#xD;
