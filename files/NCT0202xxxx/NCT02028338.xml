      To assess the safety of dapivirine (25 mg) administered via a silicone vaginal ring in&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MTN-023/IPM 030 is a Phase 2a, two-arm, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multi-site,&#xD;
      randomized trial of dapivirine vaginal ring (VR) versus placebo VR. The clinical trial is&#xD;
      designed to assess the safety of dapivirine (25 mg) administered via a silicone vaginal ring&#xD;
      (primary objective) and evaluate the acceptability of the dapivirine or placebo VR in&#xD;
      sexually experienced, HIV-uninfected adolescent females, when inserted once every 4 weeks&#xD;
      during 12 weeks of study product use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 96 participants will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either a silicone&#xD;
      elastomer vaginal ring containing 25 mg of dapivirine or a placebo VR. The ring will be&#xD;
      replaced every 4 weeks during the 12 week study product use period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of a VR to provide sustained delivery of microbicides is a novel investigational method&#xD;
      for prevention of heterosexual transmission of HIV in women. This drug delivery method may&#xD;
      circumvent potential difficulties related to adherence to daily or coitally-dependent uses of&#xD;
      microbicide regimens.&#xD;
