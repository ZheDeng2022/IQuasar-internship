  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the good and bad effects when regorafenib is used&#xD;
      instead of standard combination chemotherapy. It is not known if taking regorafenib versus&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy will have better, worse or the same results.&#xD;

    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed by the RECIST 1.1 Committee. Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from treatment start to death or last follow up. Survival will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <measure>disease control rate</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control rate (defined with RECIST 1.1 criteria at 16 weeks (2nd scan) as CR, PR or SD), will be estimated using proportions and exact binomial 95% confidence intervals provided.</description>

    <measure>duration of stable disease</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>

    <measure>toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>will be evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 4.0.

    <description>This is an open-label, phase II study of regorafenib for patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. The treatment will be repeated every week for three weeks on and one week off. Patients will be evaluated for response after every 2 cycles (8 weeks).</description>

    <description>All patients that meet the eligibility criteria who have signed informed consent and have enrolled on the trial will be treated with regorafenib, daily 3 weeks on 1 week off for all cycles. Dose will be escalated to 120 mg in week 2 of cycle 1 and all remaining cycles if no excess toxicity is experienced by the patient at the discretion of the treating physician.</description>
