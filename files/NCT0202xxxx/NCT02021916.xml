      The mission of the Louisville Cooperative Tissue Biorepository is to appropriately collect&#xD;
      normal and abnormal tissues that are removed from the human body as a part of standard&#xD;
      medical and surgical practice after adequate portions are secured by surgical pathologists to&#xD;
      allow for correct diagnoses to be made. The LCTB securely stores appropriately collected&#xD;
      human samples for research purposes and appropriately allocates these samples to local&#xD;
      investigators for research purposes. The LCTB team appropriately documents all points in the&#xD;
      process of obtaining informed consent, collection, storage, and allocation of tissues.&#xD;
