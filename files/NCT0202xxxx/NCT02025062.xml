    <textblock>
      The intervention tested in this research project aims to reduce this inequality by improving&#xD;
      the management of elderly head and neck cancer patients with a specific management. Indeed,&#xD;
      the treatment of elderly head and neck cancer patients has specificities concerning treatment&#xD;
      options, their tolerance, psychological management, nutritional and functional status, and&#xD;
      support needed at home. To assess the overall needs of the elderly patients, an assessment&#xD;
      known as &quot;comprehensive geriatric assessment&quot; (CGA) can be performed by a geriatrician with&#xD;
      extensive testing and questionnaires. This assessment is long and requires an experienced&#xD;
      geriatrician. It leads to the development of an individualized treatment plan (physiotherapy,&#xD;
      psychological follow-up, support at home, nutritional management ...) and follow-up to adapt&#xD;
      the necessary cares for the duration of the cancer treatment. The CGA utility has been&#xD;
      studied in elderly patients with nonmalignant diseases. Studies have shown that CGA allowed&#xD;
      improving survival and maintaining the elderly at home.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Context: The survival of elderly patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC)&#xD;
      cancer is greatly reduced compared to younger subjects. Several explanations have been&#xD;
      proposed : a competitive comorbidity, a more frequent refusal of standard therapy or the&#xD;
      choice of a suboptimal treatment due to fear of toxicities. The comprehensive geriatric&#xD;
      assessment (CGA) may influence the decision-making process and help for managing elderly&#xD;
      patients with head and neck cancer. The CGA is a multidimensional assessment of general&#xD;
      health status, using validated scales. It produces an inventory of problems which can then&#xD;
      serve to develop an individualized geriatric intervention plan of care and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: We postulate that the CGA and the geriatric follow-up improves 1) the therapeutic&#xD;
      decision-making process thanks to a better assessment of the patient's functional reserve and&#xD;
      its capacity to support or not the treatment, and 2) the overall survival, the functional&#xD;
      status and the nutritional status of elderly patients with HNSCC because of a more&#xD;
      appropriate treatment and a personalized medical follow-up after surgery and/or radiotherapy&#xD;
      and/or chemotherapy or more rarely targeted therapy, with adjustment of treatments and&#xD;
      management of comorbidities and/or treatment complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: To assess the impact of the CGA and the geriatric follow-up on the overall&#xD;
      survival, the functional status and the nutritional status of elderly patients with HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: To assess the impact of the CGA on the therapeutic decision, the&#xD;
      toxicity and/or complications of treatment, the complete realization of treatment, the&#xD;
      autonomy, the institutionalization, the total hospitalization stay, the quality of life of&#xD;
      elderly patients with HNSCCs and the costs.&#xD;
