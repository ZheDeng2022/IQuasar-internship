    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the effect of Gilenya on brain pathology and cognitive impairment&#xD;
      over 6, 12, and 24 months in patients with relapsing MS using MRI, clinical data, and&#xD;
      neurological assessments. Healthy controls will also be followed over 6, 12, and 24 months&#xD;
      using the same measures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-blinded, observational, prospective, 24 months follow-up,&#xD;
      controlled study to assess the efficacy of Gilenya on thalamus pathology and cognitive&#xD;
      impairment in 30 relapsing MS patients naïve to Gilenya who fulfilled the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria used for screening and started Gilenya, on a clinical basis. In addition,&#xD;
      20 HCs will be included as a reference population. Because this is an observational study&#xD;
      investigating evolution of thalamic atrophy, iron deposition, cognitive dysfunction and&#xD;
      response to herpes viruses in patients treated with Gilenya on a clinical basis the patients&#xD;
      are not starting Gilenya as an investigational drug. Therefore, the patients who are already&#xD;
      started Gilenya by the treatment decision of their physician will be asked to participate in&#xD;
      this observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening and starting procedures criteria for Gilenya on a clinical basis and for our&#xD;
      study are defined by the Gilenya PI. All patients in our clinic have standardized assessments&#xD;
      before starting any disease-modifying therapy. Once the patient decided to start Gielnya on a&#xD;
      clinical basis and qualified on a screening, as defined by Gilenya PI, our team will be&#xD;
      informed and contact the patient regarding participation in the present study before&#xD;
      receiving first dose of Gilenya. Once the informed consent is signed, the patient will follow&#xD;
      study procedures, as outlined in the protocol and study evaluation schedule. All subjects&#xD;
      will be assessed at 0, 6, 12 and 24 months with the same clinical, 3T MRI and laboratory, and&#xD;
      humoral response to herpes viruses examinations. The cognitive assessments and evaluation of&#xD;
      environmental risk factors will be performed at 0, 12 and 24 months. Safety will be also&#xD;
      assessed at 0, 6, 12 and 24 months of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The healthy controls (HC) will serve as reference comparison group to patients for atrophy&#xD;
      iron, cognitive and response to herpesvirus outcomes. We considered alternative study designs&#xD;
      as listed below. The head-to-head comparison with untreated or comparator-treated patients&#xD;
      are difficult to conduct and can not be performed without proper randomization and&#xD;
      double-blinding which is costly and unfeasible in mechanistical study like is the one&#xD;
      proposed. The inclusion of a HC group provides a valuable baseline, allowing evaluation of&#xD;
      the proposed techniques for normal variation between individuals, against which changes in&#xD;
      the proposed outcomes could be compared. Use of HCs for comparison with a patient population&#xD;
      in prospective longitudinal pilot studies of non-conventional MRI, including measurement of&#xD;
      thalamic atrophy and iron deposition, may become an attractive approach in the future for&#xD;
      several reasons. First, the ultimate goal of therapy is to normalize patient changes over&#xD;
      time, to those observed in HCs over the same time period. HCs also experience brain changes&#xD;
      over time and so the notion of arresting disease progression as measured by proposed outcomes&#xD;
      requires validation by reference to a comparator without disease progression to account for&#xD;
      age-related changes. Second, ethical considerations preclude placebo-controlled studies using&#xD;
      an established MS treatment versus placebo-treatment in patients with RRMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI analysis will be performed fully blinded, as are all phase I, II, III and IV trials&#xD;
      calculated at the Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center (BNAC), Buffalo, NY. BNAC has been&#xD;
      involved as an centralized MRI reading center in many MS clinical trials that included over&#xD;
      500 sites around the world in 55 countries The detailed procedures of how the MRI DICOM files&#xD;
      are blinded and how the workload is distributed are part of our internal standard operating&#xD;
      procedures (SOPs) that have been accepted as appropriate following standard audits by&#xD;
      government and industry agencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo study eligibility screening and consenting by a Clinical&#xD;
      Research Project Coordinator. The participant will be provided with a description of the&#xD;
      required testing for study participation, and any risks will be described in order for the&#xD;
      person to make an informed decision regarding voluntary study participation. This is also an&#xD;
      opportunity for the person to ask questions regarding the study and the testing components.&#xD;
      All study participants who choose to enroll in the study will be asked to sign and date the&#xD;
      consent form in front of the Study Coordinator who will also sign and date the consent as&#xD;
      witness.&#xD;
