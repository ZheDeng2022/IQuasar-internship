  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial involving subjects diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, in accordance with&#xD;
      guidelines established by the London Brain Bank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals often must execute more than one task simultaneously during everyday life. When&#xD;
      different activities that require attention are performed at the same time, a situation&#xD;
      called Dual Task occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under normal conditions, motor cortex areas (primary motor cortex, pre-motor cortex and&#xD;
      supplementary motor area) are responsible for selecting the range of movements in a given&#xD;
      action sequence, in accordance with the demands of the task and environmental restrictions,&#xD;
      and after the onset of movements brought about by the motor cortex, the basal nuclei continue&#xD;
      execution, leaving the motor cortex free for other tasks that require attention. However, in&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease, automaticity promoted by basal nuclei is compromised and constant&#xD;
      conscious control becomes necessary during gait. Thus, when an activity concurrent with this&#xD;
      function is performed, the frontal regions become dedicated to the secondary task and gait is&#xD;
      predominantly controlled by defective basal nuclei, which generates negative Dual Task&#xD;
      interference on gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the poor gait quality assessed in DT situations, individuals with PD have been&#xD;
      instructed to avoid these circumstances. By contrast, recent evidence has demonstrated that&#xD;
      gait training in conjunction with to secondary activities is capable of improving variables&#xD;
      related to DT gait performance in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that treadmill gait training provides greater regularity and automaticity,&#xD;
      allowing subjects to divert their attention to cognitive functions, this study hypothesizes&#xD;
      that DT treadmill gait training combined with cognitive tasks will promote better gait&#xD;
      performance in individuals with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were invited to participate in the study from phone calls. They were recruited from&#xD;
      the service list in Neurology at Hospital Onofre Lopes, in Natal -Brazil. Randomization of&#xD;
      individuals with respect to participation in the groups was done via the randomization.com&#xD;
      website, by a person unfamiliar with the training procedures (rater 1), who assigned a color&#xD;
      (yellow or green) to each group. Opaque envelopes were numbered and separated, and inside&#xD;
      each envelope was a piece of paper containing the word &quot;yellow&quot; or &quot;green&quot;. As a new patient&#xD;
      arrived for training, rater 2 opened an envelope and was only aware of the color code of that&#xD;
      particular patient. Rater 3, the lead researcher, conducted the assessment and re-assessment&#xD;
      procedures. The color codes were maintained in secrecy by raters 1 and 2 throughout the&#xD;
      entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA). Its&#xD;
      score ranges between 0 and 30, covering aspects related to visuospatial and executive&#xD;
      functions, naming, memory, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall, as well as&#xD;
      temporal and spatial orientation. Higher scores correspond to greater cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease severity was classified according to guidelines proposed by the Modified Hoehn and&#xD;
      Yahr Scale, composed of seven stages, allowing categorization of both sides of the body as to&#xD;
      balance and physical independence. Its scores range from 0 (no signs of the disease) to 5&#xD;
      points (confined to bed or wheelchair).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of degree of motor and functional impairment was obtained using the Unified&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). This study used only items 2 and 3 of the scale,&#xD;
      related to ADLs and motor exploration, whose scores correspond to 52 and 56, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinematic assessment of overground gait was performed by the Qualisys Motion Capture Systems&#xD;
      (Qualisys Medical AB, 411 13 Gothenburg, Sweden), which records the spatiotemporal variables&#xD;
      of gait, as well as angular variations of hip, knee and ankle joints. This system is composed&#xD;
      of eight cameras that emit and capture infrared light. The light is reflected by spherical&#xD;
      passive markers positioned on bony prominences and standard body segments, in order to&#xD;
      capture lower limb data. The cameras are connected to a computer, where the images collected&#xD;
      are stored. Data captured in two-dimensional imaging are processed by Qualisys Track Manager&#xD;
      2.6 acquisition software, which recognizes marker positioning and, based on the combination&#xD;
      of images from at least two cameras connected in series, enables the generation of&#xD;
      three-dimensional coordinates of movement. To that end, data are transported by 3D visual&#xD;
      software (C-Motion, Rockville, MD, USA), version Basic/RT 3.99.25.8), which allows the&#xD;
      reconstruction and three-dimensional analysis of the body segments marked, thereby recording&#xD;
      the movements executed during gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For kinematic assessment, we used 15 and 19 mm-diameter markers positioned bilaterally on the&#xD;
      following structures: iliac crest, greater trochanter, medial and lateral epicondyle of the&#xD;
      femur, medial and lateral malleoli, calcaneus, head of the first metatarsal and head of the&#xD;
      fifth metatarsal. These markers are denominated anatomical, since their function is to&#xD;
      demarcate axial joints, allowing different segments to be delimited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The marks that guide the trajectory of segments are classified as tracking, and are arranged&#xD;
      in fours on the rectangular base (cluster). The markers were placed on the base of the&#xD;
      sacrum, on the middle third of the thigh and middle third of the leg. Anatomical markers were&#xD;
      fixed with double-faced adhesive tape and reinforced with surgical tape, while tracking&#xD;
      markers were coupled to the body segments with elastic bands and Velcro. Markers were colored&#xD;
      by the same rater on all the volunteers, in order to preserve the reliability of the marking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For gait training, we used an electric Gait Trainer 2 treadmill (Biodex Medical System, NY,&#xD;
      USA), with a walking area measuring 160 x 51 centimeters (cm), and equipped with a bar for&#xD;
      upper extremity support, heart monitoring by bioimpedance sensors located on the bar and a&#xD;
      Polar Telemetry system (POLAR, USA). Coupled to the treadmill is an Unweighing System (Biodex&#xD;
      Medical System, NY, USA), composed of a vertical standing frame that carries the weight&#xD;
      supported by means of a harness. However, the patients did not use the weight support system&#xD;
      in this study and the harness was used only as a safety precaution during the training&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study procedures were performed over two days, the first for assessment and the second&#xD;
      for the intervention with immediate reassessment. On the first day, the Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
      Assessment (MoCA), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and Modified Hoehn and Yahr Scale&#xD;
      were applied. Next, weight and height were recorded. Finally, kinematic assessment of&#xD;
      overground DT gait was carried out. On the second day, the subjects were submitted to&#xD;
      treadmill training and kinematic reassessment of overground DT gait. Assessment occurred one&#xD;
      day after training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the onset of kinematic assessment, after marker placement and equipment calibration,&#xD;
      static collection was performed to inform the system regarding body segment positioning and&#xD;
      enable subsequent construction of the biomechanical model. The individual remained in the&#xD;
      orthostatic position, with arms crossed over their chest, feet apart and pointing towards one&#xD;
      of the cameras. Subjects were filmed for 3 seconds in this position. Next, the anatomical&#xD;
      markers were removed in order to perform dynamic captures. Only tracking markers of thigh and&#xD;
      leg segments remained in place, as well as those on the head of the fifth metatarsal, lateral&#xD;
      malleolus and calcaneus, which correspond to the foot segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each dynamic capture, the individuals were instructed to cover a distance of 8 meters,&#xD;
      walking at maximum speed, while performing a cognitive task. During each 8-meter lap a letter&#xD;
      was randomly drawn and the individual was asked to say as many words as possible starting&#xD;
      with that letter. When the patients unable to recall words, the subjects were also instructed&#xD;
      not to stop, but rather to continue walking and trying to remember. Ten dynamic collections&#xD;
      were conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the next day, the Experimental Group (n=11) underwent treadmill gait training&#xD;
      simultaneously to a protocol of cognitive tasks involving a number of attention and executive&#xD;
      functions, such as verbal fluency, working memory and spatial planning. The protocol was&#xD;
      created specifically for this study, based on cognitive activities proposed in previous&#xD;
      studies. The training sessions lasted 20 minutes. The first three minutes allowed subjects to&#xD;
      familiarize themselves with the treadmill. From the 4th minute onward, the volunteer walked&#xD;
      for 1 minute while performing cognitive tasks, and in the following minute, only walked.&#xD;
      Thus, the 17 remaining minutes on the treadmill alternated between one minute of treadmill&#xD;
      training combined with a cognitive task and the following minute only treadmill training. The&#xD;
      Control Group (n=11) underwent only treadmill training. Training lasted 20 minutes for both&#xD;
      groups. Treadmill gait speed for both groups was that reported by the patient as the fastest&#xD;
      possible speed while maintaining a suitable comfort level. Vital signs (heart rate and blood&#xD;
      pressure) were monitored before, during and after the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after treadmill training, DT overground gait was reassessed, using ten dynamics&#xD;
      captures, the same procedures used on the first day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinematic data processing was conducted with Qualisys Track Manager 2.6 software (QTM), where&#xD;
      markers were named and their trajectories defined. Next, the data obtained in QTM were&#xD;
      exported to the Visual 3D program, where three-dimensional reconstruction of the biochemical&#xD;
      model was carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences&#xD;
      (SPSS), version 19.0. Before the analysis of each group, data distribution normality was&#xD;
      verified by applying descriptive statistics procedures and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of central tendency and dispersion were used to illustrate clinical, demographic and&#xD;
      anthropometric data. For data with normal distribution, the paired t-test was used to compare&#xD;
      intragroup spatiotemporal and angular variables, while the student's t-test for independent&#xD;
      samples was applied to compare intergroup variables. The Mann-Whitney test was used for data&#xD;
      with non-normal distribution. A significance level of 5% was set for all these tests.&#xD;
