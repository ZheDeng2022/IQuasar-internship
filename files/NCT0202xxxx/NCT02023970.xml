  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac valve disorders are widely spread in the general population and represents the third&#xD;
      most frequent cardiovascular illness after coronary disease and arterial hypertension. In&#xD;
      this context, aortic valve stenosis (the central pathology in this project) is the most&#xD;
      common form of valve disease. Cardiac valve replacement is in the vast majority of cases the&#xD;
      first line therapy for degenerative heart-valve diseases. These are represented by mechanical&#xD;
      and bioprosthetic valve (BHV). In the vast majority of cases, BHV are derived from animals&#xD;
      and from a biological standpoint are classified as xenografts. BHV are severely penalised by&#xD;
      a premature structural damage, with ultimate valve failure occurring around 10 years after&#xD;
      surgery in 5 to 30% of cases, depending on the type of BHV used. Several factors [including&#xD;
      dyslipidaemia, gender, valve position] may contribute to the ultimate failure of the BHV and&#xD;
      there has been increasing evidence recently of a substantial immune reaction elicited by the&#xD;
      implanted BHV. This immune response is still poorly understood. It may lead to adverse immune&#xD;
      reactions and this will be thoroughly investigated by the TRANSLINK team. In this light, the&#xD;
      TRANSLINK project aims to provide the necessary data to demonstrate beyond any reasonable&#xD;
      doubt the central role of the anti-BHV immune response in the premature failure of BHV and to&#xD;
      provide efficient strategies to enable safe implantation of BHV valves in currently&#xD;
      unsuitable candidates&#xD;
