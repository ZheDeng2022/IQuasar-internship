      Protein arginine methylation is an important process, which regulates diverse cellular&#xD;
      functions including cell proliferation, RNA stability, DNA repair and gene transcription.&#xD;
      Based on literature search, protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) indeed plays important&#xD;
      roles in colon cancer pathophysiology. The PRMT expression level is involved in colon cancer&#xD;
      patient's survival and has been suggested to be a prognostic marker in colon cancer patients.&#xD;
      Recently, our group found a novel methylation on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),&#xD;
      which affected EGFR downstream signaling. investigators further observed the methylation&#xD;
      event on EGFR not only regulated tumor growth in mouse xenograft model but also influenced&#xD;
      cetuximab response in colon cancer cell lines. To further study the clinical correlation&#xD;
      between EGFR methylation and cetuximab response, we propose to detect EGFR methylation level&#xD;
      in paraffin embedded tissue samples from colorectal cancer patients with or without cetuximab&#xD;
      treatment by IHC staining and analyze its correlation with cetuximab response. This study&#xD;
      will provide an insight to the strategy of colorectal cancer therapy.&#xD;

      Colorectal cancer is the third cause of cancer in the world. The recommended treatment of&#xD;
      early stage (stage I and stage II) colorectal cancer is surgical removal, while the&#xD;
      management of late stage (stage III and stage IV) colorectal cancer relies heavily on&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Optimization of dosing and scheduling of chemotherapy agents are developed to&#xD;
      improve response and survival rate of patients. Meanwhile, the rational targeting of&#xD;
      molecular signaling pathways that are involved in the etiology of malignancies is currently&#xD;
      one of the most promising strategies in novel anticancer drug development. Since first&#xD;
      discovery of EGFR in 1962, EGFR family and its downstream signaling has become one of the&#xD;
      most well characterized receptor tyrosine kinase system. In addition to their function in&#xD;
      normal development, aberrant expression of EGFR is involved in abnormal cell proliferation,&#xD;
      reduced apoptosis, cell migration, metastasis, angiogenesis and resistance to radiation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy in cancer patients. Owing to the important role that EGFR plays in&#xD;
      tumorigenesis, new classes of drugs that target EGFR, such as cetuximab, are among the most&#xD;
      clinically advanced molecular-targeted therapies. The combination of EGFR monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      with chemotherapy has shown efficacy in colorectal cancer treatment. However, the resistance&#xD;
      of EGFR target therapy was recently observed due to complicated and different drug resistance&#xD;
      mechanisms. Take EGFR monoclonal antibody, cetuximab, as an example, the response rate of&#xD;
      cetuximab-plus-irinotecan therapy was about 23%. Some studies showed the resistance of EGFR&#xD;
      to cetuximab is related to constitutive activation of mutant KRAS. However, more and more&#xD;
      studies showed not all wild type KRAS patients response to cetuximab, while not all mutant&#xD;
      Kras patients are refractory to cetuximab. These observations make it urgent to investigate&#xD;
      the potential EGFR regulation mechanisms that may influence and predict the cetuximab&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigenetic modifications, such as alterations in DNA methylation patterns and histone&#xD;
      changes, play critical roles in human disease. Since identification of protein arginine&#xD;
      methyltransferases (PRMTs), arginine methylation has been largely recognized and is under&#xD;
      robust investigation. During arginine methylation process, PRMTs transfer methyl groups from&#xD;
      S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to guanidine nitrogenes of specific arginine residues on their&#xD;
      target proteins. After arginine methylation, protein structure, protein-protein interaction,&#xD;
      protein localization and enzyme activity are changed. As a result, diverse cellular functions&#xD;
      including signal transduction, RNA processing, DNA repair and gene transcription are under&#xD;
      regulation of arginine methylation. Recently, emerging evidences have shown links between&#xD;
      dysfunction of arginine methylation and cancers. In prostate cancer, H4R3 methylation by PRMT&#xD;
      predicts the risk of cancer recurrence; in Mixed Lineage Leukaemia (MLL), PRMT mediates&#xD;
      transcriptional upregulation during cancer progression. Moreover, aberrantly high expression&#xD;
      of PRMT is observed in tumor tissues of both breast and colorectal cancer and, notably, is&#xD;
      associated with poor clinical outcomes in colorectal cancer patients. Given the importance of&#xD;
      PRMT and EGFR in colorectal cancer development and progression, investigators tried to&#xD;
      further investigate the relation between EGFR and PRMT in colorectal cancer pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our preliminary data, investigators found PRMT can methylate EGFR, leading to&#xD;
      up-regulation of EGFR signaling. The up-regulated EGFR signaling further triggered higher&#xD;
      cell proliferation rate. In addition, cells with higher EGFR methylation level showed higher&#xD;
      tumor growth ability in mice colorectal cancer xenograft model. Importantly, the cells with&#xD;
      higher EGFR methylation level demonstrated higher cell growth rate in the presence of&#xD;
      cetuximab in in vitro cell proliferation assay, suggesting that EGFR methylation may lead to&#xD;
      resistance to cetuximab. In order to study the clinical correlation between EGFR methylation&#xD;
      and cetuximab resistance, investigators propose to collect paraffin embedded tissue samples&#xD;
      from patients with or without cetuximab treatment and analyze their EGFR methylation level.&#xD;
      Investigators expect that patients with lower EGFR methylation level have higher improvement&#xD;
      when treated with cetuximab compared to those without cetuximab treatment. In contrast,&#xD;
      patients with higher EGFR methylation level showed poorer improvement when treated with&#xD;
      cetuximab in comparison with patients without cetuximab treatment. By detecting EGFR&#xD;
      methylation levels in these tissue samples and analyzing the correlation between EGFR&#xD;
      methylation level and cetuximab response, investigators will provide an insight for&#xD;
      prediction of cetuximab response in colorectal cancer therapy.&#xD;
