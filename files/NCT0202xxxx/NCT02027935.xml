    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well white blood cells taken from&#xD;
      person's own (autologous) cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ antigen-specific T cells,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, aldesleukin, and ipilimumab work in treating patients with melanoma that&#xD;
      has spread to another place in the body. Autologous CD8+ antigen-specific T cells are white&#xD;
      blood cells that are designed in the laboratory to find melanoma cells and may kill them.&#xD;
      Biological therapies, such as aldesleukin, use substances made from living organisms that may&#xD;
      stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Giving autologous CD8+ antigen-specific T cells with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, aldesleukin, and ipilimumab may be an effective treatment for patients with&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety and efficacy of adoptively transferred cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL)&#xD;
      targeting melanoma tumors combined with anti-CTLA4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the influence of anti-CTLA4 on the duration of in vivo persistence and anti-tumor&#xD;
      efficacy achieved following adoptive transfer of antigen-specific CTL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the influence of anti-CTLA4 on the induction of T cells to non-targeted&#xD;
      tumor-associated antigens (antigen-spreading) following adoptive transfer antigen-specific&#xD;
      CTL, and the correlation of these responses with clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning 48 to 72 hours prior to T cell infusion, patients receive cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes. Patients then receive autologous CD8+&#xD;
      melanoma-specific T cells IV over 30-60 minutes on day 0, aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC)&#xD;
      twice daily (BID) on days 0-13 and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 22, 43, and 64 in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
