    <textblock>
      With the assessment of the healthy vs. diabetic and pre-diabetic Qatari population the&#xD;
      investigators intend to measure the changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in blood&#xD;
      monocytes and lymphocytes attributed to diabetes, and to evaluate whether theses changes are&#xD;
      persistent or can be reversed by improving diabetes control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The global prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is rapidly rising throughout most regions of&#xD;
      the developed and developing world. In Middle East countries, particularly in the Gulf&#xD;
      Council countries, the diabetes pandemic along with the rates of obesity have risen due to&#xD;
      the adoption of a modern lifestyle. In the Qatari population alone, T2D is highly prevalent&#xD;
      as 18% of the Qatari adults are estimated to suffer from this disease. Consanguineous&#xD;
      marriages, sedentary lifestyle, obesity and bad dietary habits are cited as the main causes&#xD;
      for this high incidence rate. Chronic hyperglycemia caused by long-term uncontrolled diabetes&#xD;
      state can lead to devastating complications such as cardiovascular diseases, neuropathy, and&#xD;
      retinopathy. Such complications are also highly prevalent in the Qatari population, perhaps&#xD;
      due to the relatively low adherence to clinical guidelines but vary among Qatari individuals&#xD;
      based on their genetic predisposition and shared family environment.It is already known that&#xD;
      inflammation is part of the complex biochemical process of initiating and further developing&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications of diabetes. Experimental models have showed that exposure to&#xD;
      hyperglycemia induces epigenomic changes in inflammatory pathways, which subsequently&#xD;
      regulate gene expression leading to the development of vascular inflammation. The&#xD;
      investigators therefore hypothesized that chronic hyperglycemia leads to altered DNA&#xD;
      methylation and dysregulation of gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes and&#xD;
      lymphocytes in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
