      INTRODUCTION Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common female endocrine&#xD;
      disorders (Fauser et al., 2011). It is a complex, heterogeneous disorder of uncertain&#xD;
      aetiology, but there is strong evidence that it can, to a large degree, be classified as a&#xD;
      genetic disease (Fauser et al., 2011). Genetic and environmental contributors to hormonal&#xD;
      disturbances combine with other factors, including obesity (Diamanti-Kandarakis et al.,&#xD;
      2006). Ovarian dysfunction and hypothalamic pituitary abnormalities contribute to the&#xD;
      etiology of PCOS (Doi et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It produces symptoms in approximately 5% to 10% of women of reproductive age (12-45 years&#xD;
      old). It is thought to be one of the leading causes of female subfertility (Goldenberg and&#xD;
      Glueck, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its prevalence has increased with the use of different diagnostic criteria and has recently&#xD;
      been shown to be 18% (17.8 ± 2.8%) in the first community-based prevalence study based on&#xD;
      current Rotterdam diagnostic criteria (March et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM OF THE WORK The study will compare the luteal phase (early) administration of clomiphene&#xD;
      citrate to the conventional (late) administration of the same drug in the follicular phase as&#xD;
      regards ovarian response in PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question What is the difference between administration of clomiphene citrate in the&#xD;
      luteal phase and the follicular phase for ovulation induction in women with PCOS? Research&#xD;
      Hypothesis Luteal phase administration of clomiphene citrate protocol gives better results&#xD;
      than conventional administration of clomiphene citrate in the follicular phase as regards&#xD;
      ovarian response in PCOS.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Subjects and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective crossover randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted in&#xD;
      infertility outpatient clinic in Ain Shams Maternity Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The required sample size has been estimated using the G*Power© software (Institut für&#xD;
      Experimentelle Psychologie, Heinrich Heine Universität, Düsseldorf, Germany) version 3.1.7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures are the total number of follicles, number of follicles &gt; 14 mm&#xD;
      in diameter, number of follicles &gt; 18 mm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measure is endometrial thickness. A previous study reported that the&#xD;
      mean (±SD) total number of follicles was 5.1 (±0.41) follicles for the early CC protocol&#xD;
      compared with 2.8 (±3.1) follicles for the late CC protocol (Badawy et al., 2009). The same&#xD;
      study of Badawy et al (2009) reported that mean (±SD) number of follicles &gt; 14 mm in diameter&#xD;
      was 3.0 (±0.28) follicles and 1.5 (±0.18) follicles in the early CC and late CC protocols,&#xD;
      respectively. The mean (±SD) number of follicles &gt; 18 mm in diameter was reported to be 2.1&#xD;
      (±0.15) follicles and 1.3 (±0.32) follicles in the early CC and late CC protocols,&#xD;
      respectively. As regards the endometrial thickness at hCG administration, the mean (±SD)&#xD;
      thickness was 9.1 (±0.23) mm versus 8.2 (±0.6) mm for the early CC and late CC protocols,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Badawy et al. (2009), the reported differences between the two protocols as&#xD;
      regards the total number of follicles, the number of follicles &gt; 14 mm in diameter, the&#xD;
      number of follicles &gt; 18 mm in diameter, and endometrial thickness are translated into huge&#xD;
      effect sizes (Cohen's d) of d = 6.3, d = 6.4, d = 3.2, and d = 1.98, respectively. The effect&#xD;
      size (d) is calculated as follows: d= ((x1-x2))/sp, where (x1 - x2) is the difference between&#xD;
      the means of the two protocols and sp is the pooled standard deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, it is estimated that a sample of 45 patients per group would achieve a power of&#xD;
      80% (type II error = 0.2) to detect a medium-to-large effect size of d = 0.6 as regards the&#xD;
      primary outcome measures. This effect size is selected as it may be considered a clinically&#xD;
      relevant difference to seek. The test statistic used is the two-sided t test and significance&#xD;
      is targeted at the 95% confidence level (type I error = 0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization method Sample randomization has been done by using (Random Allocation Software,&#xD;
      Version 1.0) (Table 1.) Statistical methods Statistical analysis will be done on a personal&#xD;
      computer using IBM© SPSS© Statistics version 21 (IBM© Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected, tabulated then analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. The&#xD;
      D'Agostino-Pearson test will be used to test the normality of numerical data distribution.&#xD;
      Numerical data will be presented as mean and standard deviation (if normally distributed) or&#xD;
      as median and interquartile range (if skewed). Categorical data will be presented as number&#xD;
      and percentage or as ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Student t test will be used to compare normally distributed numerical data. For skewed&#xD;
      data, the Mann-Whitney U test will be used. The chi square test or (Fisher's exact test, when&#xD;
      appropriate) will be used to compare categorical data P &lt; 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant. Inclusion Criteria Women aged 20-40 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with diagnosis of PCOS based on the 2003 ESHRE/ASRM (Rotterdam) criteria: to include&#xD;
      two of the following, in addition to exclusion of related disorders:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oligo / anovulation Hyperandrogenism and/or Hyperandrogenemia Polycystic ovaries by U/S i.e.&#xD;
      at least one ovary showing either 1 - 12 more follicles (2-9 mm in diameter) or ovarian&#xD;
      volume &gt; 10 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria Age &lt; 20 or &gt; 40. Major pelvic pathology. Ovarian masses. Infertility due&#xD;
      to causes other than ovarian factors e.g. Bilateral tubal block Congenital anomaly of the&#xD;

      hyperprolactinemia, Lipoid Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (LCAH), hypothyroidism,&#xD;
      hyperthyroidism and Cushing's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment (recruitment) Data: Following admission into the study, the case record form (CRF&#xD;
      1) will be filled, including demographic information, entailing patient's age, parity,&#xD;
      medical and surgical histories, and indications for the surgery. Consent will be taken from&#xD;
      every patient after detailed explanation of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy test will be done by measuring serum human chorionic gonadotropin to exclude&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic investigations will be done, once, before starting the trial including, serum Follicle&#xD;
      stimulating hormone, serum Luteinizing hormone, serum Prolactin, serum Estradiol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to contact investigators and present themselves to be assigned to one&#xD;
      of the CC administration two protocols according to the computer-generated randomization&#xD;
      plan. Each patient will have a Case Record Form (CRF II) in which the data will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (study group): will include 45 patients to whom 100 mg of CC will be administrated&#xD;
      daily for five days starting the next day after finishing MPA (medroxyprogesterone acetate)&#xD;
      10 mg tablet for five days, for one menstrual cycle, then a wash out period for another&#xD;
      menstrual cycle, then the group treatment plan is shifted to administration of 100 mg of CC&#xD;
      daily for five days starting on day 2 of the cycle induced by MPA for another menstrual&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (control group): will include 45 patients to whom 100 mg of CC will be administrated&#xD;
      daily for five days starting on day 2 of the cycle induced by MPA, for one menstrual cycle,&#xD;
      then a wash out period for another menstrual cycle, then the group treatment plan is shifted&#xD;
      to administration of 100 mg of CC daily for five days starting the next day after finishing&#xD;
      MPA (medroxyprogesterone acetate) 10 mg tablet for five days for another menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fig. 2: Crossover study design On day 14 of the cycle, patients in both study groups will be&#xD;
      monitored by transvaginal ultrasound for the mean follicular volume (folliculometry) and&#xD;
      endometrial thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be tabulates and statistically analyzed according to Consolidated Standards of&#xD;
      Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical and Legal Aspects Good Clinical Practice (GCP) The procedures set out in this study&#xD;
      protocol, pertaining to the conduct, evaluation and documentation of this study, are designed&#xD;
      to ensure that the investigators abide by the principles of good clinical practice and the&#xD;
      ethical principles laid down in the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delegation of Investigator Responsibilities The investigator will ensure that all persons&#xD;
      assisting with the trial are adequately informed about the protocol, any amendments to the&#xD;
      protocol, the study treatments, and their trial-related duties and functions. The&#xD;
      investigator will maintain a list of sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified&#xD;
      person to whom he or she has delegated significant trial-related duties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Information and Informed Consent Before being admitted to the clinical study, the&#xD;
      patient must consent to participate after the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the&#xD;
      clinical study have been explained in a form understandable to her [Form 01]. An informed&#xD;
      consent document, in Arabic language, contains all locally required elements and specifies&#xD;
      who informed the patient [Form 02]. After reading the informed consent document, the patient&#xD;
      must give consent in writing. The patient's consent must be confirmed at the time of consent&#xD;
      by the personally dated signature of the patient and by the personally dated signature of the&#xD;
      person conducting the informed consent discussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is unable to read, oral presentation and explanation of the written informed&#xD;
      consent form and information to be supplied to patients must take place in the presence of an&#xD;
      impartial witness. Consent must be confirmed at the time of consent orally and by the&#xD;
      personally dated signature of the patient or by a local legally recognized alternative (e.g.,&#xD;
      the patient's thumbprint or mark). The witness and the person conducting the informed consent&#xD;
      discussions must also sign and personally date the consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original signed consent document will be retained by the investigator. The investigator&#xD;
      will not undertake any measures specifically required only for the clinical study until valid&#xD;
      consent has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only the patient number and patient initials will be recorded in the CRF, and if the patients&#xD;
      name appears on any other document (e.g., pathologist report), it must be kept in privacy by&#xD;
      the investigators. The investigator will maintain a personal patient identification list&#xD;
      (patient numbers with the corresponding patient names) to enable records to be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the beginning of the study and in accordance with the local regulation followed, the&#xD;
      protocol and all corresponding documents will be declared for Ethical and Research approval&#xD;
      by the Council of OB/GYN Department, Ain Shams University. Furthermore, the approval of the&#xD;
      study protocol will be granted by Ethics Research Committee (ERC), Faculty of Medicine, Ain&#xD;
      Shams University (ASU), with presentation of patient's information leaflet, consent form, and&#xD;
      case record data form (CRF).&#xD;
