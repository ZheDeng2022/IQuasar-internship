  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Please note: This phase I feasibility study did not meet the expected enrollment goal of 75.&#xD;
      The study only enrolled 6 subjects and therefore no participant completed phase II of the&#xD;
      trial described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that direct dorsal column&#xD;
      stimulation is safe in the treatment of medically refractory, chronic neuropathic pain. The&#xD;
      study will examine the feasibility of Direct Dorsal Column Stimulation using existing&#xD;
      Stimulation Leads (Ad-Tech). Secondary endpoints will include pain relief, somatosensory&#xD;
      evoked potentials (SSEPs), stimulator settings required, improvement in quality of life and&#xD;
      use of pain medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design &amp; procedures This study is designed as a prospective, controlled exploratory study for&#xD;
      an acute duration SCS trial system implantation. We will quantify perception of pain and&#xD;
      stimulation-evoked paresthesias in response to both epidural and subdural direct dorsal&#xD;
      column SCS. Additionally, we will measure the effects of both SCS modalities on somatosensory&#xD;
      evoked potentials (SSEPs), patient quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normal clinical course of SCS for chronic pain includes a trial period of 3-30 days&#xD;
      during which test stimulation is delivered via temporarily implanted epidural electrodes with&#xD;
      an external percutaneous stimulation device. These electrodes are removed at the end of the&#xD;
      trial period and, following a successful trial, a permanent set of electrodes and stimulation&#xD;
      device are implanted at a later date. Subjects for this study will be recruited from patients&#xD;
      planning to undergo percutaneous trial or paddle lead SCS implantation under the care of Dr.&#xD;
      Nandan Lad at Duke University Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those subjects who a) have post-laminectomy pain syndrome and are considered good candidates&#xD;
      for SCS trials, b) previously had successful SCS but have become refractory c) did not have&#xD;
      adequate coverage during a prior SCS trial, or d) have been deemed refractory to all other&#xD;
      treatments and would otherwise receive an intrathecal catheter/pump for chronic narcotics&#xD;
      administration will be considered for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects recruited to this study will provide written informed consent prior to undergoing&#xD;
      any research procedures (see &quot;Selection of Subjects&quot; below). Following consent and prior to&#xD;
      surgery, we will record subject demographics and pain history, including age, sex, pain&#xD;
      etiology, and history of prior pain-related surgeries. Subjects will then complete baseline&#xD;
      assessments of pain using the revised short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2) and&#xD;
      long form Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Baseline measures for quality of life and global&#xD;
      function will be measured with the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and revised Self Assessment of&#xD;
      Treatment (SAT) questionnaire, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline measures have been recorded, the research study will be conducted in two&#xD;
      phases. Study Phase I will occur during SCS implant surgery. First, an epidural trial SCS&#xD;
      lead will be placed in accordance with the normal standard of care for this procedure. Next,&#xD;
      a test stimulator (Cadwell ES-5) will be connected to the test lead and intraoperative test&#xD;
      stimulation will be delivered for up to 30 minutes to determine the effect of spinal level,&#xD;
      amplitude, frequency, pulse width on direct dorsal column stimulation. Sensation thresholds&#xD;
      and paresthesia strength and coverage area will be recorded in response to these changes in&#xD;
      stimulation parameters. SSEPs will be recorded throughout the procedure (Cadwell Cascade&#xD;
      Elite IONM System). These will be recorded using needle electrodes placed on the tibial nerve&#xD;
      and the scalp. Next, an Ad-tech subdural trial lead will be inserted in the standard fashion,&#xD;
      similar to a standard lumbar drain catheter, and will be connected to the test stimulator.&#xD;
      Test stimulation and quantification of responses will be repeated for up to an additional 30&#xD;
      minutes. The test stimulator will be disconnected once test stimulation is complete, and the&#xD;
      surgery will continue per the normal standard of care to secure the two trial leads in place&#xD;
      for post-operative percutaneous trial SCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful SCS trial lead placement is typically defined as at least 50% reduction in pain or&#xD;
      adequate paresthesia coverage in the painful areas and the same threshold will be used for&#xD;
      determining efficacy in both phases of the study. Subjects that do not meet either efficacy&#xD;
      criterion will not be eligible to participate in the second phase of the study. The subdural&#xD;
      trial electrode will be removed from these subjects, and they will continue with the normal&#xD;
      clinical epidural SCS trial procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects entering Phase II of the study will be instructed to continue their usage of&#xD;
      analgesic medications and other pain treatments as necessary, and will record any such use in&#xD;
      the provided diary. This diary will also be used to query the subject for adverse events and&#xD;
      side effects on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase of the study will occur during the postoperative multi-day percutaneous SCS&#xD;
      trial period. A hand-held trial stimulator typically used to deliver test stimulation during&#xD;
      this trial period will be used to deliver stimulation for both standard care and the research&#xD;
      study. A representative from St. Jude Medical (SJM) will work with each patient throughout&#xD;
      the trial to program their system to its optimal setting, per the normal standard of care,&#xD;
      but will not be involved in the collection of research data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first half of study Phase II, trial SCS will be delivered to the subdural lead&#xD;
      only (i.e. the epidural lead will be off). Methodological limitations prevent randomization&#xD;
      of the order in which trial leads are activated in Phase II, so study staff will not be&#xD;
      blinded to the location of the active SCS lead. However, subjects will not be told which&#xD;
      trial lead is in use until the study is complete. The SJM representative will initially&#xD;
      program the subdural trial lead on the day of surgery with standard stimulation settings.&#xD;
      Subjects will assess their current pain intensity using a numeric rating scale (NRS) taken&#xD;
      from the short-form BPI, item #6. Subjects will then be discharged from the hospital after&#xD;
      receiving pain questionnaires and diaries to fill out over the next three days. On each of&#xD;
      following two days, subjects will complete pain and quality of life ratings using the short&#xD;
      from BPI, EQ-5D-5L descriptive system, and two NRS pain assessments; paresthesia coverage map&#xD;
      and paresthesia quality ratings will also be completed to quantify sensory responses to SCS.&#xD;
      On the third day following surgery, subjects will not complete NRS pain assessments, but will&#xD;
      instead complete the SF-MPQ-2 and SAT in addition to the other ratings. This will conclude&#xD;
      the first half of study Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normal clinical course of trial stimulation will continue under the supervision of Dr.&#xD;
      Lad and the SJM representative for up to 11 days to evaluate the efficacy of the trial SCS&#xD;
      lead. Subjects will return to the Duke Spine Clinic (1B) at the end of this period for&#xD;
      evaluation, x-ray imaging to confirm trial lead locations, and removal of the subdural trial&#xD;
      lead. The epidural trial lead will then be activated, marking the beginning of the second&#xD;
      half of study Phase II. All study procedures from the first half of Phase II will be&#xD;
      repeated, this time using the epidural trial lead. Subjects will then continue normal&#xD;
      clinical evaluation of the epidural trial lead with their care team, followed by removal of&#xD;
      the epidural trial lead in the Duke Spine Clinic. The study team will review study&#xD;
      participation with the subject and collect all remaining diaries at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery is performed by the Principal Investigator, Dr. Nandan Lad MD, PhD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuohy needle is percutaneously placed in the epidural space, using standard loss of&#xD;
      resistance technique and a subdural stimulation lead is then passed and advanced under&#xD;
      fluoroscopic guidance. The needle is then removed, and the lead is tested for stimulation and&#xD;
      degree of pain relief. Figure of eight suture using 2.0 Silk is used to anchor to the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuohy needle is then percutaneously placed in the lumbar subdural space, similar to a&#xD;
      standard lumbar drain catheter insertion. An Ad-Tech lead is then passed and advanced under&#xD;
      fluoroscopic guidance. The lead is tested for stimulation and degree of pain relief. The lead&#xD;
      is anchored in place for post-operative percutaneous SCS trial (≤14 days). Figure of eight&#xD;
      suture using 2.0 Silk is used to close the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial leads will be removed by gently pulling and discarding the lead using the standard&#xD;
      technique. All subjects will lay flat for 30 minutes to minimize the risk of low pressure&#xD;
      headache following lead removal, consistent with standard practice for lumbar spinal&#xD;
      catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that a total of 75 individuals will be studied. Subjects will be recruited&#xD;
      from the Spine Clinic at Duke and overseen by Dr. Lad, respectively. Subjects will&#xD;
      participate on a volunteer basis with informed consent approved by the Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board of Duke University Medical Center. Apart from medically refractory chronic neuropathic&#xD;
      pain, these individuals will be in good health. . The age range will be 18 years or older.&#xD;
