    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders affect 40 to 50% of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD),&#xD;
      contributing to substantial distress and impairment. The goal of this study is to examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a personalized type of psychotherapy against standard-care psychotherapy for&#xD;
      addressing anxiety in youth with ASD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are common neurodevelopmental syndromes affecting 1% of U.S.&#xD;
      children. Comorbid anxiety disorders affect 40 to 50% of children with ASD, causing&#xD;
      substantial distress and impairment over and above that caused by ASD alone. Although&#xD;
      standard practice cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been established as an efficacious&#xD;
      and safe treatment for anxiety disorders among typically developing youth, its utility in&#xD;
      comorbid cases with ASD remains unknown. To date, no studies have experimentally compared&#xD;
      standard practice CBT to a cognitive-behavioral intervention that has been personalized for&#xD;
      children with a comorbid presentation of anxiety and ASD. Accordingly, we are proposing a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to be conducted at three treatment sites to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of personalized CBT for anxiety in ASD (Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety in Children with&#xD;
      Autism: BIACA) relative to standard practice CBT for anxiety (Coping Cat program).&#xD;
      Furthermore, this study will employ a waitlist control group to assess the efficacy of each&#xD;
      CBT arm relative to the absence of treatment (i.e., a Waitlist control arm). The proposed&#xD;
      research will: (1) examine the efficacy of BIACA relative to Coping Cat, which represents&#xD;
      standard practice treatment, and the efficacy of both these treatments relative to a waitlist&#xD;
      control group, (2) evaluate the maintenance of treatment gains, (3) examine the impact of&#xD;
      personalized intervention on functional outcomes. A total of 201youth across 3 study&#xD;
      locations (ages 8-13 years) with ASD and co-occurring anxiety will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of the three conditions. The three recruitment sites for this study are University of&#xD;
      California, Los Angeles, the University of South Florida (USF), and Temple University.&#xD;
      Considering the rising number of children diagnosed with ASD together with the frequency and&#xD;
      severity of comorbid anxiety, the proposed work is tailored to the unique needs of youth with&#xD;
      ASD and will provide a timely contribution to public health efforts.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Anxiety Severity on the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale After 16 Weeks of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and After 16 Weeks of Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is administered by a clinician and assesses anxiety symptom severity on a scale from 0-25 with higher scores corresponding to worse anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Positive Treatment Response as Assessed by the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>After 16 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale (CGI-I) was completed by a clinician after 16 weeks of treatment. The CGI-I assesses the severity of anxiety on a 7 point scale, ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). A rating of 1 or 2 on the CGI-I designated a positive treatment response.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Anxiety/Depression Severity on the Child Behavior Checklist After 16 Weeks of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and After 16 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is completed by parents and the anxiety/depression subscale of the CBCL was used to assess anxiety/depression symptomatology. The CBCL anxiety/depression subscale is rated on a 3-point scale, ranging from 0 (Not true) to 2 (Very True), with higher scores indicating more symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Anxiety Related Impairment as Measured by the Childhood Anxiety Impact Scale After 16 Weeks of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and After 16 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Childhood Anxiety Impact Scale (CAIS) is a questionnaire completed by parents about the impact of the child's anxiety on functioning in three situational categories (i.e., school, social, and family functioning). The CAIS is rated on a 4-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). The CAIS items are summed and sorted into 3 subscales, corresponding to each situational category: school, social, and family. For all 3 subscales, higher scores correspond to more associated impact in that area.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Two-hundred and fourteen children between 7-13 years (M=9.96, SD=1.76) were recruited through referrals, advertisements, and the patient flow of three university-based mental health clinics. Recruitment began April 2014 and final data were collected around January 2017.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 214 participants enrolled in the study, a total of 47 children were excluded before assignment to groups because they did not meet eligibility criteria (did not meet IQ criteria (n=6); did not meet anxiety criteria or anxiety was not primary (n=16); no autism spectrum disorder criteria (n=17); parent unwilling or unable to adhere to study procedures (n=7); child needed a higher level of care (n=1)). Thus, only 167 children were assigned across the three groups.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The Childhood Anxiety Impact Scale (CAIS) is a questionnaire completed by parents about the impact of the child's anxiety on functioning in three situational categories (i.e., school, social, and family functioning). The CAIS is rated on a 4-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). The CAIS items are summed and sorted into 3 subscales, corresponding to each situational category: school, social, and family. For all 3 subscales, higher scores correspond to more associated impact in that area.</description>
