    <textblock>
      PrimaVie (Natreon Inc), is a a purified and standardized shilajit extract for nutraceutical&#xD;
      use. Research indicates that PrimaVie® has targeted action for increasing energy,&#xD;
      revitalization and anti-aging. Findings on a recent murine study revealed that PrimaVie (PV)&#xD;
      significantly changed the expression of genes related to muscle function (unpublished data).&#xD;
      Based on these facts, it was thought of interest to study the effect of PrimaVie and exercise&#xD;
      training on human skeletal muscle adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to determine effect of PrimaVie supplementation and combined&#xD;
      PrimaVie supplementation and exercise on changes in muscle gene expression related to muscle&#xD;
      function. Two hypothesizes have been made, oral supplementation of PrimaVie twice a day for&#xD;
      12 weeks will influence gene expression in the skeletal muscle of pre-obese to obese humans,&#xD;
      oral supplementation of PV will act with treadmill exercise training to favorably impact&#xD;
      skeletal muscle gene expression. The participants will have a total of 3 visits over 12&#xD;
      weeks. During each visit will include measurement of height, weight and vital signs, 2&#xD;
      tablespoons of blood will be draw from left or right arm, and muscle biopsies (using biopsy&#xD;
      needle) will be collected under the use of local anesthetics. The blood and muscle biopsies&#xD;
      will be used for all lab related procedure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Potential subjects will see an advertisement placed in locations around the Wexner Medical&#xD;
      Center with RN (research nurse) listed as the main contact. After potential subjects contact&#xD;
      the research nurse, he/she will use inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine potential&#xD;
      eligibility. If the potential subject meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria, he/she will be&#xD;
      scheduled for a primary visit at the Morehouse Medical Plaza or Davis Heart and Lung Research&#xD;
      Institute. At this initial visit, the research nurse will meet the potential subject in a&#xD;
      private room where the study will be fully explained in lay language, and informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained. Then, appropriate demographic, biometric and health/clinical information&#xD;
      will be recorded on the data collection sheet, and 22.5 mL of blood will be obtained via&#xD;
      venipuncture in the right/ left forearm. A muscle biopsy will also be collected by a trained&#xD;
      physician. The blood and muscle biopsy will be used for all lab related study procedures. The&#xD;
      subjects will be given an 8-week supply of the PrimaVie supplement with instructions, as well&#xD;
      as a copy of the research protocol and informed consent form. If the supplements are mailed,&#xD;
      they will also have instructions, as well as a copy of the research protocol and informed&#xD;
      consent form mailed. The subject will be instructed to call the Research Nurse/ approved&#xD;
      study personnel to let them know that they have received the supplements by mail and to go&#xD;
      over any questions or concerns the subject may have as well as to schedule follow up visits.&#xD;
      All follow up visits (T1, T2, T3a and T3b) will consist of a 22.5 mL blood draw, collection&#xD;
      of muscle biopsy/biopsies and measurement of previously specified demographic, biometric and&#xD;
      health/clinical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 4 weeks of exercise treadmill training (70-75% HRmax for 20 mins; 5 min warm up and 5 min&#xD;
      cool down - total 30 mins a day; 3 days a week), the subjects will be doing supervised (study&#xD;
      personnel) exercise routine (Treadmill) at study designated facilities( located on The Ohio&#xD;
      State University campus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1: That oral supplementation of PrimaVie twice a day for 12 weeks will&#xD;
           influence gene expression in the skeletal muscle of sedentary pre-obese to obese humans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2: That oral supplementation of PrimaVie will synergistically act with&#xD;
           treadmill exercise training to favorably impact skeletal muscle gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: A non-randomized, longitudinal study to determine the effect of PrimaVie and exercise&#xD;
      training on human skeletal muscle adaptation in 30 pre-obese to obese volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 40 volunteers will be recruited via study advertisement, and contact the&#xD;
      research staff based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. At each visit the&#xD;
      following will be recorded/collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  22.5 mL of blood (approximately 2 tablespoons) (venipuncture)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle biopsy/biopsies (1 muscle biopsy per visit collected at T1 and T2, and 2 muscle&#xD;
           biopsies are collected at T3)&#xD;

      Participants will come for three visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1 (T1) - Baseline (prior to the start of supplementation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2 (T2) - First 8 weeks of supplementation alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3 (T3) - Next 4 weeks of supplementation together with exercise (T3 consists of 2&#xD;
           sample collections: T3a (pre-exercise) after 12 weeks of supplementation together with 4&#xD;
           weeks of exercise - samples taken immediately before the final exercise routine (during&#xD;
           Visit 3), and T3b (post exercise) after 12 weeks of supplementation together with 4&#xD;
           weeks of exercise immediately after the final exercise routine (during Visit 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples collected from participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral blood: At all visits, 22.5 mL of peripheral venous blood will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle biopsies: biopsies will be collected from the Vastus lateralis or Gastrocnemius&#xD;
           muscles. A biopsy will be collected by a board certified Physician after application of&#xD;
           local anesthetic to the site of biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Supplement: PrimaVie (Natreon Inc), is a a purified and standardized shilajit extract&#xD;
      for nutraceutical use. Research indicates that PrimaVie® has targeted action for increasing&#xD;
      energy, revitalization and anti-aging. PrimaVie® also works at the cellular level, playing a&#xD;
      direct role in the synthesis of ATP, a compound that supplies the body with energy, and&#xD;
      healthy mitochondrial function. Findings on a recent murine study revealed that PrimaVie (PV)&#xD;
      significantly changed the expression of genes related to muscle function (unpublished data).&#xD;
      Based on these facts, it was thought of interest to study the effect of PrimaVie and exercise&#xD;
      training on human skeletal muscle adaptation. Participants will take:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  500 mg/day PrimaVie (Natreon Inc.) supplement, 250 twice a day for the first 8 weeks of&#xD;
           the study( a 250 mg capsule in the morning with food and a 250 mg capsule in the evening&#xD;
           with food)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  500 mg/day PrimaVie (Natreon Inc) supplement, 250 mg twice a day for the next 4 weeks (a&#xD;
           250 mg capsule in the morning with food and a 250 mg capsule in the evening with food)&#xD;
           of the study while including supervised exercise treadmill training, which includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  exercise supervised treadmill training (supervised treadmill training which include a 5&#xD;
           minute warm up; 70-75% HRmax for 20 minutes; and a 5 minute cool down - a total 30&#xD;
           minutes per day for 3 days per week)&#xD;
