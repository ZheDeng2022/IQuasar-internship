  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy characterised by progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion&#xD;
      cells and axons that leads to nerve fibre loss, optic disc cupping, and consecutive&#xD;
      glaucomatous visual field defects. It is considered to be one of the major causes of&#xD;
      blindness worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a well accepted fact least 25 - 40% of retinal ganglion cells need to be lost before&#xD;
      statistically detectable visual field defects appear on automated visual field testing, which&#xD;
      is also consistent with post-mortem histologic findings in glaucomatous eyes. Since the&#xD;
      damage associated with glaucoma is irreversible, and retinal nerve fibre layer loss is&#xD;
      considered as an early sign of glaucomatous damage, its early detection and prevention is&#xD;
      warranted. Retinal nerve fibre layer studies can be undertaken through non - invasive,&#xD;
      reproducible technologies such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry&#xD;
      etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the relationship between visual fields and retinal&#xD;
      nerve fibre layer thickness as measured by Cirrus spectral domain optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography with visual fields by Humphrey Field Analyser (HFA) in early and moderate primary&#xD;
      open - angle glaucoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It is often said that the structural damage due to glaucoma precedes functional loss, it is&#xD;
      not always clear in its interpretation. To define, which test shows up the earliest sign of&#xD;
      glaucomatous damage would be difficult to predict, since the outcome can be influenced by&#xD;
      many factors, such as the sensitivity of the test, inter - individual difference or the stage&#xD;
      of the disease process itself. Studies on post-mortem retinal ganglion cells counts and SAP&#xD;
      field loss in humans and monkeys lead to an observation that, on an average about 25% retinal&#xD;
      ganglion cells loss leads to development of an afferent pupillary defect, 35% loss for visual&#xD;
      field defects and 40% loss leads to worsening of visual acuity. It would be safe to state&#xD;
      that a) the most important clinical challenge is early detection of glaucomatous damage and&#xD;
      progression over a period of time; b) Both structural and functional tests are important in&#xD;
      assessing early damage and progression; c) significant damage to the retinal ganglion cells&#xD;
      can occur before standard tests detect a functional loss in vision. These have paved the way&#xD;
      to the development of many studies on the structure - function correlation and stating linear&#xD;
      models for the same. However these studies present a dilemma; is the structure - function&#xD;
      relation on glaucoma, a statistical statement (a structural measure will reach significance&#xD;
      before a functional test) or relational statement (statistical correlation between the&#xD;
      structural and functional tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to evaluate the structure - function correlation in early and moderate open -&#xD;
      angle glaucoma by assessing the retinal nerve fibre layer thickness by Spectral Domain&#xD;
      Optical Coherence Tomography and areas of decreased visual field sensitivity given by&#xD;
      Humphrey 24 - 2 Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm Standard protocol of automated&#xD;
      perimetry and determine any representational or statistical significance, if any between the&#xD;
      two tests.&#xD;
