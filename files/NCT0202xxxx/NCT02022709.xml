      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of SSRIs（Selective Serotonin Reuptake&#xD;
      Inhibitor） ,ERP（Exposure and Response Prevention） and the combination of the two therapies&#xD;
      for OCD(Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) patients ,at the same time, to find out the biological&#xD;
      or psychological predictors of treatment response in Chinese population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors(SSRIs) and Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      including Exposure and Response Prevention(ERP) are two kinds of the first line treatments&#xD;
      for OCD(Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) according to APA（American Psychological&#xD;
      Association）guideline. Both of the treatments are effective, but few research has been done&#xD;
      to find out who are more responsive to one treatment than the other. The aim of our research&#xD;
      is to evaluate the efficiency of SSRIs ,ERP and the combination of the two therapies for OCD&#xD;
      patients ,at the same time, to find out the biological and psychological predictors of&#xD;
      treatment response in Chinese population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, single-blind, cross-over design study.Approximately 60 patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to SSRIs or ERP group. Neuropsychological assessment and fMRI(Functional Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging） will be performed at baseline,during the treatment and at the end of the&#xD;
      study. The research has two period. In the first period(before week 8) ,the patients will&#xD;
      have monotherapy. In the second period(after week 8), rates of improvement based on the&#xD;
      YBOCS(Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale) scores will be assessed. The patient will be&#xD;
      considered responsive to treatment when he or she has a reduction in YBOCS score ≥ 35% of the&#xD;
      score at the baseline.If the patient is responsive to the treatment that he or she has&#xD;
      received at the first 8 weeks,he or she will continue to follow the previous treatment&#xD;
      strategy.If not,the patient will have a combination of SSRIs and ERP treatment for another 8&#xD;
      weeks. The follow-up period will last up to 6 months.The result of the study will improve our&#xD;
      knowledge about the efficacy of the two first line treatments .Also,it will help us to find&#xD;
      out the predictors of the outcome of the two different kinds of treatments.Strategy of&#xD;
      clinical treatment of OCD will be more individualized in the future.&#xD;
