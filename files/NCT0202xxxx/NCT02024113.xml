  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most common cancer in men and the fourth most common cancer in women&#xD;
      worldwide. Until today no effective method permits the early detection of lung cancer.&#xD;
      Consequently, lung cancer is often diagnosed owing to symptoms of advanced disease. To&#xD;
      address this problem, detection methods with an improved sensitivity and specificity are&#xD;
      urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decade, accumulating evidence shows that the metabolism of cancer cells differs&#xD;
      from that of normal cells. More specifically, the entire metabolism of cancer cells is&#xD;
      reorganized or reprogrammed to increase anabolic reactions that induce cell growth and&#xD;
      survival. Metabolic reprogramming during the development of cancer is driven by aberrant&#xD;
      signaling pathways due to the activation of oncogenes and the loss of tumor suppressor genes.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the microenvironment of the tumor plays a role in metabolic reprogramming. The&#xD;
      altered cancer metabolism is characterized by an increased glycolysis, the production of&#xD;
      lactate and the biosynthesis of macromolecules, such as proteins, lipids and nucleotides.&#xD;
      Cancer cells have a high glycolytic rate and eliminate most of the glucose-derived carbon as&#xD;
      lactate rather than oxidizing it completely via oxidative phosphorylation, a phenomenon known&#xD;
      as the Warburg effect. The breakdown of glucose and other nutrients leads to a high energy&#xD;
      production and provides the Krebs cycle with intermediates, which consequently are allocated&#xD;
      to metabolic pathways that support biosynthesis. Metabolites are the end products of cellular&#xD;
      metabolism and are therefore closely related to the observed phenotype. Disturbances in&#xD;
      biochemical pathways which occur during the development of cancer consequently provoke&#xD;
      changes in the metabolic phenotype. As a result, low-molecular weight metabolites are very&#xD;
      attractive biomarkers for different cancer types. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)&#xD;
      spectroscopy enables the identification and quantitative analysis of complex mixtures of&#xD;
      metabolites, as in plasma and serum, without an extended sample preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to determine the metabolic phenotype of lung cancer by means of proton&#xD;
      (1H)-NMR spectroscopy. Once the phenotype determined (training cohort), this has to be&#xD;
      validated by an independent cohort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects Subjects with lung cancer detected by a computed tomography (CT)-scan and referred&#xD;
      to a positron emission tomography (PET)/CT-scan are included. The diagnosis of lung cancer is&#xD;
      confirmed by means of an pathological biopsy or by a medical doctor specialized in oncology&#xD;
      with respect to radiological or clinical data. The control group consists of subjects who&#xD;
      were referred to the department Nuclear Medicine for an examination of the heart. This&#xD;
      control group represents the average population, consists of healthy subjects and patients&#xD;
      with non-cancer diseases and did not undergo a PET/CT-scan. Exclusion criteria are as&#xD;
      follows: (1) not fasted for at least 6 hours, (2) poorly controlled diabetes (fasting plasma&#xD;
      glucose concentration ≥ 200 mg/dl) in cancer patients, (3) medication intake at the day of&#xD;
      blood sampling and (4) treatment or history of cancer in the preceding 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training cohort consists of 80 subject with lung cancer and 80 controls. The validation&#xD;
      cohort consist of 250 subject with lung cancer and 250 controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling and processing Fasting venous blood samples (BD Vacutainer® LH 17 I.U. 10 ml&#xD;
      tube) are collected and stored at 4°C within 5 to 10 minutes. Around 8 hours after blood&#xD;
      collection, blood samples are transported on crushed ice to the central laboratory and&#xD;
      centrifuged at room temperature (swinging bucket centrifuge, 1600 g, 15 minutes).&#xD;
      Subsequently, 4 plasma aliquots of 500 µl are transferred into sterile cryovials and stored&#xD;
      at -80°C until examination within 6 months. When subjects give permission to store their&#xD;
      biological material, 3 aliquots are stored at the University Biobank Limburg (UBiLim) for&#xD;
      biomedical research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to NMR analysis, plasma aliquots are thawed and homogenized using a vortex mixer. After&#xD;
      centrifugation at 13000 g for 4 minutes at 4°C (fixed rotor Eppendorf centrifuge 5415 R,&#xD;
      Hamburg, Germany), plasma aliquots are diluted in deuterium oxide (D2O, 99.9%, Cambridge&#xD;
      Isotope Laboratories Inc, Andover, USA) containing 180 µg/µl&#xD;
      trimethylsilyl-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteropropionic acid (TSP, 98%, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories&#xD;
      Inc, Andover, USA) as a chemical shift reference. Finally, the prepared plasma samples are&#xD;
      transferred into a 5 mm NMR tube and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1H-NMR analyses and assignment of present resonances The 1H-NMR spectra are recorded on a 400&#xD;
      Megahertz (MHz) NMR spectrometer (Varian/Agilent, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Instruments,&#xD;
      Palo Alto, California, USA) with a magnetic field strength of 9.4 Tesla at 294 K. Slightly&#xD;
      T2- weighted spectra are acquired using a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence to&#xD;
      attenuate signals of macromolecules, such as proteins and polysaccharides. Additionally,&#xD;
      water suppression is performed in order to allow optimal detection and quantification of&#xD;
      low-molecular weight metabolites. The 1H-NMR spectra are phased manually, baseline corrected&#xD;
      and referenced to the TSP resonance at 0.015 parts per million (ppm). The assignment of the&#xD;
      present 1H-NMR resonances occurs by means of spiking experiments. A reference plasma sample&#xD;
      is alternately spiked with 34 known metabolites with a concentration of 1 mg compound per 100&#xD;
      µl plasma. The obtained chemical shifts are double checked with Chenomx NMR suite software&#xD;
      (Version 7.5, Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). Finally, 1H-NMR spectra are divided&#xD;
      in 112 spectral regions, which are integrated and normalized relative to the total integrated&#xD;
      area of all spectral regions, irrespective of the remaining water, TSP, fructose and glucose&#xD;
      resonances. The end result corresponds to 110 normalized integration regions (all integration&#xD;
      regions except those of water and TSP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis At first, the integration values of all 110 spectral regions are&#xD;
      analyzed by means of a student t-test with correction for multiple testing by&#xD;
      Benjamini-Hochberg to identify those which differ significantly between lung cancer patients&#xD;
      and controls (IBM SPSS Version 20.0, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Secondly, multivariate&#xD;
      statistical analyses are performed using SIMCA-P+ (Version 12.0, Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) to&#xD;
      investigate whether the metabolic composition of blood plasma allows to discriminate between&#xD;
      lung cancer patients and controls. An unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) was&#xD;
      performed to identify intrinsic clusters and outliers within the dataset. After the removal&#xD;
      of outliers (detected by a Hotelling's T2 range plot), an orthogonal partial least squares&#xD;
      discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), an extension of partial least squares discriminant analysis&#xD;
      (PLS-DA) with an integrated orthogonal signal correction filter, is performed to remove&#xD;
      variability not relevant to class separation. The predicted classification is expressed as&#xD;
      specificity (the percentage of controls that are actually classified as controls) and&#xD;
      sensitivity (the percentage of lung cancer patients that are actually classified as lung&#xD;
      cancer patients). The outcome of using the integration values of the significantly different&#xD;
      spectral regions, obtained by the student t-test with correction for multiple testing by&#xD;
      Benjamini-Hochberg, is compared to the outcome in which the integration values of all 110&#xD;
      spectral regions were used.&#xD;
