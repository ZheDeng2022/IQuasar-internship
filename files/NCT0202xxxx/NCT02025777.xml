      Study Hypothesis UC Disease affects the colon. PillCam IBD may be used for visualization of&#xD;
      the colon mucosa in UC Disease patients. This study is designed to evaluate the yield and&#xD;
      clinical impact of IBD capsule in detecting lesions associated with UC Disease and to&#xD;
      determine the agreement between PillCam Platform with the IBD capsule and optical colonoscopy&#xD;
      in the evaluation of UC disease extent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Scientific Objective To evaluate the agreement between PillCam IBD system and optical&#xD;
      colonoscopy in the evaluation of UC disease extent (Non-active disease, Proctitis, Left-sided&#xD;
      colitis, Pancolitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Design Established UC disease patients whose clinical condition suggests ongoing&#xD;
      disease activity, aged 18 years and up, who have no evidence of symptomatic stricture or&#xD;
      other obstruction that would prevent capsule passage will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo bowel prep, followed by a PillCam IBD capsule examination and&#xD;
      colonoscopy examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rapid videos will be evaluated by two readers, each from a different site, the&#xD;
      colonoscopy videos will be evaluated by two other physicians, at the sites&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Patient has had prior abdominal surgery of the gastrointestinal tract in the last 6&#xD;
           months, other than uncomplicated procedures that would be unlikely to lead to bowel&#xD;
           obstruction based on the clinical judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient is expected to undergo MRI examination within 7 days after ingestion of the&#xD;
           capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient with known gastrointestinal motility disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with known or suspected delayed gastric emptying&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient suffers from any condition, such as swallowing problems, which precludes&#xD;
           compliance with study and/or device instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient has Type 1 or Type II Diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient has any allergy or other known contraindication to the medications used in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient has any condition, which precludes compliance with study and/or device&#xD;
           instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are either pregnant or nursing at the time of screening, or are of&#xD;
           child-bearing potential and do not practice medically acceptable methods of&#xD;
           contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concurrent participation in another clinical trial using any investigational drug or&#xD;
           device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient suffers from a life threatening condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with history or clinical evidence of renal disease and/or previous clinically&#xD;
           significant laboratory abnormalities of renal function parameters.&#xD;
