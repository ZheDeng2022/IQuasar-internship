  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects as many as 1 in 16 people over the age of 65 and reduces the&#xD;
      quality of life of large numbers of people in the UK and around the world. Catheter ablation&#xD;
      is a minimally invasive treatment that has been developed to help eliminate AF. Recent&#xD;
      studies have identified that a particular area of the heart, namely the left atrial appendage&#xD;
      (LAA), which is a pouch in the left atrium (small collecting chamber of the heart), may be&#xD;
      the main source of AF in many cases. There is a clear lack of knowledge about the structure,&#xD;
      anatomy, function and electrical properties of the LAA, which is fundamental to furthering&#xD;
      our understanding and management of AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it is well known that AF significantly increases the risk of stroke. The&#xD;
      majority of strokes occur due to blood clots forming in the LAA. Traditionally, the most&#xD;
      effective treatment to minimise the risk of stroke has been to thin the blood with agents&#xD;
      such as warfarin. This therapy requires regular blood tests at much inconvenience to patients&#xD;
      and increases the risk of bleeding complications. Recently, a large study demonstrated that&#xD;
      use of an implanted device (Watchman速) to occlude the LAA is as effective as warfarin in&#xD;
      preventing stroke and confers a lower mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to investigate whether it is safe and feasible to ablate the LAA and to implant a&#xD;
      Watchman速 device during the same procedure in patients who are in atrial fibrillation all of&#xD;
      the time.&#xD;

      While catheter ablation has revolutionized the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF), the&#xD;
      long-term outcomes in treating persistent AF are variable, often requiring more than one&#xD;
      procedure to maintain long-term freedom from AF. Electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins&#xD;
      (PVs) is central to catheter ablation strategies, with the majority of paroxysmal AF&#xD;
      recurrences being associated with reconnection of previously isolated PVs. Persistent AF is&#xD;
      different, with recurrences being attributable to foci and or substrate outside the PVs,&#xD;
      including the left atrial appendage (LAA). Recently, a non-randomised, consecutive study of&#xD;
      987 patients undergoing repeat catheter ablation for persistent (82%) and paroxysmal (18%) AF&#xD;
      has demonstrated that almost 30% of recurrences were due to an LAA focus and that the&#xD;
      addition of LAA electrical isolation to a standard persistent AF ablation strategy improves&#xD;
      freedom from AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous LAA occlusion has been demonstrated to be as effective as warfarin in reducing&#xD;
      the risk of thromboembolic stroke in patients with AF. The combination of a standard AF&#xD;
      ablation lesion set with LAA electrical isolation and LAA occlusion may be an elegant method&#xD;
      of improving success rates of ablation for persistent AF whilst also mitigating stroke risk&#xD;
      and reducing the bleeding risks from long-term anticoagulation. However, the feasibility and&#xD;
      safety of concomitant endocardial electrical isolation and mechanical occlusion of the LAA is&#xD;
      not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we test the hypothesis that concomitant electrical isolation of the LAA and its&#xD;
      occlusion with a Watchman device, following a standard persistent AF lesion set is feasible&#xD;
      and safe.&#xD;
