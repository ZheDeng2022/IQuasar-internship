  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was designed and introduced into a clinical setting, a&#xD;
      supraglottic airway device is widely used because it has advantages such as manipulation of&#xD;
      the device when inserting it is easier than that of an endotracheal tube and it causes less&#xD;
      postoperative sore throats. Insertion of an LMA can be performed relatively easily and safety&#xD;
      at an appropriate depth of anesthesia when compared with the insertion of an endotracheal&#xD;
      tube because an LMA is inserted without using a laryngoscope and without causing stimulus to&#xD;
      the vocal cords and the trachea. Hence, an LMA may be useful in cases of coronary artery&#xD;
      disease and a carotid endarectomy where stabilization of the cardiopulmonary function is&#xD;
      important. In addition, an LMA is hemodynamically stable not only in the induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia but also in the arousal of anesthesia and thus less dangerous to a cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease patient. LMA may be useful also to patients having chronic obstructive lung disease&#xD;
      because the patients have an excessively sensitive airway and ventilation is difficult to&#xD;
      perform in them. Therefore, in elderly patients having a prevalence for cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease or chronic obstructive lung disease, use of an LMA, which stimulates the airway less,&#xD;
      may provide hemodynamical stability and reduce relevant complications or side effects. LMA&#xD;
      Supreme which is newly designed in such ways has been proven to be superior to the&#xD;
      conventional LMA Classic in terms of easy insertion and oropharyngeal sealing. A study which&#xD;
      compared LMA Classic and LMA Supreme with adult subjects showed that LMA Supreme had a&#xD;
      superior insertion success rate and better oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP) than those of&#xD;
      LMA Classic. Another newly developed supraglottic airway device is I-gel. In I-gel, which is&#xD;
      a disposable, latex-free LMA, a soft, gel-type cuff made of a thermoplastic elastomer&#xD;
      replaces the inflatable cuff of other LMAs. Thus, I-gel has an advantage that, once it is&#xD;
      installed, it requires no additional clinical manipulation such as cuff inflation or cuff&#xD;
      pressure monitoring. A comparison of I-gel with LMA Classic and other disposable supraglottic&#xD;
      airway devices produced by various manufactures in adult subjects showed that the clinical&#xD;
      properties were similar with respect to easy insertion, time required for installation,&#xD;
      laryngopharynx leak pressure, and degree of glottis exposure observed with a fiberoptic&#xD;
      bronchoscope. Thus, I-gel is expected to be a supraglottic airway device which may replace&#xD;
      the conventional LMA Classic. The elderly are known to have an upper airway anatomically&#xD;
      different from that of younger adults depending on age. A study conducted with CT showed that&#xD;
      normal elderly people had a wider upper airway than that of younger males or middle-aged&#xD;
      males and that elderly with accompanying sleep apnea had a wider upper airway than that of&#xD;
      younger males in all regions including the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx.&#xD;
      Therefore, because the upper airway of the elderly is wider and longer, a different&#xD;
      supraglottic airway device guide may be necessary. Our previous studies showed that the&#xD;
      single time success rate was significantly lower, the insertion was more difficult, and the&#xD;
      insertion took a longer time when the LMA classic was used in elderly patients than in&#xD;
      younger adult patients. However, there is no available guide for the use of a supraglottic&#xD;
      airway device or for a supraglottic airway device more appropriate for elderly patients.&#xD;
      Moreover, no study has been ever conducted with regard to such a guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, the clinical usefulness of I-gel and LMA Supreme, which are the&#xD;
      newest supraglottic airway devices, was verified in elderly patients. It was also verified&#xD;
      which of the two devices is better to use as a supraglottic airway device.&#xD;

While supplying oxygen through a mask, propofol 1.0mg/kg and remifentanil 0.5ug/kg were intravenously injected to induce anesthesia. When consciousness was not lost, propofol 0.5mg/kg was additionally injected. After consciousness was lost and spontaneous respiration disappeared, rocuronium 0.3 mg/kg was intravenously injected while performing manual ventilation.&#xD;
After injecting an anesthetic and muscle relaxant, the injection concentration of fresh gas including 6 L/min oxygen and desflurane was regulated to maintain BIS between 40 and 60. A train of four (TOF) was performed with a nerve stimulator for muscle relaxation monitoring to verify that a muscular contraction did not take place (TOF=0).&#xD;
