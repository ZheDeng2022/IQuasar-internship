      The TAILORED-Treatment consortium was established to develop new tools aimed to increase the&#xD;
      effectiveness of antibiotic and antifungal therapy, reduce adverse events, and help limit the&#xD;
      emergence of antimicrobial resistance in children and adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In reality, targeted antimicrobial therapy can most effectively be achieved by utilizing&#xD;
      personalized data to facilitate a tailored and optimized approach to individual patient&#xD;
      treatment. This can best be achieved by utilizing knowledge gained from both host-centered&#xD;
      and pathogen-centered parameters during health and disease. Unfortunately, these parameters&#xD;
      have traditionally, tended to be measured independently (for example using microbial culture&#xD;
      or PCR-based methods for microbial detection, or measurement of the immune response to&#xD;
      infections and/or blood-based biomarkers in the host), and used on an ad hoc basis without&#xD;
      careful integration for the best treatment of the patient. However, recent advances in the&#xD;
      development of high-throughput and sensitive molecular-based technologies, on-line internet&#xD;
      database access tools, and bioinformatics analysis, now means that the goal of personalized&#xD;
      medicine and treatment is in sight. Unfortunately however, there currently exists a&#xD;
      technological gap between recent state-of-the-art methodologies (for example with respect to&#xD;
      gaining new insights into novel host-pathogen interactions) and laboratory-to-bedside results&#xD;
      to benefit patients, physicians and society as a whole. The TAILORED-Treatment project is&#xD;
      designed to bridge this technological gap in order to generate novel insights and innovations&#xD;
      that are readily exploitable for the maximum benefit of multiple stakeholders in the field of&#xD;
      personalized medicine and infectious diseases.&#xD;

        Eligible subjects aged one month of age and older from both genders that attend the&#xD;
        hospital or the ED due to a suspected respiratory infections and/or sepsis (onset of&#xD;
        symptoms ≤8 days prior to recruitment) or due to a non-infectious disease. These subjects&#xD;
        are expected to fall into one of the following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with an acute bacterial infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with an acute viral infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with an acute mixed co-infection (bacterial and viral)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a fungal infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with an undetermined disease etiology&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with a non-infectious disease (control group) Patients from subgroups 1-6&#xD;
             will also be classified based on the presence or absence of sepsis or severe sepsis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        : Patients who are at least one month old will be eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The LRTI disease group should also fulfill the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Presence of two or more of the following signs of respiratory distress:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Tachypnea, Chest cough, Nasal flaring, Retractions, Rales, Expiratory wheeze and/or&#xD;
        decreased breath sounds&#xD;
&#xD;
        The Sepsis group should also fulfill the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sepsis will be defined as a combination of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)&#xD;
        due to infectious agent. SIRS will be determined according to published criteria (the&#xD;
        International Sepsis Definitions Conference, 2001) based on (in adults):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Heart rate (higher than 90/min) Respiratory rate (higher than 20/min or PaCO2 lower than 32&#xD;
        mmHg) Core body temperature (higher than 38°C or lower than 36°C) White blood cell count&#xD;
        (higher than 12,000 cells/ µl or lower than 4,000/ µl)&#xD;
&#xD;
        SIRS is defined as at least two of the above criteria, one of which must be abnormal&#xD;
        temperature or white blood cell count&#xD;
&#xD;
        Severe sepsis is defined as sepsis plus one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cardiovascular failure Acute respiratory distress syndrome Two or more other organ failure&#xD;
        As normal physiological variables are different for children, the SIRS criteria are defined&#xD;
        separately for children under 18. SIRS and severe sepsis criteria per age group are defined&#xD;
        in details in the &quot;Population/Inclusion criteria&quot; section below, according to guidelines of&#xD;
        the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
        The non-infectious disease group will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a non-infectious disease. Children in this group can only be included when&#xD;
        blood sampling for this study can be combined with blood sampling as part of standard of&#xD;
        care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An episode of febrile infection during the past 3 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A proven or suspected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, hepatitis B virus (HBV),&#xD;
             or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection&#xD;
