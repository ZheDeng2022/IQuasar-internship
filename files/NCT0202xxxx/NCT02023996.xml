  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is divided into two groups. The purpose of the first group (Group 1) was to find&#xD;
      the optimal time for taking pictures after injection of 89Zr-DFO-trastuzumab, to see how long&#xD;
      it stayed in the blood, and to see how well it was tolerated. From what the investigators&#xD;
      have learned from Group 1, patients in Group 2 no longer need serial scans or serial blood&#xD;
      draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Group 2, the patient will receive the injection of 89Zr-DFO-trastuzumab and will be&#xD;
      monitored following the injection. The patient will be asked to return for a picture 5-8 days&#xD;
      after injection to determine how well the study drug attaches to your tumor and how well it&#xD;
      is tolerated&#xD;

    <description>Antibody imaging is considered feasible if 70% of the patients are antibody-imaging positive. Antibody imaging will be considered feasible if 7 or more of the 10 patients in the first cohort are antibody-imaging-positive.We will also require that none of these patients experience severe toxicity attributable to the initial antibody.</description>

    <description>Samples will be obtained just prior to injection of the 89Zr DFO-trastuzumab tracer this sample will be banked at -80degree C for future testing for immune response (HAHA) if altered biodistribution is observed., and at 5 ± 2 minutes, 15 ± 5, 30 ± 9, 60 ± 19 minutes, and 120 - 240 minutes after the injection of the tracer 1, and at the time of each subsequent day of imaging.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive 5 mCi + 0.5 mCi of 89Zr-DFO-trastuzumab given IV over 5-10 min. Injection of cold trastuzumab will be mixed with 89Zr-DFO-trastuzumab so that total mass is equal to 50 mg [1]. In the first ten patients we wish to obtain normal organ dosimetry, pharmacokinetics &amp; determine optimal imaging time, therefore these patients will undergo imaging at 4 time points post injection, whole body counts &amp; blood draws. Subsequent patients will receive the antibody &amp; will only undergo imaging at a single time point (based on the first 10 patients) &amp; will not have whole body counts or serial bloods for pharmacokinetics. The administration of 89Zr-DFO-trastuzumab to patients undergoing a second study will be identical as for their baseline study. Patients undergoing a second injection will only have one scan that will be performed within 1 day before or 2 days after their optimum imaging time point, determined from their baseline imaging study.</description>
