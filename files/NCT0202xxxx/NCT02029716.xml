  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-human study of a topical dermal lotion formulation of RTA 408, a&#xD;
      novel small molecule which suppresses oxidative stress and inflammation. In this study, the&#xD;
      safety, local pharmacodynamics (PD), and systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) of RTA 408 will be&#xD;
      evaluated following topical application of RTA 408 Lotion to healthy volunteers. This study&#xD;
      will be conducted in three parts. In Part A of the study, healthy volunteers will have RTA&#xD;
      408 Lotion Vehicle and RTA 408 Lotion (0.5%, 1%, and 3%) applied to a small skin surface area&#xD;
      (four individual 4-cm2 sites; 16 cm2 total area) twice daily for 14 days to assess the local&#xD;
      skin tolerability, local PD, and systemic PK of these treatments. Part B will be conducted&#xD;
      after completion of Part A and will assess the safety, tolerability, local PD, and systemic&#xD;
      PK of RTA 408 Lotion applied topically twice daily for 14 days to a larger skin surface area&#xD;
      (~100 cm2). Part C will be conducted after completion of Part B and will assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, local PD, and systemic PK of RTA 408 Lotion applied topically twice daily for&#xD;
      28 days to a larger skin surface area (~500 cm2). The maximum tolerated drug concentration in&#xD;
      Part A will be used in Part B and Part C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 32 healthy adult volunteers will be enrolled in this study with 12 volunteers&#xD;
      in Part A and 10 volunteers each, in Parts B and C.&#xD;
