  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in neuromuscular diseases. The aim of&#xD;
      this research is to evaluate the thoracopulmonary recruitment by comparison of inspiratory&#xD;
      vital capacity (VC ins)and inspiratory/expiratory vital capacity (VC ins-ex) with the vital&#xD;
      capacity (VC) according to pathology and severity of pulmonary damage of patients with&#xD;
      neuromuscular diseases. The methodology consists in realize VC by support of&#xD;
      inspiratory/expiratory pressures, while the patient is passive and realizing a maximal&#xD;
      inspiratory/expiratory effort simultaneously, with the aid of mechanical&#xD;
      insufflation/exsufflation device (Cough Assist®). The evaluation will last for 30 minutes and&#xD;
      the non-inclusion criteria are those for an insufflation. The study hypothesis is that long&#xD;
      term insufflation/exsufflation device use could improve thoracopulmonary mobility.&#xD;
