      The purpose of this research study is to better understand the reasons why or why not breast&#xD;
      cancers are destroyed by standard chemotherapy. This information will be used to develop new&#xD;
      and better cancer therapies.&#xD;

    <description>To obtain DNA from the germline and breast tumor for the identification of novel somatic changes within gene and gene pathways that are potentially &quot;druggable&quot; in men or women with breast cancer undergoing a standard neoadjuvant paclitaxel (with or without trastuzumab), followed by a standard anthracycline containing regimen (e.g. doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) for breast cancer.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological confirmation of invasive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmation of breast cancer lesion ≥ 1.5 cm in size by any clinical (physical&#xD;
             examination measurement) or radiographic criteria (mammogram, ultrasound or MRI) in&#xD;
             the ipsilateral breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Benign breast disease, LCIS or DCIS in the contralateral breast is allowed.&#xD;
                  Contralateral invasive breast cancer is allowed if disease is of clinically lower&#xD;
                  stage and the higher stage lesion will be the study lesion for all biopsies and&#xD;
                  tissue samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Disease in axilla only is not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Patients that have a contraindication or inability to have an MRI may still&#xD;
                  be enrolled on study and not participate in the MRI at any of the study specific&#xD;
                  time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: For patients with bilateral disease the higher clinical stage disease will&#xD;
                  be the study lesion that will undergo study biopsies and tissue samples from&#xD;
                  surgery and the contralateral lesion will NOT undergo research biopsies and&#xD;
                  tissue samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men or women who are to begin neoadjuvant chemotherapy for treatment of Stage I-III&#xD;
             Her 2 negative breast cancer with paclitaxel followed by either the combination of&#xD;
             5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC) or the combination of&#xD;
             doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC). OR Men or women who are to begin neoadjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy for treatment of Stage I-III Her 2 positive breast cancer with paclitaxel&#xD;

             (FEC) or the combination of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC). MC1137 Trastuzumab&#xD;
             will be given concurrently with the taxane portion and can be given concurrently with&#xD;
             FEC (but not AC) at the discretion of the medical oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Her2 positive disease is defined to be: HER2 score of 3+ by IHC or HER2&#xD;

          -  Provide informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Note: If there is a history or prior malignancy, they must not be receiving any&#xD;
                  other treatment for their cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are not planning to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
