      The purpose of this study was to explore the immediate effects of transversrse vertebral&#xD;
      pressures (TVP) to the thoracic spine on cervical range of motion and pain in subjects with&#xD;
      neck pain,&#xD;

      Recruitment was by convenience sampling via referrals from local physical therapists and&#xD;
      flyers posted on a university campus. Participants were assigned to either a transverse&#xD;
      vertebral pressures mobilization group or a control group. Inclusion criteria for the&#xD;
      mobilization group were 1) ages 18 to 60, and 2) mechanical neck pain defined as pain&#xD;
      exacerbated by movement. Among the exclusion criteria were unexplained night pain,&#xD;
      unexplained weight loss, numbness and tingling in the arms and/or legs, balance or&#xD;
      coordination problems, morning stiffness lasting greater than one hour, a history of whiplash&#xD;
      injury within six weeks of treatment, diagnosis of osteoporosis, symptoms suggestive of nerve&#xD;
      root compression, prior cervical or thoracic spine surgery, or a pending legal action.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for the control group were 1) ages 18 to 60, and 2) asymptomatic neck and&#xD;
      thoracic regions over the previous six years by subject report. The latter group was labeled&#xD;
      &quot;control&quot; in the sense that it allowed blinding of the rater rather than in the sense of a&#xD;
      sham treatment group. The project was approved by the University of Puget Sound Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board, and written informed consent was obtained from all the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures Outcomes of interest were active neck motion, pressure pain threshold (PPT)&#xD;
      and report of pain. For active range of motion, a single bubble inclinometer (MIE&#xD;
      Inclinometer, Medical Research Ltd, London, UK) was used to measure flexion, extension, and&#xD;
      side-flexion with the subjects seated. Since measurement of rotation by inclinometer would&#xD;
      introduce a change from the sitting position, a universal goniometer was chosen to measure&#xD;
      rotation. De Koning et al conducted a systematic review of seated inclinometry for&#xD;
      quantifying active cervical ROM. Interrater intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for&#xD;
      flexion, extension and lateral flexion varied from 0.81 to 0.94 for healthy subjects and from&#xD;
      0.68 to 0.86 for those with neck pain. Among patients with mechanical neck pain, ICCs for&#xD;
      cervical rotation using the universal goniometer in sitting have been reported as 0.77 to the&#xD;
      right and 0.57 to the left.12 In order to consider a motion to have changed, we required&#xD;
      statistical significance at ≤ 0.01 and a difference in degrees of ≥5. Before commencing the&#xD;
      study, one researcher participated in a training session followed by intra-rater reliability&#xD;
      testing for all ROM measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPT, the minimum pressure that induces pain, was measured at the right lateral epicondyle&#xD;
      using a hand-held digital algometer (Model FPX 25, Wagner Instruments, Greenwich CT.) Three&#xD;
      measurements were taken separated by 10 second intervals, and the mean of these trials was&#xD;
      used for analysis. Good to excellent reproducibility, intra-rater and inter-rater&#xD;
      reliabilities for PPT have been reported.13-15 However, Prushansky et al reported a&#xD;
      significant difference between raters which prompted the recommendation that PPT measurement&#xD;
      should be performed by the same rater when utilized as an outcome measure. We followed this&#xD;
      recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An 11-point numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) was used to assess pain before and after the&#xD;
      intervention. Cleland et al reported the psychometric properties of the NPRS specific to neck&#xD;
      pain in a cohort of 137 patients. Test-retest reliability was moderate (ICC=.76; CI,&#xD;
      .51-.87). The minimum clinically important difference for neck pain in his study was a change&#xD;
      of 1.3 points. In our study, we selected a requirement of a 1.5-point change for clinical&#xD;
      importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol After determining eligibility, baseline ROM and PPT scores were taken by one&#xD;
      blinded rater, and subjects completed an NPRS. The mobilization group was treated with&#xD;
      non-thrust transverse vertebral pressures as described by Maitland. The patient lay prone&#xD;
      with arms to the side and in a &quot;forehead rest position&quot;. Pressures were applied to spinal&#xD;
      levels T1 through T4. The spinous process of T1 was identified by first locating C6 using the&#xD;
      cervical extension method17 and then counting caudally. The researcher stood at the level of&#xD;
      the vertebra to be mobilized on one side of the subject. The pad of the researcher's&#xD;
      non-dominant thumb was placed in contact with the lateral aspect of the spinous process of&#xD;
      T1, while the dominant thumb was placed on the dorsal side of the other thumb. Pressure was&#xD;
      applied to the spinous process to produce small amplitude, low velocity oscillation into&#xD;
      resistance to the end-range of the vertebra (Grades IV to IV+). This procedure was performed&#xD;
      for 30 seconds, then sequentially applied to the next caudal level through T4. The same&#xD;
      pattern of application was used on the subject's contralateral side. The entire procedure was&#xD;
      repeated once again for a total of 8 minutes. This was followed by a repeat of the outcome&#xD;
      measurements. The control group received no treatment. Each control subject assumed the same&#xD;
      prone position for 8 minutes as was used with the mobilization group and outcome measurements&#xD;
      were repeated. The researcher performing the outcome measurements was blinded to group&#xD;
      assignment. All subjects were clothed such that no localized residual evidence of thoracic&#xD;
      manual contact was visible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses Data were analyzed with SPSS, Version 14.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago IL). We&#xD;
      compared pre-intervention data between the transverse mobilization group and the control&#xD;
      group utilizing independent t-tests for ROM and PPT, and the Mann-Whitney test for NPRS&#xD;
      scores. We compared pre and post session measurements within each group utilizing paired&#xD;
      t-tests for ROM and PPT, and the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test for NPRS scores.&#xD;
