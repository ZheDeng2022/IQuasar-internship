      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of nab-paclitaxel and bevacizumab&#xD;
      in treating patients with stage IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable),&#xD;
      cancer of the cervix, endometrium, ovary, fallopian tube or peritoneal cavity. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Bevacizumab may stop or slow tumor growth by blocking the growth of new blood&#xD;
      vessels necessary for tumor growth. Giving nab paclitaxel and bevacizumab may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells than nab-paclitaxel alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD-malignant melanoma [MM]) of Abraxane&#xD;
      (nab-paclitaxel)/bevacizumab-complex (AB-complex) among patients with metastatic malignant&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD-gynecologic [GYN]) of AB-complex among&#xD;
      patients with gynecologic cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To further assess the safety profile and anti-tumor activity of the recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose of AB-complex for patients with previously-treated endometrial cancer IV. To further&#xD;
      assess the safety profile and anti-tumor activity of the recommended phase II dose of&#xD;
      AB-complex for patients with previously treated ovarian cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To gather preliminary data on tumor response rate and progression free survival time of&#xD;
      AB-complex among patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To gather preliminary data on tumor response rate and progression free survival time of&#xD;
      AB-complex among patients with gynecologic cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES (DOSE-ESCALATION COHORTS ONLY):&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel administered in the context of AB-complex. II. Tumor&#xD;
      concentrations of paclitaxel 24 hour (h) following AB-complex infusion and correlation with&#xD;
      plasma levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nab-paclitaxel/bevacizumab-complex intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 12 months.&#xD;
