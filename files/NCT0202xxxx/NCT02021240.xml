  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low dose sub-anaesthetic dose of ketamine has been shown to reduce postoperative pain and&#xD;
      analgesic consumption. However, due to the heterogeneous results, the standard dosing regimen&#xD;
      has not been available. Recently, its effect in postoperative outcomes and the development of&#xD;
      post-operative surgical pain has also been suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine has been shown to reduce post-operative early inflammation especially serum IL-6.&#xD;
      Therefore, study in its effects in post- operative pain and outcomes due to inflammation is&#xD;
      suggested. Only few clinical studies assessed post-operative pain are related to&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain after third molar surgery is a good model of postoperative acute inflammatory pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous study showed that there was no benefit to administer ketamine before or after oral&#xD;
      surgery for pain relief. However, other studies demonstrated that ketamine used as sedative&#xD;
      or local ketamine in third molar surgery could reduce postoperative dental pain, swelling and&#xD;
      trismus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postsurgical facial oedema is difficult to quantify accurately as it is three dimensional.&#xD;
      Over the years, various measurement techniques have been tried to measure oedema objectively.&#xD;
      These include direct linear measurement using tape or flexible rulers across fixed soft&#xD;
      tissue landmarks, standardized stereophotographic measurements, computerized tomography (CT),&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (US) and three - dimensional (3D) laser&#xD;
      scanning. Recently, three dimensional image reconstructions using a reversed engineering&#xD;
      technique has been developed and is used in the manufacturing industry. This technology could&#xD;
      be applied in a clinical setting for monitoring soft tissue changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will aim to study the use of sub-anaesthetic dose of&#xD;
      ketamine in post-operative dental pain and recovery outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that post-operative pain after Bilateral Third Molar under&#xD;
      General Anaesthesia is less in patients receiving sub-anaesthetic does of ketamine before&#xD;
      incision. The magnitude of this effect will be compared with a positive control group&#xD;
      (dexamethasone) as well as a placebo group (normal saline). Further, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      demonstrate whether ketamine can reduce post-operative facial oedema and other post-operative&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

      3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Patient will receive single dose of intravenous ketamine 0.5mg/kg before incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will receive single dose of intravenous dexamethasone 8mg before incision&#xD;
           Control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will receive single dose of intravenous normal saline before incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, patient will be randomly allocated to one of three groups.&#xD;
      HADS and SF-36 questionnaires will be completed by the patients on admission. Blood for serum&#xD;
      IL-6 and TNF - α will be taken. 3D laser scanning of the face will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will not receive any premedication and will follow other routine preoperative&#xD;
      preparation. Patients will be educated to use the Numerical Pain Rating Scale for pain&#xD;
      assessment, where 0= no pain and 10 the most severe pain. P deletion test and mini-mental&#xD;
      test will be done at ward before operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before induction, ketamine 0.5mg/kg, dexamethasone 8mg or normal saline of same volume will&#xD;
      be administrated intravenously according to the study group allocated. Induction of&#xD;
      anaesthesia will be achieved according to a standard protocol. Regional block with 2%&#xD;
      lignocaine with 1 in 80000 adrenaline will be performed by surgeon before start of the&#xD;
      procedure. The surgery will be started once the anaesthesia is effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be transferred to the recovery area for monitoring for at least 30 minutes&#xD;
      postoperatively. The vital signs including blood pressure, pulse and SpO2 and the Ramsay&#xD;
      sedation score (RSS) will be assessed every 5 minutes. Pain score (NRS) will be recorded&#xD;
      every 15 minutes. The patients will be sent back to general ward when the parameters are&#xD;
      normal. P deletion test will be done from postoperative hour 2 in the general ward until the&#xD;
      performance is at least the same as that before operation. Mini-mental test will be done at 2&#xD;
      hours postoperatively. Hourly blood pressure, pulse, SpO2 and pain score (NRS) will be&#xD;
      performed for 4 hours. Pain score (NRS) will be assessed 4 hourly afterward. Quality of&#xD;
      recovery will be assessed after operation with Chinese QoR. Serum IL-6 and TNF-α will be&#xD;
      taken at postoperative 6th hour and 16th hour. Paracetamol 1 g three times daily and tramadol&#xD;
      50mg three times daily as required will be prescribed postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be discharged home at postoperative day 1 if the discharge criteria are&#xD;
      met. 3D laser scanning of the face will be performed before they are discharged. They will be&#xD;
      asked the degree of satisfaction of the operation . Paracetamol 1 g three times daily and&#xD;
      tramadol 50mg three times daily as required will be prescribed on discharge. A diary will be&#xD;
      given to the patient. From postoperative day 1 to day 3, at each morning, average pain score&#xD;
      (NRS), analgesic consumption and side effects will be marked on the diary by the patient. At&#xD;
      the 3rd month after operation, the severity and nature of pain at the surgical sites will be&#xD;
      asked over phone. The patients will be asked to go to the Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery&#xD;
      out-patient clinic at the Prince Philip Dental Hospital on postoperative day 2 for 3D laser&#xD;
      scanning of the face.&#xD;
