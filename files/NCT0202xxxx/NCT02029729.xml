      This proposed first-in-human study (408-C-1303) is designed to assess the safety, maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) in patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors that are refractory after standard of care therapy for the&#xD;
      disease. The results of this study will help provide clinical information for the design and&#xD;
      conduct of further clinical studies with RTA 408 in cancer patients.&#xD;
