  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand why patients in the World Trade Center program&#xD;
      have continuing breathing problems. This study will improve investigators understanding of&#xD;
      breathing problems among individuals with World Trade Center exposure by allowing them to&#xD;
      review and monitor medication use, lung function, and examine other conditions that can&#xD;
      contribute to problems with breathing. The findings from the study will help investigators&#xD;
      understand why some people have persistent lower respiratory symptoms (breathing problems)&#xD;
      after their exposure to World Trade Center dust and fumes, and may help guide better&#xD;
      management and treatment of these symptoms.&#xD;

      Investigators will conduct a clinical study with aggressive treatment for lower respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms in patients in the World Trade Center Environmental Health Center. Patients in the&#xD;
      WTC EHC with uncontrolled LRS at visit 1 will be identified and placed on high-dose inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonists for three months. Adherence will be assessed at&#xD;
      monthly visits. Patients will perform spirometry and oscillometry at baseline and after 3&#xD;
      months of treatment. They will also be assessed for markers of airway inflammation, bronchial&#xD;
      hyperresponsiveness and co-morbid conditions including depression,anxiety,post-traumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder, gastroesophageal reflux, paradoxical vocal cord motion and rhinosinusitis.&#xD;

    <measure>Score on Voice Handicap Index 10 (VHI-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Voice Handicap Index 10 is a measure of laryngeal dysfunction or hypersensitivity to capture the &quot;overall&quot; state of voice handicap. The normative value for this instrument is 2.83, with a score &gt; 11 considered abnormal. There are 10 statements that are scored between 0 and 4 (0= never, 4= always). The total range is 0-40, where 40 is highest level of dysfunction.</description>
