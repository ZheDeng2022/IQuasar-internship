  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia often develop resistance to chemotherapy. For&#xD;
      this reason, we are attempting to use T cells obtained directly from the patient, which can&#xD;
      be genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). The CAR enables the T&#xD;
      cell to recognize and kill the leukemic cell through the recognition of CD19, a protein&#xD;
      expressed of the surface of the leukemic cell in patients with CD19+ leukemia. This is a&#xD;
      phase 1/2 study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the CAR+ T cells as well&#xD;
      as to determine the efficacy. The phase 1 cohort is restricted to those patients who have&#xD;
      already had an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). The phase 2 is open to all&#xD;
      patients regardless of having a history of HCT.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon meeting the eligibility requirements and enrolling on study, subjects will undergo&#xD;
      apheresis to obtain the T cells for the generation of the CD19 CAR+ T cells. In patients with&#xD;
      a prior history of allogeneic HCT, the T cells obtained are of donor origin. The T cells are&#xD;
      isolated from the apheresis product, the CD4 and CD8 T cells are then selected and grown&#xD;
      separately, transduced with a lentivirus to express the CD19 CAR as well as a truncated EGFR&#xD;
      that has no signaling capacity (noted EGFRt) and expanded in culture over a three week&#xD;
      period. During the process of cell generation, subjects will continue to be cared for by&#xD;
      their primary oncologist and may undergo additional treatment directed at the leukemia during&#xD;
      this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the CAR+ T cells have been generated, the subject undergoes a disease assessment and&#xD;
      determination if lymphodepletion is necessary. A variety of lymphodepletion strategies are&#xD;
      acceptable and determined on a case by case basis. At least 48 hours after the completion of&#xD;
      lymphodepletion, the subject will receive and infusion of CAR+ T cells at an approximate 1:1&#xD;
      ratio of CD4 to CD8 CAR+ T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following treatment with the CAR+ T cells, subjects will be followed intensely for 2 months&#xD;
      with serial blood testing and re-evaluation of disease status with bone marrow aspirates.&#xD;
      After 2 months, the subjects clinical care will be resumed by their primary oncologist, and&#xD;
      it is possible that they would receive additional chemotherapy or HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some subjects will receive cetuximab for ablation of the genetically modified T cells.&#xD;
      Criteria to receive cetuximab include acute toxicities that are life threatening, as well as&#xD;
      an ongoing remission with continued B cell aplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the study, subjects will be followed bi-annually for 5 years, and then&#xD;
      annually for 10 additional years with either a medical history, physical exam and blood tests&#xD;
      or a phone call/questionnaire. This follow up will help to determine if the subject develops&#xD;
      any long-term health problems related to the CAR+ T cells including a new cancer.&#xD;
