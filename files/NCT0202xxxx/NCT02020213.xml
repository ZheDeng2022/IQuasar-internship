  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive Aspergillus infection (IAI) occasionally occurs in immunocompromised people. Except&#xD;
      administrating empirical anti-fungal agent, using objective parameters to support the&#xD;
      tentative diagnosis of an IAI in order to make the anti-fungal treatment more specifically is&#xD;
      also important. At present, serum galactomannan (GM) test is the less-invasive, non-cultural,&#xD;
      and time-saving examination for augmenting a diagnosis of Aspergillosis. It was suggested by&#xD;
      Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) 2008 as a screening and monitoring tool for&#xD;
      Aspergillosis , and the cut-off value was adjusted to 0.5 by USA FDA . However, in clinical&#xD;
      practice, GM seems not to have good predicted value even the sensitivity and specificity are&#xD;
      declaimed more than 80% . Other controversial issues include the reproducibility of GM5 and&#xD;
      the effect of piperacillin-tazobactam or other antibiotics on the accuracy of GM baseline In&#xD;
      this study, serum GMs are examined in two conditions, one is collected for establishing a&#xD;
      baseline and the other is collected after piperacillin-tazobactam administration. We hope to&#xD;
      confirm the validity of GM baseline and the effect of piperacillin-tazobactam on GM value in&#xD;
      Taiwan.&#xD;

      We try to enroll patient who are followed in hematology department in TCVGH and are diagnosed&#xD;
      as probable pulmonary Aspergillus infection or proven pulmonary Aspergillus infection. If&#xD;
      they have poor response to current thought effective agent for pulmonary Aspergillus (eg,&#xD;
      amphotericin B, Voriconazole, itraconazole) 2 weeks, then they can choose to receive&#xD;
      Posaconazole as salvage therapy in our study. However, our study wants to quantification of&#xD;
      therapeutic response, so the enrolled patient should be agree to let us check serum&#xD;
      galactomannan level at beginning and per 2 weeks. They also should be receive chest CT in the&#xD;
      beginning and in the end of posaconazole treatment. The rule out timing is evaluated by&#xD;
      clinical doctors (hematology department) per 2 weeks, if posaconazole has poor effect to&#xD;
      their disease, the clinical doctors can decided to terminate posaconazole administration.&#xD;
      Another effective agent will be given when posaconazole fails.&#xD;
