        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Men and women ≥ 18 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of CLL/SLL, which has&#xD;
             relapsed after, or been refractory to, ≥ 2 previous treatments for CLL/SLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Must have measurable CLL/SLL defined as ≥ 1 lymph node ≥ 2 cm as measured in the&#xD;
             longest diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Active disease meeting ≥ 1 of the following IWCLL 2008 criteria for requiring&#xD;
             treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development of, or&#xD;
                  worsening of, anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL) and/or thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;&#xD;
                  100,000/μL).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Massive (i.e., ≥ 6 cm below the left costal margin), progressive, or symptomatic&#xD;
                  splenomegaly.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Massive nodes (i.e., ≥ 10 cm in the longest diameter), progressive, or&#xD;
                  symptomatic lymphadenopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of &gt; 50% over a 2-month period or a&#xD;
                  lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) of &lt; 6 months. LDT may be obtained by linear&#xD;
                  regression extrapolation of absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) obtained at&#xD;
                  intervals of 2 weeks over an observation period of 2 to 3 months. In subjects&#xD;
                  with initial blood lymphocyte counts of &lt; 30 X 109/L (30,000/μL), LDT should not&#xD;
                  be used as a single parameter to define indication for treatment. In addition,&#xD;
                  factors contributing to lymphocytosis or lymphadenopathy other than CLL (e.g.,&#xD;
                  infections) should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Autoimmune anemia and/or thrombocytopenia that is poorly responsive to standard&#xD;
                  therapy.&#xD;
