      SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: A diagnostic laparoscopy is a frequently used method to confirm the diagnosis&#xD;
      appendicitis. However until recently evidence-based laparoscopic criteria for determining&#xD;
      appendicitis were not defined. If there is any doubt about the presence of appendicitis the&#xD;
      appendix is usually removed. In a single centre prospective pilot study on 134 patients the&#xD;
      investigators were able to define the Laparoscopic APPendicitis (LAPP) score. In the current&#xD;
      study the investigators will validate the LAPP score in order to decrease the negative&#xD;
      appendectomy rate by 50%. Eventually the score should lead to a decrease in morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To decrease the negative appendectomy rate by 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A multicenter prospective validation study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All patients, â‰¥18 years, operated with a diagnostic laparoscopy for the&#xD;
      clinical suspicion appendicitis. Sample size calculation, performed by a statistician/&#xD;
      epidemiologist of the Trial Coordination Centre, showed the need to analyse 778 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): Patients operated on appendicitis in 2008 and 2009 (n=843),&#xD;
      were retrospectively analysed for negative appendectomies. This cohort will serve as the&#xD;
      control group. In this control group no intervention was given, as the LAPP score was not yet&#xD;
      defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 778 prospective analysed patients, the LAPP score will be used during a diagnostic&#xD;
      laparoscopy. With the LAPP score the investigators intend to halve the number of negative&#xD;
      appendectomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: A decrease in the negative appendectomy rate from 9% to 5%.&#xD;
      This decrease should not lead to an increase in missed appendicitis (occurring within 30&#xD;
      days), defined as requiring a surgical re-intervention or as an appendicitis or appendicular&#xD;
      infiltrate on an ultrasound or CT-scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: The risk of implementation of the LAPP score is minimal. In theory, the use of&#xD;
      the LAPP score might lead to an increase risk in missed appendicitis. This might lead to an&#xD;
      increase in morbidity.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the last decade, a laparoscopic approach for a suspicion of appendicitis has&#xD;
           become more common in surgical practice. In case the appendix looks normal the guideline&#xD;
           of the Dutch Society of Surgeons advices not to remove it. [1] The morbidity of a&#xD;
           negative appendectomy is approximately 6% and it also leads to additional costs. [2]&#xD;
           However, until recently no criteria on how to assess the appendix during a laparoscopy&#xD;
           has been published. In a recently performed pilot study the investigators defined the&#xD;
           Laparoscopic APPendectomy (LAPP) score. [3] The LAPP score is an easy applicable score&#xD;
           that can be used during a diagnostic laparoscopy to evaluate the appendix on the&#xD;
           presence or absence of 5 laparoscopic criteria on appendicitis. In our prospective&#xD;
           cohort, use of the LAPP score would have led to a positive predictive value of 99% and a&#xD;
           negative predictive value of 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The goal of the current study is to validate the LAPP score in a prospective multicenter&#xD;
           validation study. Our hypothesis is that the application of the LAPP score leads to a&#xD;
           reduction of 50% of negative appendectomies compared with a retrospective cohort in the&#xD;
           same centers. The investigators have chosen to compare the negative appendectomy rate of&#xD;
           this prospective multicenter validation study with a retrospective control group. The&#xD;
           control group consists of 843 patients operated in 5 centers in 2008 and 2009 with a&#xD;
           negative appendectomy rate of 9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The most ideal design would be a clustered center randomized trial. In such a case half&#xD;
           of the hospitals will be asked to use the LAPP score and the other half should assess&#xD;
           the appendix the conventional way. The investigators feel that it is not feasible, as&#xD;
           they already presented the LAPP score at the national congress for surgeons. In&#xD;
           addition, after publication of the results of the LAPP study surgeons might already&#xD;
           start to use the LAPP score or at least will evaluate the appendix differently than&#xD;
           before. [3]&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Objective: To reduce the negative appendectomy rate with 50% compared with the&#xD;
           retrospective control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The percentage of missed appendicitis should not exceed 1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Analyse sensitivity rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cost from used materials during the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cost form the histology review by the pathologist of a removed appendix&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prospective cohort design, multicenter prospective validation study in 778 patients&#xD;
           suspected for appendicitis with an indication for diagnostic laparoscopy. The&#xD;
           investigators expect to fulfill the inclusion within one and half year.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This cohort will be compared with a multicenter historical cohort. Each center will be&#xD;
           its own control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Population (base) All patients operated for the suspicion of acute appendicitis. The&#xD;
           preoperative work-up is not standardized for this study; therefore the investigators&#xD;
           stick to the protocol of each hospital. The clinical decision to operate the patient&#xD;
           will be made by the surgeon on call. Only patients that will undergo a (diagnostic)&#xD;
           laparoscopy can be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A total of 778 patients must be included. The investigators intend to fulfill inclusion&#xD;
           within one and a half year. This duration is based on prevalence of appendicitis in the&#xD;
           Netherlands. Annually, 16.000 appendectomies are performed, in combination with eight&#xD;
           participating centers, the investigators think this is a feasible period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size calculation The sample size calculation was performed according to the&#xD;
           methods by William D. Dupont and Walton D. Plummer (PS Power and Sample Size&#xD;
           Calculations). For the sample size calculation the investigators performed a&#xD;
           retrospective cohort analysis in 2008 and 2009 in 5 hospitals in the Netherlands&#xD;
           (Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis Assen, Nij Smellinghe Ziekenhuis Drachten, Universitair Medisch&#xD;
           Centrum Groningen, Medisch Centrum Leeuwarden and Martini Ziekenhuis Groningen). During&#xD;
           this period 843 patients were operated for the suspicion of acute appendicitis with a&#xD;
           diagnostic laparoscopy, 9% of the removed appendices turned out to be normal (appendix&#xD;
           sana). In order to half the negative appendectomy rate with a power of 0.8 and an alpha&#xD;
           of 0.05, 544 patients in the prospective group are needed. Our previous prospective&#xD;
           analysis (the LAPP study) and the retrospective data showed that approximately 15% of&#xD;
           the included patients will have another diagnosis (Crohn's disease, ruptured ovarian&#xD;
           cyst etc.), additionally the investigators expect another 15% of exclusions because for&#xD;
           example no clear laparoscopic view of the appendix (figure 1). Therefore the&#xD;
           investigators need 778 patients in our multicenter prospective validation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Important to mention, in the sample size calculation they did not take sensitivity rate&#xD;
           into account, as they expect the sensitivity will be around 100%. However, the&#xD;
           investigators will calculate this percentage and report is in the results section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 Investigational product/treatment Use of the LAPP score. The LAPP score consists of&#xD;
           5 questions concerning criteria of appendicitis, if 1 or more of these questions are&#xD;
           answered with 'yes' the appendix should be removed, if all questions are answered with&#xD;
           'no' the appendix should not be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The five questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Is there perforation and/or necrosis of the appendix;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Is the appendix thickened;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Is the mesentery of the appendix thickened;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Is there presence of injected vessels on the serosa of the appendix;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Are there any adhesions around the appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2 Use of co-intervention (if applicable) Not applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3 Escape medication (if applicable) Not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT&#xD;
&#xD;
           Not applicable, as this study concerns no research with medicinal products.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. NON-INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT&#xD;
&#xD;
           Not applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.1 Study parameters/endpoints 8.1.1 Main study parameter/endpoint The main endpoint of&#xD;
           the study is to reduce the negative appendectomy rate with 50%. The gold standard is the&#xD;
           histological examination by the pathologist. The pathologist considers the appendix as&#xD;
           inflamed when at least (local) ulceration with infiltration of polymorphonuclear&#xD;
           neutrophils into the mucosa and submucosa (endo-appendicitis) is present, either or not&#xD;
           in combination with transmural inflammation, necrosis, perforation and peri-appendicular&#xD;
           inflammation. In case of inflammation without mucosal ulceration was found, the&#xD;
           contralateral part of the appendix and more transverse slices were examined. [4] An&#xD;
           appendix is considered as normal when no signs of inflammation are found and when no&#xD;
           other abnormality is found like more rare entities as carcinoid, adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
           appendix or a parasite infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.1.2 Secondary study parameters/endpoints (if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The percentage of missed appendicitis; this should not exceed 1%. In theory the&#xD;
                LAPP score might lead to an increase in missed appendicitis. This might happen when&#xD;
                a patient has an early or mild appendicitis without any of the 5 laparoscopic&#xD;
                criteria for appendicitis. The investigators have defined 'missed appendicitis' as&#xD;
                a confirmed appendicitis or appendicular infiltrate on a CT-scan or during a&#xD;
                re-operation (within 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cost from used material during the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cost form the histology review by the pathologist of a removed appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.1.3 Other study parameters (if applicable) Not applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.2 Randomisation, blinding and treatment allocation All included patients will undergo&#xD;
           a diagnostic laparoscopy, during this procedure the LAPP score will be used and on the&#xD;
           basis of the results the appendix will be removed or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.3 Study procedures There are no additional procedures the patients will undergo during&#xD;
           this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.4 Withdrawal of individual subjects Subjects can leave the study at any time for any&#xD;
           reason if they wish to do so without any consequences. The investigator can decide to&#xD;
           withdraw a subject from the study for urgent medical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.4.1 Specific criteria for withdrawal (if applicable) For whatever reason the patient&#xD;
           is free to withdraw from the study. After the patient is asked to participate in the&#xD;
           study in the emergency department or on the surgical ward and has signed the informed&#xD;
           consent form, he/she will usually have to wait for some time before he/she is operated&#xD;
           on. In theatre the LAPP score will be used. Postoperatively the patient can still decide&#xD;
           to withdraw from the study, although the decision to remove or not to remove the&#xD;
           appendix has already been made. The patient will be prospective followed for 12 months&#xD;
           and during this period the patient can still decide to withdraw from the study, then all&#xD;
           saved data and forms will be deleted from the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.5 Replacement of individual subjects after withdrawal There is no need to replace a&#xD;
           patient that has withdrawn. In our sample size calculation the investigators anticipated&#xD;
           a 40% rate of withdrawal for several reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.6 Follow-up of subjects withdrawn from treatment These patients will have the usual&#xD;
           follow-up for patients operated on for the suspicion of appendicitis. In most case&#xD;
           patients will be seen postoperatively once or twice in the outpatient clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.7 Premature termination of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At 2 different time intervals, when 50 and 75% of the total number of patients are&#xD;
                included in the study an interim analysis will be performed. The percentage of&#xD;
                missed appendicitis will be evaluated. When the percentage of missed appendicitis&#xD;
                exceeds 2%, the study will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The percentage of missed appendicitis leading to a serious adverse event (like&#xD;
                persistent or significant disability or incapacity, life threatening or death)&#xD;
                should not exceed 1%. This will be evaluated at any time during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. SAFETY REPORTING&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.1 Section 10 WMO event In accordance to section 10, subsection 1, of the WMO, the&#xD;
      investigator will inform the subjects and the reviewing accredited METC if anything occurs,&#xD;
      on the basis of which it appears that the disadvantages of participation may be significantly&#xD;
      greater than was foreseen in the research proposal. The study will be suspended pending&#xD;
      further review by the accredited METC, except insofar as suspension would jeopardise the&#xD;
      subjects' health. The investigator will take care that all subjects are kept informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2 AEs, SAEs and SUSARs 9.2.1 Adverse events (AEs) See also section 8.7. Serious adverse&#xD;
      events caused by a missed appendicitis will be reported immediately when they occur. If a&#xD;
      missed appendicitis leads to a prolongation of hospitalization of less than 10 days the&#xD;
      investigators will consider this as an adverse event and take no further action unless this&#xD;
      exceeds 2% after inclusion of every quartile of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events like persistent or significant disability or incapacity, life threatening or&#xD;
      death will be reported immediately or at least within 7 days to the web portal&#xD;
      ToetsingOnline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events are defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during the&#xD;
      study, whether or not considered related to [the investigational product / the experimental&#xD;
      intervention]. All adverse events reported spontaneously by the subject or observed by the&#xD;
      investigaÂ¬tor or his staff will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2.2 Serious adverse events (SAEs)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in death;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is life threatening (at the time of the event);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing inpatients' hospitalisation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is a congenital anomaly or birth defect;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or&#xD;
           require hospitalization, may be considered a serious adverse experience when, based upon&#xD;
           appropriate medical judgement, the event may jeopardize the subject or may require an&#xD;
           intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will report the SAEs through the web portal ToetsingOnline to the accredited METC&#xD;
      that approved the protocol, within 15 days after the sponsor has first knowledge of the&#xD;
      serious adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAEs that result in death or are life threatening should be reported expedited. The expedited&#xD;
      reporting will occur not later than 7 days after the responsible investigator has first&#xD;
      knowledge of the adverse reaction. This is for a preliminary report with another 8 days for&#xD;
      completion of the report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2.3 Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) Not applicable for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.3 Annual safety report Not applicable for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.4 Follow-up of adverse events All AEs will be followed until they have abated, or until a&#xD;
      stable situation has been reached. Depending on the event, follow up may require additional&#xD;
      tests or medical procedures as indicated, and/or referral to the general physician or a&#xD;
      medical specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAEs need to be reported till end of study within the Netherlands, as defined in the&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
