    <textblock>
      This was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, up-titration Phase 1&#xD;
      study. Sixteen subjects in two groups (at least 40% of subjects of either male or female&#xD;
      sex), with 12 subjects in the active treatment group with an up-titration scheme from 10 to&#xD;
      100 mg, and 4 subjects in the placebo treatment group. Subjects were administered ascending&#xD;
      doses of ACT-128800/placebo once daily for 3 days at each dose level: 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 60&#xD;
      mg, 80 mg, and 100 mg.&#xD;

    <description>For each assessment, 1.5 mL of blood was collected aseptically from the subject in the supine position by venipuncture or via an intravenous. catheter placed in an antecubital vein in the arm in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid containing tubes. Immediately following collection of the required whole blood volume, the tubes were slowly tilted backwards and forwards (no shaking) to bring the anti-coagulant into solution. The anticoagulated whole blood stored at room temperature (20-25 °C) was preferably stained within 12 hours, at the latest 24 hours, and analyzed within 24 hours.
