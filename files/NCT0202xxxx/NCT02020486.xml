      This study will consist of 2 phases: Pretreatment Phase and Treatment Phase. The Pretreatment&#xD;
      Phase will have 2 time points: Screening and Baseline. Subjects will be admitted to the&#xD;
      clinical study ward the day before starting the study drug administration (Day -1) for PK and&#xD;
      safety assessments during Treatment Phase, and discharged at Day 33 (group A) and Day 47&#xD;
      (group B). Post-test will be done at Day 37 (+/-1), Day 42 (+3) (group A) and Day 51 (+/-1),&#xD;
      Day 56 (+3) (group B). Study medication will be administered with 240 mL of room temperature&#xD;
      water&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet all of the following criteria will be included in the study:&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Non-smoking, male subjects aged at least 19 years and no more than 55 years old at the&#xD;
             time of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Body Mass Index (BMI) of greater than 18 and less than or equal to 30 kg/m2 at&#xD;
             Screening. Note: BMI (kg/m2) = body weight (kg)/[height (m) x height (m)]&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and&#xD;
             their female partners are not of childbearing potential or practicing highly effective&#xD;
             contraception throughout the study period and for 30 days after study drug&#xD;
             discontinuation. No sperm donation is allowed during the study period and for 30 days&#xD;
             after study drug discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol&#xD;
