  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      REDUCE-HTN-China study is a prospective, multi-center, single cohort study for the&#xD;
      percutaneous therapeutic treatment of medication-resistant hypertension in China.The primary&#xD;
      objective is to assess the efficacy performance of the Vessix™ Renal Denervation System for&#xD;
      the treatment of medication resistant hypertension on the basis of the hypothesis that the&#xD;
      percutaneous therapeutic renal denervation for the treatment of medication-resistant&#xD;
      hypertension using the Vessix™ Renal Denervation System will reduce systolic (SBP) and&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at 6- month compared to baseline as accessed by office-based&#xD;
      blood pressure measurements.&#xD;

      The Vessix System is a highly-differentiated and advanced renal denervation system that&#xD;
      features an intuitive push-button interface, a short 30-second treatment time and an&#xD;
      over-the-wire, balloon-based approach familiar to most cardiac and vascular specialists. The&#xD;
      Vessix System has both CE Mark and TGA approval and is currently available for sale in&#xD;
      Europe, the Middle East, Australia, New Zealand and selected markets in Asia. The Vessix&#xD;
      System is an investigational device and not available for sale in China. An current analysis&#xD;
      of the REDUCE-HTN post market study affirms the device's safety profile and effective&#xD;
      treatment for resistant hypertension.&#xD;
