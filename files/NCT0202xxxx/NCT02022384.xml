  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this explorative study immunological changes during tumor therapy will be analyzed in&#xD;
      patients with malignant glioma. Immunophenotyping before and during therapy is used as&#xD;
      analysis method. Thereby immune cells are quantitatively and qualitatively detected from&#xD;
      patient's blood at continuous time points. Additionally relevant mediators like cytokines,&#xD;
      danger signals and chemokines are analyzed by other methods. Obtained results may give&#xD;
      information about the effects of therapy on immunological processes and immune cells and may&#xD;
      help to find immunological based predictive or prognostic tumor markers and to define time&#xD;
      points for including additional immune therapy in the future.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with malignant glioma generally have a bad prognosis. To improve patients' situation&#xD;
      new therapy options as well as new possibilities to determine prognosis and prediction more&#xD;
      precisely are needed. One approach is the targeted activation of the immune system to&#xD;
      recognize and eliminate tumor cells. Due to cerebral tumors the brain is no immune privileged&#xD;
      organ anymore, so that immune cells may pass the haemato-encephalic barrier to attack tumor&#xD;
      cells. This study aims to offer valuable clues about how the immune system is influenced by&#xD;
      standard therapies (radiotherapy and chemotherapy). Just with the background knowledge of&#xD;
      immune mechanisms and influencing factors by tumor therapy, an effective anti-tumor response&#xD;
      can systematically be induced by modulating immune therapy. To analyze immunological changes,&#xD;
      immunophenotyping by flow cytometry is performed with blood from patients with malignant&#xD;
      gliomas during their therapy concluding chemoradiation and chemotherapy alone. Count, class&#xD;
      and activation status of immune cells are detected by flow cytometry. Together with&#xD;
      additional analysis methods, information about immunological mediators like cytokines,&#xD;
      chemokines and danger signals can be received. For these purposes serum and plasma are&#xD;
      generated from blood samples and stored for prospective questions. The explorative determined&#xD;
      results may also help to discover new, immunological based, prognostic or predictive tumor&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
