  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading and still increasing cause of&#xD;
      disease and death worldwide, affecting those in both developed and developing countries. This&#xD;
      imparts a massive burden of ill health, in turn imposing huge healthcare costs to society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For effective treatment of COPD (as opposed to providing short term relief) early disease&#xD;
      must be targeted. The small airways of the lung (those less than 2mm) are the first affected&#xD;
      in COPD, but current methods to assess their function are relatively insensitive. There is&#xD;
      therefore a need for new, accurate methods for detection of small airway dysfunction with&#xD;
      sensitivity to shortterm change and regional discrimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous studies with hyperpolarised (HP) 3He MRI in smokers with normal pirometry and&#xD;
      patients with early stage COPD, we showed sensitivity to early changes in lung ventilation&#xD;
      and structure. The hyperpolarised gas MRI technique is safe. In particular, the lack of&#xD;
      ionizing radiation permits patients to be imaged on multiple occasions. This and its inherent&#xD;
      sensitivity to regional lung ventilation and function make it an ideal imaging tool for the&#xD;
      assessment of novel lung therapies for diseases of the small airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine short and long term reproducibility of a&#xD;
      comprehensive set of functional imaging data; using hyperpolarised gas MRI, conventional MRI&#xD;
      and lung physiology measurements in patients with moderate to severe COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition,how sensitive the imaging techniques are to changes in lung function after&#xD;
      treatment with a standard (bronchodilator) inhaler will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will serve as a platform for future larger scale studies, aimed at better&#xD;
      understanding of and intervention in early COPD.&#xD;

In addition,how sensitive the imaging techniques are to changes in lung function after treatment with a standard (bronchodilator) inhaler will also be assessed (the bronchodilator foradil is a non-investigative medicinal product as it is a medicine with a known effect which will be used to induce a known response).&#xD;

        Patients will be recruited from COPD clinics in Sheffield, the surrounding area and the&#xD;
        nurse-led clinics running alongside them, by open advertisement, after pulmonary&#xD;
        rehabilitation, and via invitation by their local GP. The target is to recruit 6 subjects&#xD;
        within 4 months.&#xD;
