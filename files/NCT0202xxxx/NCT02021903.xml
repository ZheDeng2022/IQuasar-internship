  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is observed in 30 to 50 % of patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (PD) patients, Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). It&#xD;
      is a major complain and represents a socially relevant problem as unintended episodes of&#xD;
      sleep can also occur while driving for example. Arterial hypotension is frequently observed&#xD;
      in patients with PD, DLB and MSA and considered as a marker of autonomic failure. Sleepiness&#xD;
      is known to occur preferentially when patients are having arterial hypotension whatever the&#xD;
      cause (i.e. postprandial period, administration of hypotensive medication such as dopamine&#xD;
      agonists). We hypothesize that arterial hypotension is associated with abnormal sleepiness.&#xD;
      We have observed this association in an on-going epidemiological survey Hyperglycaemia&#xD;
      induced by oral glucose load - a standardized model simulating food intake during a meal -&#xD;
      provokes arterial hypotension in the majority of Parkinson's disease patients with&#xD;
      dysautonomia. It can be hypothesised that sleep attacks in these patients could be mediated&#xD;
      by this fall in blood pressure.&#xD;

      Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is observed in 30 to 50 % of patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (PD) patients, Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). It&#xD;
      is a major complain and represents a socially relevant problem as unintended episodes of&#xD;
      sleep can also occur while driving for example. The exact pathophysiology of EDS in PD, DLB&#xD;
      and MSA has not been fully elucidated so far, although pharmacological factors (dopaminergic&#xD;
      medications) and pathological factors (neurodegeneration of sleep-wakefulness regulatory&#xD;
      areas) have been identified. Arterial hypotension is frequently observed in patients with PD,&#xD;
      DLB and MSA and considered as a marker of autonomic failure. Sleepiness is known to occur&#xD;
      preferentially when patients are having arterial hypotension whatever the cause (i.e.&#xD;
      postprandial period, administration of hypotensive medication such as dopamine agonists). We&#xD;
      hypothesize that arterial hypotension is associated with abnormal sleepiness. We have&#xD;
      observed this association in an on-going epidemiological survey (COPARK Cohort of 800 PD&#xD;
      patients, manuscript in preparation). Hyperglycaemia induced by oral glucose load - a&#xD;
      standardized model simulating food intake during a meal - provokes arterial hypotension in&#xD;
      the majority of Parkinson's disease patients with dysautonomia. It can be hypothesised that&#xD;
