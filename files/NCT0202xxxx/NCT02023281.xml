      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of exercise on the symptoms of depression&#xD;
      using serum levels of serotonin, catecholamine's, Alpha EEG asymmetry, and self-report of&#xD;
      symptoms as markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an attempt to further understand the mechanisms of improved mood through exercise; this&#xD;
      study will examine the known factors that contribute to depressed mood in a single study&#xD;
      using serotonin and catecholamine levels via blood serum and EEG slow wave asymmetry. Such&#xD;
      information can be useful in understanding the overall neurological components of depression&#xD;
      and the effects of exercise on the brain in depressed individuals that would make the&#xD;
      prescription of exercise a viable treatment option.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an increasing demand for clinical effective, safe, and cost conscious forms of&#xD;
      treatment for depression. Research shows depression to account for the largest decrease in&#xD;
      overall health compared to asthma, angina, arthritis, and diabetes (Maussavi, 2007). The cost&#xD;
      of lost productivity at work due to depression is a new focus of research as no current and&#xD;
      accurate numbers exist. Stewart, Ricci, Hahn, &amp; Morganstein (2013) were among the first to&#xD;
      examine this issue and found that lost productivity due to depression cost an estimated $44&#xD;
      billion dollars per year in spite of current medical treatments commonly prescribed. The lost&#xD;
      productivity among those with depression and the low level of treatment suggest that there&#xD;
      may be cost effective opportunities for improving depression outcomes within the general&#xD;
      workforce and society at large.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question of value regarding the use of exercise as a treatment for depression has&#xD;
      remained a source of investigation in recent years. In cooperation with Centra Health and&#xD;
      Liberty University, this study seeks to understand the mechanisms that make exercise a viable&#xD;
      treatment in depression by examining self-report of symptoms, serum levels of serotonin and&#xD;
      catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrin, and dopamine) and frontal slow wave EEG activity&#xD;
      as markers. Although these markers have been examined individually in previous studies, this&#xD;
      is the only known study that examines each of these components in a single study. Such&#xD;
      information can be useful in understanding the overall neurological components of depression&#xD;
      and the effects of exercise on the brain in depressed individuals that would make the&#xD;
      prescription of exercise a viable treatment in depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple trials, meta-analyses, and reviews have been conducted in the attempt to clarify the&#xD;
      use of exercise in depressed patients. Research has shown that exercise as a treatment may&#xD;
      result in fewer relapses than sertraline (Strohle, 2009). Similar results are indicated when&#xD;
      exercise is prescribed as an adjunct treatment with psychotherapy (Balon, Sidhu, &amp; Pankhuree,&#xD;
      2009; Blumenthal, Smith, &amp; Hoffman, 2012; Gill, Womack, &amp; Safranek, 2010). Preliminary&#xD;
      characteristics of the ideal dosage of exercise as a treatment have been researched, although&#xD;
      a definitive dose-response curve has yet to be produced (Callaghan, Khalil, Morres, &amp; Carter,&#xD;
      2011; Perraton, Kumar, &amp; Machotka, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalographic (EEG) scans have been shown to demonstrate a left frontal bias in&#xD;
      alpha (8-12 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) wave activity (Allen, Urry, Hitt, &amp; Coan, 2004; Demos,&#xD;
      2005; Iosifescu et al., 2008; Nissen et al., 2006). The up-training or down-training of&#xD;
      individual bandwidths in the treatment of depression, anxiety, ADHD, and traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury have long been established (La Vaque, 2002). Although there are no established norms&#xD;
      for neurotransmitter levels, we know through clinical medication trials that the inhibition&#xD;
      of the reuptake of serotonin and or norepinephrine improve mood. Previous studies examining&#xD;
      low levels of serotonin and decreased mood have found a correlation between exercise and&#xD;
      increased serotonin availability without the use of pharmaceuticals (Chaouloff et al., 1985;&#xD;
      Ernst, Olsen, Pinel, Lam, &amp; Christie, 2006; Jacobs &amp; Fornal, 1999). More routine type studies&#xD;
      often use neurotransmitter levels as markers (Lande, Williams, Fileta, 2012; Lidberg, Tuck,&#xD;
      Asberg, Scalia-Tomba, &amp; Bertilsson, 1985; Mann &amp; Stanley, 1984).&#xD;
