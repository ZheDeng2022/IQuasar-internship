  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients, age ≥ 18 years, with clinically diagnosed mild, moderate or severe brain&#xD;
      trauma will be asked to participate in the study. This prospective database will consist of&#xD;
      400 subjects with TBI, 200 from both TUCH and Cambridge Addenbrooke's Hospital. In addition,&#xD;
      100 controls will be recruited, with 50 from both centres.This study is a prospective&#xD;
      clinical observational study with detailed data collecting. All patients will be treated&#xD;
      according to the accepted, standardized, existing guidelines that are based on national and&#xD;
      international recommendations. New treatment interventions will NOT be evaluated during the&#xD;
      data acquisition for this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim in this study is to collect large amounts of data in adult subject population, who have&#xD;
      suffered mild, moderate or severe brain trauma. This data will be added up to the existing&#xD;
      large TBI databases from IMPACT as well as to the retrospective brain trauma data sets&#xD;
      collected at the Turku University Hospital after the year 1995 and to the prospectively&#xD;
      collected existing data set from the University of Cambridge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will contain patient characteristics, injury mechanisms, and patients' physiological&#xD;
      status and findings immediately after the incident as well as through the processes of&#xD;
      diagnostics, emergency treatment and in-hospital care. All data during these phases will&#xD;
      follow the recommendations of Common Data Elements (advanced version) in TBI studies by the&#xD;
      IMPACT investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate head CT will be performed according to the existing guidelines, and head MRI with&#xD;
      modern techniques as soon as the patient's wellbeing will allow the imaging to be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intensive care unit (ICU) visit a database of EEG signals will be collected and&#xD;
      the relevant information components will be extracted to provide inputs for the care decision&#xD;
      algorithm. The aim is to investigate the feasibility of continuous EEG monitoring on the&#xD;
      detection of epileptic seizures and other adverse events to enable rapid intervention during&#xD;
      the patient's ICU stay and to improve outcome prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also search new metabolomic, lipidomic, and genetic biomarkers related&#xD;
      to TBIs through analyzing blood samples drawn in different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on all these factors, simulation models will be brought up as to help clinicians&#xD;
      determine the earliest possible prognosis and to decide, whether patient would benefit from a&#xD;
      particular care during the acute phase of a TBI.&#xD;

        Adult patients, age ≥ 18 years, with clinically diagnosed mild, moderate or severe brain&#xD;
        trauma will be asked to participate in the study. If such possible subjects are either&#xD;
        unconscious, sedated or confused to the extent, that no personal decisions can be drawn,&#xD;
        her next of kin will be asked for the permission to include the subject in question to the&#xD;
        study. Control group subjects will be patients with acute orthopaedic injuries without any&#xD;
        signs of eventual concomitant brain trauma of any degree. The source populations will&#xD;
        consist of citizens from the local catchment areas of the participating centres.&#xD;
