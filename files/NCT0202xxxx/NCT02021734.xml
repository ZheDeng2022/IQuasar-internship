      There are certain categories of diseases which are more prevalent in the Arab world due to&#xD;
      increased rates of consanguinity in relatively isolated populations. The goal is to discover&#xD;
      these mutations by using next-generation human genetics tools. These include high-throughput&#xD;
      sequencing and genotyping along with the necessary bioinformatics analyses that will lead to&#xD;
      the discovery of the causes of most inherited diseases in the region.The secondary objective&#xD;
      will be to build a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variation in the Arab world. This will&#xD;
      include all detected mutations, not only the subset that are causing disease (from primary&#xD;
      objective), but also known trait-altering mutations as well as general diversity on the DNA&#xD;
      level among human populations of this region. This catalogue can become a widely useful&#xD;
      resource for many projects down the road, as it relies on anonymizing individual samples and&#xD;
      instead displaying data in aggregate as the cohorts of collected samples grow over the years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include all genetic disorders from all ethnic backgrounds but Mendelian&#xD;
      disease for which a gene mutation has already been identified will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of Mendelian Transmission determined by fulfilling one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple affected family members (at least first degree relative with disease) History of&#xD;
      consanguinity Severe disease in newborn in the absence of family history Sydromic disease in&#xD;
      single individuals Congenital abnormality affecting major organ system(s) Mendelianized&#xD;
      extremes of common disease (eg sever familial diabetes/ obesity/ hypertension)&#xD;
