      The objective of this proposal is to advance medication development for alcoholism by&#xD;
      conducting a safety and initial efficacy study of ibudilast, a neuroimmune modulator and&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase inhibitor, for alcohol use disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol dependence (AD) is a chronic and relapsing condition affecting 10 million Americans.&#xD;
      To date, only four pharmacotherapies are approved by the FDA for the treatment of alcoholism&#xD;
      and their efficacy is modest. Therefore, medication development for AD represents a high&#xD;
      priority area. Ibudilast (IBUD) is a glial cell modulator that inhibits phosphodiesterases&#xD;
      (PDE) -4 and -10 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Preclinical data suggest&#xD;
      that neuroimmune modulation is critical to the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse,&#xD;
      including alcohol. Further, IBUD has been shown to enhance GDNF release in vivo and GDNF&#xD;
      modulation has been implicated in alcohol reinstatement in animals, while PDE inhibition has&#xD;
      been shown to reduce alcohol intake in mice. Together, these findings suggest that&#xD;
      neuroimmune modulation constitutes a novel target for the treatment of alcoholism. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to advance medication development for alcoholism by conducting an&#xD;
      initial Phase II study of IBUD for AD. Specifically, the proposed study consists of a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subject crossover design to determine the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and initial human laboratory efficacy of IBUD in a sample of 24&#xD;
      non-treatment seeking individuals with either alcohol abuse or dependence treated with IBUD&#xD;
      (50mg BID) and placebo. Participants will complete two separate 7-day inpatient stays at the&#xD;
      UCLA CTRC during which they will take the study medication, complete an IV alcohol challenge,&#xD;
      and take part in a stress-exposure and cue-exposure paradigms. Specific aims are to test&#xD;
      whether IBUD (a) is safe in the context of alcohol administration, (b) attenuates&#xD;
      alcohol-induced reinforcement, and (c) dampens stress-induced and cue-induced alcohol&#xD;
      craving. In sum, this study will efficiently evaluate safety and initial efficacy of IBUD&#xD;
      thereby screening novel medications for AD and elucidating potential mechanisms by which IBUD&#xD;
      may be clinically efficacious. Results from this study will inform whether a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of IBUD for alcoholism is warranted.&#xD;
