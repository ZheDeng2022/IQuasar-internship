  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the effects of smoking shisha on the lungs, when&#xD;
      compared to the effects of smoking cigarettes or of not smoking. The investigators hope to&#xD;
      learn more about how shisha smokers should be monitored and treated once diseased.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional shisha smoking is practiced by ~10% of the Qatari adult population. Although&#xD;
      based on tobacco leaves, shisha smoking exposes the airway epithelium to a chemical insult of&#xD;
      intensity and duration different from that of cigarette smoking. This study, a collaboration&#xD;
      between WCMC-Qatar and WCMC-New York and the Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), is focused on&#xD;
      defining the biology of the airway epithelium of shisha smokers compared to non-smokers.&#xD;
      Using approved protocols, bronchoscopy will be used to sample the airway epithelium, the site&#xD;
      of the earliest changes associated with smoking. The transcriptome of the recovered&#xD;
      epithelium will be assessed in the genomic core WCMC-Qatar for gene expression using&#xD;
      microarrays and complete RNA sequencing using massive parallel sequencing.Based on this&#xD;
      information, the epithelial DNA will be assessed for relevant SNPs, copy number variations&#xD;
      and methylation status. Parallel studies will be carried out in cigarette smokers, providing&#xD;
      a comprehensive catalog of shisha smoking-induced changes compared to cigarette smokers and&#xD;
      non-smokers in this population.&#xD;

    <description>We will measure the effect that shisha smoking has on the small airway epithelium (SAE) by measuring parameters such as the SAE gene expression in shisha smokers (i.e., non-cigarette smokers). We will compare these parameters to the same parameters measured in non-smokers and cigarette smokers.</description>
