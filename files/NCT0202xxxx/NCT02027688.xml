    <textblock>
      Preterm infants face many feeding challenges during hospitalization which can prolong&#xD;
      hospitalization, raise parental anxiety and can lead to medical instability. The Feeding&#xD;
      Progression study will randomize preterm infants to one of two currently accepted oral&#xD;
      feeding schedules; oral feed attempts every 3 hours or every 6 hours. The study will collect&#xD;
      data on oral feeding success, milk transfer, sucking strength, growth and medical&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are at high risk for feeding issues. Feeding difficulties lead to prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization, increase medical complications and raise parental anxiety. The transition&#xD;
      from tube feeding to oral feeding is an especially important step in a preterm infant's early&#xD;
      life. Currently, there is limited evidence to guide this transition. There are two commonly&#xD;
      used schedules for transitioning preterm infants to oral feeding: an every 6 hour schedule&#xD;
      and an every 3 hour schedule. However, there is currently no evidence to guide providers in&#xD;
      their choice of oral feeding schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to explore whether an every 6 (q6) hour oral feeding&#xD;
      schedule will improve time to full oral feedings as compared to an every 3 (q3) hour oral&#xD;
      feeding schedule. The secondary objectives are to test whether every 6 hour feeding allows&#xD;
      for improved medical stability and oral-motor coordination as compared to the other commonly&#xD;
      used q3 hour schedule. Each infant will be randomly assigned to a q6 hour or q3 hour oral&#xD;
      feeding schedule. Data on oral feeding progression, respiratory status and oral motor&#xD;
      proficiency will be collected and compared. The study will collect data on how long it takes&#xD;
      each infant to get to full oral feeds, respiratory status throughout their time of oral&#xD;
      feeding, whether there were any episodes of medical complications, measures of oral motor&#xD;
      feeding skills, and the time to discharge from the hospital. This study is a crucial first&#xD;
      step towards determining which feeding schedule is optimal for preterm infants to ensure&#xD;
      timely attainment of full oral feeds and hospital discharge without compromising medical&#xD;
      stability.&#xD;
