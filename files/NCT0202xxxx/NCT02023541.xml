    <description>We will calculate descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.) for all QOL data (EQ-5D, SF-12) in addition to other PROs (depressive symptoms, social support) at each evaluation period. Univariate tests will explore the associations among QOL and PROs using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher's exact test for correlation. Changes over time in QOL and PROs will be analyzed utilizing repeated-measures modeling techniques (repeated measures analysis of covariance).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically documented adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the cervical or&#xD;
             thoracic esophagus or gastroesophageal junction or cardia of stomach.&#xD;
