  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research the genetic and biomechanical markers of human adipose tissue on patients with&#xD;
      morbid obesity. Additional tissue/fluid collection is also gathered during the time of&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      Study participation by invitation after complete pre-surgical work up at UC Davis Health&#xD;
      System. Patients will be invited to participate if they meet all inclusion criteria's after&#xD;
      completing all necessary clinical visits including lab studies, counseling, and participation&#xD;
      in educational programs. During the pre-operative visit patients interested in participation&#xD;
      will complete all necessary consent documentation. Pre-operative labs (blood and urine) will&#xD;
      be collected along with additional blood, urine, and fecal samples will be collected&#xD;
      pre-operatively. During surgery (Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgeries only) tissue collection&#xD;
      will include subcutaneous &amp; omental fat, jejunum, and liver biopsy. Post surgery patient will&#xD;
      be observed for weight loss and resolution of co-morbidities. At designated times post&#xD;
      surgery when lab studies are ordered additional blood/urine samples will be collected and&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
