      This study will seek to determine if 1) the manual unloading test is reliable, and 2)if the&#xD;
      immediate response to traction can be determined by using a simple unloading test in&#xD;
      standing. The study wil be completed in two parts: 1) a small pilot sample (n=10) to asses&#xD;
      both intra and inter tester reliability, and 2) a consecutive sample of 30 patients with low&#xD;
      back pain which does not travel below the knee. All subjects will rate their pain on a 100 mm&#xD;
      line both at rest and in their most painful direction of movement. A therapist will then&#xD;
      unload the patients spine to determine if they feel any relief. All subjects will then&#xD;
      undergo a 15 minute bout of intermittent lumbar traction, 30 sec on, 10 sec off at up to 50%&#xD;
      body weight. Following traction, all subjects will again rate their pain on a 100 mm line.&#xD;
      Subjects will be grouped by response to the initial manual unloading test and assessed for&#xD;
      within and between group differences. The study hypothesis is that the manual unloading test&#xD;
      is reliable, and that responders to mechanical traction can be accurately identified using a&#xD;
      manual unloading test.&#xD;

      This study will consist of two distinct components. Part one will be a reliability study of&#xD;
      manual unloading. Two therapists, both familiar with the technique of manual unloading as&#xD;
      described by Kaltenborn17, will perform a manual unloading test, blinded to the previous&#xD;
      results. Ten consecutive patients will be recruited from a sample of convenience at the&#xD;
      University Of Connecticut Health Center Department Of Rehabilitation. This test will be&#xD;
      repeated on the same subjects within 7 days of initial testing. Tests of agreement will then&#xD;
      be applied to determine intra and inter-rater reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part two will consist of a trial of lumbar traction in a group of subjects with low back pain&#xD;
      without radiculopathy, anticipated n=30. At the time of enrollment, all subjects will&#xD;
      complete a standardized informed consent form, detailing all potential risks of the trail.&#xD;
      Consent will include permission for demographic data to be obtained from the standard intake&#xD;
      form, and kept in a de-identified form in a secure location. All subjects will complete a&#xD;
      screening form, which will ensure that the potential subjects do not have any of the&#xD;
      excluding factors present. Prior to enrollment, all subjects will complete a standardized&#xD;
      medical history form (kept as part of the medical record for all patients), as part of&#xD;
      standard departmental practice. Additionally, participants will complete a modified Oswestry&#xD;
      questionnaire as well as two 100 mm visual analog scales (VAS), one indicating pain at rest,&#xD;
      the other indicating pain in their most provocative test motion (flexion, extension, or side&#xD;
      flexion of the lumbar spine). Subjects will then be tested with unloading in standing as&#xD;
      described by Kaltenborn. This test involves the therapist applying a low grade lifting force&#xD;
      to the patient in a standing position, testing for symptomatic alleviation via the&#xD;
      elimination of compression on pain sensitive structures. Results of this test will be coded&#xD;
      as (+) relief or (-) relief. Prior to traction application, subjects will undergo a&#xD;
      standardized, comprehensive examination (standard of care), which will include screening for&#xD;
      exclusion criteria (myotomal weakness, sensation changes, positive neural tension signs). All&#xD;
      subjects will be weighed prior to traction application to determine treatment force to be&#xD;
      generated. To aid in determining BMI, subjects will also have their height measured. The&#xD;
      reference test will consist of a single application of mechanical traction, 15 minutes, 30&#xD;
      seconds on/ 10 seconds off, at 50% of body weight with the treatment table in the opened&#xD;
      position, while positioned in a supine, hook lying neutral posture. Post traction, all&#xD;
      subjects will repeat AROM measures, and complete a second pair of VAS to determine immediate&#xD;
      effect of the intervention.&#xD;
