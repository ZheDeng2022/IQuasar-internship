      The primary objective of the protocol is to define percentage of patients with acromegaly in&#xD;
      relation to the total number of screened patients with confirmed clinically significant set&#xD;
      of associated somatic disorders with the help of laboratory (Insulin-like Growth Factor I,&#xD;
      Growth Hormone, Oral Glucose-Tolerance Test [IGF-1, GH, OGTT]) and instrumental examination&#xD;
      methods (Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI]).&#xD;

    <description>Acromegaly is an acquired pathological condition related to excessive production of growth hormone and characterized by somatic disfigurement and multiple systemic manifestations. The percentage of participants with acromegaly was determined in participants with a confirmed clinically significant set of associated somatic disorders using biochemical assays (IGF-1, GH, OGTT) and instrumental examination methods (MRI).</description>

    <time_frame>Participants were screened over approximately 21 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were counted as having a microadenomas or macroadenomas if they had at least one microadenoma or macroadenoma during the study. Microadenoma is a benign pituitary tumour size &lt;=10 millimeter (mm) and macroadenoma is a benign pituitary tumour size &gt;10 mm. The percentage of participants with microadenomas and macroadenomas registered during pituitary MRI examination were reported.</description>

    <description>Acromegaly diagnosed based on a clinically significant set of associated somatic disorders and was assessed by logistic regression and canonical discriminant analysis. The likelihood of acromegaly diagnosis, based on a clinically significant set of associated somatic disorders (predictors) was assessed by logistic regression and canonical discriminant analysis. To investigate the extent to which each of the somatic disorders poses a risk factor for acromegaly diagnosis, all predictor variables were entered into each analysis. The percentage of participants predicted to have acromegaly or not is presented for the logistic regression analysis and the canonical discriminant analysis.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a non-interventional cross-sectional survey conducted at 2 clinical sites in Russia between 05 December 2013 and 15 September 2015. This survey did not involve any intervention into routine clinical practice, including the use of any investigational therapy or special examination methods.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Adults with somatic disorders associated with acromegaly who were observed as out-patients were eligible, and 367 participants were enrolled in the survey focused on early acromegaly diagnosis. Participants previously diagnosed with acromegaly were excluded.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>All Participants</title>
          <description>Participants did not receive any investigational therapy or special examination methods. Participants screening was implemented in the following stages:&#xD;
Questioning stage: Participant's and Investigator's questionnaires. Based on the outcome of this stage, participants proceeded to the stage of examination to confirm acromegaly using biochemical assays.&#xD;
Stage of examination: Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) level was measured. In case of increased IGF-1 level, growth hormone (GH) test before and after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was conducted. If acromegaly was confirmed, pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast was made.</description>

        <description>Participants were counted as having a microadenomas or macroadenomas if they had at least one microadenoma or macroadenoma during the study. Microadenoma is a benign pituitary tumour size &lt;=10 millimeter (mm) and macroadenoma is a benign pituitary tumour size &gt;10 mm. The percentage of participants with microadenomas and macroadenomas registered during pituitary MRI examination were reported.</description>

Questioning stage: Participant's and Investigator's questionnaires. Based on the outcome of this stage, participants proceeded to the stage of examination to confirm acromegaly using biochemical assays.&#xD;
Stage of examination: IGF-1 level was measured. In case of increased IGF-1 level, GH test before and after OGTT was conducted. If acromegaly was confirmed, pituitary MRI with contrast was made.</description>

The likelihood of acromegaly diagnosis, based on a clinically significant set of associated somatic disorders (predictors) was assessed by logistic regression and canonical discriminant analysis. To investigate the extent to which each of the somatic disorders poses a risk factor for acromegaly diagnosis, all predictor variables were entered into each analysis.
