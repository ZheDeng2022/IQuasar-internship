  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 5-year long-term follow-up study of open label, single-center, phase I clinical&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PNEUMOSTEM® in premature infants with&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common cause of death for prematurely born&#xD;
      babies with low birth weights. In addition, many children who recover from this disease&#xD;
      suffer from various complications such as prolonged hospitalization, pulmonary hypertension,&#xD;
      and failure to thrive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) can&#xD;
      differentiate into pulmonary epithelial and pulmonary endothelial cells. Some animal studies&#xD;
      showed that BM-MSCs differentiate into bronchial cells and type 2 pneumocytes in rats with&#xD;
      pneumonia and improve the fibrosis that occur after administration of bleomycin. Based on the&#xD;
      findings, it is considered that mesenchymal stem cell therapy can help regenerate the damaged&#xD;
      lung as well as BPD that cause lung inflammation, fibrosis, deficiency of type 2 pneumocytes,&#xD;
      and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PNEUMOSTEM® consists of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells and is&#xD;
      intended to treat BPD in premature infants. The purpose of the study is to evaluate 3-5 year&#xD;
      long term safety and efficacy in patients who completed the earlier part of the phase I&#xD;
      clinical trial of PNEUMOSTEM®.&#xD;
