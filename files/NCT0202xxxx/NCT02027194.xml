      The aim of this study is to test and compare the effectiveness between three groups -&#xD;
      Cure-Allergic Rhinitis Syrup (CS), Yuk ping fung San (YS) and placebo groups - of adolescents&#xD;
      (nursing students) with Allergic Rhinitis (AR) in improving their symptoms of AR, body&#xD;
      constitution pattern and health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ The hypothesis are to test the effectiveness of the CS treatment on these students' AR&#xD;
      symptoms and quality of life at immediately, one month and two months after completion of the&#xD;
      4-week intervention, when compared with the YS treatment and placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cure-Allergic Rhinitis Syrup (CS) group will show significantly reduction of AR symptoms&#xD;
           over the 2-month follow-up, when compared to those in YS and placebo groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CS group will indicate a healthier body constitution pattern over the follow-up, when&#xD;
           compared to those with YS and placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CS group will indicate significantly greater improvement of their quality of life over&#xD;
           2-month follow-up, when compared to those with YS and placebo group.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rhinitis (AR) is one of the most concerned public health problems worldwide, resulting&#xD;
           from an inflammation of nasal membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nursing students is one of the high risk groups, particularly when performing clinical&#xD;
           practicum in hospitals in which they would contact with multiple allergens such as&#xD;
           micro-organisms, detergents, chemical agents, and frequently used powdered latex gloves.&#xD;
           More than 10% of these adolescents would present consistent AR symptoms such as nasal&#xD;
           congestion, sneezing and sleep problems and In turn, these symptoms could affect their&#xD;
           quality of life and academic performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-compliance to medication or refusals to medical advice was common due to lack of&#xD;
           efficacy, side effects, fear of being habit-forming, and/or expensive medical costs; and&#xD;
           thus many preferred an alternative therapy for improved symptoms and bodily condition,&#xD;
           and even full recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chinese medicine treats the disease from the root, which is a complementary and&#xD;
           alternative approach for holistic convalescence by changing unhealthy body constitution&#xD;
           (health status) to healthy. However, little scientific evidence has been established for&#xD;
           the treatment of AR with Chinese herbal medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study aims to test the effects of two alternative treatments of Chinese herbal&#xD;
           medicine, including Cure-Allergic Rhinitis Syrup (CS) and Yuk ping fung San, when&#xD;
           compared with a placebo (i.e., wheat syrup with similar taste and smell) group, in&#xD;
           reducing university nursing students' AR symptom severity and improving their quality of&#xD;
           life and body constitution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A double-blind randomized controlled trial with repeated-measures, three parallel groups&#xD;
           design is adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment and follow-ups would be taken place in an Integrative Health Clinic of The&#xD;
           University under study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stratified random sampling method in terms of the students' years of illness onset and&#xD;
           gender has been used to allocate the subjects into one of the three study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants, assessor and researcher are concealed and blinded to the random group&#xD;
           allocation, which would be performed by an independent clinic nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to maintain complete blinding, a clinic nurse will also administer the herbal&#xD;
           medicine and keep the name list locked, and thus being confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants would be recruited from all of five full-time undergraduate nursing&#xD;
           programs in School of Nursing of The University. After their eligibility for inclusion&#xD;
           checked and baseline measurement performed with informed consent obtained, the&#xD;
           participants would be grouped in terms of duration of the illness (0-2 years, 2-5 years&#xD;
           and 5 or above years) and gender and then each would draw one labeled card from an&#xD;
           opaque envelope (1=CS, 2=YS and 3=Placebo) from the clinic nurse to allocate them into&#xD;
           one of the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life and symptom severity would be measured with self-administered&#xD;
           questionnaires, and body constitution assessment would be performed by an Traditional&#xD;
           Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioner, at baseline and immediately, one-month and&#xD;
           three-month after the 4-week intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All full-time nursing students in The University under study who met the inclusion&#xD;
           criteria and voluntary to participate in this study are the potential subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size calculation has been calculated in the basis of similar Chinese herbal&#xD;
           medicine effects in improving AR symptoms (primary outcome) in previous studies. Total&#xD;
           sample size is 195 (n=65 per group) using G-Power based on the effect sizes (0.45) of&#xD;
           two similar recent studies (Jung, 2011; Yang, 2010). Taking account of about 20%&#xD;
           drop-outs, the estimated sample size becomes 234, thus 78 participants in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cure-Allergic Rhinitis Syrup (CS) and Yuk ping fung San (YS) are adopted as the two&#xD;
           alternative treatments to be tested in this study, while the placebo group will be the&#xD;
           controls in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication will be produced and provided by the researcher. CS contains 12 Chinese&#xD;
           herbal medicines in one formula, combining 3 classical ancient formula of herbal&#xD;
           medicine that are commonly used to enhance healthy body constitution. YS contains 6&#xD;
           herbal medicines, which are commonly used for AR treatment, while the placebo contains&#xD;
           wheat powder, sugar and spicy taste of food (ginger).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Boiling methods for CS and YS are the same, in which the herbal medicines will be boiled&#xD;
           with 2000 ml of water for two hours after cleansing to about 500 ml herbal concoction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants would be asked to take 20 ml per dosage on each day, by diluting two spoons&#xD;
           with a half cup of water either in the morning or at night, at their convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One bottle for two-week dosage would be offered after the first assessment at&#xD;
           recruitment; and another bottle for the remaining 2-week dosage would be given during&#xD;
           the first follow-up by the end of 2nd week (Interim assessment). Each participant would&#xD;
           have to take in total of four weeks herbal medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical issues&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethical approval of this study will be obtained from the Human Subjects Research Ethics&#xD;
           Sub-committee of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written informed consent will be obtained from the respondents to show their willingness&#xD;
           of participation. In order to enhance full understanding of the study before&#xD;
           participation, an information sheet to describe in more details about the aim and&#xD;
           procedure of the study will be given with explanations before signing the written&#xD;
           consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study data and participant identity are kept anonymous and confidential. Data collected&#xD;
           are limited in access by the researcher and clinic nurse for study purpose only. The&#xD;
           data will be destroyed after completion of the study and thesis writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Precaution of adverse effects would be taken on the herbal medicine selection&#xD;
           (double-checked by an independent TCM practitioner), medicine formation (agreed by at&#xD;
           least two TCM practitioners), time of boiling, and interim assessment (by one TCM&#xD;
           practitioner) and weekly or bi-weekly face-to-face or telephone follow-ups (by the&#xD;
           researcher). Students are reminded of reporting any discomfort and asking questions&#xD;
           about the illness and the study. They are given the contact telephone of the researcher&#xD;
           and would be referred to Western medicine or TCM practitioner for follow-up, as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All herbal medicine items should be within normal and recommended dosage. Any toxic&#xD;
           effect of the herbal medicines used is reduced by long boiling and minimal dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before random group allocation, all participants are assessed and confirmed with the&#xD;
           body constitution pattern(s) by one TCM practitioner and history of allergy to herbal&#xD;
           medicines, particularly those items adopted in the study, will be checked. Those with&#xD;
           such allergies, inappropriate body constitution for the herbal medicines used, or very&#xD;
           poor body condition, would be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring of exceptional allergy such as skin rash and related discomforts would be&#xD;
           performed over the first 2 weeks of syrup intake. At the end of the 1st and 3rd week of&#xD;
           intervention, the researcher would phone up each participant to ask about any concern or&#xD;
           discomfort experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring the health parameters such as body temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate,&#xD;
           respiratory rate, and urine for routine testing to assess and understand the&#xD;
           participants' health condition and detect possible adverse effect of herbal medicines&#xD;
           during interim assessment (2nd week of intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although very low risk for adverse events (&lt;0.1%), the researcher would terminate the&#xD;
           herbal medicine used and ask the participant to attend Accident and Emergency Department&#xD;
           immediately if any found such as serious allergy, skin rash or any illness such as fever&#xD;
           or systemic infection, which might be related to signs of over reinforcement of Yang&#xD;
           inside the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The TCM practitioner will also monitor any uncommon effects on renal and liver functions&#xD;
           such as diarrhea, urinary tract infection, pain, and skin rash in the 2nd and 4th week&#xD;
           assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
           o 60 items of Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire can assess the&#xD;
           participants' body constitution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life and symptom severity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The 28-item Rhino-conjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire is adopted to&#xD;
                evaluate the participants' level of quality of life; and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The same questionnaire is also used for assessing their symptoms severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective assessment of nasal symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peak Nasal Inspiration Flow Meter will be adopted to monitor the nasal symptom&#xD;
           (blockage)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic and other clinical information Pilot Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fifteen participants (i.e. five nursing students in each of three study groups) would be&#xD;
           recruited for a pilot study. The pilot study is conducted with the same procedure of TCM&#xD;
           assessment, and herbal medicines used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection with all the questionnaires, health assessment, follow-ups and data&#xD;
           analysis will be performed similar to the main study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Purposes of the pilot study are to test the feasibility and procedure of the study,&#xD;
           evaluate the validity and reliability of the questionnaires, examine any possible&#xD;
           difficulty in sample recruitment and data collection, as well as check the estimated&#xD;
           sample size used in the main study. Very minor amendments or modifications have been&#xD;
           made on the procedure of the main study according to its results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection would be performed at four time points: baseline measurement (Time 1) at&#xD;
           recruitment and three post-tests (Times 2-4) (immediately, and 1-month and 3-month&#xD;
           following the interventions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline assessment would be done to determine the eligibility for participant enrolment&#xD;
           (making diagnosis of AR and differentiating their body constitution) and performing&#xD;
           baseline measurements (mainly symptom severity, quality of life and body constitution)&#xD;
           for the study. After 2-week interim assessment and 4-week intervention, subsequent three&#xD;
           post-tests would be performed using the same sets of questionnaires for evaluation of&#xD;
           treatment effect and comparison between and within groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All assessments and data collection procedures would be performed in the Integrated&#xD;
           Health Clinic, the participants will self-administer the study questionnaires, be&#xD;
           assessed by the same TCM practitioner on body constitution and perform other health&#xD;
           assessments such as vital signs and urine testing.&#xD;
