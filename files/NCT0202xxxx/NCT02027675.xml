  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a society where exercise is prescribed by physicians to increase physical condition,&#xD;
      improve dietary habits and reduce cardiovascular risk, the impact of exercise, acute or&#xD;
      chronic, and diet in inflammation and immunity is unknown. Specific populations can have&#xD;
      different responses towards acute and chronic exercise. Moreover specific conditions, like&#xD;
      the type of meal ingested, can interfere with these responses. The true effect of&#xD;
      pre-competitive meal exercise in the immunity and inflammatory response is unknown. Acute&#xD;
      physical inactivity periods, commonly happens during daily life, related to work or acute&#xD;
      illness. New evidence points out that it induces immediate metabolic and endocrinological&#xD;
      changes, these can might also be associated with changes in immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to assess the effect of the precompetitive meal on the inflammatory, neuro-immune and&#xD;
           metabolic response to exercise;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to assess the effects of sedentary behaviour on inflammatory, neuro-immune and metabolic&#xD;
           response;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to assess differences in changes between healthy, asthmatic and obese subjects&#xD;

      Two interventions will be performed for assessing the research questions and aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Randomized cross-over, with a wash out period of 7 days, single-blinded trial where two&#xD;
      different pre-competitive meals will be followed by an exercise challenge; inflammatory&#xD;
      neuro-immune and metabolic response will be assessed before and after each challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from advertisement and four different groups will be compared:&#xD;
      obese-asthmatic; asthmatic non-obese; obese without asthma and non-asthmatic and non-obese.&#xD;
      All patients will be allocated to a meal challenge in which a high fat poor micronutrient&#xD;
      meal followed by a Mediterranean meal or vice-versa; meal challenge order will be randomized&#xD;
      and participants will be blinded to the intervention. The main outcome for this intervention&#xD;
      will be airway inflammation and lung function. All outcomes will be assessed before and 3h&#xD;
      after each meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of individuals will, in the three hours after the meal, perform an exercise&#xD;
      challenge, which is aimed to induce acute immune changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Randomized controlled trial where participants, after a run-in period and eligibility&#xD;
      evaluation, will be allocated to an intervention consisting in a reduction of physical&#xD;
      activity by 50% or maintaining habitual physical activity for two weeks; inflammatory&#xD;
      neuro-immune and metabolic response will be assessed before and after intervention.&#xD;
