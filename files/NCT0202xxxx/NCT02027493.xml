  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Egypt has the highest prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection in adults (up to 20%) and&#xD;
      children (up to 5.5%). The major genotype (90%) is type 4. Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or&#xD;
      -2b and ribavirin have been used in small numbers of hepatitis C virus-infected children with&#xD;
      sustained virological response being higher in genotypes 2 and 3 than in genotypes 1 and 4.&#xD;
      Genotype 4 is has been described as difficult-to-treat genotype. Several attempts to modify&#xD;
      treatment protocols have been tried in adults in an attempt to achieve higher rates of&#xD;
      sustained virological response. Shortening injection interval and/or treatment duration&#xD;
      prolongation have been tried with variable outcome reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel Hansenula- derived pegylated interferon alpha 2a: 20 Kilo dalton (Reiferon Retard)&#xD;
      has been used over the last 4 years in the Egyptian market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Reiferon retard plus ribavirin customized&#xD;
      regimen in hepatitis C virus-RNA seropositive Egyptian children. Forty six children with&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C virus aged 3-19 years were selected from 3 hepatic tertiary centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and laboratory evaluation were undertaken. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (PCR) for HCV-RNA was done before starting treatment, at 4, 12, 24, 48, 72 weeks during&#xD;
      treatment and 6 months after stoppage of treatment. All patients were assigned to receive a&#xD;
      weekly subcutaneous injection of pegylated interferon alpha 2-a ( Reiferon Retard) plus oral&#xD;
      Ribavirin daily for 12 weeks ,then cases were divided according to PCR results into 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: Patients who continued treatment on weekly basis: this group included patients who&#xD;
      had negative PCR at week 12 as well those who had positive PCR without any change in viremia.&#xD;
      Group II: Patients who continued treatment on a 5- days schedule: this group included&#xD;
      patients who had any decrease in viremia at week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were PCR-negative at week 48 and had at least one PCR-positive test during&#xD;
      therapy were assigned to have an extended treatment course of 6 months duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of adverse effects was assessed during treatment and follow up&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      hepatitis C virus is a major health problem, not only in adults but also in the pediatric age&#xD;
      group. In Egypt, the prevalent genotype is the difficult-to-treat genotype 4. Attempts are&#xD;
      being made to improve the treatment outcomes. In the current study we aim to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of customized pegylated interferon-alpha-2a plus ribavirin in children with chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus. For that, 46 children with chronic hepatitis C virus were recruited from&#xD;
      three tertiary Pediatric Hepatology centers. All were assigned to receive weekly subcutaneous&#xD;
      pegylated interferon-alpha-2a plus daily ribavirin for 12 weeks. At this point, the study&#xD;
      population was divided into two arms. Arm 1 included those who became hepatitis C virus-RNA&#xD;
      negative by polymerase chain reaction and those who showed no change of viremia or a decrease&#xD;
      of less than 1 log. This group continued treatment on weekly bases for 48 weeks, even those&#xD;
      who are hepatitis C virus-RNA positive. Arm 2; included patients who had a decrease in&#xD;
      viremia more than one log of pre-treatment viremia level. For those patients, injection&#xD;
      interval was shortened to every 5-day for a completion period of 48 weeks. Patients from&#xD;
      either group who were polymerase chain reaction-negative at week 48, but had at least one&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction-positive test during therapy, were assigned to have an extended&#xD;
      treatment course up to 72 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So the first customization was,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. prolongation of treatment duration for up to 48 weeks regardless response type&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Shortening injection interval in some patients to every 5-day injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The third customization was the prolongation of treatment for extra 6 months, i.e. up tp&#xD;
           72 weeks in some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of adverse effects, virological and biochemical responses were assessed during&#xD;
      treatment and follow up.&#xD;
