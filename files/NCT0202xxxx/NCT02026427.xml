  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The participants were hospitalized in Orthopedic and Traumatology Departments in Military&#xD;
      Institute of Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were (1) age to 40 year-old, (2) no history of urologic problems, and&#xD;
      (3) surgery under spinal anesthesia. All the patients where (1) opioids were administered&#xD;
      during the surgery, (2) general anesthesia was necessary, and (3) the urinary bladder&#xD;
      catheterization was perform during the surgery were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were randomly divided into the study and control groups. No oral&#xD;
      premedication was administered. All the patients were asked to empty their urinary bladders&#xD;
      before arrival to the operating theatre. When the standard monitoring (continuous&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry) was started, intravenous&#xD;
      premedication with midazolam was administered and lumbar spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric&#xD;
      0.5% solution of bupivacaine hydrochloride was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study group, but not in the the control one, the 40 mg of drotaverine hydrochloride&#xD;
      was administered intramuscularly. The decresed intravascular volume was corrected with&#xD;
      cristalloids. During the surgery the adequate, not deeper than II grade according to Ramsay&#xD;
      scale, level of sedationt was obtained with midazolam and/or propofol. All the participants&#xD;
      received a questionaire in which we asked the questions about (1) the duration of anesthesia,&#xD;
      (2) the time of micturition, (3) the time when discomfort or pain appeared in the lower&#xD;
      abdomen, (4) the incidence of the urinary bladder catheterization and time to&#xD;
      catheterization. On the next day after the surgery the questionaires were collected. In&#xD;
      cases, when the patient's dischaged from the hospital was planned during the weekend, he or&#xD;
      she was asked to pass on the questionaire to the nurses.&#xD;
