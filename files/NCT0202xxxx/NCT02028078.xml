    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to investigate the feasibility and stability of determining the&#xD;
      endogenous glucose production during a hypoglycaemic clamp in type 1 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      subjects by a stable tracer to tracee ratio with an enrichment of 4% and a variation below&#xD;
      +/-30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: twenty type 1 diabetic subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single-center, open, non- randomized, pilot-study&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will participate on 3 Visits. The total study duration for each subject will be&#xD;
      approximately one month.The trial can be divided into:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening Visit (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypoglycaemic clamp Visit (Visit 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow up Visit (Visit 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit (Visit1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be asked to attend the screening visit fasting. The following data will be&#xD;
      assessed and performed: informed consent signed and dated, inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      for the study, a full medical history including current medication, physical examination and&#xD;
      laboratory examination of blood/urine samples. For women in childbearing potential a urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycaemic Visit (Visit2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be asked to attend the clinical unit at approximately 20:00 in the evening&#xD;
      on day 1. Thereafter the subject will receive an insulin and glucose infusion intravenously&#xD;
      in order to obtain a steady state of a PG level of 5.5 mmol/L overnight until approximately&#xD;
      08:00 in the morning of day 2. At 05:00 hours D-[6,6-2H2] glucose (100 g/l) solution will be&#xD;
      given i.v. as a primed (9.6 mg/kg/min) for one minute and a constant (0.08 mg/kg/min)&#xD;
      infusion until the last blood sampling of the plasma glucose level of 4.0 mmol/L will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 08:00 hours in the morning at day 2, insulin infusion will be increased to 1.5 mU/kg/min&#xD;
      for each subject and the Plasma Glucose will be kept at a plateau of 5.5 mmol/L by a&#xD;
      controlled variable intravenous infusion of glucose (10% glucose enriched with 4mg [6,6-2H2]&#xD;
      glucose /ml) for one hour. Afterwards, plasma glucose is allowed to fall to a plateau of 3.5&#xD;
      mmol/L, then to a nadir of 2.5 mmol/L, then to a blood glucose level of 4.0 mmol/L and&#xD;
      finally back to a level of 5.5 mmol/L for safety reasons. Blood sampling for measurement of&#xD;
      plasma glucose, [6,6-2H2] glucose (labelled glucose),glucagon, vital signs, hypoglycaemic&#xD;
      symptoms questionnaire and hypoglycaemic awareness will be performed at each plasma glucose&#xD;
      plateau. The subject will be discharged from the clinic at day 2, or later if deemed&#xD;
      necessary by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Visit (Visit 3):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will attend the Visit 3, 3 - 10 days after Visit 2. The following data will be&#xD;
      assessed and performed: concomitant medication, including current diabetes treatment, adverse&#xD;
      events, a full physical examination and laboratory examination of blood/urine samples. For&#xD;
      women in childbearing potential a urine pregnancy test will be performed.&#xD;
