  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical gene transfer study that aims to verify the safety and efficacy of the use&#xD;
      of the EFS-ADA lentiviral vector to introduce the human adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene into&#xD;
      the hematopoietic progenitors of patients affected with severe combined immunodeficiency due&#xD;
      to ADA deficiency. The EFS-ADA vector expresses the human ADA cDNA under the control of the&#xD;
      elongation factor alpha short promoter (EFS). In addition, this protocol will examine the&#xD;
      effects of the ADA gene transfer on the immune system of treated patients. Patients with ADA&#xD;
      deficiency and ineligible for matched sibling allogeneic bone marrow transplantation are&#xD;
      eligible to participate in the study. To increase engraftment and selected advantage or&#xD;
      gene-corrected cells, busulfan will be used as a cytoreductive agent. Enzyme replacement&#xD;
      (PEG-ADA) will be discontinued 30 days after infusion of gene-corrected cells. CD34+&#xD;
      hematopoietic progenitors will be isolated from the patient bone marrow, peripheral blood or&#xD;
      cord blood, exposed to lentiviral vector-mediated gene transfer and re-infused into the&#xD;
      patient through a peripheral vein. Clinical, immunological and molecular follow-up studies&#xD;
      will assess safety, toxicity, and efficacy of the procedure.&#xD;

               5. Other conditions which in the opinion of the principal investigator and/or&#xD;
                  co-investigators, contra-indicate the bone marrow harvest, the administration of&#xD;
                  busulfan, infusion of transduced cells or indicate the patient or patient s&#xD;
                  parents/primary caregivers inability to follow protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  DFSP is a rare, locally invasive tumor with low metastatic potential.&#xD;
                       Patients receiving active anti-neoplastic therapy for any cancer, including&#xD;
                       DFSP, are not eligible. Patients with DFSP who are not being treated with&#xD;
                       active anti-neoplastic therapy at the time of enrollment AND have no plan to&#xD;
                       receive active anti-neoplastic therapy in the absence of progressive&#xD;
                       malignant disease AND whose DFSP is not expected to be life-limiting within&#xD;
                       the five years following the infusion of genetically corrected cells are&#xD;
                       eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with DFSP, for whom radiation or chemotherapy has been chosen, would remain&#xD;
        ineligible during treatment, as the interaction of busulfan and the experimental gene&#xD;
        transfer vectors with active anti-neoplastic therapy is difficult to predict and could&#xD;
        reasonably be expected to be deleterious due to overlapping toxicities. When&#xD;
        anti-neoplastic therapy is concluded, patients with ADA-SCID and a history of DFSP can be&#xD;
        included.&#xD;
