      Aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of different lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      administrations, in increasing adherence to the Mediterranean diet in a group of patients&#xD;
      with RA living in the Mediterranean basin, and, thus, in improving parameters related to&#xD;
      subjective and objective disease markers, including plasma adiponectin concentrations.&#xD;

      The effect of various dietary regimens and nutrient supplementation on rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      (RA) has been previously explored, with the majority of the evidence supporting the&#xD;
      beneficial effect of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), consumed mainly as fish oil&#xD;
      supplements. However, many capsules should be taken on a daily basis (10 - 15) in order to&#xD;
      improve health status, increasing, thus, the high drug burden these patients may encounter;&#xD;
      inability to comply with supplementation, as depicted in drop-out rates and adverse&#xD;
      reactions, is also of concern. On the other hand, the so far investigation of specific&#xD;
      dietary patterns, namely elemental or vegetarian diets, revealed similar limitations&#xD;
      regarding inability to comply, without producing clear benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last decade, a traditional dietary pattern, the Mediterranean diet, has also been&#xD;
      investigated in patients with RA. This pattern is characterized by abundance of plant foods&#xD;
      (fruits, mainly as typical daily desserts, vegetables, bread, other forms of cereals, beans,&#xD;
      nuts, and seeds), olive oil as the principal source of fat, moderate amounts of dairy&#xD;
      products (mainly cheese and yogurt), low to moderate amounts of fish and poultry, red meat in&#xD;
      low amounts and wine consumed in moderation, normally with meals. Adherence to the&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet has been associated with a significant reduction in total mortality and&#xD;
      improvement in longevity, as well as with lower incidence of atherosclerosis, coronary heart&#xD;
      disease, metabolic syndrome and biochemical markers related to insulin resistance and&#xD;
      inflammation. In RA, in specific, it has been shown to improve objective and subjective&#xD;
      measures. It is also worth mentioning that this type of intervention produced negligible or&#xD;
      no adverse effects or drop-out in RA patients. However, it has been implemented in&#xD;
      North-European populations with a background diet far away from the Mediterranean dietary&#xD;
      habits. It would be interesting to study the effect of a Mediterranean diet-based&#xD;
      intervention in a Mediterranean population of RA patients, evaluate their adherence and&#xD;
      changes in subjective disease measures as well as in biochemical markers. One of the markers&#xD;
      of interest is adiponectin, a large 30-kDa protein produced mainly by adipocytes, sharing&#xD;
      strong homologies with TNF and the complement factor C1q. Plasma levels of adiponectin have&#xD;
      been negatively associated with indices of obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. However, its role in RA is still controversial with some evidence indicating a&#xD;
      proinflammatory effect and some other suggesting antiinflammatory properties of this&#xD;
      adipocytokine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of different lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      administrations, in increasing adherence to the Mediterranean diet in a group of patients&#xD;
      with RA living in the Mediterranean basin, and, thus, in improving parameters related to&#xD;
      subjective and objective disease markers, including plasma adiponectin concentrations.&#xD;
