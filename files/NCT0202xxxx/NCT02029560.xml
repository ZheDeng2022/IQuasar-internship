      BPH and hypertension are chronic senile diseases that increase in prevalence with age. It is&#xD;
      reported that 25% of men over 60 years old suffer from both BPH and hypertension. Though&#xD;
      these two diseases differ in nature, there is a hypothesis advanced from recent studies that&#xD;
      for both diseases, increase in sympathetic tone plays an important role in pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a medical treatment of BPH, α-blockers are widely selected in clinical studies as a first&#xD;
      line treatment in patients with LUTS, for its non-invasiveness and superior clinical efficacy&#xD;
      [1, 5]. Such α-blockers increases urine flow and decreases residual urine by controlling&#xD;
      excitement of the sympathetic nervous system distributed around smooth muscle of prostate and&#xD;
      bladder neck. Through this, α-blockers improve conditions of clinical symptoms of patients&#xD;
      suffering from LUTS due to BPH, and decrease need for invasive surgery related to BPH, and&#xD;
      also have medical action to decrease morbidity rate of secondary complications of BPH such as&#xD;
      acute retention of urine, deterioration of renal function, bladder stone and urinary tract&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in the case of patients who are on hypertension medication, when considering&#xD;
      concomitant administration with α-blockers, adverse events such as orthostatic hypotension&#xD;
      and dizziness due to drop in blood pressure is most concerned. In this regard, silodosin, as&#xD;
      an alpha 1A adrenoceptor antagonist, has been proven have low occurrence of adverse events&#xD;
      related to cardiovascular system and have little effect on blood pressure compared to other&#xD;
      α-blockers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, in this study, we aim to see the effect on cardiovascular system(blood pressure)&#xD;
      Thrupas® capsule is administered every day for 12 weeks in patients with LUTS suggestive of&#xD;
      BPH.&#xD;

        The number of study subjects was calculated based on safety end-point which was variable&#xD;
        change in SBP measurement before and after the administration of Silodosin. In previous&#xD;
        studies, the standard deviation in before and after administration of Silodosin was 12.81.&#xD;
        Therefore, this study assumed the standard deviation in before and after administration to&#xD;
        be 12.81.&#xD;
&#xD;
        When the significance level was 0.05, the confidence interval was 1.41 and standard&#xD;
        deviation of SBP measurement before and after the administration of Silodocsin was 12.81,&#xD;
        the standard sample size will be 318 people and target number of study subject will be 400&#xD;
        as the expected drop rate is 20%.&#xD;
