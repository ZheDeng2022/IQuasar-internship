    <textblock>
      Recent data from large trials of high-frequency high frequency oscillation (HFO) without a&#xD;
      cuff leak vs, lung-protective conventional ventialtion (CMV) failed to show any HFO-related&#xD;
      benefit with respect to outcome. A possible explanation is that HFO increases the probability&#xD;
      of right ventricular dysfunction due to the combination of high mean airway pressures (mPaws)&#xD;
      and hypercapnia. In contrast, available preliminary data on low-frequency HFO-tracheal gas&#xD;
      insufflation (TGI) with cuff leak vs. CMV are suggestive of an HFO-TGI related benefit.&#xD;
      Low-frequency HFO-TGI with a cuff leak is associated with relatively low mean tracheal&#xD;
      pressures and adequate control of PaCO2. Thus, the investigators intend to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that low frequency HFO +/- TGI with a cuff leak is associated with better right&#xD;
      ventricular function relative to high-frequency HFO without a cuff leak.&#xD;

      Rationale of the study Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is an acute inflammatory&#xD;
      state of the pulmonary parenchyma that causes hypoxemia, atelectasis, pulmonary congestion,&#xD;
      and reduction in pulmonary compliance. Mechanical ventilation is actually life-saving, but it&#xD;
      may traumatize the lungs (e.g. volutrauma, barotrauma, atelectrauma, and biotrauma). The use&#xD;
      of low tidal volumes and high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), aims at attenuating&#xD;
      ventilator-associated lung injury. However, ARDS mortality still remains high. High frequency&#xD;
      oscillation (HFO) is an alternative ventilatory technique that employs very low tidal volumes&#xD;
      (1-4 ml/kg) administered at high frequencies (3-15 Hz). Prior observational studies have&#xD;
      reported improvements in oxygenation, whereas recent two-center data on severe ARDS suggest a&#xD;
      survival benefit from the intermittent, combined use of low-frequency HFO with a cuff leak,&#xD;
      Recruitment maneuvers (RMs), and tracheal gas insufflation (TGI). The addition of TGI&#xD;
      improves oxygenation and CO2 elimination; however, it is still unclear whether it affects&#xD;
      survival. Two recently published multicenter studies showed either neutral (10) or negative&#xD;
      results (11) with respect to survival when high frequency HFO without a cuff leak was used in&#xD;
      the treatment of early ARDS. However, these negative results may be partly due to right&#xD;
      ventricular overload/dysfunction/failure caused by the combination of high intrathoracic&#xD;
      pressures and hypercapnia, with consequent hemodynamic instability and increased need of&#xD;
      inotropic/vasopressor support. Accordingly, the investigators hypothesize that a different&#xD;
      HFO strategy [employing a combination of a low frequency and a cuff leak - which augments CO2&#xD;
      elimination and is associated with relatively low mean tracheal pressures - could lead to&#xD;
      different results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high intrathoracic pressure may impede venous return and increase pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      resistance. This concurrent right ventricular preload reduction and afterload increase might&#xD;
      cause right ventricular dysfunction/failure. On the other hand, the placement of a cuff leak&#xD;
      results in a lower (by approx. 5-6 cmH2O) mean tracheal pressure relative to the set&#xD;
      HFO-ventilator mean airway pressure (mPaw), with consequent unloading of the right ventricle.&#xD;
      In addition, further unloading of the right ventricle can be expected through the combined&#xD;
      use of a cuff leak, TGI, and a high HFO bias flow; these measures improve PaCO2 control and&#xD;
      may prevent excessive, hypercapnia-induced increases in pulmonary vascular resistance. Right&#xD;
      ventricular function can be assessed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) as previously&#xD;
      described. Right ventricular dysfunction and associated dilatation may cause cardiac output&#xD;
      reduction and coronary hypoperfusion; the latter may further compromise right ventricular&#xD;
      performance and contribute to right ventricular failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the present study is to document and compare the effect of lung protective&#xD;
      conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) and of different HFO strategies (already clinically&#xD;
      tested in trials with conflicting results) on right ventricular performance as determined by&#xD;
      TEE. More specifically, we intend to compare high-PEEP, lung protective CMV with a &quot;high&quot;&#xD;
      mPaw/no cuff leak, high-frequency HFO strategy, and a &quot;high&quot; mPaw with cuff leak, &quot;low&quot;&#xD;
      frequency HFO strategy with and without TGI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods METHODS Eligible patients (relevant criteria provided below) with early and severe&#xD;
      ARDS will be enrolled after the obtainment of informed, written, next-of-kin consent, as well&#xD;
      as attending physician's non-written consent..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient monitoring will include electrocardiographic lead II, intra-arterial pressure (+/-&#xD;
      cardiac index with PICCO plus, Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany)], and peripheral&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (SaO2). Anesthesia will be maintained with midazolam and/or propofol, and&#xD;
      fentanyl or remifentanil. Nrutomuscular blockade will be accomplished with cisatracurium,&#xD;
      which will be used in concordance with current recommendations and as part of the attending&#xD;
      physician-prescribed medical treatment. During the study period, all patients will be&#xD;
      receiving a continuous infusion of cisatracurium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMV strategy Eligible study participants will have received at least 60 min of lung&#xD;
      protective CMV with the following combinations of FiO2/PEEP: 0.5/10-12 cm H2O, 0.6/14-16 cm&#xD;
      H2O, 0.7/14-16 cm H2O, 0.8/14-16 cm H2O, 0.9/16-18 cm H2O, 1.0/20-24 cmH2O. These&#xD;
      combinations constitute &quot;general&quot; recommendations and further PEEP titrations of =&lt; 4 cm H2O&#xD;
      by attending physicians to the &quot;best&quot; combination of the patients' gas exchange and&#xD;
      hemodynamic will be considered as acceptable. A high-PEEP-associated survival benefit has&#xD;
      been recently documented. Whenever oxygenation deteriorates, PEEP will be increased first,&#xD;
      followed by an increase in FiO2, while targeting &quot;concordance&quot; with the aforementioned&#xD;
      FiO2/PEEP combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tidal volume will be within 5.5-7.5 mL/Kg predicted body weight. The maximal plateau pressure&#xD;
      limit will be 40 cmH2O, and target plateau pressure will be ≤32 cmH2O; rationale: as in the&#xD;
      study of Meade et al , a higher plateau pressure will be tolerated to allow for the use of a&#xD;
      higher PEEP level. When plateau pressure exceeds 32 cmH2O for &gt;15 min, the following&#xD;
      adjustments will be conducted: tidal volume reduction up to 4.0 mL/kg predicted body weight,&#xD;
      respiratory rate increase up to 35/min, and PEEP reduction by ≥2 cmH2O. These adjustments&#xD;
      will have to concurrently result in the achievement of the below-provided gas-exchange&#xD;
      targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The respiratory rate will be titrated to a pHa of 7.20-7.45. The inspiratory-to-expiratory&#xD;
      time (Ι:Ε) ratio will be ≤1/2. The oxygenation target will be SaO2=90-95%, and/or PaO2=60-80&#xD;
      mmHg. At pHa&lt;7.20, breathing circuit deadspace will be minimized by replacing the routinely&#xD;
      used catheter mount by a short, low-volume angular connector, the tidal volume will be&#xD;
      increased up to 8.0 mL/kg predicted body weight, and respiratory rate will be increased up to&#xD;
      35/min. If these measures fail, the criterion of &quot;poor control of pHa/PaCO2,&quot; and the use of&#xD;
      a bicarbonate infusion will be permitted. An additional option will be extracorporeal CO2&#xD;
      removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Algorithm of RMs and PEEP/FiO2&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. RM - Continuous positive airway pressure of 40-45 cmH2O for 40 sec, at an FiO2 of 1.0)&#xD;
           and titration of PEEP and FiO2 so that SaO2=90-95%, or PaO2=60-80 mmHg (RMs may be&#xD;
           repeated twice daily, once every 5 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduction in FiO2 always precedes reduction in PEEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At FiO2=0.5 and PEEP&lt;8 cmH2O - Weaning trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. RMs may be administered for up to 5 days following the onset of the ARDS&#xD;
&#xD;
      HFO-RMs strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously published recommendations regarding HFO use (Sensormedics 3100B ventilator,&#xD;
      Sensormedics, Yorba Linda, CA, USA) include the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sufficient level of deep sedation/anesthesia for the abolishment of respiratory muscles&#xD;
           activity, with or without neuromuscular blockade, so that patient-ventilator&#xD;
           dyssynchrony is avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Confirmation of endotracheal tube patency and placement of the tube at 3-4 cm above&#xD;
           carina.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. RMs: immediately after patient-oscillator connection, an RM will be performed (increase&#xD;
           in the circuit pressure to 45 cmH2O for 40 sec with the oscillator's piston off). The&#xD;
           RMs will be repeated just prior to changes in HFO frequency or just prior to/just after&#xD;
           the initiation/termination of TGI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. FiO2 will initially be set at 1.0 and then reduced (over 10-15 min) to the FiO2 of the&#xD;
           preceding CMV, provided that SaO2 is maintained &gt;90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Bias flow will be set at 60 L/min to improve CO2 clearance from the breathing circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. I:E ratio will be maintained at 1:2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. According to the methods and results of preceding studies of the investigators, TGI will&#xD;
           be equal to 50% of the preceding CMV minute ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The initial HFO mPaw will exceed the mPaw of the preceding CΜV by 8-10 cm H2O and will&#xD;
           be titrated (by ±3 cmH2O) to the best oxygenation response (predicted to correspond to a&#xD;
           &quot;target&quot; SaO2 of &gt;= 95%) during a 60-min period of standard, low frequency HFO with cuff&#xD;
           leak. The aforementioned period will precede the below-described 180-min period of HFO&#xD;
           strategy testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Initial oscillation frequency will be randomly set at either at 3.5-4 Hz or at 7 Hz. The&#xD;
           low frequency setting will be combined with a 3-5 cmH2O cuff leak and TGI for 60 min&#xD;
           followed by &quot;no-TGI&quot; for another 60 min in random order. The high frequency setting will&#xD;
           not be combined with either a cuff leak or TGI and will be maintained for an additional&#xD;
           60 min. Oscillatory pressure amplitude (ΔP) will be set at 90 cmH2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEE measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be determined during baseline CMV:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right ventricular diastolic area, left ventricular diastolic area, and Eccentricity Index.&#xD;
      Assessment of coronary blood flow in the right main coronary artery and the left anterior&#xD;
      descendant branch of the left main coronary artery (Note: coronary artery blood flow&#xD;
      measurements proved technically difficult and time-consuming and were thus removed from the&#xD;
      study protocol). The same measurements will be repeated at 120, 180, and 240 min after HFO&#xD;
      initiation, and at 60 min following return to CMV. At the same time points, we will determine&#xD;
      gas exchange, and hemodynamics including cardiac output with PICCO plus. Lastly, respiratory&#xD;
      mechanics will be assessed with rapid end-expiratory/end-inspiratory airway occlusion during&#xD;
      CMV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue oxygenation Rescue oxygenation methodology may include low-frequency HFO-TGI with cuff&#xD;
      leak, prone positioning, inhaled nitric oxide, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The&#xD;
      duration of a rescue oxygenation session will be at least 10 hours with allowance for an&#xD;
      unlimited extension if PaO2&lt;60 mmHg. Rescue initiation criterion: PaO2&lt;60 mmHg for more than&#xD;
      30 min at FiO2=1.0 during the high-PEEP, lung protective CMV, in the absence of any&#xD;
      reversible cardio-respiratory pathology and/or ventilator malfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow up Physiological variables (hemodynamics gas-exchange, and respiratory&#xD;
      mechanics) and medication will be recorded within 2 hours before study enrollment and at 9&#xD;
      a.m. of days 1-10 following study enrollment. Organ dysfunction according to the Sequential&#xD;
      Organ Dysfunction Assessment score and clinical course complications will be documented until&#xD;
      day 60 post-enrollment. Lastly, the final outcome (i.e. survival to hospital discharge or&#xD;
      in-hospital death) will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENTIAL RISKS OF INVESTIGATIONAL INTERVENTIONS AND THEIR PREVENTION. Potential risk:&#xD;
      Barotrauma. Preventive measures: This potential risk is equally high during CMV or HFO. We&#xD;
      also do not anticipate any notable clinical complications due to the use of high-frequency,&#xD;
      high mPaw HFO without cuff leak, as its duration of use will not exceed the&#xD;
      protocol-pre-specified time limit of 60 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POSSIBLE BENEFITS For the participating patient: possible increase in the probability of&#xD;
      survival to hospital discharge if HFO-TGI is used as a rescue oxygenation method and detailed&#xD;
      TEE evaluation of the cardiac function. For Medical Science: Possible improvement in the&#xD;
      understanding of the interaction among ventilatory strategy, heart, and lungs.&#xD;
