  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the&#xD;
      United States. In Los Angeles, rates of morbidities due to cigarette smoking follow&#xD;
      prevalence. While the rate of cigarette smoking in Los Angeles County among youth is at&#xD;
      historic lows, prevalence is not uniform: Cigarette smoking is pervasive among residents who&#xD;
      have significant economic disparities. Prevalence is also among the highest in the world for&#xD;
      Korean school-aged youth and substantially higher numbers of Korean American youth smoke&#xD;
      cigarettes. To date, smoking prevention efforts in Korea have had mixed results as they are&#xD;
      not interesting to youth and are not interactive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will assess an interactive, culturally adapted, tailored smoking cessation&#xD;
      intervention delivered through the internet and cell phone. Using technology, the&#xD;
      investigators seek to increase the reach and access of our intervention and facilitate&#xD;
      cessation without in-person sessions, a factor that limits smoking cessation interventions&#xD;
      for youth. Youth are energetic users of electronic media, lending support to the delivery of&#xD;
      treatment through technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators predict that subjects assigned to the intervention will demonstrate&#xD;
      statistically higher rates of smoking abstinence and longer retention in the cessation&#xD;
      program compared to those assigned to the standard of care condition. Subjects reporting&#xD;
      higher levels of smoking exposure, lower motivation, poor mental health, disadvantaged&#xD;
      neighborhoods, and lower levels of acculturation to American culture will also have lower&#xD;
      quit rates at each follow-up visit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the&#xD;
      United States. While 19% of U.S. twelfth graders smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days, fewer&#xD;
      than 10% of Californians under age 18 reported recent smoking. In Los Angeles, rates of&#xD;
      morbidities due to cigarette smoking follow prevalence. While the rate of cigarette smoking&#xD;
      in Los Angeles County among youth is at historic lows (10.4%), prevalence is not uniform:&#xD;
      Cigarette smoking is pervasive among residents who have significant economic disparities.&#xD;
      Alarming racial and ethnic disparities are noted with highest prevalence reported for adult&#xD;
      Korean males (44.8%). Prevalence of cigarette smoking is also among the highest in the world&#xD;
      for Korean school-aged youth, with 16.2% for males and 5.3% for females. To date, smoking&#xD;
      prevention efforts in Korea have had mixed results as they are not interesting to youth and&#xD;
      are not interactive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will assess an interactive, culturally adapted, tailored smoking cessation&#xD;
      intervention delivered through the internet and cell phone. The evidence-based treatment,&#xD;
      &quot;Cognitive-Behavioral/Motivational Enhancement Therapy for Smoking Cessation&quot; (CBME) for&#xD;
      adolescent smokers was developed by one of the investigators. Based on input from our&#xD;
      community partners, consultants, and youth focus group participants, the treatment will be&#xD;
      culturally adapted for appropriateness and relevance to Korean youth. The refined&#xD;
      intervention will be programmed for delivery via the Web and mobile technologies. Using&#xD;
      technology, we seek to increase the reach and access of our intervention and facilitate&#xD;
      cessation without in-person sessions, a factor that limits smoking cessation interventions&#xD;
      for youth. A 2-group, randomized control trial design will assign youth either to the&#xD;
      tailored Web and cell phone based smoking cessation program or to a control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim of the study is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To evaluate the efficacy of the tailored smoking cessation approach for Korean youth&#xD;
      seeking smoking cessation, randomly assigning 240 youth to either the experimental condition&#xD;
      or to a standard cessation approach.&#xD;
