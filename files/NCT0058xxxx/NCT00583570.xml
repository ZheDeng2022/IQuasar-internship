      Specific Aim: To determine the effect of a phosphorus additives educational intervention on&#xD;
      serum phosphorus levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Educating dialysis patients regarding phosphate containing additives will result&#xD;
      in improved serum phosphorus levels.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The amount of phosphorus in the American diet has increased considerably, primarily from&#xD;
      phosphorus-containing additives in convenience and ready to eat foods (Calvo 1996). It is&#xD;
      estimated that, depending on individual food choices, additives add as much 1000 mg/day of&#xD;
      phosphorus to the diet (Bell). Phosphorus in additives is almost entirely absorbed while only&#xD;
      60% of naturally occurring phosphorus is absorbed (Uribarri 2003). Education regarding high&#xD;
      phosphorus foods is a key component of hyperphosphatemia management (Ford 2004, Cupisti&#xD;
      2004), but the use of phosphorus additives may make it difficult for patients and dietitians&#xD;
      to estimate phosphorus content of foods. It has been suggested that hyperphosphatemia is a&#xD;
      nutritional barrier to preventing renal bone disease and that an intervention focusing on&#xD;
      phosphate containing food additives has great potential (Sherman). Our objective is to&#xD;
      determine the effect of an educational intervention regarding phosphate additives on serum&#xD;
      phosphorus about 300 chronic hemodialysis patients at Centers for Dialysis Care (CDC) and&#xD;
      Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) in Cuyahoga County. Facilities will be randomized to&#xD;
      intervention and control groups. All dietitians and eligible patients at the intervention&#xD;
      facilities will be invited to take part in the intervention. All dietitians and consenting&#xD;
      eligible patients at control facilities will form a usual care group. Prior to the trial,&#xD;
      demographic and medical characteristics, lab data and medications will be collected for the&#xD;
      previous three months using a chart abstraction and patient interview form. Demographic&#xD;
      characteristics include age, sex, race, education and insurance status. Medical&#xD;
      characteristics include dialysis dose, binder prescription, vitamin D dosing, cause of renal&#xD;
      failure, number of months on dialysis, and major co-morbid conditions. Lab data will include&#xD;
      albumin, calcium, phosphorus, serum bicarbonate, and PTH. Medication data will include binder&#xD;
      prescription and bone medications. In the first month of the trial study coordinators will&#xD;
      meet with intervention and control subjects and assess basic knowledge regarding phosphorus&#xD;
      content of foods and label reading. Intervention subjects will also receive education&#xD;
      regarding phosphorus additives and their effect on the phosphorus content of foods, a&#xD;
      laminated card listing common phosphorus additives, and a handout about additives in foods&#xD;
      from fast food restaurants where they eat. The subject will be instructed to use the&#xD;
      materials when shopping or eating out to avoid phosphorous additives. During the 2nd month of&#xD;
      the trial, study coordinators will contact intervention subjects by phone to reinforce&#xD;
      educational materials and answer questions. Control subjects will be contacted and asked&#xD;
      about shopping and eating habits. During the 3rd month the interviews from month 1 will be&#xD;
      repeated for both intervention and control subjects to assess changes in knowledge.&#xD;
      Intervention subjects will also be asked to evaluate the phosphorus additives tool and&#xD;
      provide feedback for evaluating the ease of use and utility. Having a control group that&#xD;
      receives attention but not the key intervention (phosphorus containing additives education&#xD;
      and tools) will allow us to distinguish the effect of attention from the effect of the&#xD;
      intervention. Chart abstraction data on labs, dialysis dose, binder prescription, and vitamin&#xD;
      D dosing will be collected for all three months of the trial.&#xD;
