      Does subtype of HIV-1 affect the response of ARVs given to Ugandan children&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing demand for treatment and access to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy for HIV&#xD;
      infection in resource - poor settings. Of all the HIV-1 subtypes (A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K&#xD;
      and multiple recombinant viruses), ARV drugs were developed by studying primarily subtype B.&#xD;
      This HIV subtype predominates in North America, Western Europe and the rest of the&#xD;
      industrialized world. However, worldwide, subtype B makes up a minority (about 10%) of the&#xD;
      HIV infected population. In Uganda, HIV-1 subtypes A and D predominate. Although there is&#xD;
      some evidence that the ARV's developed against subtype B virus have activity against&#xD;
      non-subtype B virus, as the demand grows for ARV's in resource-poor settings, it is not&#xD;
      entirely clear whether all non-B subtypes will respond robustly to the current ARV's&#xD;
      available. Also, it is unknown if drug failure (in the form of viral resistance) to&#xD;
      non-subtype B virus is due to mutations that are similar to those seen in subtype B virus.&#xD;
      Without more data in resource-poor countries, it is still too early to tell whether different&#xD;
      HIV-1 subtypes will require unique drug treatment or salvage strategies for those who fail&#xD;
      initial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Wisconsin (UW) Health HIV Care Program has been partnering with the Mulago&#xD;
      Hospital Pediactirc Infectious Disease Clinic (PIDC) for the past five years. The PIDC has&#xD;
      well over 5,000 children with HIV that attend this clinic. Approximately 20% of these&#xD;
      children have met criteria for ARV treatment under the US PEPFAR (Presidents Emergency Plan&#xD;
      for AIDS Relief) arrangement. A retrospective collaborative (UW/PIDC) study performed at the&#xD;
      PIDC examined (using genotyping) 40 children who failed initial ARV therapy. This study found&#xD;
      some different mutations in children who failed the antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon the above study, the goal of the present cohort study is to examine prospectively&#xD;
      in an expanded population of children who attend the PIDC the relationship between the HIV&#xD;
      subtype infecting Ugandan children and their virologic and clinical response to the ARV's now&#xD;
      available to this population. Approximately 30% of children are currently failing (based&#xD;
      primarily upon clinical data) ARV therapy at the PIDC. In this study, these children will&#xD;
      have a separate tube of 5 cc of blood drawn (at specified times) for HIV subtyping to examine&#xD;
      whether specific subtypes of HIV are associated with failure to specific ARV's or ARV&#xD;
      combinations. In addition to HIV subtype determination, viral genotyping (viral mutations)&#xD;
      will be performed to examine the relationship between the HIV subtype and specific viral&#xD;
      mutations indicating resistance to an ARV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall design of this study is to prospectively collect cohort clinical and virologic&#xD;
      data from children (ages birth to 16 years) started on ARV therapy during a 12 month period&#xD;
      of enrollment (about 110 children who qualify for PEPFAR ARV treatment). The only inclusion&#xD;
      criteria is the child receives ARV therapy. The only exclusion is refusal on the part of the&#xD;
      patient or family to have blood drawn and records examined. Children receiving ARV therapy in&#xD;
      this time period will be approached and recruited for this study by the attending physician.&#xD;
      This study is approved by the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics and Mulago&#xD;
      Hospital IRBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treated children will have clinical and HIV genotype and subtype data (blood sent to U.&#xD;
      Wisconsin for analysis) collected prior to starting ARV's. Children will then receive as&#xD;
      initial therapy for HIV infection 2 NRTIs (AZT, d4T, ABC or ddI) and 1 NNRTI (Neverapine, or&#xD;
      Efavirenz) or Kaletra (a protease inhibitor). One month after starting ARVs (and every four&#xD;
      months thereafter during the study period) an HIV viral load will be obtained. If the child&#xD;
      is failing therapy, clinical data at the time of failure will be collected and blood will be&#xD;
      drawn for repeat viral load, HIV-1 subtyping (has the subtype changed), and genotypic&#xD;
      analysis (see below). Decisions on what to use as treatment for those children failing their&#xD;
      first antiretroviral regimen will be made using the data collected on the blood obtained from&#xD;
      each child in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARV failure at the PIDC is generally assessed on clinical grounds (weight loss, diarrhea,&#xD;
      fever, opportunistic infection [OI] etc). The PIDC has a fairly sophisticated data management&#xD;
      system. In those children having clinical failure to the ARV's after initial therapy, blood&#xD;
      for HIV-1 viral load, subtype and genotype will be drawn. This blood will be frozen and&#xD;
      shipped to the University of Wisconsin for analysis. On site (Dr. Kekitiinwa) clinical data&#xD;
      will be collected. This data will include age, sex, physical findings and clinical course on&#xD;
      ARV's. More specifically, the reason for ARV failure was: the occurrence of OI, wasting,&#xD;
      recurrence of diarrhea, (other symptoms of HIV), or toxicity to the ARV (tolerability). All&#xD;
      blood samples will be labeled only with a number that corresponds to the identity of the&#xD;
      patient. This number will be kept by Dr. Graziano. These samples will then be Federal&#xD;
      Expressed on dry ice to the University of Wisconsin where they will be evaluated for HIV-1&#xD;
      subtype and genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No material inducements for recruitment will be offered and no personnel at the PIDC will&#xD;
      receive incentives for recruitment of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is minimal risk to the patient. ARV therapy is standard of care at the PIDC for&#xD;
      those infected with HIV and having AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-tests of significance and other population cohort analyses will be performed to examine&#xD;
      whether there is a correlation between HIV-1 subtype, clinical failure, and the appearance of&#xD;
      specific genetic resistant mutants. There is no statistical justification for the sample&#xD;
      size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only risk from this study is bruising and the transient pain of the blood drawn for&#xD;
      analysis (see consent form). Since AIDS is a devastating disease in Uganda and ARV therapy&#xD;
      represents the only hope HIV infected children have, there is no particular concern for&#xD;
      examination of medical records for these children. There is no cultural sensitivity to&#xD;
      drawing blood in PIDC population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical benefit to the study participants in this research is the knowledge of mutations&#xD;
      (in those failing therapy) before starting second line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians caring for the patient will administer the consent form. All are fluent in English&#xD;
      (the national Uganda language) and Lugandan (the prevalent dialect in Kampala and surrounding&#xD;
      areas). See the consent form (What your signatures or thumb print means) enclosed for&#xD;
      details.&#xD;
