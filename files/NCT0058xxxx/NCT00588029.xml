      The purpose of this study is to collect a blood sample from patients with breast disease&#xD;
      (cases) and from individuals without breast cancer (controls)that may be used for research&#xD;
      purposes. These blood samples will be used by researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer&#xD;
      Center who study the causes of breast cancer, as well as more effective ways to prevent,&#xD;
      diagnose, and treat breast cancer.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For acquisition of existing breast cancer tissue specimens from the MSKCC Tissue&#xD;
             Procurement Service, the only criteria are a pathologically-confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
             invasive breast cancer and the availability of corresponding nonmalignant tissue from&#xD;
             each case.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the prospective acquisition of blood or saliva from control subjects without&#xD;
             breast cancer, eligibility criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient with a previous diagnosis of invasive breast cancer who undergoes a&#xD;
             palliative procedure related to the presence of a pleural effusion is eligible for the&#xD;
             pleural fluid collection aspect of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any female patient, or any female over the age of 18 accompanying a patient under the&#xD;
             care of a physician in the Department of Urology, Department of Surgery, or Department&#xD;
             of Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will have no history of preinvasive (carcinoma in situ) or invasive breast&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be eligible without regard to racial, or ethnic status. Attending&#xD;
             physicians authorized to obtain informed consent may exercise discretion in excluding&#xD;
             individuals for appropriate medical or other (e.g., mentally impaired) reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the prospective acquisition of blood, saliva, pleural fluid or cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
             from patients who have or are suspected of having breast cancer or carcinoma in-situ,&#xD;
             eligibility criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient at MSKCC with a previously confirmed or suspected diagnosis of malignant&#xD;
             or premalignant (e.g., carcinoma in situ) breast disease is eligible for inclusion in&#xD;
             the blood acquisition aspect of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient with a previous diagnosis of invasive breast cancer who undergoes a&#xD;
             palliative procedure related to the presence of a pleural effusion is eligible for the&#xD;
             pleural fluid collection aspect of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient with a previous diagnosis of invasive breast cancer with leptomeningeal&#xD;
             metastasis who undergoes a routine procedure associated with the collection of&#xD;
             cerebrospinal fluid is eligible for the cerebrospinal fluid collection aspect of this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must be under the care of one or more members of the MSKCC Breast Disease&#xD;
             Management Team at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may have received prior hormonal therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation&#xD;
             therapy, or surgical therapy at MSKCC or another institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must be 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be eligible without regard to sex, racial, or ethnic status. It is&#xD;
             anticipated that approximately 99% of the patients will be female. Attending&#xD;
             physicians authorized to obtain informed consent may exercise discretion in excluding&#xD;
             individuals for appropriate medical or other (e.g., mentally impaired) reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If, after pathologic diagnosis, preinvasive or invasive breast disease is not found,&#xD;
             patients previously consented for the blood collection aspect of this protocol will&#xD;
             not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the prospective acquisition of blood or saliva from control subjects without&#xD;
             breast cancer, ineligibility criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A first degree relative (mother, daughter, sister, father, brother or son) who&#xD;
                  has been diagnosed with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A personal history of breast cancer, lobular carcinoma in situ or atypia.&#xD;
