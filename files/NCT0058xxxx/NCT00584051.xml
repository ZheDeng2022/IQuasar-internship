    <textblock>
      Asthma is an inflammatory condition of the airways in the lungs that results in obstruction&#xD;
      of airflow in those with the condition. The disease continues to be a major worldwide health&#xD;
      care problem and its prevalence continues to increase annually. In 2005, 20 million people&#xD;
      were diagnosed with asthma. The disease causes significant morbidity and accounts for 5,000&#xD;
      deaths annually. Between 1980 and 1994 the prevalence of asthma increased 74% in the United&#xD;
      States and, in children under age 5, the prevalence increased by 160%. The allergic etiology&#xD;
      of airway inflammation associated with asthma is established. Bronchial washings of asthmatic&#xD;
      subjects are most often characterized by eosinophils, mast cells, and cytokines that are&#xD;
      associated with the Th2 (allergic) phenotype. Similarly, IgE plays a pivotal role in airway&#xD;
      inflammation of asthmatic subjects when allergens that cross-link IgE bound to mast cells in&#xD;
      the airways cause the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. The association&#xD;
      of asthma and the IgE mediated allergic phenotype is well established and up to 70% of&#xD;
      asthmatics also suffer from allergic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequately treated asthma often has minimal impact of quality of life but diagnosis and&#xD;
      proper treatment is often delayed, resulting in increased missed school days, emergency room&#xD;
      visits, and otherwise preventable degradation in quality of life. It would therefore be&#xD;
      highly useful to identify a biomarker that can be used to assist in the diagnosis of asthma&#xD;
      or to identify subjects at higher risk of developing allergic disease or asthma in the&#xD;
      future. Efforts at identifying a genetic marker for the early diagnosis of asthma have been&#xD;
      unsuccessful, mainly due to the complexity of the pathogenesis of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrial natriuretic factor is a pro-hormone precursor for 4 natriuretic peptide hormones&#xD;
      including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). ANP's effects on the cardiovascular system are&#xD;
      well characterized. Less well understood is the role these hormones play in immune&#xD;
      regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have demonstrated a role for ANP in the regulation of immune function: ANP&#xD;
      induces release of histamine from mast cells and macrophages, stimulates migration of&#xD;
      neutrophils, enhances the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells, and stimulates&#xD;
      TNF-Î² production. Human dendritic cells express ANP receptors (GC-a) which polarize CD4+&#xD;
      cells towards a Th2 phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since allergic rhinitis and asthma are associated with a Th2 phenotype, it is possible that&#xD;
      elevated levels of ANP can be used to predict asthma severity or to predict future&#xD;
      predilection to atopic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of ANP gene polymorphisms that have been studied and found to be&#xD;
      associated with renal disease, heart disease, hypertension and diabetes. Several studies have&#xD;
      investigated the potential role of these polymorphisms in cardiovascular disease and have&#xD;
      found association between polymorphisms of the ANP gene and left ventricular remodeling,&#xD;
      hypertension, renal disease, diabetes, and increased risk of ischemic stroke. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, no studies evaluating the role of ANP polymorphisms in allergic disease have been&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research proposal is to evaluate whether ANP levels can be utilized to&#xD;
      assist in diagnosis of asthma and in the prediction of asthma severity. Additionally, we will&#xD;
      investigate the potential effect of polymorphisms in the ANP gene on asthma severity and thus&#xD;
      serve as a useful genetic marker to predict future risk of atopy and asthma.&#xD;

        The study will include three groups; an asthma group, an allergic rhinitis group, and a&#xD;
        healthy control group. Participants will be between 18-40 years of age and will meet&#xD;
        inclusion/exclusion criteria outlined below. The study will continue for a total of 1 year.&#xD;
        Study subjects will keep a diary of symptoms using a validated asthma subjective&#xD;
        questionnaire (Juniper). Serum levels of atrial natriuretic peptide and serum IgE, will be&#xD;
        obtained at the initial visit and then at regular intervals depending on the study group&#xD;
        (table 1).&#xD;
