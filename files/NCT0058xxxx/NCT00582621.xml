  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the genetic causes of Hodgkin's disease (a&#xD;
      kind of lymphoma) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as multiple myeloma, leukemia, and&#xD;
      related diseases. The doctors have identified the patient because 1) they have had a&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative disorder such as lymphoma, leukemia, or multiple myeloma, and have a&#xD;
      family member with one of these disorders or 2) they are a member of a family with a&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative disorder, including Hodgkin's disease and/or, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or a&#xD;
      second cancer after Hodgkin's disease.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a personal and/or family history of lymphoma or lymphoproliferative&#xD;
             disease B-cell malignancies, or multiple myeloma referred for study participation, or&#xD;
             MSK patients referred from to the MSKCC outpatient clinics of the Lymphoma, Multiple&#xD;
             Myeloma, or Leukemia Services in the Department of Medicine in consultation for&#xD;
             treatment who are found on routine history or through a Family History Questionnaire&#xD;
             (FHQ) (Appendix A). Individuals who have relatives or members of successive&#xD;
             generations of the family affected with Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,&#xD;
             lymphoid leukemia, multiple myeloma other lymphoproliferative disease prostate or&#xD;
             pancreatic cancers, or other conditions suggesting hereditary cancer at the discretion&#xD;
             of the MSKCC Principal Investigator. Patients with lymphoma, associated with colon and&#xD;
             renal cancer will be eligible for DNA storage through this protocol. Family members or&#xD;
             probands with Hodgkin's disease who are women who received therapeutic irradiation for&#xD;
             Hodgkin's disease&quot; or who developed secondary cancers after Hodgkin's disease are also&#xD;
             eligible for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The criteria for eligibility are broad because the ascertainment by the computerized&#xD;
             FHQ does not allow for resolution of different types of lymphoma or different types of&#xD;
             leukemia. Patient recall of this information is also imprecise. More accurate family&#xD;
             history information will be obtained upon contact of family members and diagnoses will&#xD;
             be verified by obtaining pathologic documentation. The spectrum of familial&#xD;
             lymphoproliferative syndromes (LPS) may include all types of lymphoma as well as&#xD;
             chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This is an additional reason to have a broad&#xD;
             eligibility. Subset analysis will be performed on specific types of lymphoid&#xD;
             neoplasms. DNA of patients with a family history of lymphoma who have consented to&#xD;
             protocol 93-102 (&quot;Ascertainment of Peripheral Blood or Saliva Samples for Genetic&#xD;
             Epidemiology Studies of Familial Cancers&quot;) will also be eligible for inclusion in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Family members of probands including patients, sisters, brothers, halfbrothers and&#xD;
             sisters, sons, daughters, grandparents, as well as aunts and uncles are also eligible.&#xD;
             An effort will be made to ascertain all living affected and unaffected living&#xD;
             relatives in the affected lineage. An emphasis will be on affected sibling pairs and&#xD;
             both parents, if alive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As this study involves research that presents no greater than minimal risk to children&#xD;
             (see Sec. 46.404 of Federal Regulations part 46), minors are also eligible for&#xD;
             participation. The assent of any minor should be obtained before the patient is&#xD;
             enrolled into this study, as well as the consent of the legal guardian.&#xD;
