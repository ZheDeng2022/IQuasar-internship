    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate new non-invasive imaging techniques for the&#xD;
      evaluation of skin lesions, as well as normal skin. Our primary goal is to collect and study&#xD;
      these images of different skin lesions along with matching biopsy specimens. The long-term&#xD;
      goal is to develop a technique that will improve the early detection of skin cancer and&#xD;
      eliminate the need for many skin biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The High-resolution OCT (Apollo Medical Optics) device can provide both cross-sectional and&#xD;
      en-face images with cellular information. Real-time color images through the same objective&#xD;
      with OCT are also provided to show the OCT imaging location of lesion. The color image can be&#xD;
      registered simultaneously on a larger dermoscopic image obtained by an external dermoscope.&#xD;
      The imaging mode of cross-sectional, en-face and color image can be switched arbitrarily to&#xD;
      align the lesion and obtain high-resolution images efficiently. The total imaging time is&#xD;
      around 10 to 15 minutes depending on the number of images to be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help identify more diagnostic features of optical imaging and better understand their&#xD;
      histology correlation, we have developed a novel technique called &quot;precision biopsy&quot;.&#xD;
      Precision biopsy is an optical imaging guided, feature-targeted mini-biopsy. Once the feature&#xD;
      of interest is identified and isolated by the optical imaging, a 2.0 mm punch biopsy is&#xD;
      performed. Besides cosmetic benefit of minimal scarring, this tissue sparing biopsy captures&#xD;
      the &quot;feature of interest&quot; for histology revelation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the histologic features of precision biopsy will be compared to images gathered&#xD;
      by multi-modal optical imaging. The precision biopsy will also be compared to the traditional&#xD;
      shave biopsy or shave excision, to determine whether the diagnostic information is comparable&#xD;
      between the two methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For live remote control (LRC) imaging consultation, MSK dermatologist will based on his&#xD;
      clinical examination. An imaging technician will perform the clinical and dermoscopic&#xD;
      imaging, while the expert reader will perform confocal imaging remotely via a HIPPA compliant&#xD;
      Webex platform.&#xD;
