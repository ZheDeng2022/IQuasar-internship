  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate several aspects of thinking abilities including&#xD;
      attention and memory, and quality of life in patients who were diagnosed with and treated for&#xD;
      Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL), and are in remission of their disease. The findings of this&#xD;
      study may help us understand whether this disease and its treatment may have affected some&#xD;
      patients' thinking skills, and may provide important information that can be used to develop&#xD;
      programs to improve the quality of life of patients with PCNSL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will also study whether persons having particular types of genes involved in&#xD;
      the metabolism of methionine (5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine S-methyltransferase-MTR,&#xD;
      MTFH reductase-MTFHR, transcobalamin 2-Tc2), and apolipoprotein E (APOE) are more likely to&#xD;
      have delayed adverse effects after treatment for their tumors. The findings of this study may&#xD;
      help us understand whether this disease and its treatment may have affected some patients'&#xD;
      thinking skills, and whether this may be related to having certain genes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) has increased threefold in&#xD;
      immunocompetent populations in recent years. Improvements in treatment, particularly&#xD;
      involving combined modality therapy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been shown to&#xD;
      augment patient survival with a median disease-free period of about 40 months. However, the&#xD;
      combination of these two modalities often increases the risk for delayed neurotoxicity. There&#xD;
      is a paucity of studies that have assessed neuropsychological functioning and quality of life&#xD;
      in patients with PCNSL. The majority of studies reported performance status and survival&#xD;
      rates, but systematic cognitive evaluations were only seldom included. Unfortunately, relying&#xD;
      only on these variables does not adequately assess the more subtle cognitive impairments that&#xD;
      most patients with brain tumors experience. Neuropsychological difficulties often interfere&#xD;
      with disease free patients' ability to function at premorbid levels at work and at home. A&#xD;
      study including neuropsychological evaluations of a relatively large group of patients with&#xD;
      PCNSL who received combined modality treatments, and are in remission from their disease is&#xD;
      planned. A follow-up assessment also will be performed in order to monitor performance over a&#xD;
      specified period of time. The proposed study will also test the hypotheses that: (1) the&#xD;
      presence of polymorphisms that influence methionine metabolism places PCNSL patients treated&#xD;
      with chemotherapy alone or in combination with radiotherapy at risk for developing&#xD;
      treatment-induced white matter disease and cognitive dysfunction; (2) the possession of the&#xD;
      apolipoprotein E (APOE) Ñ”-4 allele is associated with the development of cognitive&#xD;
      difficulties following treatment for PCNSL. Research in order to better understand the&#xD;
      incidence, extent, and severity of treatment-induced neuropsychological impairments in&#xD;
      patients with PCNSL is of utmost importance, given the recent increase in both the number of&#xD;
      cases diagnosed and longterm survival. It is likely to provide valuable information regarding&#xD;
      specific cognitive domains that should be addressed in the development of strategies for&#xD;
      cognitive rehabilitation or other interventions that may be appropriate. The findings of this&#xD;
      study will also be relevant for comparison with ongoing and future research investigating the&#xD;
      potential neurocognitive sequelae of alternative treatment modalities for PCNSL (e.g.,&#xD;
      high-dose chemotherapy followed by peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplant).&#xD;
