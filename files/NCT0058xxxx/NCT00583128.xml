  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the experimental&#xD;
      drug AST-120 in treating patients with non-constipating IBS. The study will test whether or&#xD;
      not patients receiving AST-120 experience at least a 50% reduction in the number of days with&#xD;
      abdominal pain compared to placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients experiencing non-constipating IBS will be randomized to one of two arms in the&#xD;
      study: the experimental drug AST-120 or placebo. Patients will take 2g of AST-120 or placebo&#xD;
      three times per day for eight weeks. After the 8 week course, patients will receive an&#xD;
      additional 8 weeks single blind treatment, after a one week washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental drug AST-120 is composed of black, odorless spherical carbon particles in 2g&#xD;
      sachets (aluminum foil pouches). The placebo consists of microcrystalline cellulose spheres,&#xD;
      Celphere CP-305 stained to match the appearance of AST-120, in 2g sachets (aluminum foil&#xD;
      pouches). Both AST-120 and placebo are oral (taken by mouth) preparations. Both are&#xD;
      tasteless. To take the product, patients will tear open the sachet, drop the contents&#xD;
      directly on their tongue and wash it down with 8 ounces of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be expected to participate in up to 10 visits, approximately three by telephone&#xD;
      and the remainder of visits are in-clinic. At these visits, patients will undergo a number of&#xD;
      tests including: hematology panel, lactose intolerance testing, physical exams, pregnancy&#xD;
      tests, evaluations based on the following scales: The Bristol Stool Scale, IBS Severity&#xD;
      Scale, IBS Quality of Life, SCL-90R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provided the patient has been stable for eight weeks prior to their baseline visit, they will&#xD;
      be allowed to take the following medications: drugs that inhibit gastric secretion (histamine&#xD;
      blockers, proton pump inhibitors), benzodiazepines and Imidazopyridines (short acting,&#xD;
      nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics) for sleep (dose must be consistent with the use of a sleep&#xD;
      agent) aspirin at a cardiovascular prophylactic dose (75-150 mg/day) and paracetamol.&#xD;
      Antidepressants for non-IBS symptoms are allowed. Loperamide will be permitted as a rescue&#xD;
      for diarrhea only when patients are experiencing at least 3 liquid or soft stools in one day.&#xD;
      However, Loperamide is prohibited during the two week screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not be allowed to take the following medications whilst on trial and these&#xD;
      therapies must have been discontinued by at least two weeks prior to their baseline visit:&#xD;
      probiotics, neuroleptics, antidepressants for IBS symptoms, daytime tranquilizers,&#xD;
      prokinetics, spasmolytics, analgesics, other investigational agents and any over-the-counter&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be required to keep a diary during the study&#xD;
