      Pilot Study of Budesonide for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis with overlap features of Autoimmune&#xD;
      Hepatitis Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic liver disease of unknown cause that&#xD;
      may result in inflammation and destruction of the bile ducts inside the liver. Over time,&#xD;
      cirrhosis and complications of liver failure may develop. Although treatment with ursodiol&#xD;
      has been association with a reduction in liver enzymes (blood tests) and a reduction in the&#xD;
      progression of the disease, some patients do not respond to ursodiol therapy. Patients with&#xD;
      overlap features of Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH) appear to be at higher risk of developing&#xD;
      complications of disease even when on ursodiol. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects and safety of Budesonide in PBC with overlap features of AIH. Budesonide has unique&#xD;
      effects on the immune system that may be helpful in the treatment of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will include those patients with a diagnosis of PBC with overlap&#xD;
      features of AIH and in whom liver enzymes have not sufficiently improved with ursodiol&#xD;
      therapy (the alkaline phosphatase is not less than twice upper normal). At entry all patients&#xD;
      will have a history and physical examination, blood tests, bone densitometry and complete&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaires. Patients will be prescribed Budesonide 9 mg to take daily for&#xD;
      one year in addition to the ursodiol. The medication can be taken with or without food. Blood&#xD;
      tests and symptoms diaries will be completed every 3 months. Patients will be contacted by&#xD;
      phone to assess tolerance of the medication and any new health problems. At one year,&#xD;
      patients will return for a history and physical and repeat blood tests and bone densitometry.&#xD;
      Possible side-effects include bone mass loss (bone thinning), diarrhea, indigestion, nausea,&#xD;
      joint pains, dizziness, headaches, weight gain and Cushing's syndrome. Other side-effects are&#xD;
      possible. The medication and the tests will be billed to the patient or patient's insurance.&#xD;
