      The purpose of this open-label study is to determine the tolerance and efficacy of&#xD;
      twice-daily application of PRK 124 (Pyratine-6)(0.125%) moisturizing lotion for improving the&#xD;
      signs and symptoms of mild to moderate facial rosacea.&#xD;

      Cytokinins are plant growth factors that regulate plant growth and differentiation. PRK 124&#xD;
      (N-furfuryl-9-(2-tetrahydropyranyl) adenine)(Pyratine 6™) is a cytokinin that has been shown&#xD;
      to have modulatory, anti-ROS (reactive oxygen species), and antisenescence effects on the&#xD;
      growth of human skin cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent clinical studies showed that PRK 124 (0.1%) treatment in 40 subjects for 12 weeks&#xD;
      improved the appearance of photodamaged facial skin by decreasing fine wrinkles, roughness&#xD;
      and mottled hyperpigmentation. Treatment with PRK 124 lotion furthermore decreased skin&#xD;
      transepidermal water loss and also increased skin moisture content. The topical PRK 124&#xD;
      lotion was well tolerated by the subjects with no significant increase in erythema or&#xD;
      irritation. Treatment with PRK 124 was shown to decrease both acne and erythema observed at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rosacea is a common, chronic dermatosis that is characterized by papules and pustules,&#xD;
      persistent erythema and telangiectasia. The objective of this study is to compare the&#xD;
      long-term efficacy and tolerance of PRK 124 (0.125%) moisturizing lotion applied twice daily&#xD;
      for 48 weeks for improving the clinical signs and symptoms of inflammatory acne rosacea as&#xD;
      well as cutaneous signs of skin photodamage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty four volunteers with mild-to-moderate facial rosacea will participate in this single&#xD;
      center, open-label study designed to evaluate the subject=s tolerance and effectiveness of&#xD;
      PRK 124 (0.125%) moisturizing lotion applied twice daily for 48 weeks, for improving the&#xD;
      signs and symptoms of acne rosacea. Subjects will apply the test lotion twice daily, once in&#xD;
      morning and again in the evening before bedtime. Subjects will be assessed at baseline and at&#xD;
      4, 8 and 12 weeks after treatment for improvement in the clinical signs and symptoms of acne&#xD;
      rosacea and effect of treatments on transepidermal water loss (TEWL). In addition, the&#xD;
      subject's tolerance will be assessed at each follow-up visit (weeks 4, 8, and 12). Facial&#xD;
      photographs will be obtained at baseline and at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Subjects will then be&#xD;
      given the opportunity to continue treatment for 36 additional weeks. Subjects must have&#xD;
      normal clinical laboratory tests, and if female, a negative urine pregnancy test at 12 weeks&#xD;
      to continue the 36 weeks treatment. Clinical laboratory tests and urine pregnancy test will&#xD;
      be repeated at week 48 or early study completion. Clinical assessments will be done at weeks&#xD;
      24, 36 and 48 during the last 36 weeks. Additional objective measures of skin moisture&#xD;
      content and skin erythema using a chromameter will be done at week 12 and at follow-up visits&#xD;
      (weeks 24, 36 and 48). Telephone follow-up will be done at weeks 16, 20, 28, 32 and 40 to&#xD;
      assess subject tolerance and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Global assessment of severity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall improvement over baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photodamage (fine wrinkles, texture, mottled hyperpigmentation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transepidermal water loss (TEWL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin moisture content&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin erythema as measured by a chromameter&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject self assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signs &amp; symptoms (burning/stinging, erythema/telangiectasia, papules/pustules)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall improvement over baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photodamage (fine wrinkles, texture, mottled hyperpigmentation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cosmetic acceptability&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local skin tolerance of the treatments will be assessed by the Investigator and by the&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by percent improvement on a scale of 0-4. Subjects received a 0 for no improvement, 1 for less than twenty-five percent improvement, a 2 for twenty-five to fifty percent improvement, a 3 for fifty to seventy-five percent improvement and a 4 for greater than seventy-five percent improvement. Mean scores from all continuing 16 participants were averaged for each encounter, for a total of 8 visits. The percent improvement in mean erythema severity was calculated by comparing the change in mean scores at week 48 to mean scores assessed at baseline.</description>

        <title>Erythema Severity</title>
        <description>Measured by percent improvement on a scale of 0-4. Subjects received a 0 for no improvement, 1 for less than twenty-five percent improvement, a 2 for twenty-five to fifty percent improvement, a 3 for fifty to seventy-five percent improvement and a 4 for greater than seventy-five percent improvement. Mean scores from all continuing 16 participants were averaged for each encounter, for a total of 8 visits. The percent improvement in mean erythema severity was calculated by comparing the change in mean scores at week 48 to mean scores assessed at baseline.</description>
