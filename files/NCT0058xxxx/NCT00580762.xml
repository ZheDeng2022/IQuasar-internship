      This study will address a true clinical problem by developing a risk/benefit analysis for&#xD;
      rapid surgical weight loss in the ESRD population. The risks of surgical intervention, as&#xD;
      well as, potential nutritional concerns, balanced with that of the potential medical benefits&#xD;
      associated with significant weight loss.&#xD;

      The study will be designed to compare two cohorts of patients that will undergo laparoscopic&#xD;
      RYGB. Cohort 1 will include ESRD patients on HD who meet the NIH guidelines and preoperative&#xD;
      requirements for RYGB. Cohort 2 will include non-ESRD patients who meet the NIH guidelines&#xD;
      and preoperative requirements for RYGB. Laparoscopic RYGB will be performed in ESRD patients&#xD;
      who meet the guidelines recommended by the National Institutes of Health consensus statement&#xD;
      . This includes patients who either have a BMI≥40 kg/m2 or have a BMI≥35 kg/m2 and have a&#xD;
      significant morbidity attributed to their obesity (i.e. sleep apnea, hypertension, and&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus). All patients will undergo a complete pre-operative evaluation inclusive&#xD;
      of dietary instruction, assessment of surgical risk, psychosocial evaluation and compliance&#xD;
      evaluation. This evaluation will be conducted through an existing infrastructure at the&#xD;
      investigators Bariatric Surgery Center. Patients will be required to be on hemodialysis or&#xD;
      able to be converted to hemodialysis for the perioperative period. All procedures will be&#xD;
      performed by the same team of surgeons, experienced in both laparoscopic RYGB, organ&#xD;
      transplantation and general surgery in ESRD patients. The risks involved with Roux-en-Y&#xD;
      gastric bypass surgery will be discussed with the patient. These risks are inherent to the&#xD;
      procedure, however the procedure is being conducted for medical appropriate reasons and&#xD;
      therefore the benefits to the procedure outweigh the risks. At the present time, it is&#xD;
      believed, without any justification, that this procedure is more risky or too risky in the&#xD;
      ESRD population. A primary objective of this study is to investigate this question.&#xD;
