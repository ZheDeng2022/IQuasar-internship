  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about individual's with a family history of colon&#xD;
      cancer and the process by which they may decide to undergo or not undergo prophylactic&#xD;
      colectomy. This is a surgery to remove the colon in order to reduce risk of cancer (or of&#xD;
      getting cancer again).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is associated with up to an 80% lifetime&#xD;
      risk of developing colorectal cancer and a 40-50% chance of a metachronous tumor after&#xD;
      partial colectomy for the disease. For these patients, prophylactic colectomy has been&#xD;
      proposed as a potential risk management alternative to a lifetime of intensive surveillance&#xD;
      by colonoscopy. The highly personal nature of such risk management decisions has been&#xD;
      recognized in the development of individualized genetic counseling services. However, prior&#xD;
      psychosocial research in this area has tended to use linear statistical techniques in which&#xD;
      clinically important details are lost in an overly broad, one size-fits-all model that is&#xD;
      difficult to apply in a one-to-one counseling session. We propose an innovative approach&#xD;
      based on the Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (C-SHIP) model in which we will&#xD;
      explore how attitudes towards prophylactic colectomy are organized into meaningful patterns&#xD;
      or types that can translate readily into tailored counseling recommendations. Specific aims&#xD;
      of this study are: 1)to assess levels of intention in prophylactic colectomy among HNPCC&#xD;
      patients; 2)To identify distinctive decision types based on profiles of perceived pros and&#xD;
      cons of prophylactic colectomy; and 3) To explore the pattern of relations between decision&#xD;
      types and counseling-related outcomes (level of intention in colectomy, cancer-specific&#xD;
      anxiety, and colonoscopy adherence). We will conduct a one-time cross-sectional telephone&#xD;
      survey of 320 HNPCC patients (defined as either carriers of a mutated mismatch repair gene&#xD;
      associated with HNPCC or those with a personal/family history meeting published criteria for&#xD;
      HNPCC). Using cluster analysis we will create a taxonomy of decision types. Prior research&#xD;
      leads us to expect at least three types: Disengaged, Risk-Focused, and Ambivalent. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that each type will have a different pattern of relations with the outcome&#xD;
      variables (e.g., Risk-focused types will show higher level of intention regarding surgery,&#xD;
      high anxiety, low avoidance, and high colonoscopy adherence, whereas Ambivalent types will&#xD;
      show higher level of intention regarding surgery, high anxiety, high avoidance, and low&#xD;
      colonoscopy adherence). Understanding these patterns will enhance the ability of physicians,&#xD;
      genetic counselors, and other providers to help their patients make well informed, thoughtful&#xD;
      decisions about the preventive strategy that will best protect their health, emotional&#xD;
      well-being, and quality of life.&#xD;

             cancer history characteristics associated with HNPCC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are considered at sufficiently high risk by their CRC specialty physician that&#xD;
             prophylactic colectomy may be presented as an option (excluding FAP).&#xD;
