      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are as follows: 1) to describe the spectrum of small intestinal&#xD;
      lesions demonstrated by capsule endoscopy (CE) in patients with Crohn's disease; 2) to&#xD;
      determine the inter-observer agreement for recognizing these small intestinal lesions; 3) to&#xD;
      determine the sensitivity, positive predictive value, and accuracy of CE, CT enterography,&#xD;
      small bowel follow-through, colonoscopy with ileoscopy, and all pairwise combinations of&#xD;
      these examinations with a consensus clinical diagnosis for the diagnosis and evaluation of&#xD;
      the extent and severity of small intestinal Crohn's disease; 4) to establish a Crohn's&#xD;
      Disease Capsule Endoscopy Index of Severity (CDCEIS); 5) to describe the spectrum of right&#xD;
      colon lesions demonstrated by CE in patients with Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive adult patients with suspected or definite Crohn's disease seen in the&#xD;
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinic at Mayo Clinic Rochester will be offered enrollment in a&#xD;
      prospective observational trial comparing CE with CT enterography, small bowel&#xD;
      follow-through, colonoscopy, and a consensus clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Seventy&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained. Co-investigators in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)&#xD;
      Clinic will clinically evaluate all patients, including a history and limited physical&#xD;
      examination. Patients will undergo clinically indicated laboratory tests. Serum will be&#xD;
      stored on all patients for other potential laboratory studies. Patients will complete a&#xD;
      retrospective symptom diary for the week prior to their evaluation at Mayo, and a Crohn's&#xD;
      Disease Activity Index (CDAI) will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a CT enterography with peroral contrast interpreted by a&#xD;
      co-investigator radiologist. All patients will undergo a clinically indicated colonoscopy&#xD;
      with ileoscopy by a staff co-investigator (not by C.A.S. or the staff co-investigator&#xD;
      interpreting the CE), and a Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) will be&#xD;
      calculated. If no significant small bowel strictures are identified by CT enterography or&#xD;
      colonoscopy with ileoscopy, then patients will subsequently undergo CE. All CE studies will&#xD;
      be read separately by C.A.S. (gastroenterology fellow) and a supervising staff&#xD;
      gastroenterologist co-investigator, each blinded to the other's interpretation. The&#xD;
      interobserver agreement between C.A.S. and the co-investigator staff will be determined.&#xD;
      Patients will lastly have a clinically indicated small bowel follow-through interpreted by a&#xD;
      co-investigator radiologist. All co-investigators will be blinded to the results of the other&#xD;
      imaging modalities until after interpreting their respective studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following each imaging procedure, the interpreting physician will complete both small&#xD;
      intestine and colon anatomy forms. The physician will identify all types of lesions present&#xD;
      and also give both a global evaluation of the severity of lesions found and a global Crohn's&#xD;
      disease activity score indicating one of the following: active Crohn's disease, suspicious&#xD;
      for Crohn's disease, inactive Crohn's disease, or no evidence of Crohn's disease.&#xD;
      Co-investigators representing each of the diagnostic modalities will meet periodically to&#xD;
      review those cases where there is disagreement among the imaging procedures with respect to&#xD;
      the extent and severity of small intestinal Crohn's disease in order to reach a consensus&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis. This consensus clinical diagnosis will serve as the gold standard against&#xD;
      which each of the individual imaging modalities is evaluated. Sensitivity, positive&#xD;
      predictive value, and accuracy of all diagnostic modalities compared to the consensus&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis will be determined. A Crohn's disease capsule endoscopy index of severity&#xD;
      (CDCEIS) will be created after the CE studies have been reviewed by investigators from other&#xD;
      referral centers both inside and outside the United States to determine the inter-observer&#xD;
      agreement (reproducibility) for each type of small bowel lesion identified by CE. Logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis with step-wise deletion will then be utilized to create the CDCEIS using&#xD;
      only those lesions that are reproducible, with the global Crohn's disease endoscopic activity&#xD;
      score from the CE as the dependent variable.&#xD;

             by colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of abdominal radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known or suspected oropharyngeal or esophageal dysphagia (unless recent&#xD;

             performed prior to administration of the M2A capsule)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a creatinine ≥ 2.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with documented reaction to iodinated contrast material.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an ileostomy or colostomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with documented reaction to metoclopramide.&#xD;
&#xD;

             often chronically anemic, and a hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dl or greater would allow these&#xD;
             patients to safely participate in the study.)&#xD;
