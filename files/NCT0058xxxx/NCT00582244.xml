  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women in the Netherlands.&#xD;
      Approximately 11,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer annually, of whom about 30% are&#xD;
      below 50 years of age. Premenopausal women with breast cancer treated with chemotherapy or&#xD;
      hormonal therapy may experience a premature onset of the menopause. Estrogen deficiency&#xD;
      following adjuvant treatments leads to primary endocrine symptoms, including vasomotor and&#xD;
      urogenital problems. Secondary symptoms include insomnia due to night sweats, dyspareunia due&#xD;
      to vaginal dryness, weight gain, and psychological distress. The symptoms resulting from&#xD;
      accelerated estrogen withdrawal can be pronounced and severe, and may adversely affect&#xD;
      women's sexual functioning, body image, and overall HRQL. Healthy women who enter natural&#xD;
      menopause are often prescribed hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to alleviate vasomotor and&#xD;
      sexual symptoms. However, due to possible tumor-promoting effects, HRT is contraindicated for&#xD;
      patients with a history of breast cancer. For these women, non-hormonal medications are&#xD;
      frequently prescribed to treat vasomotor symptoms. Although these medications have been shown&#xD;
      to yield moderate symptom relief, they also have a number of bothersome side effects. To&#xD;
      alleviate urogenital symptoms, local vaginal moisturizing or estrogen cream is often&#xD;
      prescribed. There is growing evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including&#xD;
      relaxation techniques, and physical exercise may effectively reduce vasomotor symptoms in&#xD;
      naturally occurring menopause. CBT and relaxation techniques are aimed primarily at the&#xD;
      modification of precipitants of hot flushes and at stress management. Physical exercise on a&#xD;
      regular basis affects neurotransmitters, which regulate central thermoregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The proposed study will evaluate the efficacy of a supportive intervention program&#xD;
      in alleviating menopausal symptoms, improving sexual functioning and enhancing the quality of&#xD;
      life of younger women (&lt; 50 years) with breast cancer who have become prematurely menopausal&#xD;
      as a result of their treatment. Specifically, the study will evaluate CBT including&#xD;
      relaxation (A), physical exercise (B), and a combination of A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of investigation: This multicenter study will employ a prospective, full-factorial&#xD;
      design. In total, 325 consenting women will be randomized to group A, group B, group AB or a&#xD;
      usual care, 'waiting list' control group (N = 81-81 per group). Upon completion of the study,&#xD;
      the patients assigned to the control group will be given the opportunity to undergo either&#xD;
      the A or B intervention program. The program will begin with a structured assessment of the&#xD;
      target symptoms: hot flushes, night sweating and vaginal dryness. The overriding goal of the&#xD;
      intervention is to provide symptomatic women with information skills and support to manage&#xD;
      their symptoms more effectively. For group A, the intervention will consist of 6 weekly group&#xD;
      CBT sessions of 1.5 hours, of 15 minutes of daily homework and a booster session at 3 months.&#xD;
      The CBT will focus on understanding and self-control of menopausal symptoms. Relaxation&#xD;
      techniques (paced respiration and muscle relaxation) will focus on the reduction of&#xD;
      sympathetic nervous system activity, and are expected to have a positive impact on the&#xD;
      frequency and intensity of hot flushes. For group B, the intervention will be an individually&#xD;
      tailored, 12 week home-based physical exercise program of 2.5-3 hours per week, with&#xD;
      instructions provided in-clinic on 2 occasions, and telephone support on 2 additional,&#xD;
      interim occasions. The physical exercise program is intended to enhance fitness levels, in&#xD;
      general, and to improve thermoregulation specifically related to hot flushes. Group AB will&#xD;
      receive both the CBT and exercise program elements. Women allocated to the intervention&#xD;
      groups will be asked to complete a battery of questionnaires assessing menopausal symptoms&#xD;
      (the primary outcome), sexuality, body- and self-image, psychological distress and generic&#xD;
      HRQL prior to the start of the program (baseline, T0), at 12 weeks (T1) and at 6 months&#xD;
      follow-up (T2). Women allocated to the control group will complete the same questionnaire&#xD;
      battery at parallel points in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results/ relevance: If demonstrated to be effective, the availability of a structured&#xD;
      supportive intervention program (modules A, B or AB) will be a welcome addition to regular&#xD;
      medical care offered to breast cancer patients with treatment-induced menopause. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that such a program will have direct benefit in terms of symptoms relief and the&#xD;
      improvement of patients' HRQL.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study sample will be composed of 325 women, younger than 50 years of age, with&#xD;
        histologically confirmed primary breast cancer (stages: T1 - T4, N0 - N1 and M0). All women&#xD;
        will have been premenopausal at the time of diagnosis, have completed adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
        (with the exception of herceptin, which can continue to receive) a minimum of 4 months and&#xD;
        a maximum of 5 years prior to study entry. Women may currently be receiving adjuvant&#xD;
        hormonal therapy. All women should be disease-free at time of study entry. Potentially&#xD;
        eligible women will be screened for the presence of at least one of the following 3&#xD;
        menopausal symptoms during the previous 2-month period: hot flushes, sweating and/or&#xD;
        vaginal dryness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women will be excluded from the study if they lack basic proficiency in Dutch, if they have&#xD;
        serious cognitive or psychiatric problems, or serious physical comorbidity that would&#xD;
        preclude them from participating in a physical exercise program. Since physical exercise&#xD;
        may be contraindicated as a treatment for hot flushes in obese women, 49 patients with a&#xD;
        BMI ≥ 30 will be excluded from the study. Patients participating in concurrent studies or&#xD;
        rehabilitation programs containing psychosocial interventions will also be excluded.&#xD;
