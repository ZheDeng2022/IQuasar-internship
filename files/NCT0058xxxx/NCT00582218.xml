  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find ways to get services to families living with HIV. New&#xD;
      services for families living with HIV have been tried in places around the country. They seem&#xD;
      to benefit many families. We will work with places in New York City that provide HIV services&#xD;
      to find out more about family services. There, we will talk with people living with HIV,&#xD;
      their family members, and their providers. Many questions need to be answered. For example:&#xD;
      What kinds of services do families want? What would make it easier for families to come in&#xD;
      for services? What would get in the way?&#xD;

      Families affected by HIV and AIDS require access to a comprehensive continuum of services.&#xD;
      Findings from our own and other recently completed federally sponsored intervention trials&#xD;
      and other studies could be used to help expand and enhance these services. However, a number&#xD;
      of fundamental questions must first be answered about the feasibility of &quot;technology&#xD;
      transfer.&quot; This study will address this issue by conducting individual interviews and focus&#xD;
      groups with providers from 64 medical care and social service settings. Data will also be&#xD;
      obtained through a comprehensive assessment of providers' capacities to serve families and to&#xD;
      participate in technology transfer, including dimensions of organizational mission and&#xD;
      leadership, availability of resources, and connections in the community. Thirty&#xD;
      patients/clients served by each setting along with approximately twenty of their family&#xD;
      members will also be individually interviewed to assess their needs for services, factors&#xD;
      that affect their desire for family-oriented services, and their willingness to take part in&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention studies. Data analysis will determine how initial setting readiness&#xD;
      and setting capacities, and feedback about patient and family needs and willingness to&#xD;
      participate in research, influence change in readiness, interest in capacity building and&#xD;
      participation in research partnership activities. We will also conduct hierarchical data&#xD;
      analyses to better understand how providers' readiness and capacities are related to&#xD;
      clients'and families' service needs, barriers to participation, and willingness to&#xD;
      participate in research. Study findings will guide efforts to implement family-oriented&#xD;
      intervention research in frontline community service settings, and will help to establish a&#xD;
      scientific framework for studying the process of technology transfer. Additionally, this&#xD;
      project will lay the groundwork for sustained research collaboration with the network of&#xD;
      community providers participating in this study to further explore ways to address the needs&#xD;
      of families affected by HIV/AIDS.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria for Sampling AIDS Care Settings: Our goal in sampling is to identify and&#xD;
        recruit the kinds of organizations that might ultimately be targets for Phase IV trials and&#xD;
        other Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center dissemination efforts. For purposes of this&#xD;
        research, we define an &quot;AIDS Care Setting&quot; as any setting which:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provides primary medical care, case management, day treatment, mental health or&#xD;
             substance use treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Includes two or more full-time professional staff (e.g., social workers, nurses,&#xD;
             clergy, physicians, or psychologists) with primary responsibility for an HIV/AIDS&#xD;
             population.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active caseload of at least 50 people with HIV/AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has been in operation as an HIV/AIDS provider for at least two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has leadership and staff who are agreeable to participate in the work plan outlined in&#xD;
             the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria for Providers:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Working as an administrator of HIV/AIDS care services, or a direct provider of&#xD;
             services to HIV+ patients/clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Working at the agency for at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Working at the agency at least 20 hours a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to converse in English or Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Identified by agency leadership as staff who meet above criteria and can be&#xD;
             approached, or want to volunteer to be interviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria for Sampling Patients/Clients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Identified as HIV+ (according to identification by setting staff and/or by virtue of&#xD;
             receiving services in a program exclusively designated for people infected with&#xD;
             HIV/AIDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving services at an HIV/AIDS Care Setting sampled for this study, at the time of&#xD;
             recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Identified as a setting client for at least three months (in order to answer questions&#xD;
             about the setting).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 or older or emancipated minors over age 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to converse in English or Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physically and mentally capable of providing informed consent, as determined by a&#xD;
             trained interviewer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria for Patients'/Clients' Family Members: In keeping with the definition of&#xD;
        family as &quot;networks of mutual commitment&quot; adopted by the NIMH Family and AIDS Consortium,&#xD;
        and in recognition of the diverse types of family situations of people affected by&#xD;
        HIV/AIDS, we will include anyone designated as a &quot;family member&quot; by the index&#xD;
        client/patient who meets our other inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Identified by index patient client as &quot;one of the people in my family most likely to&#xD;
             participate in programs with me&quot; at the HIV/AIDS Care Setting sampled for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 or older or emancipated minors over age 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to converse in English or Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physically and mentally capable of providing informed consent, as determined by a&#xD;
             trained interviewer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for AIDS Care Settings: Note that two or more AIDS Care Settings may&#xD;
        exist within a single institution or agency. For example, hospitals may have separate&#xD;
        programs for adult and pediatric HIV. A community AIDS service organization may have&#xD;
        multiple distinct programs for different populations. Also, two settings may be closely&#xD;
        coordinated. In order to ensure independence among settings, we will adopt the following&#xD;
        exclusionary criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only one AIDS Care Setting administered or governed by a given institution will be&#xD;
             included in the study. If one setting from a particular institution agrees to&#xD;
             participate, other settings from that institution will be ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Multi-site programs or programs of a single agency that are working together in a&#xD;
             coordinated fashion for purposes of this study will be treated as a single &quot;AIDS Care&#xD;
             Setting.&quot; If we discover that programs are affiliated, we will remove them from the&#xD;
             list. In general, we will attempt to carry out this project at the site initially&#xD;
             identified, although involvement of multiple sites may be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Consideration for Providers: All providers who are identified by the agency&#xD;
        leadership will be approached. However, a provider will not be able to participate if&#xD;
        he/she has already participated in the study as a provider from another agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Considerations for Patients and Families: All patients/clients of settings&#xD;
        identified for this study and meeting above inclusion criteria are eligible.&#xD;
        Patients/clients will be able to participate regardless of whether or not they nominate a&#xD;
        family member to participate in the study with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients/clients will not be able to participate if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are not HIV+.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been receiving services at the HIV/AIDS care setting for less than three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are under the age of 18, or are not emancipated minors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are not able to converse in either English or Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are physically and mentally incapable of providing informed consent, as determined by&#xD;
             a trained interviewer.&#xD;
