  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that by slightly lowering the acidity of blood (or&#xD;
      increasing the pH), dialysis patients utilize protein and amino acids more efficiently.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The normal range of pH of the blood (measure of acid-base balance of body) is rather large.&#xD;
      It is defined as a range of pH between 7.38 and 7.44. There is evidence to suggest that a&#xD;
      high normal arterial pH (7.43-7.45) preserves nutritional status of individuals better than a&#xD;
      low normal arterial pH (7.36-7.38). We will test this hypothesis in a small group of stable&#xD;
      patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing automated peritoneal dialysis. It needs to&#xD;
      be noted that all pH levels to be attained in this study are considered to be normal. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure for the study will be the N-balance. The changes in blood pH will be&#xD;
      obtained by medications (ammonium chloride for lower pH and sodium bicarbonate for higher&#xD;
      pH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures: A total of eight subjects with end-stage renal disease undergoing automated&#xD;
      peritoneal dialysis will be recruited. The initial study procedures will be for purposes of&#xD;
      screening individuals for the study. The subjects will perform 24-hour collection of urine&#xD;
      and dialysate to assess dialysis dose and a peritoneal equilibration test to evaluate the&#xD;
      transport properties of the peritoneum. Only those subjects who receive the minimum dialysis&#xD;
      dose and have an average peritoneal transport type will enter the study. During this phase,&#xD;
      the subjects will maintain a food diary to evaluate dietary preferences and dietary calorie&#xD;
      and protein intake. These data will be used to prepare the diets for the subjects when they&#xD;
      are admitted to the GCRC. The next two weeks will be used to evaluate the response of&#xD;
      arterial pH to the use of the low alkali solution. If, at the end of two weeks, the arterial&#xD;
      pH is not in the desired range, the subjects will require ammonium chloride supplementation&#xD;
      to achieve the lower pH. In such subjects, ammonium chloride supplementation will be used for&#xD;
      all phases of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualifying subjects will be hospitalized in the GCRC for 41 days. The entire period of&#xD;
      hospitalization will be divided into two equal phases of 20.5 days each: one will be the low&#xD;
      pH phase (low alkali dialysis solution with/without ammonium chloride) and the second will be&#xD;
      the high pH phase (high alkali dialysis solution with sodium bicarbonate with/without&#xD;
      ammonium chloride). Nitrogen balance will be estimated during the entire period of&#xD;
      hospitalization. N-intake is a sum of dietary and medicinal intake, while N-output will be&#xD;
      N-losses in dialysate, urine and feces. The N-balance will be the difference between N-intake&#xD;
      and N-output. The second outcome measure will be leucine turnover studies. Leucine turnover&#xD;
      studies will be performed on days 21 and 41. Leucine turnover studies provide information&#xD;
      regarding rates of total body protein synthesis and total body protein degradation as well as&#xD;
      rates of leucine oxidation. The study will take 10 hours each - the initial 4 hours will be&#xD;
      after an overnight fast and the last six hours will be while being fed. The third outcome&#xD;
      measure will be the content of some proteins in a sample of muscle biopsy. Muscle biopsy will&#xD;
      be performed on days 21 and 41 after the completion of leucine turnover studies. Finally,&#xD;
      nutritional assessment will be performed at the time of patient admission, on day 21 and 41.&#xD;
      On days 21 and 41, the nutritional assessment will be performed prior to the start of the&#xD;
      leucine turnover studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be compensated for participation in this study -the amount of compensation&#xD;
      will be dependent upon the degree of participation of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk-benefit Assessment: The risks of the study include the risks of performing a muscle&#xD;
      biopsy, discomfort associated with the placement of the feeding tube, emotional problems&#xD;
      associated with prolonged hospitalization in the GCRC and risks associated with venipuncture.&#xD;
      There are no direct benefits to the subjects as a result of their participation in this&#xD;
      study. However, if we demonstrate that the higher arterial pH is better at preservation of&#xD;
      nutritional status, it may have the potential of decreasing the prevalence and/or severity of&#xD;
      protein-energy malnutrition in patients undergoing automated peritoneal dialysis.&#xD;
