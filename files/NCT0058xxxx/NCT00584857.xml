    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the optimal treatment for patients with advanced stage or&#xD;
      recurrent endometrial cancer. Traditionally, patients have been treated with either hormonal&#xD;
      therapies (megesterol) or chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin). This study investigates&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the combination of hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. This study also&#xD;
      will examine the side-effects associated with these drugs and the quality of life of patients&#xD;
      on combination therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy with 40,100 new cases diagnosed&#xD;
      and 6,800 deaths attributable to this malignancy in 2003. Most patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      endometrial cancer have early stage disease that is amenable to treatment with hysterectomy&#xD;
      and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with excellent clinical outcomes. Surgical staging has&#xD;
      improved accuracy over clinical staging for defining a low risk population of patients who&#xD;
      have favorable long-term outcomes with surgery alone. However, approximately 15% of patients&#xD;
      will have evidence of Stage III or IV disease at the time of initial diagnosis and 15% of&#xD;
      surgical Stage I/II patients will have recurrent disease. Radiation therapy will be effective&#xD;
      in patients with disease confined to the pelvis; however, patients with metastatic disease&#xD;
      will require more systemic therapy in order to control disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple chemotherapeutic agents including cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, paclitaxel,&#xD;
      carboplatin, and oral etoposide, alone and in combination, have been studied for persistent,&#xD;
      advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. A phase III study by the Gynecologic Oncology Group&#xD;
      (GOG) compared doxorubicin with and without cisplatin (GOG 107) for patients with advanced or&#xD;
      recurrent endometrial cancer. A higher response rate (45% vs. 27%) was noted for combination&#xD;
      therapy and has been considered by many to be the standard chemotherapy regimen for treatment&#xD;
      of patients with advanced endometrial cancer. However, clinical trials have continued to&#xD;
      define the optimal chemotherapy regimen for this disease. Recently, the use of whole&#xD;
      abdominal radiation therapy in the adjuvant setting for advanced endometrial cancer was&#xD;
      demonstrated to be inferior to the combination of cisplatin and doxorubicin. The predicted&#xD;
      2-year survival of 70% for patients receiving the chemotherapeutic regimen was superior to&#xD;
      patients that received radiation therapy (59%)(p&lt;0.01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormonal and cytotoxic chemotherapy agents are utilized in patients with metastatic or&#xD;
      recurrent disease not amenable to radiation therapy. Hormonal agents have been used in this&#xD;
      disease process since it has been demonstrated to be a hormonal responsive tumor. Notably, a&#xD;
      correlation between histologic grade and the presence or absence of hormonal receptors has&#xD;
      been noted, with well differentiated tumors more likely to express hormone receptors than&#xD;
      those with poor histology. Furthermore, the presence of estrogen receptors (ER) and&#xD;
      progesterone receptors (PR) varies with tumor histology. ER has been reported to be present&#xD;
      between 70% and 87% of endometrioid adenocarcinoma and 0 and 24% in UPSC; while, PR has&#xD;
      ranged from 67% to 91% in endometrioid tumors and 0 and 19% in UPSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various progestins have been investigated including Megace (megesterol acetate) and Provera&#xD;
      (medroxyprogesterone acetate) for the treatment of endometrial cancer. These agents are&#xD;
      generally well tolerated and have been reported to have response rates of 15-30% with&#xD;
      long-term complete responses not uncommonly experienced. Furthermore, median survival in&#xD;
      patients treated with progestins ranges from 9 to 20 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As paclitaxel has been noted to be active in ovarian cancer and other malignancies, it seems&#xD;
      reasonable to evaluate its utility for endometrial cancer. Accordingly, single agent&#xD;
      paclitaxel was administered to 30 chemotherapy na√Øve patients with advanced or recurrent&#xD;
      endometrial cancer. The overall response rate was 36% when patients received a 24-hour&#xD;
      infusion of paclitaxel. Furthermore, paclitaxel given as a 3-hour infusion demonstrated a&#xD;
      response between 27 to 37% in patients that had failed prior chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel has been combined with platinum compounds, primarily cisplatin in several studies.&#xD;
      A phase II study that combined paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 as a 3-hour infusion with cisplatin 75&#xD;
      mg/m2 reported a 67% response rate. There were seven complete responses and nine partial&#xD;
      responses with an 18 month median overall survival. An additional phase II study evaluated&#xD;
      the efficacy of combining paclitaxel and carboplatin in both primary advanced and recurrent&#xD;
      non-papillary and papillary tumors following radiation. The response rate was 78% in patients&#xD;
      with primary advanced non-papillary tumors with a median disease-free survival of 23 months,&#xD;
      with the median overall survival not being reached at the time of publication. Furthermore,&#xD;
      patients with recurrent endometrial cancer had a response rate of 56%, with a median overall&#xD;
      survival of 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase I study by the GOG combined paclitaxel, cisplatin, and doxorubicin with or without&#xD;
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. A 46% response rate with this regimen determined the&#xD;
      optimal dosing of the agents and led to a phase III GOG study (GOG 177). GOG 177 demonstrated&#xD;
      the combination of paclitaxel, doxorubicin and cisplatin to have higher response rates (57%&#xD;
      vs. 33%) over the combination of doxorubicin and cisplatin, but the three drug combination&#xD;
      was associated with more toxicity and 12-month overall survival (58% vs. 50%) was similar.&#xD;
      Furthermore, more Grade 3 and 4 toxicity was experienced by patients that received the three&#xD;
      drug combination, although this was not statistically significant. Accordingly, a phase III&#xD;
      trial comparing the paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and cisplatin regimen to a more tolerable&#xD;
      regimen of paclitaxel and carboplatin is planned by the GOG, based on equivalency studies in&#xD;
      ovarian cancer patients where carboplatin was substituted for cisplatin and demonstrated&#xD;
      easier administration with equal efficacy and less toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of hormonal agents with cytotoxic chemotherapy has also been investigated.&#xD;
      These studies utilized various combinations of non-taxane based cytotoxic chemotherapy in&#xD;
      addition to megesterol or medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients had response rates that&#xD;
      varied from 33% to 60%, with the combination cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, cisplatin and&#xD;
      megesterol producing the greatest response rate. Additionally, Pinelli et al. reported a 56%&#xD;
      complete or partial response rate in a group of patients treated with carboplatin and&#xD;
      sequential hormonal therapy with megesterol and tamoxifen. These studies suggest that&#xD;
      sequential administration of hormonal therapy with chemotherapy has no detrimental effects on&#xD;
      patients, and may be beneficial as hormonal therapy is generally less toxic than&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Based on known tolerability and efficacy, investigating the combination of&#xD;
      megesterol acetate with paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy appears to be a reasonable&#xD;
      option in the setting of advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, this phase II study will evaluate the combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin and&#xD;
      megesterol acetate for the treatment of advanced or recurrent adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
      endometrium.&#xD;
