  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitral regurgitation (MR) is common in the elderly and its prevalence is increasing with the&#xD;
      aging of the population. Organic MR, due to primary valvular lesions, initiates a cascade of&#xD;
      complications determined by its degree. MR of severe degree is associated with excess&#xD;
      mortality and high cardiac morbidity (heart failure, atrial fibrillation). It also causes&#xD;
      left ventricular remodeling which induces left ventricular dysfunction, which in turn leads&#xD;
      to poor clinical outcome. Surgery can eliminate MR, but carries immediate and long-term&#xD;
      risks, especially in the elderly. Therefore, chronically decreasing the degree of MR is a&#xD;
      major goal of medical therapy but such an effect is yet unproved because of conflicting&#xD;
      results of small and mostly non-randomized series. Our recent preliminary studies suggest&#xD;
      that a sustained decrease of degree of MR and improvement of left ventricular remodeling can&#xD;
      be achieved with powerful reduction of afterload, obtained in particular with angiotensin-II&#xD;
      receptor blockade. Therefore, the present proposal seeks to address gaps of knowledge&#xD;
      regarding vasoactive treatment of MR through the verification of the following hypothesis:&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Vasoactive therapy using angiotensin-II receptor blocker (Candesartan Cilexetil)&#xD;
      weighed against placebo produces a sustained reduction of the consequences of organic MR. The&#xD;
      specific aims are that the treatment a) decreases the degree of MR (decreases the regurgitant&#xD;
      volume, primary end-point) and b) improves left ventricular remodeling (decreases the&#xD;
      end-diastolic volume index, secondary end-point), as compared to placebo.&#xD;

      Patients with MR organic (intrinsic valve disease), isolated (no other valve disease),&#xD;
      moderate or more severe (regurgitant volume *30 mL/beat). A Clinical trial, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo controlled, double-blind, without cross-over, of 1 year oral treatment with potent&#xD;
      angiotensin-II receptor blockade using 32 mg Candesartan daily. The trial is preceded in all&#xD;
      patients by an acute open-label study to determine tolerance and immediate response. The&#xD;
      methods used to measure the end-points will be: a) Doppler-Echocardiography for quantitation&#xD;
      of the degree of MR (measurement of regurgitant volume) using a combination of three&#xD;
      simultaneous methods (quantitative Doppler, quantitative two-dimensional echocardiography,&#xD;
      proximal flow convergence) and b) of left ventricular remodeling (end-diastolic volume index&#xD;
      measured by echocardiography and by electron beam computed tomography). This single center&#xD;
      study seeks to enroll a total of 90 patients. The analysis will be based on intention to&#xD;
      treat and compare the regurgitant volume and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index&#xD;
      measured after one year of treatment with the active drug or placebo. The results of the&#xD;
      trial should provide strong evidence regarding medical treatment of patients with organic MR.&#xD;
