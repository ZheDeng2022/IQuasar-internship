  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with strong family histories of breast cancer are at increased risk to have breast&#xD;
      cancer. Women whose close relatives have had breast cancer often have more breast cancer&#xD;
      screening than other women their age. To increase the chance that any breast cancer will be&#xD;
      caught early, women at risk often take part in special screening programs. These programs&#xD;
      involve more frequent visits to the doctor for breast exams, yearly mammography, and new&#xD;
      types of exam like breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Studies are going on to find out&#xD;
      whether these programs are better than standard screening. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      find out how these programs impact women's quality of life. The study will also try to learn&#xD;
      what factors make it hard to take part in the programs. We hope to be able to design new&#xD;
      programs that are easier to follow.&#xD;

      Women at risk for hereditary breast cancer are recommended to undergo intensive surveillance&#xD;
      to maximize the likelihood of detecting the disease at an early, more curable, stage (Burke&#xD;
      et al. 1997, Eisenger et al. 1998, Moller et al. 1999). Although the particular&#xD;
      recommendations of different groups have varied, all suggest programs that incorporate&#xD;
      clinical and radiographic screening performed more frequently than in the general population,&#xD;
      beginning at a considerably younger age. Recent studies demonstrating the sensitivity of&#xD;
      breast MRI have led several groups to incorporate this technology as an incremental (not&#xD;
      replacement) modality, further increasing the intensity of the surveillance regimen. While&#xD;
      data are beginning to accumulate regarding the effectiveness of aggressive surveillance,&#xD;
      little is known about the ability and willingness of women to adhere to these rigorous&#xD;
      schedules, nor about the psychosocial and economic costs of the programs. Based upon the&#xD;
      Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (C-SHIP)model (Miller, Shoda, Hurley 1996), we&#xD;
      hypothesize that the ability to adhere to a proposed screening regimen will result from a&#xD;
      complex and dynamic interaction between the nature of that regimen, events that can be&#xD;
      expected to occur in the course of screening (such as abnormal results and practical&#xD;
      barriers) and key psychological factors such as the individual's attentional style, affective&#xD;
      state, perceived risk of cancer, cancer-specific worries, and beliefs regarding the&#xD;
      effectiveness of screening. To test the hypothesis, we propose to prospectively study women&#xD;
      with a hereditary risk for breast cancer participating in a structured surveillance program&#xD;
      of monthly breast self-examination, semi-annual clinical examination and annual mammography,&#xD;
      augmented by annual interval breast MRI.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 25 years or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Genetic predisposition as defined by one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (deleterious or uncertain significance) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Untested first-degree relative of an individual with a known deleterious BRCA&#xD;
                  mutation OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unaffected first-degree relative of an affected individual within a hereditary&#xD;
                  breast-ovarian kindred in which no testing has been performed or testing is&#xD;
                  negative, defined as: 3 or more women in 2 generations affected with breast or&#xD;
                  ovarian cancer. Women with bilateral breast cancer and woman with both breast and&#xD;
                  ovarian cancer count as single individual AND 1 woman must be first-degree&#xD;
                  relative of the other two, or related to the other two through a male AND At&#xD;
                  least 1 woman affected with breast cancer before age 50 or ovarian cancer at any&#xD;
                  age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to understand and complete English-language questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intend to receive clinical and radiographic follow-up at MSKCC&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women will not be excluded if they have previously received clinical and&#xD;
                  radiographic follow-up at either MSKCC or another institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of breast or ovarian cancer&#xD;
&#xD;

             implant, severe claustrophobia, weight over 300 pounds) or to paramagnetic contrast&#xD;
             (prior IgE-type allergic reaction, sickle cell anemia, renal failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or planning to begin attempts at conception within 1 year of enrollment. A&#xD;
             negative serum Î²-hCG will not be required for study entry, nor for radiographic&#xD;
             examination, as this test is not routinely performed before clinically indicated&#xD;
             radiographic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable for physical, psychological, or financial reasons to receive clinical and&#xD;
             radiographic follow-up at MSKCC&#xD;
