  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to test how safe and how well AST-120, an investigational&#xD;
      product, works in treating too much acid in the stomach. Patients will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of two groups, AST-120 or a placebo for the first four weeks of the study. The&#xD;
      patients will be switched to the other group (AST-120 or placebo)for the following four&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial where 20 patients&#xD;
      with confirmed persistent GERD symptoms (at least twice weekly) after a standard course of&#xD;
      PPI, with abnormal bile reflux levels but normal esophageal acid exposure are randomized to&#xD;
      initially receive either AST-120 or placebo for a period of 4 weeks after a two week&#xD;
      screening period. After a washout period of one week, patients will cross over to the&#xD;
      opposite blinded treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental drug AST-120 is composed of black, odorless spherical carbon particles in 2g&#xD;
      sachets (aluminum foil pouches). The placebo consists of microcrystalline cellulose spheres,&#xD;
      Celphere CP-305, stained to match the appearance of AST-120, in 2g sachets (aluminum foil&#xD;
      pouches). Both AST-120 and placebo are oral (taken by mouth) preparations. Both are&#xD;
      tasteless. Take the product, patients will tear open the sachet, drop the contents directly&#xD;
      on their tongue and wash it down with 8 ounces of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will continue to receive the previously prescribed PPI throughout the duration of&#xD;
      the trial. In addition, patients will be allowed up to 6 Gelusil tablets daily as a &quot;rescue&#xD;
      medication&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be expected to participate in approximately 5 in-clinic visits. During these&#xD;
      visits, patients will undergo a number of tests including: comprehensive physical, hematology&#xD;
      panel, a urine pregnancy test for pre-menopausal females, completion of the Gastroesophageal&#xD;
      Reflux Disease Symptom Assessment Scale (GSAS) and Short-Form-36 (SF-36)Quality of Life Form&#xD;
      and an upper endoscopy will be performed to determine the extent of esophageal inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be allowed to continue on their previously prescribed PPI with no changes and&#xD;
      may take up to 6 Gelusil tablets per day. The following therapies must be discontinued and&#xD;
      should not be taken during the trial: H2receptor antagonists, NSAIDs, Baclofen and Antacids&#xD;
      (OTC or prescription).&#xD;
