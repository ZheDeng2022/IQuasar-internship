  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intravesical treatment of bladder cancer with Abraxane is more desirable than other&#xD;
      taxanes due to its ability to be diluted in water and not lipid-based solutions allowing it&#xD;
      greater access to sites in the bladder. Thus, we are interested in investigating Abraxane's&#xD;
      safety, toxicity, and efficacy profile for the treatment of recurrent transitional cell&#xD;
      cancer of the urinary bladder in a combined phase I &amp; II trial. The phase I trial is designed&#xD;
      as a dose-escalation study with cohorts of threes that will enroll a maximum of 18 patients.&#xD;
      Dose increases will occur in groups of three patients, with each successive group receiving&#xD;
      an increased concentration of Abraxane intravesically. No dose increase will occur until each&#xD;
      member of the previous cohort has undergone the first instillation of the medication without&#xD;
      experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Any patient who experiences a DLT will be&#xD;
      removed from the trial and treated appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If one patient in the cohort experiences a DLT an additional three patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      and treated at that dose-level. If none of the additional three patients experience a DLT,&#xD;
      the next group of patients will be started on the next higher dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at any dose level, two or more patients experience a DLT the previous dose level will be&#xD;
      considered as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). An additional three patients (for a total of&#xD;
      six patients) will then be treated at the MTD. If less than two patients experience a DLT&#xD;
      this dose level will be established as the MTD. The phase II aspect is designed in a Simon II&#xD;
      stage format in which to satisfy our study powering, the first stage there will be 10&#xD;
      patients enrolled. If there are 2 or more successful treatments in that group (negative urine&#xD;
      cytology and bladder biopsy after 6 months), then the first stage will pass the rejection&#xD;
      rule, and up to another 19 patients will be enrolled. If at any point in the study, there&#xD;
      have been a total of 6 or more successes, then the phase II aspect will be considered a&#xD;
      successful trial and the study will be completed at that point.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary&#xD;
             bladder confirmed at the study institution. The patient must have demonstrated&#xD;
