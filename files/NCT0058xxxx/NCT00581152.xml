      Stem cells can develop into every cell, every tissue and every organ in the human body, e.g.,&#xD;
      they can make any kind of cells in the human body. Stem cells reproduce themselves many times&#xD;
      over and over. Their almost limitless potential has made stem cells a significant focus of&#xD;
      medical research. But before scientists can use stem cells for medical purposes, they must&#xD;
      first learn how to harness their power. They cannot treat disease until they learn how to&#xD;
      manipulate stem cells to get them to develop into specific tissues or organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We know that turning genes on and off is crucial to the process differentiation, so we can&#xD;
      add some factor into the culture dish and observe stem cells to differentiate into specific&#xD;
      types of cells. But some sort of signal is needed to actually trigger the stem cells to&#xD;
      differentiate. We are still searching for that signal. If we can ultimately learn how to&#xD;
      direct stem cells to differentiate into one type of tissue or another, then we can use them&#xD;
      to treat patients. In this proposal, we will first examine this step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a novel approach to understanding differentiation of human embryo stem (hES)&#xD;
      cells, by studying TBX3, a protein called a transcription factor that controls the expression&#xD;
      of other genes. In humans, the loss of function of TBX3 causes Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome, a&#xD;
      genetic disorder that can pass from one generation to the next. Furthermore, our preliminary&#xD;
      results show that TBX3 is downstream mediator of another protein, BMP4. BMP4 is a known key&#xD;
      regulator for hES cell differentiation. Thus, TBX3 is an attractive candidate as a downstream&#xD;
      mediator of BMP4 in hES cell differentiation. We will test TBX3 effects on hES cell&#xD;
      differentiation if down-regulate TBX3 in hES cells with a technology called siRNA knockdown.&#xD;
      We will identify the genes controlled by TBX3 with a recently invented powerful technology&#xD;
      called CHIP-GLAS. This technique allows us to examine thousands of genes on a small chip in a&#xD;
      single experiment. We expect that the innovative experiments proposed here will open a new&#xD;
      avenue to understanding the signal of hES cell differentiation.&#xD;

      PURPOSE OF STUDY The purpose of this study is to understand what triggers stem cells to&#xD;
      differentiate into one type of tissue or another. The study of TBX3, a protein called a&#xD;
      transcription factor that controls the expression of other genes, shows that it is a&#xD;
      downstream mediator of the protein BMP4, a known key regulator for hES cell differentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand the role of TBX3 in hES cell differentiation, we hypothesize that TBX3 is a&#xD;
      downstream mediator of BMP4 and play an important role in hES cell differentiation. We&#xD;
      propose the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine TBX3 function in hES cell differentiation. NIH approved hES cells will be&#xD;
           cultured in a conditioned medium with BMP4 to induce differentiation and TBX3&#xD;
           expression. TBX3 will be knocked down with siRNA technology. The cell morphology and&#xD;
           biochemical changes will be examined for the effects of TBX3 knockdown on hES cell&#xD;
           differentiation, including testing human ÃŸ-CG estradiol and progesterone. The gene&#xD;
           expression profile will also be examined with Affymetrix gene expression chip and&#xD;
           verified with real-time RT-PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify the genome-wide downstream targets directly bound by TBX3 in hESC with&#xD;
           Chromatin immunoprecipitation-guided ligation and selection (CHIP-GLAS). To identify the&#xD;
           targets of TBX3 in BMP4-induced hES cells, we will perform ChIP-GLAS analysis. CHIP-GLAS&#xD;
           is a novel high-throughput technique with combination of chromatin precipitation and&#xD;
           oligonucleotide-based microarray. This technology will allow us to identify the&#xD;
           genome-wide downstream target genes directly bound by TBX3 in hES cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that the proposed experiments will identify a key regulator for hES cell&#xD;
      differentiation and open a new avenue to understanding the function of TBX3 in hES cells. The&#xD;
      CHIP-GLAS promoter array provides us a cutting edge tool and allows us to examine the broad&#xD;
      function of TBX3. We anticipate that the study will significantly enhance our understanding&#xD;
      of TBX3 function in hES cell differentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN NIH-approved cell lines will be available at the Sue and Bill Gross Stem Cell&#xD;
      Research Core Facility at the University of California, Irvine. Non-NIH-approved cell lines&#xD;
      will be obtained from Sue &amp; Bill Gross Stem Cell Core at UC Irvine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environment: Huang Lab is currently supported by the Helen and Larry Hoag Foundation and the&#xD;
      Susan Komen Foundation. There are no active grants from the federal government. Previously,&#xD;
      Dr. Huang was supported by K23 and R03 grants. They were completed in 2004 and 2006,&#xD;
      respectively. No equipment was purchased with the funds from the federal grants. As all&#xD;
      equipment currently in Huang lab was purchased with the UCI startup fund or with private&#xD;
      funds, there is no conflict with government regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At University California, Irvine, Sue and Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center will be a key&#xD;
      component of the Stem Cell Core Facility. This facility provides stem cell technology and&#xD;
      resources to the UCI faculty (Please see attached letter). By merging technical and&#xD;
      scientific expertise in a number of essential disciplines, the Core harbors a diverse tool&#xD;
      kit for the exploration of multiple aspects of stem cell biology. The Core also provides a&#xD;
      knowledge base for differentiating, genetically modifying and assaying human embryonic stem&#xD;
      cells (hESCs) in support of multiple stem cell projects on campus and in the surrounding&#xD;
      area. All services and procedures are performed in accordance with good quality assurance and&#xD;
      record keeping practices pursuant to standard operating procedures and good laboratory&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sue and Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center The human embryonic stem (hES) cell core&#xD;
      facility of the Sue and Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center opened in April 2006. It&#xD;
      occupies approximately 10,000 square feet of space in the research park immediately adjacent&#xD;
      to the University of California, Irvine campus. Approximately $1.7 million were committed by&#xD;
      the UCI to fully equip the facility for all aspects on hES cell research. Further gifts&#xD;
      totaling $236,687 from the Fuji Foundation and the Nichols Foundation provided additional&#xD;
      major equipment and supplies that are available for all investigators. The facility was set&#xD;
      up as a Federal-free zone in which investigators can to carry out all aspects of hES cell&#xD;
      research. Individual rooms are equipped with tissue culture biosafety cabinets, CO2&#xD;
      incubators, an inverted microscope, a dissecting microscope, digital imaging equipment, a&#xD;
      centrifuge, a water bath and a dedicated refrigerator and freezer. Ten such tissue culture&#xD;
      set-ups as well as standard lab bench space are available to UCI investigators and visitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The facility also has major pieces of equipment needed for hES cell analysis such as a Zeiss&#xD;
      510 Meta Two-Photon Confocal Microscope. The facility will shortly have a BD LSR II Flow&#xD;
      cytometer and a BD FacsAria cell sorter. Pretested reagents will be available to&#xD;
      investigators through the core facility. These will include medium components, growth&#xD;
      factors, feeder cells, gelatin, Matrigel, antibodies and primers to assay stem cell marker&#xD;
      expression. In addition, the core facility will assist in karyotype analysis and tumor&#xD;
      formation tests of hES cells.&#xD;
