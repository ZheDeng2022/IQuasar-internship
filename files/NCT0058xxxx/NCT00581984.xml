      This study will collect 5 year data about any possible health problems associated with breast&#xD;
      implants. This data will be used to help see if the implants are both safe and effective. If&#xD;
      they are proven safe and effective, they will continue to be available. If they are not&#xD;
      proven safe and effective to the satisfaction of the FDA, they may not be available in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;

      This prospective clinical study is being undertaken to document the safety of McGhan Medical&#xD;
      Silicone-Filled Breast Implants. Patients will be evaluated pre-operatively,&#xD;
      intraoperatively, and at one, three and five years following implant surgery. Safety of&#xD;
      McGhan Medical Silicone-Filled Breast Implants will be assessed based on the incidence of&#xD;
      medical complications, implant failure and serious adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective clinical study of McGhan Medical Silicone-Filled Breast Implants is part of&#xD;
      an ongoing research effort to document the safety and effectiveness of silicone-filled breast&#xD;
      implants.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of any age for which breast reconstruction is considered appropriate.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have any of the following conditions or situations present:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Post mastectomy surgical removal of the breast for cancer or other diseases;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Post trauma or post surgery where there was total or partial removal of the&#xD;
                  breast resulting in significant deformity.(for any reason);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Severe ptosis requiring reconstruction (i.e. mastopexy);.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any congenital or acquired discrepancy in breast size such as to represent a&#xD;
                  significant physical deformity. This does not include normal variants of&#xD;
                  asymmetry. Examples include, but are not limited to:Pectus excavatum, Pectus&#xD;
                  carinatum; Thoracic hypoplasia (Poland's syndrome, Scoliosis; Isolated rib&#xD;
                  deformities; Tuberous breasts; Congenital absence&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Revision of implant procedure due to any of the following circumstances;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous augmentation or reconstruction with silicone- or saline-filled implants where&#xD;
             problems exist, such as implant. rapture or significant capsular contracture (Baker&#xD;
             Grade III or IV) requiring revision;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Contralateral mammaplasty in unaffected breast as a result of the affected breast&#xD;
                  requiring surgery (for one of the aforementioned circumstances), when medically&#xD;
                  indicated to provide symmetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate tissue available to cover implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Saline-filled implants are not an appropriate choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to follow all study requirements, such as agreeing to all required&#xD;
             follow-up visits, and acceptance of the risks involved as indicated by signing of the&#xD;
             Patient Informed Consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Advanced fibrocystic disease considered to be premalignant-without accompanying&#xD;
             subcutaneous mastectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Existing carcinoma of the breast, without mastectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abscess or infection in the body at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing.&#xD;

             wound healing ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Show tissue characteristics which are clinically incompatible with mammaplasty, such&#xD;
             as tissue damage resulting from radiation, inadequate tissue, compromised vascularity&#xD;
             or ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have, or under treatment for, any condition which, in the opinion of the surgeon, may&#xD;
             constitute an unwarranted surgical risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Show psychological characteristics which, in the opinion of the surgeon, may be&#xD;
             incompatible with the surgical procedure and the prosthesis, such as inappropriate&#xD;
             attitude or motivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Wish to have augmentation mammaplasty, but do not have at least one of the diagnoses&#xD;
