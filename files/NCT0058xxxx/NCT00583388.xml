      Acute cardiac and vascular events, like heart attack and sudden cardiac death manifest a&#xD;
      clear surge in the early morning hours around the time of waking, so that their peak onset is&#xD;
      between 6AM and 11AM. The mechanisms are not fully understood, but we had shown that healthy&#xD;
      subjects have impaired vascular reactivity in the early morning (endothelial dysfunction).&#xD;
      This is associated with a decrease in nitric oxide levels (a substance that promotes&#xD;
      vasodilatation). We also have described that vessel reactivity and the levels of this&#xD;
      substance can recover by noon only when people breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-arginine is a semi-essential amino acid found in large quantities in chicken, in fish, and&#xD;
      beans and is the substrate for the production of nitric oxide Therefore we want to test if&#xD;
      there is a beneficial effect of administration of L-arginine on the circadian pattern of&#xD;
      vessel reactivity. Our goal is to understand why cardiovascular events are more likely to&#xD;
      happen in the early morning and how to prevent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will help us to understand the efficacy, acute effects and tolerability of high&#xD;
      doses of L-arginine. This can lead to future research to assess long term effects of&#xD;
      L-arginine supplements to prevent cardiovascular events in the early morning hours.&#xD;

      Acute cardiac and vascular events, including sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and&#xD;
      stroke manifest a clear surge in the early morning hours around the time of waking, so that&#xD;
      their peak onset is between 6 AM and 11AM. The mechanisms for this morning increase in acute&#xD;
      cardiovascular events are not fully understood. Factors such as arousal from sleep, increased&#xD;
      sympathetic drive, increased vasoconstrictor sensitivity and impaired endothelial function&#xD;
      have been implicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently described the occurrence of early morning endothelial dysfunction, with blunted&#xD;
      flow-mediated arterial dilatation in the early hours after waking. Our preliminary data&#xD;
      suggest that this early morning endothelial dysfunction is likely due to an increased plasma&#xD;
      levels of L-arginine endogenous inhibitor, ADMA and reducted plasma L-arginine levels, with&#xD;
      consequent reduced availability of NO in the morning. The early morning fall in NOx levels&#xD;
      can be potentiated by fasting and attenuated by a low-nitrate, protein rich breakfast.&#xD;
      Because the production of NO depends in part on the availability of L-arginine, methods to&#xD;
      maintain an adequate level of plasma L-arginine in the early morning are needed. We propose&#xD;
      to assess the efficacy of high doses of L-arginine in preventing early morning endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to examine the effects of high doses of L-arginine on morning changes in&#xD;
      nitric oxide and endothelial function. Our hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. That L-arginine administered orally prior to sleep will prevent the early morning decline&#xD;
      in plasma levels of L-arginine and nitric oxide; 2. That L-arginine administered prior to&#xD;
      sleep will attenuate or prevent the early morning decline in endothelial function; and 3.&#xD;
      That the effects of L-arginine, taken prior to sleep, on plasma levels of L-arginine and&#xD;
      nitric oxide and on endothelial function will be more marked with 15 grams of L-arginine&#xD;
      versus 5 grams of L-arginine or placebo, indicative of a dose response effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary aim is to identify the short-term tolerability and safety of two different&#xD;
      doses of L-arginine. Our hypothesis is that subjects taking high doses of L-arginine (15&#xD;
      grams) will not have significant symptoms or adverse changes in vital signs.&#xD;

    <description>Each subject will be exposed to three treatments, a) 5 g of L-arginine, b) 15 g of L-arginine, and c) placebo, the sequences will be randomly assigned to the 42 volunteers. The washout period between interventions will be from one to two days.L-arginine will be mixed in 60 cc of dextrose-based syrup to blind the taste and color of the L-arginine powder.</description>

    <description>Ultrasound from the brachial artery will be done on 3 occasions: at 9 pm after 4hs of fasting, at 6 am and at 11 am. The brachial artery images will be acquired above the antecubital fossa in the longitudinal plane of the artery with an ultrasound machine using a 6-MHz linear transducer. Flow-mediated vasodilatation will be assessed by the reactive hyperemia method (inflation of a blood pressure cuff around the forearm to 200 mmHg for 5 minutes and then released). The diameter of the brachial artery will be assessed 60 to 90 s after deflation of the cuff. After a 10min period a second baseline image of the brachial artery will be obtained. Non-low-mediated vasodilatation will be measured by an administration of a sublingual dose of nitroglycerin (0.4 mg).</description>
