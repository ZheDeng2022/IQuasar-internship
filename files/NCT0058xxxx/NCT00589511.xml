  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this multisite study is to evaluate the performance of the Nucleus Freedom&#xD;
      cochlear implant system in a large population of sequentially implanted pediatric subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will include 50 pediatric subjects ages 1 year to 17 years, 11 months of&#xD;
      age, implanted at up to 5 sites in the United States and Canada. The estimated duration of&#xD;
      this multisite study is 18 to 24 months. The duration of individual subject participation is&#xD;
      not to exceed 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a within-subject repeated measures experiment (in which each&#xD;
      subject serves as his or her own control) in order to accommodate the heterogeneity that is&#xD;
      well known to characterize hearing-impaired populations&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1 year to 17 years, 11 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilateral severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss for those 1 to 2 years of age.&#xD;
             Severe hearing loss for those 2 years of age and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Limited benefit from bilateral hearing aids. Limited benefit is defined as a lack of&#xD;
             progress in the development of simple auditory skills in conjunction with appropriate&#xD;
             amplification and intensive aural rehabilitation over a 3 to 6 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For younger children, unable to take speech perception tests due to age-related&#xD;
                  cognitive and linguistic limitations, limited benefit will be quantified using&#xD;
                  the Infant Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (IT-MAIS)1 or Meaningful&#xD;
                  Auditory Integration Scale (MAIS)1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For older children, capable of speech perception tasks, limited benefit is&#xD;
                  defined as Â£ 30% on the recorded open-set Multisyllabic Lexical Neighborhood Test&#xD;
                  (MLNT)2 or Lexical Neighborhood Test (LNT) 2, depending on the child's cognitive&#xD;
                  and linguistic skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English spoken as a primary language.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to participate in and to comply with all requirements of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ossification or any other cochlear anomaly that might prevent complete insertion of&#xD;
             the electrode array, as confirmed by medical examination and tests including MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signs of retrocochlear or central origin to hearing impairment as confirmed by medical&#xD;
             examination and tests including MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical or psychological conditions that would contraindicate undergoing surgery&#xD;
             (e.g., active middle ear infections, tympanic membrane perforation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additional handicaps that would prevent or restrict participation in the evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unrealistic expectations on the part of the subject or subject's parents/guardians,&#xD;
             regarding the possible benefits, risks and limitations that are inherent to the&#xD;
             surgical procedure and prosthetic device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness or inability of the candidate or candidate's parents/guardians to comply&#xD;
             with all study requirements.&#xD;
