  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is a common digestive disorder. After excluding dietary factors, drugs and other&#xD;
      secondary causes, at least three broad pathophysiologic subtypes are recognized- dyssynergic&#xD;
      defecation, constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) and slow transit&#xD;
      constipation (STC), all predominantly affect women and elderly. Many patients also&#xD;
      demonstrate abnormal rectal perception with both rectal hyposensitivity and hypersensitivity&#xD;
      being common. Recent surveys show that most constipated patients are dissatisfied with&#xD;
      current therapy. Also, constipated patients showed significant psychological dysfunction and&#xD;
      impaired quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To investigate a novel biofeedback technique of&#xD;
      improving rectal hypersensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: A large compliant balloon attached to a barostat was placed in the rectum in 8&#xD;
      patients with rectal hypersensitivity (urgency/pain threshold &lt;30 mm Hg). Sensory&#xD;
      deconditioning was performed by incremental balloon distensions (1-2 mmHg) until normal&#xD;
      thresholds were reached.&#xD;

      To investigate a novel biofeedback technique of improving rectal hypersensitivity using&#xD;
      rectal barostat and to compare this with clinical standard of care comprising of low dose&#xD;
      antidepressant therapy with escitalopram. Patients will be randomized to sensory adaptation&#xD;
      training or escitalopram in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;

    <time_frame>Trial entry and at the end of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary physiologic outcome measure is increase in rectal sensory thresholds after treatment. A rectal hypersensitivity responder is defined as an individual who show at least 20% increase in two or more sensory thresholds (first, desire and urge defecate/pain) after treatment when compared to baseline, and will be compared between the SAT and escitalopram groups. An overall responder is defined as both a hypersensitivity responder and abdominal pain responder.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Abdominal Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Trial entry and at the end of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The symptomatic outcome measure is decrease in pain score as assessed by daily pain logs where pain is scored on a scale of 0 to 4, after treatment when compared to the baseline period. A pain responder is defined as a subject with 30% decrease in pain compared to baseline.</description>

    <description>a large compliant balloon is placed in the rectum attached to a barostat. The balloon is distended in 1 mm increments until patient reports moderate discomfort and then increased in 1 mm increments until maximum tolerable pressure. Gradually over 6 training sessions, administered biweekly, the maximum tolerable pressure is increased over 3 months, if treatment is successful.</description>

    <description>This study will last for approximately 3 months and will include 4-6 clinic visits with each visit lasting 2 hours every week or every 2 weeks. At the beginning of each visit we will ask you about your health status and level of satisfaction of your bowel habits. We will then place the pencil-thick probe and balloon inside your rectum and attach it to the barostat device and a computer. We will increase and decrease the volumes of the balloon until the most pressure you can tolerate or a certain level of pressure as measured by the machine is reached, whichever occurs first. You will continue to keep stool diaries and pain diaries for 7 days before and after each visit.</description>
