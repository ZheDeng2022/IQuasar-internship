  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if a standard tool used to check anxiety in white men works&#xD;
      well for Black men. The tool is used only for men who have prostate cancer. It is meant to&#xD;
      see how the cancer affects men. If the investigators have a good tool, it is more likely that&#xD;
      the investigators can help those who have high levels of anxiety. This test is known as the&#xD;
      Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (also called the MAX-PC).&#xD;
