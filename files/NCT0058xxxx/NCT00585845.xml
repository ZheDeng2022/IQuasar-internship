  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will evaluate the safety and tolerability of CRS 207 an investigational&#xD;
      product that is a weakened form (attenuated) of Listeria monocytogenes, a type of bacteria&#xD;
      that is commonly found in the environment. CRS-207 has been altered in the lab to reduce its&#xD;
      ability to cause disease, while maintaining stimulation of the immune system. CRS 207 has&#xD;
      also been genetically modified with recombinant DNA to release an antigen called Mesothelin.&#xD;
      Because CRS 207 stimulates an immune response to Mesothelin and Mesothelin may be present at&#xD;
      higher levels on tumor cells than on normal cells, this clinical trial will also examine if&#xD;
      CRS 207 boosts the immune system in a way that targets certain types of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this first clinical trial with CRS-207 is to identify an appropriate dose of&#xD;
      the investigation agent for later clinical studies and to explore safety when given to&#xD;
      consenting adults with advanced cancer of the ovary or pancreas, non-small cell lung cancer,&#xD;
      or advanced malignant epithelial mesothelioma. Immunological response to CRS-207 and tumor&#xD;
      status of study participants will also be measured. Patients who choose to enter the study&#xD;
      must meet all study entry criteria and must have previously failed standard treatment for&#xD;
      their cancer. Qualifying study patients will be assigned to receive one of several dose&#xD;
      levels of CRS-207. Each patient may receive up to 4 intravenous administrations (21 days&#xD;
      apart) of CRS-207 at their assigned dose level.&#xD;

      Patients who consent to participate in the study will be evaluated for eligibility according&#xD;
      to their medical history, physical examination, blood testing, and computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      scan of thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Those patients who qualify for the study will receive up&#xD;
      to 4 intravenous doses of CRS-207, 21 days apart. After each infusion, they will be monitored&#xD;
      overnight in an in-patient facility, including collection of blood specimens. Study&#xD;
      participants will return after each infusion for outpatient follow-up visits for further&#xD;
      blood tests and additional monitoring of safety and immune response to CRS-207. Participants&#xD;
      will have repeat CT scans to measure tumor size after the 2nd dose and again after the 4th&#xD;
      dose. On Day 91 participants will be discharged from the study. All study participants will&#xD;
      be eligible to participate in a long-term follow-up study with a visit 6 months after the&#xD;
      final dose of CRS-207 and annually thereafter for evaluation of disease progression,&#xD;
      survival, and potential long-term toxicity of CRS 207.&#xD;
