      The proposed project will develop and test an HIV prevention intervention for Latino&#xD;
      families. This study will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conduct a pilot &quot;run-through&quot; of an adapted family-based intervention with three cohorts&#xD;
           (about 24 families) to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness for&#xD;
           the target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Revise the family-based HIV prevention intervention based on the results of the pilot&#xD;
           &quot;run-through&quot; and structured exit interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recruit and randomize 100 families into the Latino family-based HIV prevention&#xD;
           intervention or a general health promotion condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Estimate the effect size of the Latino family-based HIV prevention intervention from&#xD;
           assessment of changes in HIV-related sexual behavior and attitudes and parental&#xD;
           monitoring/supervision over 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a thorough review of the literature, the following is anticipated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The revised intervention will be feasible, acceptable, and appropriate for Latino&#xD;
           families and will be enthusiastically received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The family-based HIV prevention intervention will result in safer adolescent sexual&#xD;
           behavior, greater change with regard to primary outcome measures of behavior (recent&#xD;
           sexual activity, the number of unprotected sex acts, proportion of condom use, and&#xD;
           intentions to use condoms), safer HIV-related attitudes, improved parent-child&#xD;
           communication skills, and greater parental monitoring than the Latino families in the&#xD;
           general health promotion condition.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Latinos are disproportionately represented among those diagnosed with HIV and Latino&#xD;
      adolescents are at risk for engaging in sexual behaviors that can lead to HIV. However, data&#xD;
      regarding HIV prevention interventions for Latino adolescents, as distinct from other ethnic&#xD;
      groups, have not been published to date. This K Award will conduct an initial study of a&#xD;
      family-based intervention specifically for Latino families. With the support of a NIMH&#xD;
      Minority Supplement Award, Dr. Lescano has adapted a family-based intervention from a&#xD;
      multi-site trial for non-minority youth. Using a qualitative approach, Dr. Lescano has added&#xD;
      to the intervention family context issues relevant to Latinos such as acculturation,&#xD;
      religiosity, gender role and sexual socialization, parent-child communication, and monitoring&#xD;
      practices. The initial phase of the K Award will be a run-through of the adapted family-based&#xD;
      intervention with three cohorts (8 families per group) to further assess participant reaction&#xD;
      and appropriateness. The intervention will then be revised based on feedback using structured&#xD;
      exit interviews. Next, 100 Latino families with an adolescent between the ages of 13 and 18&#xD;
      will be randomized into either the family based HIV prevention intervention or a general&#xD;
      health promotion (GHP) condition that focuses on healthy behaviors such as diet and exercise.&#xD;
      Groups consist of 6 to 8 parent and youth dyads in a one-day, 7-hour workshop. Both&#xD;
      interventions employ activities for youth and parents separately (e.g., focus on adolescent&#xD;
      vulnerability) and parents and adolescents together. The project will estimate the effect&#xD;
      size of the Latino Family-based HIV prevention intervention from assessment of changes in the&#xD;
      adolescents' HIV-related sexual behavior and attitudes, gender and sexual socialization,&#xD;
      parent-child communication, and parental monitoring. Measures will be completed at baseline&#xD;
      and at 3 and 6 months post-intervention. The work done in this K Award will provide pilot&#xD;
      data that will lead to submission of an R01 to determine the efficacy of the intervention,&#xD;
      compared to a adolescent-only, skills-based HIV prevention group and a general health&#xD;
      promotion group, in a larger sample of Latinos. An efficacious intervention is urgently&#xD;
      needed for Latino communities.&#xD;
