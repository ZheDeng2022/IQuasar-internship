      The primary purpose of this study is to learn if taking pictures of your heart using two&#xD;
      dimensional and three dimensional echocardiography in the heart failure intensive care unit&#xD;
      can be helpful to understanding how the heart is working.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All research subjects will be adults admitted to the heart failure ICU with acute&#xD;
      decompensated heart failure and requiring monitoring of their heart function using a catheter&#xD;
      that is placed in the pulmonary artery which is a blood vessel. In this situation, use of the&#xD;
      pulmonary artery catheter,or PAC, is considered standard clinical care. It is not a research&#xD;
      procedure. The PAC would be used even if you were not participating in this research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All research subjects will be evaluated at the time they are admitted to the ICU, 24 to 48&#xD;
      hours after admission to the ICU, and 7 days after leaving the ICU. At all three time points,&#xD;
      we will be taking pictures of the heart using the two dimensional and three dimensional&#xD;
      echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, at each time-point, we will collect a blood sample of approximately two and a&#xD;
      half tablespoons each time, and a urine sample. We will be testing the sample for biomarkers&#xD;
      of heart failure which are proteins and enzymes specifically related to heart function. We&#xD;
      will not be conducting any genetic research on the sample. Any extra blood from these&#xD;
      research tests will not be saved for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also be looking at the data that is collected by the pulmonary artery catheter. The&#xD;
      catheter has a sensor on it that measures things like blood flow and pressure in the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Day 7 post discharge visit there will be a six minute hall walk so that we can access&#xD;
      the distance that you can walk. We will access any symptoms that you may experience. A nurse&#xD;
      or physician will monitor the six minute hall walk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research information that we collect on you will not be placed in your medical record.&#xD;
      The data is for research purposes only.&#xD;

      Study Design This is a single-center, prospective cohort study. The project will be carried&#xD;
      out at the Main Campus of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Comprehensive transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography will be performed in the Heart Failure Intensive Care Unit at the Cleveland&#xD;
      Clinic Foundation. This is an eight bed intensive care unit dedicated to treating patients&#xD;
      with acute clinical issues related to heart failure and is staffed by heart failure&#xD;
      specialists, medical officers and nurses specializing in heart failure management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy will be individualized per patient and will be entirely at the discretion of the&#xD;
      patients' cardiologist under the standard of care. Nevertheless, the Heart Failure Intensive&#xD;
      Care Unit has standard drug protocols for intravenous vasodilators such as nitroglycerin and&#xD;
      sodium nitroprusside, as well as inotropic therapy such as dobutamine and or milrinone, and&#xD;
      pressors such as norepinephrine and or vasopressin. Based on the hemodynamic assessment using&#xD;
      PAC, diuretics and vasodilators will be the first-line agents, followed by inotropic agents.&#xD;
      Oral vasodilators will be instituted following a standard protocol. All medications and their&#xD;
      doses will be noted at the time of each echocardiographic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The schedule will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first echo will be performed within 24 hours of PAC insertion. Preferably at the&#xD;
           time of or prior to commencing treatment in the Heart Failure Intensive Care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second echo will be performed 24-72 hours after baseline echo in the Heart Failure&#xD;
           Intensive Care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The third echo will be performed at the time of the scheduled outpatient visit after&#xD;
           hospital discharge. The tests will be performed in the General Clinical Research Center&#xD;
           which is an outpatient visit located on the fifth floor of the M building or at&#xD;
           Cardiology Desk F-17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline for individual patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Extraction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive Hemodynamics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a PAC inserted, usually via right jugular venous approach, for a&#xD;
      clinical indication prior to recruitment This is required for inclusion into the study. Data&#xD;
      collected at baseline and at the time of second echo will include systolic and diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressures, heart rate and rhythm, central venous pressure, systolic and mean pulmonary&#xD;
      artery pressures, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac output and index by Fick&#xD;
      equation, calculated cardiac power, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, and&#xD;
      transpulmonary gradient. Thermodilution derived RV ejection fraction can also be performed. A&#xD;
      dedicated hemodynamic database capturing all the above mentioned variables has already been&#xD;
      designed and implemented for routine clinical use in the Heart Failure Intensive Care Unit.&#xD;
      Since this is an observational study, it can be performed in concurrent with other clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiographic studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All echocardiograms will be performed on an ultrasound machine capable of two dimensional&#xD;
      echocardiograms with strain imaging using the GE Vivid 7 machine and three dimensional&#xD;
      echocardiograms using the GE Vivid 7 machine or Phillips ultrasound machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will undergo echocardiographic assessment with a standard ultrasound machine&#xD;
      equipped with a 3.5 MHz transducer and capable of digital image storage. All echocardiograms&#xD;
      will be performed on an ultrasound machine at the bedside, capable of two dimensional&#xD;
      echocardiography with strain imaging using GE Vivid 7machine, and three dimensional&#xD;
      echocardiography using the GE Vivid 7 machine or Phillips ultrasound machine. The reason for&#xD;
      the broad range of study periods is to allow flexibility of performing echocardiography to&#xD;
      fit into the patients' treatment plan in the Heart Failure Intensive Care Unit. Our&#xD;
      experience in conducting this kind of study in the Heart Failure Intensive Care Unit has led&#xD;
      us to believe that having a range of times is often helpful. Patients admitted overnight or&#xD;
      in the weekends, without compromising the objectives of the study. Since the objective of the&#xD;
      study is to determine the role of serial echocardiographic parameters with or without&#xD;
      hemodynamic data in predicting the need for more invasive interventions or correlating with&#xD;
      treatment responses to infusions, this design is close to &quot;real-world&quot; logistics and will&#xD;
      unlikely affect study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be placed in the left lateral decubitus position. When this is not possible&#xD;
      such as when a patient is on a ventilator, modified views will be obtained. Standard&#xD;
      parasternal long and short axis as well as standard apical four, three and two chamber views&#xD;
      will be obtained. Subcostal images will be acquired when possible. The echocardiogram will&#xD;
      include assessment of left and right ventricular systolic and diastolic function and valvular&#xD;
      function. Assessment of systolic function will include: left ventricular end-systolic and&#xD;
      end-diastolic diameters, left ventricular outflow tract diameter, left ventricular volumes,&#xD;
      pulsed Doppler of Left ventricular outflow tract. Biplane left ventricular ejection fraction,&#xD;
      stroke volume, cardiac output and index will then be calculated. Right-sided measurements&#xD;
      will include, right ventricular end diastolic and systolic areas, pulse wave Doppler of the&#xD;
      tricuspid valve. Strain will be acquired in all views along with pulse wave tissue Doppler of&#xD;
      left and right ventricular annuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac Biomarkers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 40cc blood sample collection in plasma (20cc) and serum (20cc) will be collected&#xD;
      at each echo study, and will be processed and aliquotted within 2 hours at the GCRC core lab.&#xD;
      Biomarkers of interest include: (1) plasma B-type natriuretic peptide at every visit, (2)&#xD;
      cardiac troponin T at baseline, (3) high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) at baseline,&#xD;
      will be sent to the clinical laboratory for analysis. Extra blood will be collected at every&#xD;
      visit and stored in -80F freezer for other research-based novel biomarkers, all subject to&#xD;
      availability of supplementary external research funding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six minute hall walk Standard Six minute hall walk will be performed to assess functional&#xD;
      capacity only at the GCRC follow-up visit.&#xD;
