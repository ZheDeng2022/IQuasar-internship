      The purpose of this study is to assess the role endovascular therapy to treat aortic disease&#xD;
      involving the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the visceral segment of the aorta (or&#xD;
      thoracoabdominal aorta)&#xD;
    </textblock>

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, non-randomized, single-site evaluation of the use of novel&#xD;
      endovascular technology to treat complex aortic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to allow for the evaluation of patients with both complex anatomic condition and&#xD;
      challenging physiologic situations there are three study subsections as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ascending Arm Protocol: The intended use of the study is to provide endovascular therapy&#xD;
           to patients with ascending aortic pathology including aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, and/or&#xD;
           aortic dissection who are considered high risk for conventional surgery. This will&#xD;
           involve disease in the aorta from the sinotubular junction to the innominate artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aortic Arch Arm Protocol: The intended use of the study is to provide endovascular&#xD;
           therapy to patients with aortic arch pathology including aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm and/or&#xD;
           aortic dissection who are considered high risk for conventional surgery. This will&#xD;
           involve disease in aorta from the sinotubular junction to descending thoracic aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Thoracobabdominal Aortic Arm Protocol: The intended use of the study is to provide&#xD;
           endovascular therapy to patients with thoracoabdominal aortic pathology including aortic&#xD;
           aneurysms, renal aneurysms, and superior mesenteric artery aneurysms. This will involve&#xD;
           the aorta from the left carotid artery origin through the iliac artery bifurcation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the purpose of the study is also characterized based on the protocol arm that&#xD;
      patients are enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ascending Arm Protocol: The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, and&#xD;
           intermediate (or long-term) rupture free survival rate of high risk surgical patients&#xD;
           undergoing endovascular repair of ASCENDING AORTIC pathology including aortic&#xD;
           dissection, aortic aneurysm, and/or aortic pseudoaneurysm. The objectives of this arm&#xD;
           are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the safety, efficacy and intermediate (or long-term) durability of an&#xD;
                endovascular prosthesis as a means of preventing ascending aortic growth and&#xD;
                rupture in high risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To measure the physiologic effects and outcomes of endovascular aneurysm repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Establish selection criteria, improve device design, operative technique and&#xD;
                follow-up procedures for patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Arch Arm Protocol: The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, and&#xD;
           intermediate (or long-term) rupture free survival rate of high risk surgical patients&#xD;
           undergoing endovascular repair of AORTIC ARCH pathology including aortic aneurysm,&#xD;
           pseudoaneurysm and/or dissection. The objectives of this arm are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the safety, efficacy and intermediate (or long-term) durability of an&#xD;
                endovascular prosthesis as a means of preventing aortic arch growth and rupture in&#xD;
                high risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To measure the physiologic effects and outcomes of endovascular aneurysm repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Establish selection criteria, improve device design, operative technique and&#xD;
                follow-up procedures for patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Thoracoabdominal Arm Protocol: The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term&#xD;
           safety, durability and rupture free survival of surgical patients undergoing&#xD;
           endovascular repair of the THORACOABDOMINAL AORTA involving pathologies that include&#xD;
           thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, renal artery aneurysms and superior mesenteric artery&#xD;
           aneurysms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the long-term safety and durability of an endovascular prosthesis as a&#xD;
                means of preventing aneurysm growth and rupture in patients having aneurysms&#xD;
                involving the THORACOABDOMINAL AORTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To measure the physiologic effects and outcomes of endovascular aneurysm repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Establish selection criteria, improve device design, operative technique and&#xD;
                follow-up procedures for patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair involving&#xD;
                the THORACOABDOMINAL AORTA.&#xD;

&#xD;
                              -  Proximal fixation may occur in either native aorta or surgical&#xD;

&#xD;
        Arch Arm Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. General Inclusion Criteria (Must meet ALL of the following):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Life expectancy greater than 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Suitable arterial anatomy&#xD;

                  ascending aneurysm or dissection&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Anatomic Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must meet ALL of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Aneurysm of the ascending aorta or aortic arch/proximal descending thoracic&#xD;
                       aorta that is &gt;5.5cm or is considered to be at high risk for rupture or&#xD;
                       dissection given the morphologic characteristics of the aneurysm (or&#xD;
                       diverticulum).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Proximal aortic fixation zone:&#xD;
&#xD;
                         1. Native aorta or surgical graft (If surgical graft in ascending aorta,&#xD;
                            the angulation within the graft must be &lt;90 degrees)&#xD;
&#xD;
                         2. Diameter: 20-42mm&#xD;
&#xD;
                         3. Proximal neck length ≥10mm&#xD;
&#xD;
                         4. Ascending aortic length &gt;50mm&#xD;
&#xD;
                         5. Must occur distal to coronary arteries and any coronary artery bypass&#xD;
                            grafts that are considered patent and necessary for proper cardiac&#xD;
                            perfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Distal aortic fixation zone:&#xD;
&#xD;
                         1. Native aorta or surgical graft&#xD;
&#xD;
                         2. Diameter: 20-42mm&#xD;
&#xD;
                         3. Distal neck length ≥10mm&#xD;
&#xD;
                    4. Supra-aortic trunk (brachiocephalic) vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
                         1. Although the prosthesis will typically have two branches, modifications&#xD;
                            to the design will allow for a single branch or three branches. Thus,&#xD;
                            it is generally planned that at least one extra-anatomic bypass graft&#xD;
                            will be done in conjunction (or in a staged fashion) with the&#xD;
                            procedure. The two vessels incorporated into the endograft repair would&#xD;
                            most commonly be the innominate artery and left carotid artery.&#xD;
                            However, the innominate artery may be coupled with the left subclavian&#xD;
                            artery in the setting of a bovine arch whereby the flow to the left&#xD;
                            carotid would come from a left subclavian to carotid bypass. Similarly,&#xD;
                            the left carotid and subclavian artery may be branched, or simply one&#xD;
                            vessel branched should specific anatomic limitations exist. In such a&#xD;
                            situation, multiple extra-anatomic bypasses may be necessary. Thus the&#xD;
                            inclusion criteria are defined for each artery, yet any combination of&#xD;
                            arteries may be used for a repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         2. Diameter of vessel(s) to be incorporated into endograft&#xD;
&#xD;
                              -  Innominate artery: 8-22 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
                              -  Left (or right) common carotid artery: 6-16mm&#xD;
&#xD;
                              -  Left (or right) subclavian artery: 5-20mm&#xD;
&#xD;
                              -  Length of sealing zone ≥ 10mm&#xD;
&#xD;
                              -  Acceptable tortuosity&#xD;
&#xD;
                    5. In the setting of an aortic dissection the following criteria must exist:&#xD;
&#xD;
                         1. Access into the true lumen from the groin and at least one supra-aortic&#xD;
                            trunk vessel&#xD;
&#xD;
                         2. A sealing zone in the target aorta (or surgical graft) that is proximal&#xD;
                            to the primary dissection, such that a stent graft would be anticipated&#xD;
                            to seal off the dissection lumen&#xD;
&#xD;
                         3. A sealing zone in the target supra-aortic trunk vessels that is distal&#xD;
                            to the dissection, anticipated to seal off the dissection lumen, or&#xD;
                            surgically created&#xD;
&#xD;
                         4. A true lumen size large enough to deploy the device and still gain&#xD;
                            access into the target branches&#xD;
&#xD;
                    6. In the setting of a more distal disease, the repair may be coupled with a&#xD;
                       thoracoabdominal branched device, infrarenal device, and/or internal iliac&#xD;
                       branch device - typically performed in a staged fashion&#xD;
&#xD;
                    7. Iliac anatomy must allow for the delivery of the arch branch device which is&#xD;
                       loaded within an 18F-24F sheath. Conduits to the iliac vessels or aorta may&#xD;
                       be used if deemed necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Thoracoabdominal Arm Protocol&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Presence of at least one of the following aneurysms is necessary to drive the&#xD;
                  need for a repair with a fenestrated/branched device:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. A thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm ≥ 4 cm or suggestive of a high risk of&#xD;
                       rupture as a result of morphology, growth history or symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. A renal artery aneurysm &gt; 20 mm (or twice the diameter of native renal&#xD;
                       artery)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. An SMA aneurysm &gt;30 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Outside of the &quot;Indications for Use&quot; for commercially available fenestrated or&#xD;
                  branched endografts approved for use for the treatment of these aneurysms.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Proximal neck&#xD;

&#xD;
                    3. The proximal landing zone may be in a prior endograft or a prior surgical&#xD;
                       graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Iliac Artery&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Diameter ≥ 7 mm (anticipated diameter following balloon angioplasty,&#xD;
                       stenting, dottoring, or conduit) or ≥ 6 mm for patients receiving an&#xD;
                       Low-Profile device.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Iliac angulation that will not preclude device delivery or surgical&#xD;
                       modification of the iliac system&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. For a bifurcated or aorto-monoiliac prosthesis, iliac implantation sites&#xD;
                       require ≤ 20 mm in diameter and ≥ 20 mm in length&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For a straight aorto-aortic prosthesis, distal neck (normal aorta between the&#xD;
                  aneurysm and iliac bifurcation) ≥ 10 mm in length and ≤ 40 mm in diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If a hypogastric branch will be used to treat the common iliac aneurysm&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. The intended common iliac artery is &gt; 20mm in diameter or the aneurysm has&#xD;
                       morphology concerning for rupture; and&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. The intended distal fixation site within the internal iliac is ≤ 10mm in&#xD;
                       diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Renal arteries or other visceral vessels arising from the aorta in an orientation&#xD;
                  that is evident and measurable from cross-sectional imaging (CT or MR)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Visceral branch diameters (for incorporated vessels) between 4 mm - 11 mm at the&#xD;
                  intended distal sealing site (thus distal to a visceral artery aneurysm in such&#xD;
                  circumstances).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Greater than 5 mm of proximal visceral branch length to allow for a seal with the&#xD;
                  mated device, or the ability to exclude an early branch.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In the setting of an aortic dissection the following criteria must exist:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Access into the true lumen from the groin and at least one supra-aortic&#xD;
                       trunk vessel&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. A sealing zone in the target aorta (or surgical graft) that is proximal to&#xD;
                       the primary dissection, such that a stentgraft would be anticipated to seal&#xD;
                       off the dissection lumen&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. A sealing zone in the target supra-aortic trunk vessels that is distal to&#xD;
                       the dissection, anticipated to seal off the dissection lumen, or surgically&#xD;
                       created&#xD;
&#xD;
                    4. A true lumen size large enough to deploy the device and still gain access&#xD;
                       into the target branches&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In the setting of a more proximal disease, the repair may be coupled with an&#xD;
                  arch-branched device, thoracic aortic endograft, or surgical aortic repair -&#xD;
                  typically performed in a staged fashion&#xD;
&#xD;
        General Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient can be treated in accordance with the instructions for use with a commercially&#xD;
             marketed endovascular prosthesis&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of anaphylactic reaction to contrast material with an inability to properly&#xD;
             prophylax the patient appropriately&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known sensitivity or allergy to materials of construction of the device (including the&#xD;
             materials of the LP device).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Body habitus that would inhibit X-ray visualization of the aorta&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject had a major surgical or interventional procedure unrelated to the treatment of&#xD;
             the aneurysm planned &lt;30 days from the endovascular repair&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Unstable angina&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Unwilling to comply with follow up schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Systemic or local infection that may increase the risk of endovascular graft infection&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. An uncorrectable coagulopathy&#xD;
