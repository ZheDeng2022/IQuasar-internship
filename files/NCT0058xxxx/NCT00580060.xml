  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot trial to investigate the use of GM-CSF DNA as an adjuvant for peptide&#xD;
      vaccination in patients with metastatic melanoma. The objective of this study is to determine&#xD;
      the safety and adjuvant effect of vaccination with the gene coding for human GM-CSF with a&#xD;
      multi-epitope melanoma peptide vaccine (tyrosinase and gp100 peptides) in patients with AJCC&#xD;
      stage IIB, IIC, III and IV melanoma who are HLA-A2+. We will assess whether use of GM-CSF DNA&#xD;
      is safe and generates an immune response to peptides derived from antigens on melanoma cells.&#xD;

      This is a pilot trial to investigate the use of GM-CSF DNA as an adjuvant for peptide&#xD;
      vaccination in patients with metastatic melanoma. The objective of this study is to determine&#xD;
      the safety and adjuvant effect of vaccination with the gene coding for human GM-CSF with a&#xD;
      multi-epitope melanoma peptide vaccine (tyrosinase and gp100 peptides) in patients with AJCC&#xD;
      stage IIB, IIC, III and IV melanoma who are HLA-A2+. We will assess whether use of GM-CSF DNA&#xD;
      is safe and generates an immune response to peptides derived from antigens on melanoma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Dose Ranging part of the study, cohorts of 3 patients will be treated at increasing&#xD;
      dose levels of GM-CSF DNA delivered subcutaneously (100, 400, or 800 ug), followed by&#xD;
      administration of both peptides subcutaneously to the same site on day 5 or day 6. Patients&#xD;
      will be treated monthly for three immunizations. Pharmacokinetic studies will be performed&#xD;
      during the first cycle. Patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected in&#xD;
      order to measure the T cell responses induced by the vaccines. Toxicity will be assessed&#xD;
      during this part of the study, although we do not expect to achieve a dose limiting toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT). The dose for the second part of the study will be the maximum tolerated dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the study will assess the immunological efficacy of the vaccine. Nine&#xD;
      patients will receive GM-CSF DNA delivered subcutaneously at one site, followed by&#xD;
      administration of both peptides to the same site on day 5 or day 6, every month for three&#xD;
      immunizations. A total of at least 18 patients is planned for both phases of the study.&#xD;
      Patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected in order to measure the T cell&#xD;
      responses induced by the vaccines. Specifically, Elispot assays for CD8+ T cells responses&#xD;
      against the peptides will be assessed, and will be the primary method to determine the&#xD;
      generation of a specific immune response to the peptide antigens.&#xD;
