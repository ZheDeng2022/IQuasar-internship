    <textblock>
      The goal is to study the accuracy of 3-dimensional ultrasound (which does not involve&#xD;
      radiation) to measure the size of the stomach, comparing it with a previously validated&#xD;
      method that involves radiation. This will make it possible to check the stomach function of&#xD;
      children without exposing them to radiation. A second goal is to measure the size of the&#xD;
      stomach and the effect of a standard meal on stomach volume in adolescent boys and girls.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the fasting and postprandial volumes measured by 99mTc- SPECT (standard test)&#xD;
           and 3-D ultrasound in 12 healthy adults in order to test latter's external validity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the performance characteristics of 3-D ultrasound for the measurement of&#xD;
           gastric volumes during fasting and in response to a standard meal, specifically, the&#xD;
           intra- and inter-individual coefficient of variation in 12 healthy adults who undergo&#xD;
           two estimations of fasting and postprandial volumes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To develop normative data for fasting and postprandial gastric volumes in 24&#xD;
           asymptomatic adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: first, 12 healthy adults will undergo SPECT and 3-D&#xD;
      ultrasound in random order (aim 1); one week after the first ultrasound examination, a second&#xD;
      Ultrasound examination will be conducted in all participants (aim 2) In the second part, 24&#xD;
      adolescents (12 in each gender, 12 aged 13-15, 12 aged 16-18)) will undergo a single&#xD;
      determination of fasting and postprandial gastric volumes during fasting and post-prandially.&#xD;
      The methods and validation of the SPECT study have been previously published (2). Three D&#xD;
      ultrasonography will be conducted using state of the art equipment following methods&#xD;
      published in the literature. (3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will screen 80 healthy adults or adolescents in order to enroll 12 healthy adulkts&#xD;
      for the first two aims, and 24 adolescent healthy subjects for the third aim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects in group 1, the order of SPECT and 3D- ultrasound tests will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization assignments will be made according to a pre-study schedule prepared by the&#xD;
      Section of Biostatistics. Medical investigators will be blinded to assignment, allocation&#xD;
      will be concealed&#xD;
