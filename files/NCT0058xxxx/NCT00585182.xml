  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep vein thrombosis(DVT) is a common complication in hospitalized medical patients.&#xD;
      Consensus guidelines recommend using medications such as heparin or low-molecular-weight&#xD;
      heparins (LMWH) to prevent DVT in these patients. Generally, these medications are given in a&#xD;
      fixed dose that is the same for everyone. The appropriate dose of medication in patients with&#xD;
      severe obesity is uncertain. There is some evidence that the use of standard fixed-doses in&#xD;
      severely obese patients may not provide adequate protection against DVT. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate a weight-based dose(0.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight) of the&#xD;
      commonly prescribed LMWH, enoxaparin in severely obese patients to determine if predictable&#xD;
      levels of blood thinning can be achieved. We hypothesize that dosing enoxaparin 0.5mg/kg once&#xD;
      daily in severely obese patients will lead to predictable blood levels.&#xD;

      Background and Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      hospitalized patients. It is a well-known complication in patients after major surgery or&#xD;
      trauma. More recently, medically ill patients have been identified as another high risk group&#xD;
      with up to 15% of patients experiencing VTE in the absence of prophylaxis. 1 Several studies&#xD;
      have found the use of enoxaparin, dalteparin, and fondaparinux to be safe and effective in&#xD;
      reducing risk of VTE by 45% to 63% in medically ill patients. 1-3 Additionally, enoxaparin&#xD;
      has been found to be at least as safe and effective as unfractionated heparin for VTE&#xD;
      prophylaxis. 4 Enoxaparin 40 mg once daily has been shown to be a safe and effective&#xD;
      prophylactic therapy in hospitalized patients. 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      In thromboprophylaxis studies, including those investigating enoxaparin 40 mg once daily,&#xD;
      morbidly obese patients (greater than or equal to 35 kg/m2) have been grossly under-enrolled.&#xD;
      This is problematic for several reasons. First, the drug distribution is weight dependent and&#xD;
      therefore, anticoagulant levels will differ according to a patient's weight. 5 Secondly, the&#xD;
      FDA approved doses are fixed doses that do not take into account body weight. Thirdly, obese&#xD;
      patients are at greater risk for failure in preventing VTE and obese patients are probably at&#xD;
      greater risk for developing VTE. 6 Lastly, morbidly obese patients are becoming quite common&#xD;
      as the population as a whole is becoming more obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even with this information, there are no standards of VTE prophylaxis in obese patients.&#xD;
      Optimal means of delivering safe and effective thromboprophylaxis in this group is unknown.&#xD;
      When using LMWH's, consensus recommendations have been to monitor peak anti-Xa activity&#xD;
      targeting a level of 0.1-0.2 units/mL. 5 However, many hospitals do not have access to&#xD;
      anti-Xa monitoring. Studies evaluating the predictability of weight-based prophylactic dosing&#xD;
      of tinzaparin have demonstrated that anti-Xa levels are predictably achieved and therefore,&#xD;
      laboratory monitoring may not be necessary with this dosing strategy.7 However, tinzaparin is&#xD;
      not widely utilized in the U.S. and uncertainties remain about whether predictable anti-Xa&#xD;
      levels can be achieved with a weight-based prophylactic regimen using the more commonly used&#xD;
      drug enoxaparin. If weight-based dosing with enoxaparin is shown to result in predictable&#xD;
      anti-Xa activity in obese patients, the need for monitoring would be obviated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective is to evaluate the predictability in achieving target&#xD;
      anti-Xa activity levels in morbidly obese medically ill patients using weight-adjusted (0.5&#xD;
      mg/kg) once daily prophylactic dose of enoxaparin. The secondary objective is to gain&#xD;
      information to evaluate the pharmacokinetic curve of enoxaparin in obese patients over 18&#xD;
      hours after the second dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Selection Criteria: VTE risk will be evaluated with an institutionally utilized&#xD;
      risk stratification scheme. This risk stratification scheme which was drafted by a&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary panel, represents standard of care for medically ill patients at the&#xD;
      University of Utah.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: Medically ill patients who are greater than 18 years of age who have a&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 35 kg/m2 who are admitted to the University of&#xD;
      Utah Medical Center, are at risk for VTE, and are eligible for pharmacological prophylaxis as&#xD;
      determined by patient's provider will be consented for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: Patients who are pregnant (a urine HCG will be performed if a female of&#xD;
      child-bearing age is not on reliable birth control, or if otherwise clinically indicated),&#xD;
      are currently on therapeutic anticoagulation, have a bleeding disorder, platelet count of&#xD;
      less than 100,000/mL, coagulopathy, active bleeding, creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min&#xD;
      (based on Cockcroft-Gault equation, and rounding serum creatinine to 1 in patients greater&#xD;
      than 65 years), or recent (within 14 days) stroke, surgery or trauma will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a single arm study enrolling consecutive eligible patients admitted to the&#xD;
      University of Utah Medical Center. This is a descriptive study evaluating the feasibility and&#xD;
      predictability of administering weight-adjusted enoxaparin (0.5mg/kg once daily) to achieve&#xD;
      recommended target peak anti-Xa levels in patients at extreme body weight. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that weight-adjusted prophylaxis will reliably achieve recommended target anti-Xa levels. If&#xD;
      so, this would obviate the future need for routine anti-Xa monitoring using this&#xD;
      pharmacologic regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, there will also be a parallel cohort evaluating a day 2 pharmacokinetic curve&#xD;
      by 5-serial anti-Xa activity measurements in a subset of up to 2-3 patients in each weight&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures: Consecutive eligible patients will be enrolled if informed consent is&#xD;
      given. Consent will be obtained in the University Hospital, mainly on the Internal Medicine&#xD;
      Floor. It will be obtained by the one of the study co-investigators. At least one person who&#xD;
      is obtaining consent will be available to consent patients any time of day and will have&#xD;
      adequate time to exchange information and answer questions between investigator and&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol uses a VTE prevention regimen that employs rational pharmacologic&#xD;
      principles and is in line with published recommendations for prophylaxis in this patient&#xD;
      population. In consideration of having a comparator cohort group, we would consider it to be&#xD;
      unethical to have a cohort group receiving enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily as a&#xD;
      comparator group because pharmacologic data strongly suggests that effective levels of&#xD;
      anticoagulation would not be achieved in this population of patients. 8 Informed consent was&#xD;
      felt optimal in order to allow patients to fully understand that this regimen, although it is&#xD;
      an acceptable standard of care, is being employed under the broader context of a study&#xD;
      whereby other patient data will be collected and recorded in prospective fashion. Once&#xD;
      informed consent is obtained, patients will begin VTE prophylaxis with enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg&#xD;
      subcutaneously once a day. Peak anti-Xa activity will be obtained in all patients through a&#xD;
      venipuncture 4-6 hours after the first or second dose has been given. Five milliliters of&#xD;
      blood will be drawn. This is the amount of blood that is needed for this laboratory test to&#xD;
      be performed. Baseline clinical and demographic information will be obtained and recorded on&#xD;
      standard case reporting forms, CRF (see Appendix B). Patients will continue prophylaxis as&#xD;
      deemed necessary by their attending physician through the duration of their hospital stay or&#xD;
      unless dictated otherwise by the patient's attending physician. Adverse events such as VTE,&#xD;
      bleeding event, or thrombocytopenia will be recorded during the hospital stay (see Appendix&#xD;
      C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients consent to do the additional testing, this will be marked on the consent form.&#xD;
      These patients will have anti-Xa levels drawn before the first enoxaparin dose, and then at&#xD;
      4h, 6h, 12h, and 18h after the second dose of enoxaparin. If the 12h anti-Xa level is&#xD;
      obtained and is less than 0.05 units/mL, then the 18 hour blood test can be eliminated. The&#xD;
      purpose of this section is to provide us with information to evaluate the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      curve of enoxaparin in obese patients over 18 hours.&#xD;
