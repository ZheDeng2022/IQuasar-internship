    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether a test, called the PET scan, may be useful in&#xD;
      determining if there are additional locations of cancer not otherwise detectable by other&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PET scan is a nuclear medicine imaging study that measures how much radioactive sugar is&#xD;
      used by your tumor. The study will compare pictures of the cancer from the PET scan to other&#xD;
      x-ray exams, such as a CT scan, as well as to what your doctors find at the time of surgery.&#xD;
      If the study results show that the PET scan gives us a good idea of what is happening to the&#xD;
      tumor, then it may be useful in deciding which patients with colorectal metastases to the&#xD;
      liver should be operated on and what operation should be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, by comparing the results of PET scans with the other studies that will be&#xD;
      performed as part of your care, we will try to determine which test best tells us which&#xD;
      patient is most likely to benefit from surgery.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  initial diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma confirmed by the Pathology Department of&#xD;
             Memorial Hospital or by diagnostic barium enema if the primary tumor is still in&#xD;
             place.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a candidate for liver resection for metastatic colorectal cancer as defined by members&#xD;
             of the Department of Surgery of Memorial Hospital. Patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
             cancer isolated to the colon, rectum, or liver are eligible. In addition, patients&#xD;
             with limited, resectable pulmonary metastases are eligible.&#xD;
