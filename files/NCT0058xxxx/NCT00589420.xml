      RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways&#xD;
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Giving sorafenib together with docetaxel may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving sorafenib together with docetaxel to see how&#xD;
      well it works in treating patients with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the proportion of patients achieving a 50% reduction in serum PSA from&#xD;
           baseline in patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) receiving&#xD;
           sorafenib tosylate and docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the progression-free survival of patients with AIPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To quantify the number and percent of patients who have stable disease at 6 months of&#xD;
           therapy (failure to progress).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate median time to progression for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the objective response rate of patients with AIPC treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the percentage of patients surviving at 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the toxicities and estimate toxicity rates for patients treated with this&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure changes in tumor vasculature in response to therapy in selected patients with&#xD;
           dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and correlate primary and secondary objectives&#xD;
           to these measurement changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure changes in serum HMGB1 in response to therapy and correlate primary and&#xD;
           secondary objectives with these changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure changes in serum cathepsin D in response to therapy and correlate primary and&#xD;
           secondary objectives with these changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 2-19 and docetaxel IV&#xD;
      on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 10 courses. Patients then receive oral&#xD;
      sorafenib tosylate alone twice daily on days 1-19 with treatment repeating every 21 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood collection periodically to measure serum HMGB1 and cathepsin D levels&#xD;
      before and after therapy.&#xD;
