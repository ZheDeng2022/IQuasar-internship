  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Automobile driving is a crucial aspect of everyday life, yet vehicular crashes represent a&#xD;
      serious public health problem. Patients with epilepsy are at elevated risk for automobile&#xD;
      crashes, causing great personal suffering and financial costs to society. Most collisions&#xD;
      involving epileptic drivers are not seizure related but may instead result from cognitive&#xD;
      effects upon driving performance of epilepsy and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Several million&#xD;
      American drivers take AEDs for treatment of medical conditions besides epilepsy and may also&#xD;
      be at risk for cognitive impairments that can reduce driving performance. Empirical evidence&#xD;
      of the effects of AEDs on driving performance would enable development of driving guidelines&#xD;
      that could lower the risk of injurious motor vehicle collisions; however, this evidence is&#xD;
      currently lacking. The broad goal of our project is to determine the specific effects of the&#xD;
      most commonly utilized AED, phenytoin, by assessing driving performance and cognitive&#xD;
      abilities in neurologically normal volunteers taking phenytoin in a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, crossover study. Our proposed experiments will assess: (1) cognitive&#xD;
      functions using standardized neuropsychological tests (of attention, perception, memory, and&#xD;
      executive functions), (2) driving performance during phenytoin and placebo administration,&#xD;
      and (3) the effects of phenytoin-related cognitive performance upon driving performance. To&#xD;
      measure driving performance, we will use a state-of-the-art fixed-base interactive driving&#xD;
      simulator that allows us to observe driver errors in an environment that is challenging yet&#xD;
      safe for the driver and tester, under conditions of optimal stimulus and response control.&#xD;
      The results of this study of 30 drivers treated with phenytoin and placebo will increase the&#xD;
      understanding of the role of AED-related cognitive impairment on driving safety errors. A&#xD;
      better understanding of the impact of AEDs upon driving performance is necessary to&#xD;
      rationally develop interventions that could help prevent crashes by drivers treated with&#xD;
      AEDs.&#xD;

      Patients with epilepsy are at elevated risk for automobile crashes, causing great personal&#xD;
      suffering and financial costs to society. Most collisions involving epileptic drivers are not&#xD;
      seizure related but may instead result from cognitive effects upon driving performance of&#xD;
      epilepsy and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Several million American drivers take AEDs for&#xD;
      treatment of medical conditions besides epilepsy and may also be at risk for cognitive&#xD;
      impairments that can reduce driving performance. Empirical evidence of the effects of AEDs on&#xD;
      driving performance would enable development of driving guidelines that could lower the risk&#xD;
      of injurious motor vehicle collisions; however, this evidence is currently lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad goal of the current project is to determine the specific effects of AEDs on&#xD;
      cognitive function and driving performance. To address this goal we will assess driving&#xD;
      performance and cognitive abilities in neurologically normal volunteers taking phenytoin&#xD;
      (Dilantin), the most commonly prescribed AED. Effects of phenytoin on driving performance and&#xD;
      cognition will be addressed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover&#xD;
      study. Driver cognition will be assessed using a battery of neuropsychological tests. Driving&#xD;
      performance will be objectively assessed in all participants on standardized tasks enacted in&#xD;
      a state-of-the-art driving simulator. Our 3 Specific Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To assess the effects of phenytoin on cognitive abilities that are crucial to the&#xD;
      driving task, including perception, attention, memory, and executive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: A driver's cognitive abilities will decline during steady-state phenytoin&#xD;
      administration compared to placebo. Drivers with higher blood levels of phenytoin will show&#xD;
      greater decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To assess effects of phenytoin on driving performance and safety errors in a&#xD;
      state-of-the-art driving simulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Driving performance will decline and driver safety errors will increase during&#xD;
      phenytoin administration compared to placebo. Drivers with higher blood levels of phenytoin&#xD;
      will show greater impairments of driving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To assess the effects of phenytoin-related cognitive impairments upon driving&#xD;
      performance in a state-of-the-art driving simulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3. Impairments of cognitive function affecting perception, attention, memory,&#xD;
      executive function, and arousal will increase the likelihood of driver errors that may lead&#xD;
      to a crash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses would be supported if the drivers taking phenytoin, as opposed to placebo,&#xD;
      demonstrate worse cognitive performance on neuropsychological tests, and more safety errors&#xD;
      and crashes in the simulator. The hypotheses would also be supported if drivers with higher&#xD;
      phenytoin levels show greater impairments of cognition and driving. Once the effects of&#xD;
      phenytoin on driving performance are demonstrated in this project, we will have evidence to&#xD;
      support more comprehensive research addressing specific dosing and serum levels and acute&#xD;
      versus chronic administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no evidence concerning the effects of phenytoin on driving performance.&#xD;
      Accurate driving performance data on patients receiving phenytoin would allow determination&#xD;
      of fair and accurate criteria for making recommendations to drive or not to drive affecting&#xD;
      millions of patients taking AEDS for epilepsy and other conditions. These data could also&#xD;
      help reduce the risk of car crashes due to medication side effects.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticipating a 10-15% drop-out rate, we will induct 30 neurologically normal subjects&#xD;
             (age 18 (21) -60) to obtain 25 evaluable subjects who are legally licensed to drive in&#xD;
             their state of residence and have been actively driving under appropriate legal&#xD;
             guidelines for at least 5 years (to minimize performance variations of novice&#xD;
             drivers).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because this study is intended to determine the potential effects of phenytoin on&#xD;
             driving performance, a relatively healthy cohort of patients must be chosen. Chronic&#xD;
             medical or psychiatric conditions could cause significant alterations in driving&#xD;
             performance independent of those caused by phenytoin, which would complicate&#xD;
             interpretation of performance impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are younger than 18 or older than 60&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have history of prior seizures, family history of epilepsy, or prior history of head&#xD;
             injury&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a known history of prior drug or alcohol abuse or unwillingness to abstain from&#xD;
             drug or alcohol use during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a past or current active neurological or psychiatric disorder that could impair&#xD;
             cognitive or driving performance (i.e. baseline IQ &lt; 90, dementia, mental retardation,&#xD;
             stroke, severe head injury, schizophrenia, active clinical depression, progressive&#xD;
             brain tumor).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have a chronic medical condition (i.e. diabetes mellitus, renal&#xD;
             insufficiency, congestive heart failure, hepatic dysfunction, hematologic condition,&#xD;
             HIV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking medications known to affect the central nervous system (i.e. baseline pre-study&#xD;
             treatment with antiepileptic drug, anxiolytics, sedatives, hypnotics, antidepressants,&#xD;
             antipsychotics, narcotics and tranquilizers)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regularly use over-the-counter cough suppressants, antihistamines, or sleep aids; or&#xD;
             who ingest over 7 cups of daily coffee or currently smoke cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be excluded if they cannot complete SIREN testing or neuropsychological&#xD;
             instruments because of visual or hearing impairment (history or screening discovery of&#xD;
             corrected visual acuity of less than 20/50) or other physical disability, or if they&#xD;
             have a history of severe motion sickness as an adult-a marker for patients who develop&#xD;
             simulator sickness and therefore cannot participate in SIREN testing.&#xD;
