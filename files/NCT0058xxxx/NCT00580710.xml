    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the effects of diabetes mellitus and its treatment upon&#xD;
      the body's responses to low blood glucose (blood sugar) levels. Diabetes is a medical&#xD;
      condition in which blood glucose can rise very high. Treatment of diabetes mellitus involves&#xD;
      giving insulin (a hormone), which can occasionally cause blood glucose to fall too low. The&#xD;
      body responds to low glucose levels by producing a number of hormones, which act against the&#xD;
      insulin to help correct the low blood glucose. These hormones also provide symptoms which&#xD;
      warn that the glucose is falling too far. These protective warnings by the body may be&#xD;
      different in people with diabetes. We want to test whether this also means that diabetes&#xD;
      changes the sensitivity of brain function to a lowering of blood glucose levels. In order to&#xD;
      answer this question, we need to compare the response of people with diabetes with the&#xD;
      response of people who do not have diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan of the study is to lower the subject's blood glucose using insulin, while measuring&#xD;
      what changes occur in brain function using what is called functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that a person with type 1 diabetes is less likely to suffer the&#xD;
      long term microvascular complications of diabetes (eye, kidney and nerve damage) if they&#xD;
      strive to achieve as near normal a blood glucose as possible. Unfortunately the tighter the&#xD;
      blood glucose control is, the more likely the subject is to suffer episodes of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
      Hypoglycemia is often the aspect of diabetes management most feared by people with diabetes&#xD;
      and may cause more anxiety than the threat of advanced complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many people with diabetes the problem of hypoglycemia is compounded by the development of&#xD;
      the syndrome of hypoglycemia unawareness. One aspect of hypoglycemia unawareness is&#xD;
      impairment of the hormones normally released as blood glucose falls. Hypoglycemia triggers a&#xD;
      release of such insulin antagonists as epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucagon, growth hormone&#xD;
      and cortisol. These hormones act synergistically with the autonomic nervous system to raise&#xD;
      blood glucose, counteracting insulin and restoring normoglycemia. These homeostatic&#xD;
      mechanisms are also responsible for some of the early symptoms of low blood glucose,&#xD;
      providing a warning to insulin-treated diabetics as glucose falls. A number of studies&#xD;
      including research from this unit have established that strict metabolic control is&#xD;
      associated with impairment of the normal counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia and a&#xD;
      loss of hypoglycemia awareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain is central to the recognition of hypoglycemia and the coordination of the&#xD;
      counterregulatory response. Neural tissue depends mainly on glucose for its energy supply. As&#xD;
      circulating glucose falls beneath the level needed to maintain glucose transport across the&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier, a variety of defense mechanisms are activated, including symptoms of&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction. However, the precise nature and causes of the adverse CNS effects of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia are not well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a tool to measure the effects of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia on the patterns and magnitudes of neuronal activation in the human brain, in&#xD;
      both normal and diabetic subjects.&#xD;
