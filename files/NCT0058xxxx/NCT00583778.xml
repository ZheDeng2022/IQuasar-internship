  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, controlled clinical trail testing whether three doses of 1.25 mg of&#xD;
      nebulized levalbuterol in combination with three doses of 0.5mg of nebulized ipratropium will&#xD;
      lead to greater bronchodilation than that achieved by three doses of nebulized 1.25 mg of&#xD;
      levalbuterol alone every 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that three doses of 1.25 mg of nebulized levalbuterol&#xD;
      in combination with three doses of 0.5mg of nebulized ipratropium will lead to greater&#xD;
      bronchodilation than that achieved by three doses of nebulized 1.25 mg of levalbuterol alone&#xD;
      every 20 minutes. The secondary hypothesis is that the treatment combination of levalbuterol&#xD;
      and ipratropium will lead to fewer hospitalizations than levalbuterol alone in patients with&#xD;
      acute asthma exacerbation. Other secondary objectives include (1) evaluating the relationship&#xD;
      between baseline (S)- albuterol levels and (R)- albuterol levels on presentation and FEV1,&#xD;
      (2) the relationship between baseline (S)- albuterol levels and (R)- albuterol levels on&#xD;
      presentation and change in FEV1,(3) time to event analysis for an improvement of 15%, 20%,&#xD;
      30%, 40%, and 50% in FEV1 from initial presentation value, (4) analysis of FEV1 at discharge.&#xD;

      Patients will then receive, in a randomized double-blinded fashion, levalbuterol, 1.25mg&#xD;
      every 20 minutes for a total of 3 aerosolized doses combined with ipratropium, 0.5mg every 20&#xD;
      minutes for a total of 3 aerosolized doses. The medication will be premixed by the pharmacy&#xD;
      in a total of 3 ml of normal saline and the nebulizer will be driven with oxygen at 6 liters&#xD;
      per minute. A second plasma sample for analysis of albuterol isomers will be drawn within a&#xD;
      fifteen minute window following the third aerosol treatment. Spirometry will be repeated&#xD;
      again at 30 and 60 minutes after the third aerosol treatment (Figure 1). All patients will&#xD;
      receive prednisone, 60mg orally immediately after their first dose of aerosolized&#xD;
      medications, unless contraindications to prednisone administration are present. Patients will&#xD;
      not receive any other medications during the time course of the study. Vital signs and pulse&#xD;
      oximetry will be repeated prior to each nebulized treatment and again 30 minutes after the&#xD;
      third nebulized treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will terminate 60 minutes after the third aerosol administration. At that point,&#xD;
      any further therapy will be at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients will be&#xD;
      questioned about the occurrence of any side effects from levalbuterol treatment including&#xD;
      palpitations, anxiety, nausea, vomiting or headache. Patients will also be questioned about&#xD;
      the occurrence of any side effects from ipratropium, including dry mouth, dry eyes, and&#xD;
      urinary retention. Patients will be withdrawn from the study at any point these side effects&#xD;
      become intolerable to the patient or any time the patient so desires. Patients will also be&#xD;
      withdrawn if they develop palpitations and have an ECG that demonstrates ventricular or&#xD;
      supraventricular tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .Patients will be called 14 days after their ED visit to assess relapse or recurrence of&#xD;
      acute asthma exacerbation. In addition, a chart review will be performed to assess relapse or&#xD;
      recurrence of acute asthma exacerbation, as well as determine hospital length of stay in&#xD;
      those patients who required admission after the initial visit.&#xD;
