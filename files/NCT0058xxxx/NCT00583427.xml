  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a medicine called Sulodexide will help prevent or slow&#xD;
      down the progression of Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis type II/Dense Deposit&#xD;
      Disease. Sulodexide is not yet FDA approved and has not been studied in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aim/hypotheses: to measure the efficacy of Sulodexide treatment in patients with the&#xD;
      above disease/s.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study subjects will be asked to take Sulodexide twice a day. The Sulodexide will be taken in&#xD;
      addition to the regular medications the subject is on. There will be no change in these other&#xD;
      medications. The subject will also be asked to have blood tests each month to follow kidney&#xD;
      function. The frequency of these tests is the normal/standard frequency for persons with MPGN&#xD;
      II/DDD and is neither increased nor decreased because of participation in this study. The&#xD;
      study will occur over 6 months for each subject.&#xD;
