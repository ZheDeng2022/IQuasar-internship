      This is a study to determine if people with Lupus have weak bones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test which is a better method for detecting bone changes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single energy quantitative computed tomography (SEQCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate whether weak bones are associated with things like medications or amount of fat and&#xD;
      muscle.&#xD;

      This is a longitudinal cohort study to evaluate the natural history of osteoporosis in&#xD;
      children and adolescents with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the BMD of children and adolescents with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus to&#xD;
           healthy controls utilizing Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and Single energy&#xD;
           quantitative computed tomography (SEQCT). The following questions will be addressed at&#xD;
           baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the variation of BMD seen among subjects with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus? Is the&#xD;
      BMD of children with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus diminished relative to healthy controls? If&#xD;
      BMD is diminished, what is the severity of the reduction?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the annual change in BMD for children and adolescents with Systemic&#xD;
           Lupus Erythematosus over a five year period in a longitudinal cohort study utilizing&#xD;
           arial and volumetric densitometry methods of both trabecular- and cortical-rich regions&#xD;
           of bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the use of DXA and SEQCT for measuring BMD in children and adolescents with&#xD;
           Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the determinants of BMD and corresponding markers of bone metabolism in&#xD;
           a longitudinal cohort of pediatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To bank Systemic Lupus Erythematosus subject blood and urine specimens for future&#xD;
           analysis. Future analysis will focus on newly developed bone metabolism markers, as this&#xD;
           is a currently evolving area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate body composition in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus utilizing whole body DXA&#xD;
           and to determine the contribution of body composition abnormalities to BMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Method: This study includes a baseline cross-sectional component&#xD;
      comparing Systemic Lupus Erythematosus subjects to normal healthy controls followed by a&#xD;
      longitudinal follow up study of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus subjects. Systemic Lupus&#xD;
      Erythematosus subjects and controls will be evaluated in a single-day visit to the University&#xD;
      of California, San Francisco Pediatric Clinical Research Center for clinical assessment and&#xD;
      phlebotomy followed by a radiologic evaluation at the Department of Radiology.&#xD;
