  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms in women undergoing&#xD;
      surgery for gynecologic malignancy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower urinary tract symptoms, including urinary incontinence, voiding dysfunction, urgency,&#xD;
      frequency, fecal incontinence, as well as sexual dysfunction, is directly affected by&#xD;
      gynecologic malignancies and the surgical and medical management of those malignancies.&#xD;
      Increased risk of injury to the urinary tract is a recognized complication of surgical and&#xD;
      medical therapy of gynecologic malignancies. To date, only a few studies have looked at the&#xD;
      incidence of lower urinary tract symptoms at the time of diagnosis of gynecologic malignancy&#xD;
      and prior to treatment, and there have been no published studies describing the incidence of&#xD;
      sexual dysfunction at the time of diagnosis and prior to therapy of gynecologic malignancies.&#xD;
      However, sexual dysfunction has been described in patients with urinary incontinence and&#xD;
      pelvic organ prolapse and following surgery for incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.&#xD;
