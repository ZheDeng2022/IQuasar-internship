  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure certain specific chemicals in your blood, produced by&#xD;
      the body in response to a stress, such as having pancreatic cancer. These chemicals are&#xD;
      called &quot;cytokines&quot; and the researchers doing this study want to look at the role they may&#xD;
      play in developing depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States, with a 5&#xD;
      year mortality rate of over 95%. With limited treatments available for cure or prolongation&#xD;
      of survival, quality of life issues, such as the optimal treatment and understanding of&#xD;
      depression, become an important focus of care in this population. Clinical Depression (Major&#xD;
      Depressive Syndrome) occurs in up to 50% of patients with pancreatic cancer, and is&#xD;
      significantly more common than in other cancers. Accumulating evidence suggests a potential&#xD;
      role for endogenous cytokines, specifically interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the development of depression in the medically&#xD;
      ill, including cancer patients. These same cytokines have been noted to be elevated in&#xD;
      pancreas cancer patients. The main goal of this pilot study is to examine the role of&#xD;
      specific endogenous cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, as well as IL-10, Il-15 and IFN-gamma)&#xD;
      in the development of Major Depressive Syndrome (MDS) in patients with pancreatic cancer. To&#xD;
      achieve our goal, we will examine the relationships between serum cytokines (IL-1, IL-6,&#xD;
      TNF-alpha, as well as IL-10, Il-15 and IFN-gamma) and clinical depression (i.e. MDS)&#xD;
      utilizing a cross sectional design in 4 samples of patients: a) Pancreas cancer patients with&#xD;
      a DSM-IV diagnosis of MDS (N=25); b) Pancreas cancer patients without a DSM-IV diagnosis of&#xD;
      MDS (N=25); c) Healthy Controls with a DSM-IV diagnosis of MDS (N=25); and d) Healthy&#xD;
      Controls without a DSM-IV diagnosis of MDS (N=25). Measures will include a structural&#xD;
      clinical interview for DSM-IV diagnosis (SCID) of Major Depressive Syndrome, as well as&#xD;
      measures of depressive symptom severity, fatigue severity, concentration and attention, and&#xD;
      cognitive function. Plasma concentrations of endogenous cytokines ((IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, as&#xD;
      well as IL-10, Il-15 and IFN-gamma) will be measured utilizing standard assays. Our specific&#xD;
      aims are: 1) To preliminarily examine the relationships between plasma concentrations of&#xD;
      endogenous cytokines (IL-1, Il-6, TNF-alpha, as well as IL-10, Il-15 and IFNgamma) and a&#xD;
      DSM-IV diagnosis of Major Depressive Syndrome in patients with pancreas cancer and healthy&#xD;
      controls; 2) To explore the relationships between plasma concentrations of endogenous&#xD;
      cytokines (Il-1, Il-6, TNF-alpha, as well as IL-10, Il-15 and IFN-gamma) and the&#xD;
      phenomenology and severity of depressive symptoms, presence and severity of fatigue, and&#xD;
      degree of impairment in attention, concentration and cognition, in depressed patients with&#xD;
      pancreas cancer and healthy depressed controls. The results of this pilot study will be&#xD;
      utilized to seek NIH funding for larger, longitudinal, multi-institutional, studies examining&#xD;
      the role of endogenous cytokines in pancreas cancer patients, as well as clinical&#xD;
      intervention trials for the treatment of clinical depression in pancreas cancer patients that&#xD;
      utilize specific cytokine antagonists as adjuncts to antidepressant drug therapies.&#xD;

    <description>All subjects will be administered a battery of clinician rated and self report instruments including measures of depression, fatigue, and cognitive functioning. In addition, measures of pain, sleep, and anxiety will also be utilized to assess these important potential confounding variables. The SCIDIV will be used to ascertain the presence or absence of a current DSMIV diagnosis of Major Depressive Episode for all subjects. The interview should take approximately fortyfive minutes to complete. Patients will have their blood drawn once, in order to determine plasma levels of the cytokines IL1, IL6, TNFalpha, IL10, IL15 and IFNgamma.</description>
