  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out about the pain and quality of life of individuals&#xD;
      who are adult cancer survivors. By quality of life, we mean how you are feeling about&#xD;
      different aspects of your life, including your physical health, your emotional health, and&#xD;
      your ability to carry out daily activities. We are interested in people's opinions about&#xD;
      their quality of life, as well as the factors that affect their quality of life. In addition,&#xD;
      learning about pain will help us to develop new services for adult cancer survivors.&#xD;

      The main objective of the proposed study is to identify the prevalence of persistent pain in&#xD;
      a sample of adult cancer survivors. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive information&#xD;
      about pain in the cancer survivor population. Although prior studies have assessed pain&#xD;
      syndromes in breast and lung cancer survivors (e.g., post-mastectomy and post-thoracotomy&#xD;
      pain), there is a lack of information about the prevalence and characteristics of&#xD;
      post-treatment pain in other subpopulations of survivors. To address this knowledge gap, a&#xD;
      random sample of cancer survivors who are from 1 to 10 years post-treatment completion and&#xD;
      who were treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center will complete a&#xD;
      telephone-administered pain interview and assessment battery focusing on pain, quality of&#xD;
      life, and psychological distress. Our initial recruitment and evaluation will begin in 50&#xD;
      breast cancer survivors and then will expand 50 survivors in each of the other services&#xD;
      Colorectal, Genitourinary, Head and Neck, and Thoracic in allotments of 50 participants each.&#xD;
      We estimate that the completion time for the interview and assessment battery will range from&#xD;
      45 to 60 minutes. This telephone-based survey will identify vulnerable subgroups of patients&#xD;
      with persistent pain and provide a knowledge base for future research on the prevalence and&#xD;
      risk factors for post-treatment pain in the cancer survivor population.&#xD;
