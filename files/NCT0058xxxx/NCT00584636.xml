    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the addition of budesonide to oral corticosteroids&#xD;
      will result in a decrease in relapse rates compared to oral corticosteroids alone in children&#xD;
      who are discharged from the ED after an asthma exacerbation. Secondly, that there will be an&#xD;
      improvement in lung function, a decrease in beta-2 agonist use and an improvement in&#xD;
      health-related quality of life compared to placebo.&#xD;

      Children between the ages of 2 and 8 years inclusive who have a history of asthma are&#xD;
      eligible for enrollment if they present to the pediatric emergency department with an asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation that is believed would not require admission to the hospital. All eligible&#xD;
      children will be enrolled whenever there are study personnel available after obtaining&#xD;
      informed written consent. Children less than 2 years of age will not be enrolled as their&#xD;
      wheezing may be due to bronchiolitis. Children will also be excluded if they have been on an&#xD;
      oral or inhaled corticosteroid in the last week, have a history of a chronic lung disease&#xD;
      (e.g. cystic fibrosis), non-corrected congenital heart disease, are pregnant, or unavailable&#xD;
      for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial asthma severity will be based on PEFR's or clinical asthma scores (table 1). If the&#xD;
      child is able to reliably provide a peak flow in the emergency department this value will be&#xD;
      recorded and calculated as a percentage of their predicted based on standardized height and&#xD;
      weight charts. All peak flows will be performed by licensed respiratory therapists or trained&#xD;
      registered nurses. If a childs effort during the performance of the peak flows is considered&#xD;
      poor by the respiratory therapist then only the asthma score will be utilized. If a child can&#xD;
      perform the peak flows adequately they will be sent home with the peak flow meter. All&#xD;
      children will be assigned clinical asthma scores regardless of whether peak flows are&#xD;
      obtained. With this asthma scale a score of less than 7 is considered mild, 8 to 11 moderate&#xD;
      and a score of 12 to 15 severe. This asthma score has been shown to have good interobserver&#xD;
      reliability with a Pearson correlation statistic of 0.92.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be treated based on normal practice patterns for our ED and the decision to&#xD;
      discharge a patient will be at the attending physician's discretion. All children will&#xD;
      receive 2 mg/kg of methylprednisolone up to a maximum dose of 60 mg orally within the first&#xD;
      60 minutes of treatment or 0.6mg/kg of oral dexamethasone (max 15mg) given in the Emergency&#xD;
      room. When discharged home all children will be given a prescription for 4 days of&#xD;
      methylprednisolone in a dose of 1 mg/kg given once daily Patients will be assigned in a&#xD;
      double blind fashion to budesonide nebules or placebo. A computer generated table of random&#xD;
      numbers will be used to assign children to treatment group. Groups will be randomized in&#xD;
      blocks of 10. A locked area in the ED will contain numbered plastic bags each containing&#xD;
      either budesonide nebules or identical appearing and tasting placebo nebules. Study personnel&#xD;
      and patients will be blinded to treatment allocation for the entire length of the trial.&#xD;
      Patients will be given instructions on the use and dosage (based on weight) of the study&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be contacted by telephone at 7 days. They will be followed for 28 days or&#xD;
      until they relapse, whichever comes first. Relapse will be defined as any unscheduled&#xD;
      physician visit for worsening asthma symptoms. At the time of telephone follow-up patients&#xD;
      will be asked about symptoms as well as about compliance with their study medications (see&#xD;
      data collection sheet). At the return visit on day 28 they will be asked to bring their&#xD;
      medication with them to determine compliance. At that time they will also have peak flows&#xD;
      obtained and a repeat assessment of the quality of life scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to measure health-related quality of life, the Integrated Therapeutics Group Child&#xD;
      Asthma Short Form (ITG-CASF) will be completed by a research assistant upon enrollment, via&#xD;
      telephone follow-up 7 days after the emergency department visit, and at the 28 day follow-up&#xD;
      visit. The ITG-CASF has previously been validated in children with chronic asthma. Gorelick&#xD;
      et al have shown it to be a valid and responsive measure of health-related quality of life in&#xD;
      children as young as 2 years of age treated in an emergency department for acute asthma. The&#xD;
      8-item ITG Child Asthma Short Form measures the following three concepts: Daytime Symptoms,&#xD;
      Nighttime Symptoms, and Functional Limitations. In addition to the standard 8-item ITG Child&#xD;
      Asthma Short Form, they identified two additional items from the long form to assess whether&#xD;
      inhaler use interfered with the child's life and whether adjustments were made to family life&#xD;
      because of the child's asthma.&#xD;
