      To determine the maximum tolerated dose of ABT 510 when administered concurrent with&#xD;
      radiation therapy for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      1. To describe the toxicity associated with this regimen in adult patients with newly&#xD;
           diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the duration of disease free survival and overall survival associated with&#xD;
           this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) and 2 (TSP-2) in tumor vs. corresponding normal tissue&#xD;
           using quantitative real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (Q-RT-PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine the effect of ABT 510 on tumor permeability and tumor blood volume as measured&#xD;
           by non-invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).&#xD;

    <description>ABT 510 (TSP-1 mimetic peptide) is a parenterally available nonapeptide analog of the heptapeptide and is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. ABT 510 competes with TSP-1 for binding to endothelial cells, but the exact mechanism of anti-angiogenesis is unknown. ABT 510 is administered by SQ injection. The starting dose of ABT 510 will be 20mg once daily (QD) SQ. Doses will be escalated by approximately 50% increments in consecutive cohorts of 3-6 patients until maximum tolerated dose is achieved.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must be 19 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have histologically proven newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have fully recovered from the immediate post-operative period and be&#xD;
             maintained on a stable corticosteroid regimen for 5 days prior to entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60% (i.e. the patient must be able&#xD;
             to care for himself/herself with occasional help from others).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have adequate hematologic, renal and liver function (i.e. Absolute&#xD;
             neutrophil count &gt; 1500/mm3, Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3, creatinine 1.5 mg/dl .&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with the potential for pregnancy or impregnating their partner must agree to&#xD;
             follow acceptable birth control methods to avoid conception. The effect of the&#xD;
             investigational drugs on the developing human fetus is not known, but these drugs are&#xD;
             likely to be harmful to the developing fetus or nursing infant. Women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential must agree to use adequate contraception (either surgical sterilization;&#xD;
             approved hormonal contraceptives such as birth control pills Depo-Provera, or Lupron&#xD;
             Depot; barrier methods such as condom or diaphragm along with spermicide; or an&#xD;
             Intrauterine device (IUD)). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician and study&#xD;
             PI immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient is able to self-administer or has a caregiver who can reliably administer&#xD;
             subcutaneous injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior therapy for the brain tumor (except surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior treatment with antineoplastic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Exclude sexually active males and females unwilling to practice contraception during&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Serious concurrent infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Clinically significant cardiac disease not well controlled with medication (e.g.&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, symptomatic coronary artery disease and cardiac arrhythmias&#xD;
             ) or myocardial infarction within the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who have had prior cytotoxic chemotherapy prior to radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with other serious uncontrolled co-morbid diseases that the investigator&#xD;
             feels may comprise the study findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must be able to learn to self -administer or have another person administer&#xD;
             subcutaneous(SQ) injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients who have received any other investigational agents within the 28 days prior&#xD;
             to Day 1 of the study.&#xD;
