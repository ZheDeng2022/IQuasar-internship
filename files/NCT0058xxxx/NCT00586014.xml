      The purpose of this phase II study is to assess the toxicity and efficacy of sequentially&#xD;
      administered high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue in the treatment&#xD;
      of multiple myeloma. Prior studies have shown that dose-intensified melphalan can produce&#xD;
      higher response rates and complete remission in some patients. Over the past several years,&#xD;
      multiple phase II studies utilizing high dose chemotherapy or high dose chemo-radiotherapy&#xD;
      with autologous marrow or peripheral blood stem cell rescue have demonstrated improved&#xD;
      response rates and survival rates compared to historical controls. Recently a prospective&#xD;
      randomized trial has demonstrated improved response rates, response duration and overall&#xD;
      survival utilizing high dose therapy with autologous bone marrow support compared to standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The primary cause of failure is relapse and it is unclear how many, if any,&#xD;
      patients are cured by this approach. Based on observations of efficacy in Hodgkin's Disease,&#xD;
      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and breast cancer, an approach utilizing sequential high dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy in multiple myeloma was developed. This protocol tests the sequential regimen in&#xD;
      multiple myeloma patients who have responded to a standard dose chemotherapy regimen prior to&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;

      The purpose of this phase II study is to assess the toxicity and efficacy of sequentially&#xD;
      administered high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue in the treatment&#xD;
      of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a chemotherapy sensitive disease but is not curative&#xD;
      with standard therapy with a median survival of 2 to 4 years. Prior studies have shown that&#xD;
      dose-intensified melphalan can produce higher response rates and complete remission in some&#xD;
      patients. Over the past several years, multiple phase II studies utilizing high dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy or high dose chemo-radiotherapy with autologous marrow or peripheral blood stem&#xD;
      cell rescue have demonstrated improved response rates and survival rates compared to&#xD;
      historical controls. Recently a prospective randomized trial has demonstrated improved&#xD;
      response rates, response duration and overall survival utilizing high dose therapy with&#xD;
      autologous bone marrow support compared to standard chemotherapy. The primary cause of&#xD;
      failure is relapse and it is unclear how many, if any, patients are cured by this approach.&#xD;
      Based on observations of efficacy in Hodgkin's Disease, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and breast&#xD;
      cancer, an approach utilizing sequential high dose chemotherapy in multiple myeloma was&#xD;
      developed. This protocol tests the sequential regimen in multiple myeloma patients who have&#xD;
      responded to a standard dose chemotherapy regimen prior to enrollment. As originally written,&#xD;
      eligible patients were required to have sensitive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol was revised in August 1998 to allow entry of patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      myeloma who had stable but not progressive disease following VAD chemotherapy. Patients with&#xD;
      recurrent myeloma were still required to have chemotherapy sensitive disease. Eligible&#xD;
      patients must also have pathologically confirmed multiple myeloma, no prior bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation and acceptable organ function (pulmonary, renal, hepatic, and cardiac). The&#xD;
      recent revision of the protocol also allows entry of patients with renal insufficiency due to&#xD;
      multiple myeloma to be enrolled on the protocol. Prior to initiating high dose therapy,&#xD;
      patients must undergo a complete history and physical exam with routine lab work plus titers&#xD;
      for HIV, CMV, HSV, and VCV: immunoglobulin levels, beta-2 microglobulin and serum protein&#xD;
      electrophoresis as well as immunoelectrophoresis and bone marrow aspirates and biopsies.&#xD;
      These studies are all standard for multiple myeloma patients. All patients require a double&#xD;
      Human Hickman to be placed prior to the start of therapy. The protocol was originally written&#xD;
      to include total body irradiation and high dose Melphalan as a preparative regimen for&#xD;
      patients who had not received prior radiotherapy. Patients who were not eligible for TBI&#xD;
      received high dose BCNU plus Melphalan. A revision removed the TBI Melphalan arm from the&#xD;
      protocol after analysis of over 100 patients treated at Stanford University Medical Center on&#xD;
      this same protocol showed no difference in event-free survival or overall survival between&#xD;
      the TBI containing arm and the chemotherapy only preparative regimen. The TBI arm was dropped&#xD;
      due to the increased cost and morbidity of TBI and the associated scheduling and logistics&#xD;
      problems. The other revision to the protocol was the inclusion of CD34 stem cell selection on&#xD;
      the stem cells collected by leukapheresis following high dose cyclophosphamide. This change&#xD;
      was based on the results of a Phase III study which demonstrated that the degree of tumor&#xD;
      cell contamination of these stem cell collections could be decreased by 3-6 logs with CD34&#xD;
      cell selection. The dose of Melphalan was also increased to 200 mg/m2 after completion of a&#xD;
      dose escalation study at Stanford.&#xD;
