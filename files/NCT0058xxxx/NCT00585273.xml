  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decade, second generation antipsychotics have been increasingly utilized. Since&#xD;
      their introduction, however, atypical antipsychotics have been increasingly associated with&#xD;
      significant metabolic complications including hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance/diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, and obesity. These metabolic complications increase the risk for cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease in populations with an already elevated risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial goal of the proposed study is to identify early signs of endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
      and vascular disease in those treated with atypical antipsychotics. The identification of&#xD;
      early signs of vascular disease may further link metabolic complications with any&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk. Demonstration of changes in vascular function associated with atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotics represents an important identifiable intermediate of more long-term&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second goal of the proposed study is to identify genetic factors that may be associated&#xD;
      with the development of cardiovascular disease, which can later serve as a guide to predict&#xD;
      risk. Accurate prediction of risk may facilitate the future development of an empirical,&#xD;
      risk-based, individualized selection process for antipsychotic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To quantify the role of antipsychotic-induced metabolic complications on the&#xD;
      development of vascular disease using measures of endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Atypical antipsychotics will lead to greater impairments in endothelial&#xD;
      function, evidenced by decreased flow-mediated dilation from baseline measures and compared&#xD;
      with changes over time in controls. Medication-induced metabolic complications will be&#xD;
      temporally associated with these impairments in endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To investigate the role of candidate pharmacogenetic polymorphisms with cardiovascular&#xD;
      and metabolic complications of atypical antipsychotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Profiles of polymorphisms at receptors targeted by atypical antipsychotics will&#xD;
      be associated with impaired cardiovascular function and metabolic complications.&#xD;

      Participants will have all evaluations related to metabolic complications performed in the&#xD;
      University of Iowa Clinical Research Unit (CRU) or in the EndoPAT laboratory located in Room&#xD;
      269 GH. For all visits, weights will be measured without shoes, in light clothing, using an&#xD;
      electronic scale that measures to the nearest 0.25 kg. Standing heights will be measured&#xD;
      without shoes, to the nearest 0.1 cm using a free-standing stadiometer. These weights and&#xD;
      heights will be utilized for the computation of body mass index (BMI). Waist circumference&#xD;
      will be measured horizontally at the tip of the right iliac crest in the standing position&#xD;
      using a measuring tape. Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured in the sitting&#xD;
      position after five minutes of silent rest, using an automated sphygmomanometer. An&#xD;
      ambulatory blood pressure will also be obtained at each visit. An EKG will be conducted&#xD;
      during Visit 1. Dual energy X-ray absortionmetry (DEXA) will assess percentage of body fat at&#xD;
      intake, Visit 4 and Visit 8. If a participant is unable to complete a DEXA scan, body fat&#xD;
      will be determined using the BOD POD® Gold Standard Body Composition Tracking System. The BOD&#xD;
      POD® is an integrated system consisting of a digital scale to measure subject mass, a large&#xD;
      egg-shaped fiberglass air displacement plethysmography (ADP) to determine body volume (BV),&#xD;
      and a computer that operates the equipment and calculates body composition. Body density is&#xD;
      determined from subject mass and volume measurements and then percent fat is calculated using&#xD;
      one of several standard formulas. CRU dieticians will perform skin fold measurements at&#xD;
      intake and completion. Fasting measures of triglycerides, LDL-C, HDL-C, IDL, VLDL,&#xD;
      apolipoprotein A, apolipoprotein B, Lp(a) cholesterol, C-reactive protein, IL-6, leptin&#xD;
      levels, insulin levels, and glucose will be obtained at baseline, 2 weeks, 12 weeks, 26&#xD;
      weeks, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years and 4 years. Hemoglobin A1C will be collected at baseline and&#xD;
      weeks 12 and 26, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years and 4 years. Cholesterol levels will be determined&#xD;
      by an enzymatic calorimetric test using cholesterol esterase and cholesterol oxidase. LDL-C&#xD;
      and HDL-C fractions will be obtained via a homogeneous enzymatic in vitro colorimetric assay.&#xD;
      For the determination of triglyceride levels, free glycerol is eliminated prior to hydrolysis&#xD;
      of triglycerides in a preliminary reaction where lipase and 4-aminophenazone are omitted,&#xD;
      followed by enzymatic hydrolysis of triglycerides and determination of the liberated glycerol&#xD;
      by a fully enzymatic colorimetric assay reaction. Apolipoproteins and other lipid parameters&#xD;
      will be measured using beta quantification through the Mayo Medical Laboratories (unit code&#xD;
      83673).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial and Cardiovascular Function: Participants will have endothelial function measured&#xD;
      at baseline, and each subsequent visit. To maximize completion rates, participants planning&#xD;
      to discontinue their antipsychotic between weeks 16 and 26 will have their final measures&#xD;
      taken at the time of discontinuation. Prior to these appointments, participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to not eat or drink anything (including caffeinated products such as coffee, tea,&#xD;
      soda, etc.) except water for at least 12 hours prior to the appointment. They will also be&#xD;
      instructed to not drink any alcohol for 24 hours prior to each study. They will be asked not&#xD;
      to smoke for the two hours prior to the study. Administration of blood pressure and lipid&#xD;
      lowering medications for that day will be delayed until after the procedures. Measures of&#xD;
      endothelial function will be obtained in the Clinical Research Unit (CRU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDUIT VESSEL FUNCTION: Conduit vessel endothelial function will be assessed non-invasively&#xD;
      via ultrasound measurement of brachial artery diameter during changes in brachial artery&#xD;
      flow. The technique uses a 10-13 MHz linear array transducer ultrasound system (Biosound&#xD;
      ESAOTE, Indianapolis, IN). A 5 cm length of the brachial artery is imaged in longitudinal&#xD;
      section above the antecubital fossa and the optimal probe site on the skin marked. Baseline&#xD;
      images of brachial artery diameter and Doppler velocities from the center of the vessel are&#xD;
      recorded on videotape. While images for brachial artery diameter are being continuously&#xD;
      recorded, an occluding forearm cuff placed just below the antecubital fossa is inflated for 5&#xD;
      minutes. The brachial artery diameter and Doppler velocities are continuously recorded&#xD;
      before, during and after cuff deflation. After approximately 5 minutes, once basal diameter&#xD;
      and flow have been restored, nitroglycerin (300 mcg) will be administered sublingually and&#xD;
      measurements made for an additional 6 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE VARIABILITY: We will also assess blood pressure and heart rate&#xD;
      variability using recordings of indirect arterial pressure with a beat-to-beat finger&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure recording in conjunction with the electrocardiogram&#xD;
      tracing during the conduit vessel function procedures. Data from this measurement will allow&#xD;
      us to assess blood pressure and heart rate variability. Cardiovascular variability (HRV) is a&#xD;
      marker for cardiovascular risk whereby lower variability indicates greater risk for&#xD;
      myocardial infarct and stroke. This procedure can be performed during assessment of conduit&#xD;
      vessel function so requires no additional time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARTERIAL TONOMETRY: We will utilize arterial tonometry through measurement of pulse wave&#xD;
      analysis (PWA) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) using a SphygmorCor machine. This machine uses a&#xD;
      noninvasive probe, pressed lightly on the skin over the carotid, radial and femoral arteries&#xD;
      for about five minutes each. These measurements will provide a measure of arterial&#xD;
      compliance, stiffness, and other hemodynamic information. The PWA system is a computerized&#xD;
      diagnostic tool for the assessment of central blood pressure. The peripheral pressure pulse&#xD;
      waveform contains information in addition to the maximum and minimal values (systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic pressures). The PWA system can derive the central aortic pressure waveform from the&#xD;
      peripheral pressure waveform recorded at the radial or carotid arteries. The system uses&#xD;
      mathematical transforms to derive the central aortic pressure pulse waveform and then&#xD;
      calculates a range of central indices of ventricular-vascular interaction, which are&#xD;
      displayed both graphically and numerically. The PWV system measures the velocity of the blood&#xD;
      pressure waveform between any two superficial artery sites. A pressure tonometer is used to&#xD;
      transcutaneously record the pressure pulse waveforms in the underlying artery. The pressure&#xD;
      pulse waveform is recorded simultaneously with an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, which&#xD;
      provides an R-wave timing reference. Pressure pulse recordings are performed consecutively at&#xD;
      the two superficial artery sites over the carotid and femoral artery. The software processes&#xD;
      each set of pressure pulse and ECG waveform data to calculate the mean time difference&#xD;
      between the R-wave and the pressure wave- on a beat-by-beat basis. The PWV is then calculated&#xD;
      using the mean time difference and the arterial path length between the two recording sites.&#xD;
      The velocity of the blood pressure pulse waveform is dependent on the stiffness of the artery&#xD;
      along which the pulse is traveling. Serial measurement of pulse wave velocity in a section of&#xD;
      artery will indicate the magnitude of change in arterial stiffness in that section of the&#xD;
      artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT: Detailed historical information will be gathered including age,&#xD;
      occupation, education, race, height, weight, medical history, treatment history, family&#xD;
      history of medical illness with focus on risk factors for metabolic syndrome, and substance&#xD;
      use history including tobacco. Basic clinical information will be obtained to verify&#xD;
      psychiatric diagnosis and assess cardiac risk by the Framingham Heart Study formula. It is&#xD;
      estimated that this history will take 45 minutes to complete. Affective and psychotic&#xD;
      symptomatology will be cross-sectionally assessed using the Montgomery Asberg Depression&#xD;
      Rating Scale, the Young Mania Scale, and the Brief Psychotic Rating Scale.&#xD;

        Thirty patients, 18 - 50 years of age, who are being started on a first-line,&#xD;
        second-generation, antipsychotic associated with weight gain (risperidone, olanzapine, or&#xD;
        quetiapine) for the treatment of an affective or psychotic disorder, will be invited to&#xD;
        participate. Participants must not have taken any of these antipsychotics or clozapine in&#xD;
        the preceding three months. Another twenty psychiatric controls not taking antipsychotic&#xD;
        medications will also be enrolled. Statistically, controls will serve primarily to compare&#xD;
        changes in flow-mediated dilation over time rather than for direct comparison of variables&#xD;
        between groups. Participation will be voluntary and initiated upon clinician or&#xD;
