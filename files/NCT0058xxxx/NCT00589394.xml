    <textblock>
      The lack of clear guidelines and studies addressing the proper response to the pneumococcal&#xD;
      vaccine (Pneumovax ®) has hampered our ability to diagnosis and care for our immunodeficiency&#xD;
      patients. Should an age matched normal response range to the Pneumovax ® be established, it&#xD;
      would have a profound impact in the diagnosis, safety and care of immunodeficiency patients.&#xD;
      Moreover, characterizing the B cell compartments response to the Pneumovax ® may better&#xD;
      delineate the mechanism of protective immunity from Pneumovax ® and provide an additional&#xD;
      tool for the diagnosis and care for immunodeficiency patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The ability to respond to a polysaccharide vaccine antigen is an integral part of evaluating&#xD;
      a patient with immunodeficiency. The pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax ®) remains the only&#xD;
      readily available and the most widely used unconjugated polysaccharide vaccine. Although the&#xD;
      pneumococcal vaccine is widely used test the immune systems response to a polysaccharide&#xD;
      antigen, no clear guidelines or studies exist to what is considered a proper response to the&#xD;
      Pneumovax ®. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) memory B cells are thought to play an important role in&#xD;
      protection against pneumococcal disease. It is not known to what extent the ability of B&#xD;
      cells to be activated in response to pneumococcal vaccination contributes to protective&#xD;
      immunity. To address these issues, the following two specific aims are proposed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. Assess Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to pneumococcus pre- and&#xD;
      post-pneumococcal immunization in healthy controls Specific Aim 2. Analysis of B cell subsets&#xD;
      in blood of healthy controls pre-and post-pneumococcal immunization to identify changes in&#xD;
      memory B cell, class switched and activated B cells.&#xD;
