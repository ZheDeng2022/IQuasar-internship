  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of clinical research is to look at the nature of disease and try to develop&#xD;
      improved methods to diagnose and treat disease.The goal of this study is to evaluate the use&#xD;
      of computed tomography (CT) scan of the heart in the diagnosis of disease in vein grafts&#xD;
      after bypass surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have bypass surgery with using vein grafts from their legs (saphenous veins)&#xD;
      have a very high risk of developing blockages in the grafts. It has been shown in previous&#xD;
      studies that the progression of disease in vein grafts is very quick and can result in chest&#xD;
      pain, heart attacks or death. In the past, evaluation of the grafts was possible with heart&#xD;
      catheterization only. The technique of CT scan is currently considered an effective way to&#xD;
      look at vein grafts as well as the arteries around the heart to identify blockages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain blood proteins have been associated with rapid progression of vein graft blockages.&#xD;
      Our purpose is to not only to identify blockages at different stages after bypass surgery,&#xD;
      but to investigate the causes of the rapid progression of the disease, including clinical&#xD;
      history, risk factors and the blood proteins.&#xD;
