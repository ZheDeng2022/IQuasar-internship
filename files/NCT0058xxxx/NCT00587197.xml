      Patients with cirrhosis require endoscopic screening for large esophageal varices. The aims&#xD;
      of this study were to determine the cost -effectiveness and patient preferences of a strategy&#xD;
      employing abdominal computerized tomography (CT) as the initial screening test for&#xD;
      identifying large esophageal varices. In a prospective evaluation,102 patients underwent both&#xD;
      CT and endoscopic screening for gastroesophageal varices. Two radiologists read each CT&#xD;
      independently; standard upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was the reference standard.&#xD;
      Agreement between radiologists, and between endoscopists regarding size of varices was&#xD;
      determined using kappa statistic. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to determine the&#xD;
      optimal screening strategy for varices. Patient preference was assessed by questionnaire. CT&#xD;
      was found to have an approximately 90% sensitivity in the identification of esophageal&#xD;
      varices determined to be large on endoscopy, but only about 50% specificity. The sensitivity&#xD;
      of CT in detecting gastric varices was 87%. In addition, a significant additional number of&#xD;
      gastric varices, peri-esophageal varices, and extraluminal pathology were identified by CT&#xD;
      but not identified by endoscopy. Patients overwhelmingly preferred CT over endoscopy .&#xD;
      Agreement between radiologists was good regarding the size of varices (Kappa = 0.56), and&#xD;
      exceeded agreement between endoscopists (Kappa = 0.36). Use of CT as the initial screening&#xD;
      modality for the detection of varices was significantly more cost-effective compared to&#xD;
      endoscopy irrespective of the prevalence of large varices. In conclusion, abdominal CT as the&#xD;
      initial screening test for varices could be cost-effective. CT also permits evaluation of&#xD;
      extra-luminal pathology that impacts management.&#xD;

      Study Group -We screened a population of 581 consecutive patients with cirrhosis who were&#xD;
      scheduled to undergo upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Exclusion criteria included inability&#xD;
      to provide consent, patients who had previously undergone liver transplantation, previous&#xD;
      portosystemic shunt procedure, or had a recent history (&lt; 7 days) of upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeding . In addition, patients with renal insufficiency defined as a serum creatinine of &gt;&#xD;
      1.7 mg/dL in non-diabetics or &gt;1.5 mg/dL in diabetics were excluded given concerns regarding&#xD;
      the requirement of intravenous contrast during CT. Approximately 300 patients met inclusion&#xD;
      criteria for screening for esophageal varices. Patients who had endoscopic variceal therapy&#xD;
      (n=19) were also screened and 10 patients were included in the study to determine the role of&#xD;
      CT imaging in determining the presence of varices in this group of patients. The last&#xD;
      endoscopic therapy session in this group was greater than four weeks prior to the CT scan in&#xD;
      order to eliminate any potential radiological artifact from the endoscopic treatment.&#xD;
      Patients who met inclusion criteria (n=300) but declined entry into the study cited either&#xD;
      scheduling conflicts (n=142),or fear of radiation (n=24) . The diagnosis of cirrhosis in the&#xD;
      134 patients who consented to the study was based on histology (N = 76); or the presence of&#xD;
      ascites, thrombocytopenia or splenomegaly combined with low serum albumin (&lt;3.4 g/dL) and&#xD;
      prolongation of the prothrombin time (INR &gt; 1.3) with compatible abdominal imaging (N = 58).&#xD;
      No endoscopies were performed purely for research purposes. Written informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained from all patients who were enrolled into the study. Of the 134 patients who&#xD;
      consented, 102 completed both endoscopic and CT examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reflect practice in the real world, the endoscopic procedures were deliberately chosen to&#xD;
      be carried out by regularly scheduled endoscopists rather than a small selected group of very&#xD;
      experienced endoscopists. Varices were regarded as present or absent, with size recorded as&#xD;
      either large (â‰¥5 mm diameter) or small (&lt;5 mm diameter) based on subjective assessment of&#xD;
      diameter.. Titrated sedation was undertaken in all patients with midazolam and fentanyl.. The&#xD;
      size of the esophageal varices was measured in the distal 5 cm of the esophagus during&#xD;
      withdrawal of the instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two gastrointestinal radiologists (R1 and R2), each with over 10 years of experience and&#xD;
      blinded to each other's evaluation, as well as to the results of the endoscopy, read each CT&#xD;
      study. Axial images were evaluated to determine the presence and size of esophageal and&#xD;
      gastric varices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multidetector CT scans (four detectors or higher)were performed using 0.5 second rotation&#xD;
      time ,scanner settings of 250 mAs and 120 kVp, slice thickness 3 mm, and 3 mm reconstruction&#xD;
      interval. Intravenous low osmolar iodinated contrast (Omnipaque 300; GE Healthcare) was&#xD;
      administrated at a rate of 4ml/second, with late arterial phase scanning initiated 35 seconds&#xD;
      after contrast injection, and carried out from the liver dome through the liver and pancreas.&#xD;
      Portal phase imaging was initiated 70 seconds after contrast injection, and was carried out&#xD;
      from above the diaphragm to the iliac crest. Partial phase images were also reconstructed to&#xD;
      a nominal slice thickness of 0.75-1.5 mm and a 20cm field of view to maximize spatial&#xD;
      resolution.. The total effective radiation dose for this protocol was 15mSv. There was a&#xD;
      possible clinical indication to perform CT of the abdomen in 44 of the patients; CT was&#xD;
      performed solely for research purposes in 58 patients. Large esophageal varices on CT scan&#xD;
      were defined as those that were measured as greater than or equal to 5 mm in diameter, with&#xD;
      small varices being those that measured less than 5 mm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine degree of interobserver variability regarding characterization of variceal size&#xD;
      between endoscopists, photographs of esophageal varices were taken during endoscopies and&#xD;
      randomly selected images were circulated among 5 endoscopists, 2 with &lt;5 years' experience in&#xD;
      practice and 3 with &gt;15 years' experience. The endoscopists were blinded to the results of&#xD;
      the other's interpretation and were asked to characterize the endoscopic images as either&#xD;
      small,large, or absent varices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction with endoscopy and CT was determined by administering a questionnaire&#xD;
      for each patient to complete 24 hours after the procedure. The questionnaire determined the&#xD;
      patient's opinion regarding elements of comfort and convenience during each test. In&#xD;
      addition, patient preference for either study and the reason for preference were elicited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis - Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of&#xD;
      CT in determining characteristics of varices were determined for both radiologists with&#xD;
      endoscopy regarded as the reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensitivity of CT for detecting large varices was determined by identifying which of&#xD;
      those patients with large varices at endoscopy were identified by CT as having esophageal&#xD;
      varices. The specificity of CT for identifying esophageal varices was defined by correctly&#xD;
      identifying the absence of varices in those patients in whom no varices were found&#xD;
      endoscopically. Dilated and tortuous veins that protruded into the lumen of the stomach on CT&#xD;
      were termed gastric varices. Variceal channels that coursed along the adventitia of the&#xD;
      esophagus, but did not protrude into the esophageal lumen were termed peri-esophageal&#xD;
      varices. Kappa statistic was used to determine agreement between observers in grading the&#xD;
      size of the varices, both on endoscopy and on CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We assumed a 40% prevalence rate of esophageal varices, and a 20 % rate of large varices&#xD;
      (2,8). To detect a 15% difference in detection rate of esophageal varices between CT and&#xD;
      endoscopy, 95 patients would require to be studied for an alpha of 0.05 (one tailed test), or&#xD;
      alpha of 0.10 (two tailed test), and beta of 0.20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decision Model We compared the cost-effectiveness of three strategies for the detection of&#xD;
      large varices in patients with cirrhosis using a decision tree approach. The comparison&#xD;
      strategies were 1) Endoscopy, 2) CT and 3) CT + Endoscopy only for patients with small&#xD;
      varices on CT. The model was contructed using Treeage Pro Suite 2007 (Treeage Software,&#xD;
      Williamstown, MA). Patients considered in this analysis are assumed to have compensated&#xD;
      cirrhosis in whom the presence or absence of esophageal varices is not known. The decision&#xD;
      tree assumed a two year time horizon. The efficacy and costs of the three approaches were&#xD;
      compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The decision tree is&#xD;
      presented in the Appendix (Figure 1) We made a number of assumptions for this analysis. The&#xD;
      full set of assumptions are presented in the appendix (Table 1). We assumed the sensitivity&#xD;
      of testing strategies and subsequent complication and bleeding rates from various sources.&#xD;
      The sensitivity of detection of large varices with CT was derived from the results presented&#xD;
      in this paper. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of a third party payer,&#xD;
      considering only direct health care costs. Costs were not discounted due to the relatively&#xD;
      short time horizon of the analysis (two years). The main outcome of the analysis was the cost&#xD;
      per variceal bleed prevented. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were&#xD;
      calculated compared to the &quot;Do Nothing&quot; strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
