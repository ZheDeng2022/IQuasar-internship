      The purpose of the Phase Ib portion is to find out the highest dose of study drug that can&#xD;
      safely be given when tested in a small group of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the Phase II portion is to find out how safe the study drug is when taken at&#xD;

      This open-label, multicenter, randomized study will consist of a Phase Ib portion: a safety&#xD;
      run-in period with 3 ascending doses of E7820; and a Phase II portion: a randomized 2-arm&#xD;
      design. Approximately 95 patients with measurable, nonresectable locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma, who have failed first-line chemotherapy, will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study (approximately 12 to 15 patients in the Phase Ib portion and 80&#xD;
      patients in the Phase II portion). Patients will only participate in either the Phase Ib or&#xD;
      the Phase II portion of the study. Patients will receive up to a planned total of 12 cycles&#xD;
      of study treatment unless there is occurrence of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, withdrawal by the Investigator, lost to follow-up, or death, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first. After 12 cycles, patients who demonstrate clinical benefit may continue single&#xD;
      agent E7820 for long as clinical benefit is sustained and the treatment is well tolerated. If&#xD;
      the treating physician does not feel comfortable discontinuing chemotherapy after 12 cycles,&#xD;
      further chemotherapy may be considered following discussion with the medical monitor and&#xD;
      sponsor.&#xD;
