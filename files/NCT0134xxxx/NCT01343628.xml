  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol dependence, or &quot;alcoholism&quot;, affects approximately 14 million Americans. Currently,&#xD;
      only three pharmacotherapies (disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate) have been approved for&#xD;
      the treatment of alcohol dependence and these medications are, at best, moderately&#xD;
      successful. Thus, there is a great need for the examination of other biological systems,&#xD;
      which contribute/influence the drug reward/addiction pathways within the brain, such that the&#xD;
      discovery of new targets and new pharmacotherapies will be possible. Other biological systems&#xD;
      in addition to dopamine, such as serotonin, and norepinephrine (NE) are thought to be&#xD;
      important in several aspects of addiction, including reward, craving and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the effects of a 5 day course of atomoxetine (a selective NE&#xD;
      transporter (NET) inhibitor) (80 mg/day; Strattera or placebo) on alcohol-elicited craving&#xD;
      and sensitivity to alcohol. The novelty of this study is that of atomoxetine and the fact&#xD;
      that it targets NET, neither of which has heretofore been examined in the context of alcohol&#xD;
      dependence. It is hopeful that this study, of 64 total individuals, will provide the PI with&#xD;
      sufficient preliminary data to submit a subsequent R01 application to study atomoxetine and&#xD;
      the involvement of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms within the NET gene on&#xD;
      alcohol-related phenotypes in alcohol dependent and non-dependent populations. The long-term&#xD;
      objective of this research is to develop more efficacious treatment interventions for alcohol&#xD;
      abuse and dependence.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NET genotype groups for rs11648486 SNP (CC 61%; CT 33%; TT 4%) (e.g., C/C and C/T) will be&#xD;
      compared to one another in a 2 (NET Genotype: C/C vs. C/T &amp; T/T) x 2 (Medication: atomoxetine&#xD;
      80 mg/day (~ vs. placebo) x 3 (Drink: Drink 1, 2, and 3) mixed factorial repeated measures&#xD;
      design using PROC MIXED in SAS by calculating difference scores. Of interest are the possible&#xD;
      interactions of the NET SNPs and atomoxetine on cue-elicited craving and the rewarding&#xD;
      effects of alcohol across trials.&#xD;

    <description>This questionnaire is used to assess craving. The AUQ consists of eight items related to urge drink that are rated on a 7-point Likert scale with the extremes anchored by &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; and &quot;Strongly Agree.&quot; The AUQ has demonstrated internal consistency and reliability (Bohn et al., 1995).</description>
