      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional dyspepsia is one of the commonest digestive disorders. The pathophysiology of&#xD;
      functional dyspepsia is uncertain. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has been recommended as the&#xD;
      first line treatment for functional dyspepsia. However, the results on effectiveness of PPI&#xD;
      are conflicting and it has been suggested that PPI is only effective for acid-related&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to use a wireless pH monitoring system positioned at the junction of&#xD;
      esophagus and stomach to evaluate the chronological relationship between acid exposure at&#xD;
      this region and symptoms of dyspepsia as well as its impact on the efficacy of acid&#xD;
      suppressive therapy in treatment of functional dyspepsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional dyspepsia patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study center(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the chronological relationship between acid exposure at squamo-columnar&#xD;
           junction (SCJ) and dyspeptic symptom in different subtypes of functional dyspepsia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the relationship between acid exposure at squamo-columnar junction and&#xD;
           dyspeptic symptom response to PPI&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the efficacy of PPI and placebo in treating functional dyspepsia patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esomeprazole 20mg vs Placebo o.d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects: 130&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional dyspepsia patients without concomitant gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 June 2010 - 30 May 2012&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary variable(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proportion of patients who report positive response to adequate relief of dyspeptic symptoms&#xD;
      at week 8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary variable(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyspeptic symptom scores, symptom association probability of dyspeptic symptoms in relation&#xD;
      to esophageal pH of less than 4 as measured at 1 cm above SCJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of visits: 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased acid exposure at SCJ contributes to dyspeptic symptom and predicts treatment&#xD;
      response to PPI in FD patients without concomitant GERD&#xD;

      Baseline assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be invited to complete self-administered questionnaires for demographics&#xD;
      and baseline symptom assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics: age, gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening of functional gastrointestinal disorder based on the Rome III questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional dyspepsia symptom questionnaire: an 8-item dyspeptic symptom score&#xD;
           questionnaire using 4-point (0-3) Likert scale based on recall of the past 7 days for&#xD;
           assessment of epigastric pain, epigastric burning, belching, bloating, postprandial&#xD;
           fullness, early satiation, nausea and vomiting. Functional dyspepsia will be further&#xD;
           classified into epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) and postprandial distress syndrome (PDS)&#xD;
           according to the Rome III definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Global dyspeptic symptom assessment: a dichotomous patient-reported scale in which they&#xD;
           are asked to give a response of either &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; to the inquiry &quot;Do you have&#xD;
           adequate relief of dyspeptic symptom over the last 7 days?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GERD symptom questionnaire: Patients will also be asked to report the frequency of&#xD;
           heartburn or acid regurgitation over the last 3 months. Patients with frequency of&#xD;
           reflux symptoms of more than twice per month are deemed to have concomitant GERD and&#xD;
           they will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological disorder: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) will be used for screening of&#xD;
           concomitant psychological disorder such as depression and generalized anxiety disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper endoscopy and BRAVO pH capsule insertion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper endoscopy will be arranged within 2 weeks of baseline assessment in order to exclude&#xD;
      organic pathology such as peptic ulcer, esophagitis and neoplasm. The position and morphology&#xD;
      of gastroesophageal junction is assessed during withdrawal of endoscope after deflation of&#xD;
      stomach at end-expiratory of the patient in left lateral body position. The morphology of&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction will be graded according to the &quot;flap valve&quot; concept. In order to&#xD;
      avoid the confounding effect of gross anatomical disruption of gastroesophageal junction on&#xD;
      acid exposure at SCJ, patients with grade IV disruption of gastroesophageal junction, which&#xD;
      refers to patulous hiatus with axial displacement of SCJ, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of endoscopy examination, the BRAVO delivery system will be passed orally&#xD;
      into esophagus in the same body position. The endoscope is then reintroduced to facilitate&#xD;
      positioning of the delivery system under direct visualization. The BRAVO pH capsule will be&#xD;
      placed at 1 cm proximal to SCJ for monitoring of acid exposure at SCJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recording of esophageal pH profile and symptoms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wireless esophageal pH monitoring will last for 48 hours. During the study period, the&#xD;
      patients will be instructed to engage in their usual daily activities. The patients will be&#xD;
      given a diary documenting meals, sleeping and dyspeptic symptoms. The patient has to return&#xD;
      the Bravo data recorder after 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of BRAVO pH monitoring, patients will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      esomeprazole 20mg daily or identical looking placebo for 8 weeks. The random allocation&#xD;
      sequence will be obtained from a computer-generated list of random numbers in blocks of 10.&#xD;
      Concealed allocation is achieved by an independent staff who assigns treatments according to&#xD;
      consecutive numbers in sealed envelopes. Study medications are dispensed as sealed packages&#xD;
      in consecutive numbers. Medication adherence is measured by pill counts during final visit&#xD;
      (V2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will report their individual dyspeptic symptoms on weekly basis using a self&#xD;
      administered symptom questionnaire. At week 4 and week 8, they will need to give an&#xD;
      additional rating on their overall symptom response using global symptom assessment. The&#xD;
      patients are required to give a dichotomous response of either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to the question&#xD;
      stating &quot;Do you have adequate relief of symptoms over the past 7 days?&quot;&#xD;
