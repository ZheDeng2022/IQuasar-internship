  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate feasibility of stereotactic body radiation (SRS) in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent oligometastatic disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with limited disease recurrence, known as oligometastatic or oligorecurrent disease&#xD;
      (defined here as 5 or fewer sites of metastatic disease) will benefit in terms of overall&#xD;
      survival and disease progression from reduced tumor burden and improved local control via&#xD;
      radiation to oligometastatic sites.&#xD;

    <measure>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>A a self-administered, 27-item questionnaire designed to measure four domains of HRQOL in cancer patients: Physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being. Scaling of items: Five-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Scoring: Subscale scores added to obtain total score. Alternative scoring includes the Trial Outcome Index (TOI), which is the sum of the Physical, Functional, Cancer Subscales. The TOI is reported to be an efficient and precise summary index of physical and functional outcomes. Higher scores indicated better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Local disease control</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of patients with local control is defined as stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) in the target lesion, per RECIST v1.1. Complete Response (CR): the disappearance of a target lesion. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

    <measure>Local failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of patients with local failure (progressive disease (PD) within the target lesion. Per RECIST v1.1: Progressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).</description>

    <description>Dose and fractionation will be dependent on the lesion location and lesion size and is up to the exact fractionation and dose is at the discretion of the treating physician. A minimum of 48 hours must be used in between SRS treatments at each site. Note that patients can have SRS everyday or multiple SRS sessions in one day as long as the minimum time for each treatment site is met. For example, if two lung lesions, brain, adrenal, and liver sites were being treated both lung sites could be treated Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and the adrenal, liver and brain lesions treated Tuesday, Thursday</description>
