      This project will study whether a new therapy that includes the practice of forms of&#xD;
      meditation is helpful for combat veterans returning from deployments in Iraq or Afghanistan&#xD;
      suffering with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). &quot;Mindfulness meditation&quot; cultivates&#xD;
      present-focused, non-judgmental attention to ones body, emotions, and thoughts, and is&#xD;
      proposed to lead to a greater sense of well-being and acceptance and better tolerance of&#xD;
      painful and distressing emotions. &quot;Compassion&quot; and &quot;loving-kindness&quot; meditations help&#xD;
      stabilize positive emotions like love and compassion, and may also be helpful for chronic&#xD;
      pain, and possibly depression and PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare a 16 week psychotherapy group for PTSD involving Mindfulness and&#xD;
      Self-compassion meditation, with a more standard form of group psychotherapy known as&#xD;
      &quot;Present-centered group therapy&quot;. Both therapies will be conducted at the VA Ann Arbor PTSD&#xD;
      clinic by VA psychotherapists. (The study is also approved by the IRB of the VA Ann Arbor).&#xD;
      Combat veterans will be randomly assigned to either the Meditation or the standard group&#xD;
      psychotherapy. All patients will also receive fMRI brain scans before and after the therapy,&#xD;
      as well as assessment interviews before, at 8 weeks, and immediately post-therapy, and at 3&#xD;
      mo and 6 mo follow-ups. Saliva cortisol and measures of attention will also be obtained at&#xD;
      each assessment.&#xD;

      Background: &quot;Mindfulness meditation&quot; is an ancient &quot;Mind-Body&quot; attentional technique for&#xD;
      cultivating present-focused, non-judgmental attention to sensory, interoceptive, emotional,&#xD;
      and cognitive processes. It is proposed to lead to a greater sense of well-being and&#xD;
      acceptance, greater cognitive flexibility, and better tolerance of painful and distressing&#xD;
      physical, emotional, and cognitive phenomena. Our group has found a model of emotional&#xD;
      meta-awareness leads to decreased amygdala and increased medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)&#xD;
      activation. Mindfulness meditation has also been suggested to work by volitionally altering&#xD;
      self-related cognitive/emotional processing to shift away from the predominate 'narrative'&#xD;
      (and potentially ruminative) mode to a more 'experiential', present-centered mode in which&#xD;
      arising sensations, percepts, emotions, and cognitions can be perceived with greater&#xD;
      equanimity and flexibility. Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is helpful for coping&#xD;
      with chronic pain, fibromyalgia, and distress and anxiety associated with major medical&#xD;
      disorders, and Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for preventing depression relapse&#xD;
      in patients. &quot;Compassion meditation&quot; is likewise an ancient practice for cultivating and&#xD;
      stabilizing a sense of pro-social, empathic, kind/loving and compassionate regard to one's&#xD;
      self and others, and in the Tibetan tradition, is based upon a 'foundation' of mindfulness. A&#xD;
      single small trial found a loving-kindness meditation improved chronic lower back pain&#xD;
      symptoms, and neuroimaging studies have found effects on emotional neurocircuitry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective/Hypothesis: We hypothesize that practice of mindfulness and Tibetan self-compassion&#xD;
      meditation by PTSD patients will lead to 1.) improvement in PTSD and other symptoms and&#xD;
      quality of life 2.) improved emotional regulation, attentional control, increased&#xD;
      'mindfulness' and self-compassion, and 3.) strengthening of mPFC circuits during emotional&#xD;
      provocation. There are theoretical considerations and limited empirical data that mindfulness&#xD;
      and Tibetan compassion meditation may be useful for combat-related PTSD, which is marked by&#xD;
      exaggerated emotional responses and distress to trauma memories and cues, distressing guilt&#xD;
      and self-blame, and emotional dysregulation; however, the acceptability and efficacy of&#xD;
      mindfulness and Tibetan compassion meditation not been demonstrated in combat PTSD. A pilot&#xD;
      study at the Ann Arbor VA PTSD Clinic adapted a psychotherapy using mindfulness meditation,&#xD;
      mindful stretching exercises, and Tibetan compassion meditation for use in combat PTSD, and&#xD;
      found significant reductions in 'avoidant' PTSD symptoms and self-blame cognitions compared&#xD;
      to a treatment-as-usual group. Importantly, we were also able to identify some obstacles to&#xD;
      acceptability that have provided our group with greater insight and experience into how to&#xD;
      acceptably and effectively deliver meditation programs to combat veterans seeking treatment&#xD;
      for PTSD. PTSD neuroimaging studies implicate deficits during emotional provocation in medial&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (mPFC), associated with emotional regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Further develop a manualized group psychotherapy based on mindfulness and Tibetan&#xD;
      self-compassion meditation for combat PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Formally test our meditation intervention for PTSD in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Utilizing a 'translational design', perform a pilot study of fMRI neuroimaging to&#xD;
      determine the effects of meditation on neurocircuitry underlying emotional regulation that&#xD;
      may mediate therapeutic effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: We will develop a manual for our meditation incorporating input from&#xD;
      qualitative data from patients and an expert advisory board including meditation and PTSD&#xD;
      therapy experts. We will adapt a present-centered therapy group as a control intervention,&#xD;
      controlling for hours of therapist contact. We will randomly assign PTSD patients to either&#xD;
      meditation or present-cetnered therapy, with pre- post, 3 mo, and 6 mo follow-up assessments&#xD;
      with validated measures of PTSD and psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, &quot;mindfulness&quot;,&#xD;
      emotional regulation, and trauma-related maladaptive cognitions. We will also perform a pilot&#xD;
      study of fMRI neuroimaging to determine the effects of meditation on neurocircuitry&#xD;
      underlying emotional regulation that may mediate therapeutic effects. Validated emotional and&#xD;
      social cognition neuroimaging paradigms will be used to examine specific effects of&#xD;
      mindfulness meditation on mPFC and cortico-limbic neurocircuitry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: This research will examine the efficacy of a highly novel treatment approach for&#xD;
      PTSD, and also specific neural mechanisms of emotional regulation and how they may be altered&#xD;
      by effortful rehearsal of alternate emotion regulation and emotion induction techniques. It&#xD;
      may thus lead to improved treatment and understanding of therapeutic mechanisms involving&#xD;
      emotional regulation.&#xD;
