  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Celecoxib is effective for reducing postoperative pain in adults. Children use celecoxib more&#xD;
      rapidly than adults and require higher doses. Celecoxib is partially metabolized in the liver&#xD;
      by a certain enzyme. A person's genetic variation of this enzyme can influence how well their&#xD;
      body uses Celecoxib. Furthermore, Celecoxib down-regulates P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a drug&#xD;
      efflux transporter located at the blood brain barrier responsible for central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) extrusion of ondansetron and possibly fentanyl; therefore celecoxib may augment the CNS&#xD;
      effects of these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile of celecoxib in children and&#xD;
      the influence of genetics on metabolism would help to develop appropriate celecoxib dosing in&#xD;
      children for various treatment options.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Celecoxib is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) inhibitor belonging to the non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) class of medications. Adult studies have evaluated single&#xD;
      dose and short term courses of Celecoxib and shown improved postoperative analgesia. One&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) study suggested that celecoxib had faster clearance in pediatric&#xD;
      patients implying the need for a higher dose in children. Adult literature has reported Cox-2&#xD;
      inhibitor administration up to 10 times the typical dose without adverse side effects. One&#xD;
      adult chemotherapy drug trial involved high dose Celecoxib for a median of 8.4 months with&#xD;
      very limited side effects. Another study demonstrated that blood brain barrier (BBB)&#xD;
      permeable selective Cox-2 inhibitors effectively reduced central nervous system Prostaglandin&#xD;
      (PG) E2, (a surrogate marker of Cox-2 activity) concentrations and postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Celecoxib may influence CSF levels of various drugs, possibly via a P-gp regulation&#xD;
      mechanism. Brain uptake of drugs is limited by both an anatomic (passive) and a biochemical&#xD;
      (active) blood brain barrier (BBB). Metabolic enzymes and efflux protein transport systems&#xD;
      represent the latter; the best known group is the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein&#xD;
      transporters and best studied is P-gp encoded by the ABCB1 (aka MDR1) gene. P-gp actively&#xD;
      pumps drugs and toxins out of the central nervous system (CNS) and acts in concert with&#xD;
      detoxification enzymes to defend against cell damage. Celecoxib has been shown to&#xD;
      down-regulate P-gp expression. Ondansetron and fentanyl are substrates of P-gp and CNS levels&#xD;
      are influenced by its activity. Clinically, NSAIDs augment opioid effect and reduce nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting, possibly by preventing the CNS extrusion of opioids and ondansetron via P-gp&#xD;
      down-regulation. We will use peripheral blood mononuclear cells P-gp activity, as measured by&#xD;
      RT-PCR and ELISA, as a surrogate for P-gp activity at the BBB and correlate with celecoxib&#xD;
      plasma levels. Also, there are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ABCB1 gene&#xD;
      associated with pain and drug transport in humans (rs2032582, rs2229109, rs9282564, rs1045642&#xD;
      and rs1128503) and they may influence CSF drug levels including ondansetron and fentanyl&#xD;
      based on their associated drug efflux capacity or susceptibility to celecoxib&#xD;
      down-regulation. In addition, SNPs of the CYP2C9 P450 enzymes (rs1057910 and rs1799853) have&#xD;
      been implicated in altered PK of celecoxib in humans. Although controversial in children, in&#xD;
      adults they have been associated with &quot;slow&quot; to &quot;poor&quot; metabolism and increased area under&#xD;
      the curve (AUC) up to three fold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At our institution, children diagnosed with hematologic malignancies routinely undergo&#xD;
      general anesthesia for bone marrow aspiration/biopsy (BM) and diagnostic/ therapeutic lumbar&#xD;
      punctures (LP). Post intervention site pain may be associated with a post dural puncture or&#xD;
      atypical headache. Recently there have been reports of elevated Cox-2 expression in patients&#xD;
      with CML and lymphomas. Data suggests that the combination of Cox-2 inhibitors with standard&#xD;
      chemotherapeutics may enhance the potential of treatment for some hematological malignancies.&#xD;
      Access to blood and cerebral spinal fluid provide a unique opportunity to determine celecoxib&#xD;
      concentrations in the respective compartments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives are to determine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels (ug/L) of celecoxib&#xD;
      120-180 minutes following ingestion of a 14 mg/kg or 7 mg/kg dose of a 20 mg/ml celecoxib&#xD;
      suspension (Phase I) and to develop a pediatric CSF and plasma 24-hour pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      profile of a 14 and 7 mg/kg dose of a 20 mg/ml celecoxib suspension (Phase I and Phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a 14 compared with a 7 mg/kg oral dose of a celecoxib 20&#xD;
      mg/ml suspension will achieve a significantly higher CSF level (ug/L) of at least 15 ug/L&#xD;
      (equivalent to 50% of the COX-2 enzyme inhibition) 121-180 minutes post ingestion. It is also&#xD;
      hypothesized that adequate analgesic plasma levels will be achieved rapidly and tolerated&#xD;
      using these celecoxib doses. Alleles of the ABCB1&amp; CYP2C9 genotypes are predicted to&#xD;
      influence CSF levels of fentanyl ondansetron and celecoxib PKs and efficacy, respectively.&#xD;
      Specific P-gp SNPs are vulnerable to celecoxib down-regulation. The investigators expect that&#xD;
      Celecoxib will improve quality of life and reduce discomfort when administered before and&#xD;
      after a LP +/- BM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-phased double-blind randomized controlled study of sixty-five (65) children&#xD;
      aged 2-18 years in maintenance therapy for leukemia, who will receive a single dose of&#xD;
      celecoxib prior to a scheduled lumbar puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase I, twenty (20) children will receive either celecoxib 14 or 7 mg/kg 120-180 minutes&#xD;
      prior to lumbar puncture (LP). In Phase II, forty-five (45) children will receive celecoxib&#xD;
      14 mg/kg, 7 mg/kg or placebo in one of 5 time intervals, 1-24 hours prior to LP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug levels in CSF and plasma will be measured using established HPLC-Mass Spec techniques.&#xD;
      Pharmacogenetic data of the ABCB1 &amp; CYP2C9 genotypes will be determined. Patient follow-up&#xD;
      will be on Day 1 &amp; 7 after ingestion to document adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSF penetration of Cox-2 inhibitors may reduce the incidence of acute pain evolving into a&#xD;
      chronic pain model. The results of this study will establish the safety of this class of&#xD;
      medications in children and enable a more rational approach to their dosing in acute pain&#xD;
      models and perhaps future chemotherapeutic protocols&#xD;
