  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of AERAS-422 in&#xD;
      healthy, BCG-naïve adults.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomized, controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation study of AERAS-422.&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in 24 HIV-negative, healthy adults who are BCG-naïve and&#xD;
      negative for prior exposure to Mtb at enrollment. The study will be conducted at one or more&#xD;
      clinical research sites in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AERAS-422 will be administered on Study Day 0 as a single 0.1 mL intradermal (ID) injection&#xD;
      containing either &gt;= 10^5 to &lt;10^6 CFU (low-dose) or &gt;=10^6 CFU (high-dose). BCG Tice® will&#xD;
      be used as an active control for AERAS-422 and will be administered as a single 0.1 mL ID&#xD;
      injection containing 1-8 x 10^5 CFU on Study Day 0.&#xD;

    <description>Assessment of collected unsolicited and solicited adverse events (including site of injection reaction (pain, erythema, induration, ulceration, drainage, and scarring), regional lymphadenopathy (axillary and cervical), fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia and fatigue. The adverse event collection timeframe includes all events that occur up to 56 days after study vaccination. Assessment of serious adverse events will be based on events collected throughout the duration of the study. All safety data will be evaluated before moving into the next successive dose level.</description>
