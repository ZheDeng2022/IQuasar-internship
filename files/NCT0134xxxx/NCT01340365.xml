  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effects of Tai Chi-a mind-body exercise--on age-related loss of physiological&#xD;
      complexity (using fractal and entropy based measures), and to understand the relationship&#xD;
      between complexity, function and adaptability, we will conduct a two-arm prospective&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial. Our overarching goal is to evaluate if six months of Tai Chi&#xD;
      training, compared to a waitlist control receiving standard medical care, can enhance&#xD;
      physiological complexity and adaptability in older Tai Chi-na√Øve adults. Secondary goals of&#xD;
      the study are to characterize the relationship between complexity biomarkers, measures of&#xD;
      function, and resilience. This pilot study will inform a future more definitive trial by&#xD;
      providing information on recruitment and retention, compliance, dose-dependent effects,&#xD;
      preliminary estimates of effect size, and the optimal biomarkers of complexity, function, and&#xD;
      adaptive capacity.&#xD;

      Specific Aim #1: To determine if 6 months of Tai Chi training can increase complexity,&#xD;
      function, and adaptive capacity of multiple physiological systems in older healthy adults.&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: To determine the relationships between biomarkers of physiological&#xD;
      complexity, conventional measures of function and adaptive capacity. Statistical regression&#xD;
      models will be used to determine relationships, both at baseline and overtime, between a)&#xD;
      complexity biomarkers and measures of physical and cognitive function, and b) complexity&#xD;
      biomarkers and adaptive capacity. Elucidating these relationships will further inform the&#xD;
      interpretation of complexity biomarkers and provide insights into underlying component&#xD;
      mechanisms contributing to complex physiological dynamics.&#xD;
