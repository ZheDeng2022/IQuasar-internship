      PURPOSE OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the aesthetics (the appearance of the&#xD;
      implanted tooth and gums) as well as the soft tissue loss over a three-year period. This&#xD;
      study involves replacing a missing small front tooth with a dental implant, abutment, and&#xD;
      crown. A titanium dental implant acts as the replacement for a tooth root. An abutment is&#xD;
      made of titanium which is either gold or silver in color and cannot be seen; but may affect&#xD;
      the way the gum looks. An abutment is the component that attaches the crown to the implant&#xD;
      post. A crown (which acts as the tooth replacement) is made of metal and/or porcelain and&#xD;
      attaches over the abutment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dental implant and the abutments used in this study have been approved by Health Canada&#xD;
      and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of replacing the small teeth in&#xD;
      the front of the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The abutment is made in two colors (either gold or silver) and you cannot choose. For each&#xD;
      subject this is decided by chance. You will have an equal chance of getting a gold or&#xD;
      silver-colored attachment. You will know which color the abutment will be once you have&#xD;
      consented to be in the study and registered. You will know the color of the abutment before&#xD;
      the implant is placed. The abutment is covered by the crown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be in this study for about three years. There will be approximately 60 subjects who&#xD;
      will participate in this study in different centres, in Canada and the USA.&#xD;

        Subjects for this study will be recruited from the practices of the six study centers (Dr.&#xD;
        Caudry + 5 centers from the North American PEERS group) within a period of eighteen months&#xD;
        from commencement of the study. A total of sixty subjects (ten per center) of any gender&#xD;
        and race aged 18 and older will be accepted provided they meet the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
        criteria (see page 6). Dental implants for permanent tooth replacement are not indicated&#xD;
        for use in those under the age of 18. Vulnerable subjects will not be included.&#xD;
