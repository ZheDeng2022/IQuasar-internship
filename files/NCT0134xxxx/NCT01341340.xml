      The purpose of the ABSORB BTK Clinical Investigation is to evaluate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of the Everolimus Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold System (BVS) in subjects with&#xD;
      critical limb ischemia (CLI) following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the&#xD;
      tibial arteries.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. History of symptomatic critical limb ischemia (CLI) (Rutherford Becker Clinical&#xD;
             Category 4 or 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is able to take at least one type of thienopyridine (e.g. clopidogrel) and&#xD;
             acetylsalicylic acid (eg. Aspirin/ASA).&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have had a negative pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 14 days before treatment, must not be nursing at the time of treatment, and&#xD;
             must also agree at time of consent to use birth control during participation in this&#xD;
             study up to and including the angiographic follow-up at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions, and&#xD;
             has signed the informed consent form prior to any study related procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject must agree to undergo all protocol-required follow-up examinations and&#xD;
             requirements at the investigational site.&#xD;
