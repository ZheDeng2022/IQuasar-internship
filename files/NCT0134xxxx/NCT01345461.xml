    <textblock>
      As the critical care practice has improved over the last decades more patients are recovering&#xD;
      from intensive care therapy. However, muscle atrophy and neuromuscular dysfunction are&#xD;
      commonly observed sequelae after critical illness and are thought to play important roles in&#xD;
      the development of intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW). As a consequence, these&#xD;
      entities may contribute to the impaired physical function and prolonged convalescence&#xD;
      reported by ICU patients up to twelve months after discharge. Thus, strategies to counteract&#xD;
      muscle atrophy and neuromuscular dysfunction acquired during the ICU stay may therefore&#xD;
      potentially improve physical outcome and reduce the overall burden of critical illness.&#xD;
      Limited information is available on muscle function in ICU patients and to our knowledge no&#xD;
      muscle stimulation methods are currently available for evaluating muscle fatigue in large,&#xD;
      proximal muscles groups, such as m. quadriceps, in non-cooperating ICU patients.&#xD;

      Positioning of the subject: A special device, consisting of a rigid padded wooden board&#xD;
      resting on metal bar, which was attached to the metal framing of the hospital bed, held the&#xD;
      knee joint at a 90-degree angle and secured firm support of the entire thigh (Fig. 1). The&#xD;
      positioning was chosen to reduce unnecessary movement and minimize risk for mechanical&#xD;
      ventilated ICU patients. Isometric knee extension forces were therefore measured while&#xD;
      subjects were placed in a supine position in a hospital bed with a 30-degree incline of the&#xD;
      head and torso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical muscle stimulation: Two carbon electrode pads were placed distally over the motor&#xD;
      point of the medial (vastus medialis) and lateral (vastus lateralis) heads of the quadriceps&#xD;
      muscle. The motor point was defined as the location that corresponded to the lowest possible&#xD;
      threshold current and the motor threshold current was defined as the lowest train stimulation&#xD;
      current that resulted in visible muscle contraction. Another pair of electrodes (5x9 cm) was&#xD;
      placed 5 cm distal to the inguinal fold (10). To optimize electrical conduction, the skin was&#xD;
      shaved and rinsed before applying the electrodes. This approach was similar to previous&#xD;
      studies (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, two constant current high voltage stimulators delivered ten single stimuli&#xD;
      twitches with biphasic square pulses at widths of 300 μs. A train generator was then switched&#xD;
      on, triggering the delivery a 35 Hz current in bouts of 3 seconds periods separated by&#xD;
      1-second pause for a total of 40 tetanic contractions. In immediate succession to the tetanic&#xD;
      contractions a second series of ten single twitch stimuli ended the protocol. Figure 2 show&#xD;
      an example of an actual recording of the force response curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first experimental day testing current was adjusted to 75% above the motor threshold&#xD;
      current. On the second testing day, training intensity was determined as the stimulation&#xD;
      intensity corresponding to the same force output level (mV) as generated by the first tetanic&#xD;
      contraction on the first testing day, while maintaining the same ratio between the medial and&#xD;
      the lateral intensity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stimulation parameters and the two-channel stimulation method were chosen in order to&#xD;
      increase the amount of stimulated muscle mass, ensure a safe, tetanic contraction in the&#xD;
      non-cooperating subjects; to reduce risk of excessive muscle damage and to avoid recruitment&#xD;
      of sensory fibers and thus minimize discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Force measurements: A height adjustable strain gauge, placed beneath the bed, were secured to&#xD;
      the metal framing of the bed and connected horizontally (180 degree) to the subjects with a&#xD;
      non-extensible strap placed around the angle of the subject. To minimize leg movement a&#xD;
      second non-extensible strap were attached between the ankle and a fixed metal bar, pulling&#xD;
      directly opposite the strap holding the strain gauge. A bridge circuit was used to detect&#xD;
      changes in relative resistance in the strain gauge and transformed voltage changes,&#xD;
      proportional to the torque generated by the activated muscle, were then A/D converted,&#xD;
      sampled at 1 kHz and subsequently stored on a personal computer for further offline analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Off line data analysis All motor current threshold values were the average of two&#xD;
      measurements per side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tetanic contractions: To ensure attainment of plateau level of contractions torque values&#xD;
      were calculated as the mean of the last second of the 3-s contraction. Peak tetanic torque&#xD;
      values were the highest obtained value. The tetanic stimulation period was subdivided into&#xD;
      five intervals where interval 1 corresponds to the first 60 seconds (1-15 contractions),&#xD;
      interval 2 from 61-120 seconds (16-30 contractions), interval 3 from 121-160 seconds (31-40&#xD;
      contractions), interval 4 the first 120 seconds (1-30 contractions) and interval 5 to the&#xD;
      total period of 160 seconds (1-40 contractions). For each interval the resistance to muscle&#xD;
      fatigue was expressed as a Fatigue Index (FI) and calculated as the ratio between the sum of&#xD;
      peak torque values from the final three contractions relative to the sum of peak torque&#xD;
      values from the first three contractions. Furthermore were peak torque values for each&#xD;
      contraction plotted and the slope of the regression line for each interval calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twitch contractions: All data were 15Hz low pass filtered and peak torque and rise-time were&#xD;
      calculated before and after the tetanic stimulation period. For each 10-twitch series peak&#xD;
      torque and rise-time (the slope between 30% and 70% of the twitch peak force, Nm/s) was&#xD;
      calculated for the individual twitches. Both peak torque and rise-time were then expressed as&#xD;
      the average values of all twitches before and after the tetanic contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data integrity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care was taken to ensure identical study conditions and uniformity in regard to time of day,&#xD;
      location, equipment and procedure. Furthermore, all tests were conducted in a&#xD;
      temperature-controlled environment with a single observer assessment and measurements regime&#xD;
      maintained throughout the study. The same investigator (JBP), who was blinded to the&#xD;
      intensity level, determined all threshold values and MR conducted all on-line muscle force&#xD;
      measurements. To ensure optimal comparison between the two experimental secessions subjects&#xD;
      were placed in a standardized position securing uniformity of posture, joint positions and&#xD;
      orientation of the thigh. To reduce day-to-day variations in electrode placement on the&#xD;
      thigh, these were marked, along with at least three permanent landmarks, on a transparent&#xD;
      paper, thus serving as a &quot;map&quot; for a precise identification. On day seven the same&#xD;
      investigator (JBP) then carefully replaced the electrodes identical to day 1. On both testing&#xD;
      days, gauges were calibrated and each subject received a short standardized low intensity&#xD;
      familiarisation session prior to the testing procedure to ensure potentiation of muscle&#xD;
      tissue during which electrical muscle stimulation and the present protocol were carefully&#xD;
      explained. Left/right testing order was determined after randomisation with the same order of&#xD;
      testing maintained on the second experimental day. Subjects were instructed to be as relaxed&#xD;
      as possible and to suppress any voluntary contraction during the test. Finally, to ensure the&#xD;
      quality of the recorded data, knee extension forces were immediately displayed on-line on a&#xD;
      computer screen for visual inspection.&#xD;
