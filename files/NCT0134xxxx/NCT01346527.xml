    <textblock>
      Background: The health of the next generation is likely programmed in the womb (i.e.in&#xD;
      utero), and our understanding of how that programming happens will allow us to favorably&#xD;
      influence the health of future generations. The focus of this proposal is to examine the&#xD;
      effect of in utero programming on heart function in children born to women with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2DM). Specifically, neonates born to diabetic women have abnormal heart structure&#xD;
      and weaker heart function at birth, which may predispose them to long-term heart problems in&#xD;
      childhood, adolescence and adulthood. At present, the reason for these heart abnormalities in&#xD;
      children born to women with diabetes is unknown and is the focus of this proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective(s) and Hypothesis(es): The objectives are to examine the relationships among&#xD;
      maternal lipid (fatty acid, triglyceride, very low density lipoprotein) metabolism and&#xD;
      neonatal heart structure and function in diabetes and to identify clinical markers during&#xD;
      pregnancy for heart dysfunction in infants born to diabetic women. The overall hypothesis is&#xD;
      that maternal lipid metabolism is abnormal in diabetes, and this metabolic dysregulation&#xD;
      increases fatty acid delivery to the fetus in utero and leads to abnormal accumulation of&#xD;
      lipid in the fetal heart, resulting in altered neonatal heart structure and function in&#xD;
      infants born to diabetic women. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that decreased&#xD;
      maternal fatty acid oxidation (fat &quot;burning&quot;) rate, elevated lipolytic (fat breakdown) rate&#xD;
      and elevated blood total free fatty acid level predicts abnormal neonatal heart structure and&#xD;
      function in infants born to women with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Procedures: The investigators will test these hypotheses by using clinical&#xD;
      metabolism studies (infusion of stable isotope labeled fatty acid, serial blood and breath&#xD;
      sampling, and mass spectrometry) to quantify whole-body fat (fatty acid oxidation, lipolysis,&#xD;
      and serum fatty acid , triglycerides, VLDL-cholesterol levels) metabolism in 25 diabetic&#xD;
      women during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, and compare these lipid metabolism kinetics to&#xD;
      25 body mass index matched healthy non-diabetic women during pregnancy and determine if&#xD;
      alterations in maternal lipid metabolism predict abnormal neonatal heart function in children&#xD;
      born to these women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Impact: Type 2 diabetes is an epidemic in the United States and is steadily&#xD;
      increasing worldwide. Diabetes has detrimental health effects in pregnant women and in their&#xD;
      offspring. The investigators know that children born to women with diabetes have an increased&#xD;
      risk for developing diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease, than children born to&#xD;
      healthy women. This proposal will address an important knowledge gap regarding the role of&#xD;
      maternal lipid (and potentially other nutrients) metabolism on the cardiovascular health of&#xD;
      the global and increasing population of children born to diabetic women. Findings from this&#xD;
      project will be novel and innovative, and will likely point to clinical interventions that&#xD;
      target and correct lipid and other metabolic abnormalities in women with pre-gestational&#xD;
      diabetes. The impact will be great because the long-term goal is to ameliorate heart problems&#xD;
      in children born to diabetic (both pre-gestational and gestational) women. In addition, this&#xD;
      project will establish a small cohort of children that can be followed long-term to address&#xD;
      novel questions about the progression of heart and other metabolic abnormalities in children&#xD;
      born to diabetic women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: In the United States, there are approximately 1.2 million children born to women&#xD;
      with diabetes mellitus (DM) each year. This number is increasing due to the epidemic of type&#xD;
      2 diabetes and obesity in Western society. Infants born to diabetic women (IBDW) have&#xD;
      alterations in cardiac morphology and function, which may predispose them to long-term&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular health. At present, mechanisms for adverse cardiovascular outcomes in&#xD;
      IBDW are unknown. Abnormal maternal glucose metabolism in DM during pregnancy was previously&#xD;
      thought to affect fetal cardiac development. However, recent findings indicate that IBDW with&#xD;
      good 3rd trimester glucose control still develop cardiac abnormalities. In fact, other&#xD;
      aspects of maternal nutrient metabolism and partitioning (other than glycemic control) may&#xD;
      regulate fetal cardiac development. For example, abnormal fatty acid, triglyceride, and&#xD;
      lipoprotein metabolism are common in DM, and maternal serum lipid levels in pregnant&#xD;
      diabetics predict neonatal birth weight. The investigators propose that maternal fatty acid&#xD;
      metabolism is dysregulated in diabetic pregnancy. This increases fatty acid delivery to the&#xD;
      fetus and leads to fetal myocardial lipid accumulation, and altered neonatal heart morphology&#xD;
      and function in IBDW. To date, this has not been explored in humans. The proposal stems from&#xD;
      the &quot;lipotoxicity&quot; paradigm: chronic elevations in maternal blood lipid (i.e. fatty acid,&#xD;
      triglyceride, very low density lipoprotein) levels during pregnancy lead to increased lipid&#xD;
      delivery to and cause myocardial lipid deposition in the developing fetus. These lipids&#xD;
      displace glucose utilization by the fetal myocardium; the preferred fetal heart substrate in&#xD;
      a healthy pregnancy. Abnormal fetal heart lipid deposition and accumulation of lipid&#xD;
      metabolic intermediates (e.g. ceramide) may lead to myocardial insulin resistance and&#xD;
      contractile dysfunction in IBDW. The relationship between abnormal nutrient metabolism during&#xD;
      pregnancy and adverse cardiovascular and metabolic health in diabetes may be important in&#xD;
      other conditions such as childhood obesity in which this project could provide insight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: In 25 women who have pre-gestational type 2 DM and 25 healthy non-diabetic&#xD;
      body mass index-matched controls during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, the investigators&#xD;
      will address the following Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To characterize maternal lipid metabolism kinetics (fatty acid oxidation&#xD;
      rate, lipolytic rate, fatty acid clearance rate) and maternal and fetal serum lipid&#xD;
      concentrations (free fatty acid, triglyceride and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Women with DM during pregnancy will have higher whole-body lipolytic rates and&#xD;
      serum lipid concentrations, and lower whole-body fatty acid oxidation and clearance rates&#xD;
      than healthy women without DM during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2A: To examine the relationship among maternal lipid kinetics, maternal and&#xD;
      fetal plasma lipid concentrations, and neonatal cardiac morphology and function in neonates&#xD;
      born to these women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2B: To determine whether maternal lipid metabolism kinetics, maternal serum&#xD;
      lipid levels and clinical markers of maternal glycemic control alone or in combination can&#xD;
      predict abnormal neonatal cardiac function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2A:. Altered maternal lipid metabolism kinetics (higher lipolytic and lower fatty&#xD;
      acid oxidation rates) will be related to elevated maternal and fetal serum lipid&#xD;
      concentrations and abnormal neonatal cardiac function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2B. The combination of maternal lipid metabolism kinetics (lipolytic and fatty&#xD;
      acid oxidation rates) and serum fatty acid level will be superior to markers of glycemic&#xD;
      control (HBA1C and fructosamine) for predicting neonatal cardiac function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Whole-body lipid metabolism kinetics (fatty acid oxidation, lipolytic, clearance&#xD;
      rates) will be measured during clinical metabolism studies using stable isotope tracer&#xD;
      methodology and mass spectrometry performed in the Clinical Research Unit and Biomedical Mass&#xD;
      Spectrometry Facility at Washington University School of Medicine. Umbilical cord blood will&#xD;
      be collected at parturition and serum lipid (fatty acid, triglyceride and VLDL) and other&#xD;
      nutrient as well as growth-related hormone levels will be quantified. Neonatal heart function&#xD;
      (within 2 weeks of parturition) will be examined using 2D, Doppler, tissue Doppler and&#xD;
      strain/strain rate echocardiography performed at St. Louis Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Impact: Currently, nothing is known regarding the role of lipid metabolism in&#xD;
      cardiac abnormalities in IBDW. This translational proposal will address an important&#xD;
      knowledge gap regarding the potential role of abnormal lipid metabolism in the development of&#xD;
      cardiac abnormalities in IBDW. These associations are a critical step towards understanding&#xD;
      the mechanisms of cardiac morphologic and functional alterations in IBDW, in order to&#xD;
      identify clinical prognostic markers for cardiac abnormalities in IBDW, develop targeted&#xD;
      interventions for these cardiac deficits, and to decrease the future risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and heart failure in IBDW. The potential impact of these findings could extend not&#xD;
      only to women and children with pre-gestational diabetes, but to other children born to women&#xD;
      with clinical complications including gestational diabetes, obesity, intrauterine growth&#xD;
      retardation, and HIV.&#xD;
