  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have indicated that heart failure (HF) clinics facilitating patient&#xD;
      self-management and using multi-disciplinary care reduce in hospital bed-days, all-cause and&#xD;
      HF-related hospitalizations, all-cause mortality, and improve patient quality of life.&#xD;
      Additionally, national and provincial organizations have identified patient-focused homecare&#xD;
      initiatives in telehealth as demonstrating great promise for health service. Our pilot study&#xD;
      demonstrated the feasibility of the internet based vHFC and supports the investigation of&#xD;
      this intervention in patients with HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our single-blinded randomized trail is to investigate the efficacy of an&#xD;
      Internet-based heart failure (HF) clinic (vHFC) in 186 patients living with HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Participation in a vHFC emphasizing patient self-management and monitoring will result in&#xD;
      improved functional capacity compared to usual care in patients with HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Participation in a vHFC emphasizing patient self-management and monitoring will result in&#xD;
      improved health indices such as, self-management skills, quality of life, levels of B-type&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide and healthcare utilization compared to usual care in patients with HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objectives of the vHFC study is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish a cohort of 186 patients with HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the benefits of participating in the vHFC over usual care at 12 months with&#xD;
           respect to exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the changes in other risk factors and lifestyle behaviours between the vHFC&#xD;
           and usual care patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Consecutive cardiac in-patients of the University Hospital of Northern BC in Prince George&#xD;
      and of St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver will be screened for the Inclusion/Exclusion&#xD;
      Criteria. Those who meet the criteria will undergo the baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline assessment will include collecting information on social demographics,&#xD;
      (including age, gender, education level, and socioeconomic data) medical history, 6-minute&#xD;
      walk test, self-management and quality of life, fasting blood test, medication use, HF&#xD;
      severity classification, blood pressure, and lifestyle (physical activity, smoking status,&#xD;
      alcohol consumption). Following baseline assessment, patients will be stratified by sex and&#xD;
      randomized to either the vHFC or usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual Care Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to usual care will be given educational information explaining what&#xD;
      HF is, the importance of salt and fluid restriction, a form to log their weight and a list of&#xD;
      Internet-based resources.There will be no contact between the study personnel and the usual&#xD;
      care participants for the duration of the study, nor will there be any attempt to control for&#xD;
      the level of patient care. Participants will return at 12 months for outcome assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon randomization, a letter will be sent to the participant's primary care provider from the&#xD;
      study investigators informing them of their patient's participation in the study with a brief&#xD;
      description of the study and a copy of the vHFC Treatment Algorithms to indicate under what&#xD;
      circumstances the vHFC nurse and/or participant may contact them with regards to their care.&#xD;
      The vHFC nurse (a nurse with experience in chronic disease management) will contact the&#xD;
      participants' primary care provider to follow-up on the letter, discuss the intervention&#xD;
      protocol and preferred method of communication as well as to provide access to the website to&#xD;
      view their participant's progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given the same educational information as the usual care group and&#xD;
      registered to the vHFC website with a unique username and password. Common practice for&#xD;
      managing HF patients attending urban-based, specialized HF clinics is to have them weigh&#xD;
      themselves daily and report any dramatic fluctuations and/or increasing symptoms to their&#xD;
      clinic. The investigators have transformed this model to the vHFC such that each day,&#xD;
      participants will logon to the vHFC and enter their weight and answer six questions regarding&#xD;
      their current symptoms. Participants can also enter comments for the vHFC nurse in the text&#xD;
      box located below the questions. An alert will be generated if the participant enters data&#xD;
      outside of the desired parameters, does not enter their data for three consecutive days, or&#xD;
      enters a comment in the text box for the vHFC nurse to view. If an alert is generated,&#xD;
      following participant data entry, the participant is presented with a pop up window to inform&#xD;
      them that the vHFC nurse will contact them within 24 hours (or the next business day in the&#xD;
      case of a weekend or holiday). An alert will be logged in the vHFC nurse's 'inbox' of the&#xD;
      website and an email will also be sent to the vHFC nurse indicating that a participant alert&#xD;
      has been generated. The nurse will contact the participant by telephone to discuss the alert&#xD;
      generated and provide counselling. The participant is able to view a graphic depiction of&#xD;
      their progress at the same time as the nurse to facilitate the counselling session. At this&#xD;
      time a decision regarding what needs to happen will be determined using the Treatment&#xD;
      Algorithm. The vHFC nurse will then 'resolve' the alert and document the actions taken in the&#xD;
      vHFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants from the usual care and vHFC groups will return to the University Hospital&#xD;
      of Northern BC or St. Paul's Hospital after 12 months for a full follow-up assessment&#xD;
      (6-minute walk test, self-management and quality of life, fasting blood test, medication use,&#xD;
      HF severity classification, blood pressure, lifestyle (physical activity, smoking status,&#xD;
      alcohol consumption) and any adverse events)).&#xD;
