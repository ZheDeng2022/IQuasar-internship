      The current project proposes the comparison of two pharmacologic strategies as adjunctive&#xD;
      treatments for the improvement of HIV-associated neurocognitive disruption, additionally to&#xD;
      use of HAART. The investigators propose the use of the compound that has shown greatest&#xD;
      benefits in this context to date, the lithium, versus the use of a well-tolerated and&#xD;
      promising drug in other pathologies with neurocognitive affectation, such as Alzheimer or&#xD;
      Parkinson diseases, which is the rivastigmine. In those other diseases, this second compound&#xD;
      has recently offered a good tolerability, but also benefits on attention, memory and other&#xD;
      neurocognitive areas. Both study groups, patients on therapy with lithium and patients on&#xD;
      therapy with rivastigmine, will be compared to a control group, which will not initiate any&#xD;
      other treatment (therefore only continuing antiretroviral therapy). The investigators are&#xD;
      aware that this proposal will offer new relevant data for the study of neurocognitive&#xD;
      improvement in HIV infection, as well will allow a better knowledge of clinical management of&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients with CNS disease, an aspect that is a common clinical concern today.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adjunctive treatments based on neurocognitive improvement for HIV-infected patients with CNS&#xD;
      disruption have consisted essentially of neurostimulant or neuroprotective treatments.&#xD;
      Reports published to date have involved valproic acid, peptide T, CPI-1189, selegiline,&#xD;
      memantine, minocycline and lithium. Regarding valproic acid, two trials have confirmed lack&#xD;
      of benefit using this compound on HIV-associated neurocognitive decline. In case of peptide&#xD;
      T, CPI-1189, selegiline, memantine and minocycline, although their potential mechanisms on&#xD;
      brain follow different pathways, trend towards improvement on neurocognitive functioning has&#xD;
      been observed. Nonetheless, results on those trials are particularly based on a short term&#xD;
      and, moreover, mild connections with benefits on neurocognitive and functional measures have&#xD;
      been established. The lithium has been the compound showing clearest benefits on this regard.&#xD;
      Two reports have consistently demonstrated benefits on neurocognitive performance using this&#xD;
      neuroprotective agent, both in patients with HIV and showing impairment previously. However,&#xD;
      lithium is well known to be a drug not easily incorporated in routine practice, at least&#xD;
      further than in a psychiatry context. In addition, adverse events related to their use are&#xD;
      relatively frequent, and therefore clinical follow-up must be especially controlled. Besides,&#xD;
      lithium concentrations are also a concerning aspect considering its use, and drug plasma&#xD;
      levels are recommended to be performed throughout the therapy application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all these reasons, the current project proposes the comparison of two pharmacologic&#xD;
      strategies as adjunctive treatments for the improvement of HIV-associated neurocognitive&#xD;
      disruption, additionally to use of HAART. The investigators propose the use of the compound&#xD;
      that has shown greatest benefits in this context to date, the lithium, versus the use of a&#xD;
      well-tolerated and promising drug in other pathologies with neurocognitive affectation, such&#xD;
      as Alzheimer or Parkinson diseases, which is the rivastigmine. In those other diseases, this&#xD;
      second compound has recently offered a good tolerability, but also benefits on attention,&#xD;
      memory and other neurocognitive areas. Furthermore, in the case of this project, rivastigmine&#xD;
      is suggested to be used through a transdermal system patch, a fact that can provide&#xD;
      suitability and comfortability with regard to the selected administration method. Both study&#xD;
      groups, patients on therapy with lithium and patients on therapy with rivastigmine, will be&#xD;
      compared to a control group, which will not initiate any other treatment (therefore only&#xD;
      continuing antiretroviral therapy). The investigators are aware that this proposal will offer&#xD;
      new relevant data for the study of neurocognitive improvement in HIV infection, as well will&#xD;
      allow a better knowledge of clinical management of HIV-infected patients with CNS disease, an&#xD;
      aspect that is a common clinical concern today.&#xD;
