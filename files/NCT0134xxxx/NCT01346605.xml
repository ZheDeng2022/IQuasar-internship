      This protocol describes a study whose goal is to collect de-identified Cardiac CT Perfusion&#xD;
      (CTP) acquisition parameters and clinical findings from approximately 20 qualified medical&#xD;
      facilities. The study uses an electronic data capture tool to collect the de-identified data&#xD;
      to create a global multi-center registry. This registry will be used for scientific analysis&#xD;
      and publication of pertinent medical trends such as CT utilization, radiation dose, and&#xD;
      common cardiovascular findings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recently developed technique of Cardiac CT Perfusion (CTP) gathers information on both&#xD;
      coronary anatomy and myocardial perfusion in a single scan. This diagnostic test can detect&#xD;
      the presence of coronary plaque as well as assess the functional significance of a stenosis.&#xD;
      To date, it is estimated that 1000 cases of CTP have been performed in the world. While no&#xD;
      exceptional adverse events have been reported (nor are expected), the image quality and&#xD;
      clinical validation in a multi-center multi-vendor setting has been a marked issue for many&#xD;
      experts in this nascent field. This issue has hampered the clinical utility of this test and&#xD;
      raises concerns about its widespread utilization leading to unnecessary costs and exposure to&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, the rapid explosion in the use of a related procedure, Cardiac CT Angiography&#xD;
      (CCTA) started in 2004 and was marked by large-scale variation in radiation dose, quality&#xD;
      issues, inappropriate use, and interpretation proficiency. Critics of the rapid growth of&#xD;
      CCTA defamed the procedure for imaging abuse charges and noted unchecked and irresponsible&#xD;
      use radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of RECRUIT is to prevent this clinical inefficiency from occurring again. The&#xD;
      main goal of RECRUIT is to determine the best practices for optimal acquisition and&#xD;
      interpretation of the CTP images, in an effort to optimize standards before the inevitable&#xD;
      rapid adoption of this potentially revolutionary technology. RECRUIT will aim to maximize the&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness and minimize the clinical risks associated with CTP before the&#xD;
      protocol becomes integrated into the standard-of-care and harmonization of the best practices&#xD;
      is nearly impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUIT will enable select clinics that are currently performing CCTA to perform CTP by&#xD;
      training them on the latest acquisition techniques as provided by the field leaders in CTP.&#xD;
      In addition to providing the acquisition protocol, our researchers will provide the clinical&#xD;
      team with a sophisticated EDC tool that effectively monitors numerous factors that could&#xD;
      influence the quality of the images. Finally, RECRUIT will collect de-identified images from&#xD;
      the sites for analysis in our core lab. Analysis of the images will be correlated with&#xD;
      acquisition techniques and patient factors (i.e. BMI). This information fed back to the&#xD;
      clinical team that performed the procedure in an effort to improve their proficiency. This&#xD;
      process will proceed in an iterative manner, with all endpoints being tracked for reporting&#xD;
      in peer-reviewed literature.&#xD;
