      This single-center, investigator-masked, crossover study is designed to investigate the&#xD;
      circadian rhythms of aqueous humor dynamics in human subjects with ocular hypertension (OHT)&#xD;
      before and after intervention with a commonly used ocular hypotensive medication,&#xD;
      brimonidine.&#xD;

      Currently, the only effective treatment to prevent disease progression is lowering of the&#xD;
      intraocular pressure (IOP).2 Usually, clinical IOP measurements are performed during the day&#xD;
      with little information collected on nocturnal IOP. A recent surge of interest in nocturnal&#xD;
      IOPs stems from the hypothesis that significant glaucomatous damage may occur at night.4,5 In&#xD;
      response, some investigators have advocated particular classes of glaucoma medications based&#xD;
      on their nocturnal IOP effects.6-8 The most efficacious drug on the market may not be the&#xD;
      preferred treatment if it is ineffective at night. Therefore, the understanding of nighttime&#xD;
      IOP and the aqueous humor dynamics that control it has important scientific, clinical, and&#xD;
      commercial implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research on glaucoma medications has been limited to the effects of ocular&#xD;
      hypotensive drugs on 24-hour IOP or daytime aqueous humor dynamics. Few studies have&#xD;
      evaluated nocturnal aqueous humor dynamics. The investigators recently completed studies of&#xD;
      day and night differences in aqueous humor dynamics in patients treated with drugs from three&#xD;
      different classes that include a prostaglandin analog, a beta blocker and a carbonic&#xD;
      anhydrase inhibitor. The current study is designed to elucidate the physiological mechanisms&#xD;
      driving the efficacy of brimonidine, an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist, throughout the 24-hour&#xD;
      period, i.e. circadian rhythms in aqueous humor dynamics. Based on what the investigators&#xD;
      know of 24 hour IOPs this drug is expected to work well at night potentially by enhancing&#xD;
      uveoscleral outflow. This study will test this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In studies of new glaucoma medications the preferred study population includes ocular&#xD;
      hypertensive subjects. These people have high IOP but no optic nerve damage and no glaucoma.&#xD;
      They may be taking prescribed IOP lowering drugs for this condition or they may not. Those&#xD;
      taking ocular drugs are asked to stop taking them. Since glaucoma drugs affect aqueous humor&#xD;
      dynamics in different ways, it is essential that no residual medical effect remains from&#xD;
      these drugs. A washout period is necessary to remove all topical ocular drug effects. A&#xD;
      concern for patient safety exists when OHT patients are taken off of glaucoma medications, as&#xD;
      IOP may rise during the washout period. In order to monitor IOP in these patients, a biweekly&#xD;
      check of the IOP is made. If pressure rises above the ophthalmologist's preset &quot;target&#xD;
      pressure&quot; at any point, then the patient is removed from the study and returned to his/her&#xD;
      previous medical regimen.&#xD;
