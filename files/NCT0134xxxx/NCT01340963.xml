  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigated 100 subjects, both genders, with chronic Chagas disease, confirmed by&#xD;
      at least two distinct serological tests, and classified according to Los Andes classification&#xD;
      in a long term follow-up aiming at identifying the predictive value of the signal-averaged&#xD;
      electrocardiogram for cardiac death and ventricular tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects admitted to the study were submitted to clinical history taking, physical&#xD;
      examination, and noninvasive assessment, including blood pressure measurement, resting&#xD;
      12-lead surface electrocardiogram, 24h ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring,&#xD;
      M-Mode/two-dimensional echocardiogram, signal-averaged electrocardiogram in both time and&#xD;
      frequency domains. Selected subjects were further submitted to treadmill stress test and&#xD;
      coronary angiography to rule out coronary heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were followed by non-investigational primary care assistance at three to six months&#xD;
      scheduled clinical visits on an outpatients basis. Both noninvasive and invasive evaluation&#xD;
      during follow-up were requested at discretion of primary evaluation. Adverse outcomes were&#xD;
      ascertained by review of medical records and active contact to either study subjects or their&#xD;
      relatives.&#xD;

      Admission:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal prospective study, with a cohort of 100 consecutive outpatient subjects (34 to&#xD;
      74 years old; 31 females) with Chagas' disease followed-up for at least 10 years at the&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy outpatient clinic of University Hospital, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil, a&#xD;
      tertiary care center. Enrollment was from 1995 to 1999. Subjects were born in endemic regions&#xD;
      of Minas Gerais, Goias or Bahia States of Brazil and Chagas' disease was diagnosed on basis&#xD;
      of two positive serum tests, hemagglutination cruzipain-ELISA and indirect&#xD;
      immunofluorescence. All subjects were referred to the arrhythmia for risk stratification. At&#xD;
      the time of admission none had received nitroderivative therapy. Subjects were classified&#xD;
      according to the severity of heart involvement according to Los Andes classification, and&#xD;
      divided into three groups: class I - 28 subjects (group 1), class II - 48 subjects (group 2),&#xD;
      and class III - 24 subjects (group 3). Clinical and laboratory data were assessed during a&#xD;
      personal interview and review of medical records. On admission, all subjects were in New York&#xD;
      Heart Association functional class I or II, had normal sinus rhythm and normal PR intervals.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria at initial enrollment were: any degree of atrioventricular block or&#xD;
      non-sinus rhythm, previous documented acute coronary events (unstable angina or myocardial&#xD;
      infarction), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatic valvular heart disease, alcohol&#xD;
      addiction, thyroid dysfunction or abnormal serum electrolytes. Treadmill stress test and/or&#xD;
      coronary artery angiogram were indicated in selected subjects to rule out concomitant&#xD;
      coronary artery disease. World Health Organization and Helsinki Treaty regulations reviewed&#xD;
      in Venice (1983) were followed and all subjects provided informed consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects have been followed-up by the same team of physicians. Medical visits have been&#xD;
      scheduled at the outpatient clinics in a three to six-month interval. Medications were&#xD;
      prescribed at the discretion of the physician who performed the primary evaluation. Body&#xD;
      weight varied &lt;2 kg during follow-up, and serum potassium varied from 3.5 to 5&#xD;
      milliequivalent/L. Mild systemic arterial hypertension (systolic arterial pressure ranging&#xD;
      from 140 mmHg and 155 mmHg, or diastolic arterial pressure ranging from 90 mmHg and 105 mmHg)&#xD;
      was observed in 41% of the subjects and all received anti-hypertensive medication (converting&#xD;
      enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, vasodilators and/or beta-blockers) at the discretion of the&#xD;
      physician who performed the primary evaluation in order to reduce blood pressure levels to&#xD;
      less than 140/90 mmHg. All regularly followed at scheduled clinical visits. The endpoints&#xD;
      were described elsewhere in this registry. All causes of adverse events were ascertained by&#xD;
      active search of relatives and review of the medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting surface 12-lead ECG and plain chest roentgenogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, standard resting 12-lead ECGs were recorded in the supine position (with&#xD;
      simultaneous 3-lead acquisition) with a Cardimax ECAPS 12 2000 Compliant Electrocardiograph&#xD;
      (Nihon-Kohden Co, Tokyo, Japan). Electrocardiographic abnormalities were classified according&#xD;
      to standard criteria for conduction disturbances (intraventricular and atrioventricular),&#xD;
      chamber overload, and abnormal Q waves [11]. The electrocardiographic variables assessed is&#xD;
      sinus rhythm were: maximum P-wave duration and PR interval (typically in lead II), QRS&#xD;
      complex duration (the longest ventricular duration in precordial leads), maximal absolute QRS&#xD;
      complex in any precordial lead, presence of bundle branch block and/or left fascicular-block,&#xD;
      presence of abnormal Q waves (Q-wave, defined as the first QRS deflection &gt;1-mm deep and&#xD;
      &gt;0.04-ms wide), and left atrial overload (P-wave duration in lead II &gt;110 ms or Morris index&#xD;
      in V1 &gt;4 millivolt.ms). In antero-septal leads (V1, V2 and V3) and in inferior leads (L2, L3&#xD;
      and aVF) the presence of Q-wave in two out of three leads was considered abnormal. An&#xD;
      independent observer blind to the study analyzed the electrocardiographic records that were&#xD;
      automatically obtained from electrocardiograph equipment. Subsequent 12-lead resting ECGs&#xD;
      were recorded at each clinical visit in order to assess cardiac rhythm during follow-up.&#xD;
      Plain chest roentgenogram was carried out on the same day and cardiomegaly was defined by a&#xD;
      cardiothoracic ratio of more than 0.50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      M-mode/2-D Echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiograms were performed using an Apogee CX-200 equipment&#xD;
      (ATL, Bothell, Washington, USA) with a 4-megahertz broadband transducer. The echocardiograms&#xD;
      were analyzed by a trained observer blinded to the study protocol Echocardiographic&#xD;
      parameters were assessed according to standard procedures of the Section of Echocardiography&#xD;
      of the Department of Cardiology, with special care taken to detect left ventricular apical&#xD;
      aneurysms. The echocardiographic parameters assessed were left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
      (LVEF) calculated by the teichholz method, left atrial diameter (LAD), presence of pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial hypertension (defined as maximal pulmonary arterial pressure &gt; 30 mmHg, diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction, and the presence of an apical aneurysm. Normal cut-off value for LVEF was&#xD;
      defined as &gt;50%. Routine echocardiograms were performed in order to track changes in LVEF&#xD;
      during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24h Ambulatory ECG Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring was performed using a three-channel&#xD;
      DMS-cassette-tape recorder and carefully analyzed using the Del-Mar Avionics StrataScan&#xD;
      System (Del Mar Avionics, Irvine, California, USA) by a trained observer blind to the study&#xD;
      in order to assess the presence of ventricular arrhythmia and atrioventricular conduction&#xD;
      disturbances. Variables assessed in the 24h ambulatory ECG were: i) isolated premature&#xD;
      supraventricular contractions ii) nonsustained supraventricular tachycardia defined as a&#xD;
      sequence of three of more supraventricular ectopic beats, iii) isolated premature ventricular&#xD;
      contractions, and iv) ventricular tachycardia episodes (defined as: heart rate &gt;100 bpm, QRS&#xD;
      duration &gt;120 ms, three or more consecutive ventricular complexes, and atrial-ventricular&#xD;
      dissociation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard-deviation of all consecutive normal interbeat intervals in 24h (24h SDNN) was&#xD;
      employed to assess heart rate variability. Normal cut-off point was defined at &gt;=100ms.&#xD;
      During follow-up, 24h ambulatory ECG were performed at the discretion of attending&#xD;
      physician's judgment in order to assess cardiac rhythm and arrhythmia. One trained specialist&#xD;
      blind to Los Andes classification groups analyzed all tape recordings immediately after their&#xD;
      acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signal-averaged electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) was employed to asses the presence of both&#xD;
      ventricular late potentials and intraventricular electrical transients (IVET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAECG was acquired in sinus rhythm with a Predictor-IIc equipment (ART Inc., Fitchburg,&#xD;
      Massachusetts, USA) using modified XYZ Frank orthogonal leads and QRS-triggered&#xD;
      coherent-averaged up to the noise level of 0.3 microvolt. SAECGs were analyzed in both time&#xD;
      and frequency domains by an independent observer blinded to the study patients information.&#xD;
      After signal average ECG acquisition, time domain analysis was carried out on vector&#xD;
      magnitude (VM), using a bidirectional 4th order 40 Hz to 250 Hz band-pass Butterworth filter.&#xD;
      The variables extracted from VM were: duration of VM (DUR [ms]), root-mean-squared voltage of&#xD;
      last 40ms of VM (RMS40[microvolt]) duration of potentials below 40 microvolt at the terminal&#xD;
      portion of VM (LAS40[ms]). Due to the presence of bundle branch block as a common finding in&#xD;
      Chagas disease, normal cut-off point for DUR was defined at &gt;150ms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The onset and offset points of VM delimited the analytic region for frequency domain&#xD;
      analysis, by using the spectral turbulence analysis approach. The analytic region in VM was&#xD;
      preprocessed to extract the first derivative, aiming at removing the high-amplitude&#xD;
      low-frequency components. The derived signal was cut into slices to build a power spectral&#xD;
      density time-frequency map by applying the short-time Fourier transform. Each data segment&#xD;
      was limited in 25 ms, with 2 ms interval between successive segments to assure adequate&#xD;
      time-resolution, tapered by a Blackmann-Harris window after mean removal, and zero-padded to&#xD;
      64 points. After Fourier transform of a particular segment, its spectral amplitude was&#xD;
      squared to obtain the estimated power spectral density function. Successive power spectral&#xD;
      density function estimates in the analytic region were attached in a three-dimensional map.&#xD;
      The boundaries of the analytic region (up to 200 ms duration) were placed 25 ms prior to the&#xD;
      onset of the VM and to a point on the ST segment 50 ms after the offset of the VM. In the&#xD;
      time frequency map, spectral turbulence was studied by comparing sequential spectral&#xD;
      estimates. We calculated Pearson's correlation coefficient between adjacent power spectral&#xD;
      function estimates throughout ventricular activation, and deployed the correlation&#xD;
      coefficients in a time series, of which the mean and the standard deviation of the&#xD;
      intersegment spectral correlation (abbreviated as MSC and SSC, respectively) were calculated.&#xD;
      Additionally, we calculated the frequency corresponding to 80% of the total area under a&#xD;
      particular power spectral function estimate, starting at zero Hz, which practically&#xD;
      represented the edge or the border, and deployed the edge frequency, thus calculated, in a&#xD;
      time series. The mean and the standard deviation of the electrical transients (abbreviated as&#xD;
      MET and SET, respectively) of the edge frequency series were extracted. Power spectral&#xD;
      estimates were limited to the range from 0 to 300 Hz in order to avoid interference of high&#xD;
      frequency noise during correlation. MSC and SSC were multiplied by 100 to simplify&#xD;
      calculations. Normality threshold values have been defined previously as MSC&gt;94, SSC&lt;=6,&#xD;
      MET&lt;=78 and The SET&lt;=31. The presence of intraventricular electrical transients (IVET+) was&#xD;
      optimally defined when 2 out of 4 variables were outside normality range. We used the above&#xD;
      method based on our hypothesis that the presence of high frequency electrical transients,&#xD;
      representing underlying electrically unstable myocardial areas, would determine the reduction&#xD;
      of intersegment correlation. Likewise, high frequency transients would increase the energy&#xD;
      content of a spectral estimate and the shift the spectral border rightward, to a higher&#xD;
      frequency.&#xD;
