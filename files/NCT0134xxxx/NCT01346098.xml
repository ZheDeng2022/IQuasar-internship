  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposal is to demonstrate that, in patients with disease of the pancreatic&#xD;
      head with very high-risk of complications of pancreatojejunal reconstruction (soft pancreas&#xD;
      and pancreatic duct diameter &lt;3 mm), total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation&#xD;
      (IAT) is associated with a lower morbidity (in terms of surgical or medical complications)&#xD;
      and mortality compared with pancreaticoduodenectomy and pancreatojejunal anastomosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complications of the pancreatic anastomosis still represents a significant risk for death&#xD;
      after the resection of the pancreatic head. In an effort to decrease morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      the referral of patients who need a pancreaticoduodenectomy to institutions (and surgeons)&#xD;
      performing a high volume of this surgical procedure has been championed. Nonetheless, the&#xD;
      role of prophylactic medications and the best surgical technique(s) for the removal of the&#xD;
      pancreatic head are still debated. However, very few prospective randomized clinical trials&#xD;
      have been conducted to compare different surgical techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will address for the first time the role for preemptive total pancreatectomy and&#xD;
      IAT in selected patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy that are considered high risk for&#xD;
      pancreaticojejunostomy disruption (eg, small pancreatic duct, soft pancreas). The information&#xD;
      expected is the identification of total pancreatectomy and the IAT as the standard treatment&#xD;
      in a subgroup of patient with pathologies of the pancreatic head at high risk for leakage of&#xD;
      pancreatic anastomosis. Ultimately this project will lead to reserve more innovative cell&#xD;
      therapy for patients with the highest risk of anastomosis failure reducing pancreatojejunal&#xD;
      reconstruction related morbidity and mortality&#xD;

Clinical hallmarks of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency include symptoms of fat malabsorption, such as steatorrhea, weight loss and abdominal pain. Frequency of bowel movements and characteristics of stools will be serially recorded. Fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, E and K will be measured 12 month after the hospital discharge after the index surgery. Oral pancreatic enzyme supplementation will be prescribed according to the severity of clinical steatorrhea and weight loss.</description>

    <description>At the time of surgery the surgeon will directly assess pancreatic consistency and the pancreatic duct size. In the presence of a soft pancreas and a small duct (diameter &lt;3 mm), the patient will be randomly assigned to receive either a pancreaticoduodenectomy with pancreatic anastomosis (group A) or a total pancreatectomy with IAT (group B).</description>

    <description>Standard lymphadenectomy, end-to-side two-layer pancreaticojejunostomy and duodenojejunostomy will be performed. If the pylorus is preserved, so will be the right gastric artery, unless the artery is damaged or hindering adequate gastric mobilization. No prokinetic agent will be administered routinely, but IV metoclopramide will given on demand (10 mg , three times daily). Prophylaxis will consist of octreotide (0,1 mg three times daily from day 0 to 7), low molecular weight heparin and a single dose of antibiotic (cefazolin 2 g). Early postoperative analgesia will be achieved by epidural or, when contraindicated, patient-controlled analgesia</description>

    <description>If the patient will be assigned to this group, the surgeon will complete the pancreatectomy preserving the spleen. The body and tail of the pancreas will be sent to the islet isolation facility. Islets will be isolated and purified according to the automated method described by Ricordi. The resulting islet tissue will be suspended in a cold isotonic saline solution and infused into the portal vein during the next 24h.</description>
