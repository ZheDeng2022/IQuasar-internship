    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation trial to evaluate twice daily dosing of the sachet formulation of&#xD;
      BEZ235. This trial will find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the sachet formulation given&#xD;
      twice daily, as well as evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of the twice&#xD;
      daily dosing. Patients will initially be given once daily dosing to determine the PK and PD&#xD;
      of the single daily dose. On Day 9, they will begin twice daily dosing, with half of the&#xD;
      single daily dose divided twice daily, and PK and PD of the twice daily dose will be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;

         23. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding or adults of&#xD;
             reproductive potential not employing an effective method of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they&#xD;
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate&#xD;
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six&#xD;
                  months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol&#xD;
                  &lt; 20 pg/mL] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only&#xD;
                  when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone&#xD;
                  level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
                  becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and&#xD;
                  for 5 T1/2 (8 days) after stopping treatment. The highly effective contraception&#xD;
                  is defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
        subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation&#xD;
        methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy)&#xD;
        or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;
        reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Male partner sterilization: (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the&#xD;
        absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male&#xD;
        partner should be the sole partner for that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault&#xD;
             caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as BEZ235&#xD;
        potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test ≤&#xD;
             72 hours prior to initiating treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving offspring&#xD;
             must use condom during treatment, for 5 T1/2 (8 days) after stopping treatment and for&#xD;
             additional 12 weeks (3 months in total after study drug discontinuation) and should&#xD;
             not father a child in this period.&#xD;
