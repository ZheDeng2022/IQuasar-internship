  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy individuals with type 2 diabetes will receive intensive counseling on food selection&#xD;
      to improve glucose control using either high cereal fiber dietary strategies or low glycemic&#xD;
      index foods especially canola oil containing bread. The treatments will last 3 months with&#xD;
      bloods taken for HbA1c, glucose and blood lipids. If the study shows a benefit for either or&#xD;
      both diets, then use of high fiber, and/or low glycemic index foods with canola oil, may&#xD;
      provide another potential way to improve glucose control and lower cholesterol levels in&#xD;
      non-insulin dependent diabetes.&#xD;

      Overall design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size justification: The sample size requirement was determined based on the&#xD;
           ability to detect a HbA1c reduction of at least 0.4 units, significance of the test (α)&#xD;
           of 0.05, β of 2 and power (1-β) of 0.80 (The FDA criterion for drug effectiveness is a&#xD;
           HbA1c reduction of 0.3 to 0.4 units). Examination of recent study results for HbA1c of&#xD;
           the research group on type 2 diabetic subjects indicated a standard deviation of 0.32.&#xD;
           So the desired total number to complete this study is N=80, or 120 enrolled assuming a&#xD;
           30% attrition rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design: All subjects will be randomized to one of two 12-week treatments in a&#xD;
           two-treatment parallel design. Treatments: 1) low glycemic index dietary advice (e.g. to&#xD;
           eat intact grain cereals, Pita Break Finland Rye and Little Stream Quinoa breads,&#xD;
           parboiled rice, cracked wheat, pasta, peas, beans, lentils, and baked goods made from&#xD;
           legume flour), with particular emphasis on a canola oil containing bread; and a 2) high&#xD;
           cereal fiber diet emphasizing whole grains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: The study will consist of approximately two months recruitment and patient&#xD;
      selection, and a 3 month treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Details: Fasting blood samples are obtained at screening, week -2, 0, 2, 4, 8, 10 and&#xD;
      12 of each study period for glucose, lipids and oxidation products. HbA1c will be assessed on&#xD;
      all visits except week 2. Twenty-four hour urine for urinary C-peptide, isoprostane, urea,&#xD;
      creatinine and electrolyte analyses will be obtained immediately prior to the beginning of&#xD;
      the study and at the end of the 12 week treatment. At weeks 0 (baseline) and 12, endothelial&#xD;
      function will be assessed. Following the 12 week treatment period, subjects who wish to&#xD;
      undertake the alternate treatment will be given appropriate instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Setting: Risk Factor Modification Center at St. Michael's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants/controls (selection and inclusion/exclusion criteria):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Selection: Healthy non-insulin dependent diabetic men and women will be recruited by&#xD;
      newspaper advertisement, physician referral and the diabetic clinic at St. Michael's&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interventions: Diets: Diets will be the subjects' diabetic diets modified as above. Diet&#xD;
           histories will be recorded at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 10 and 12. These diets will be assessed&#xD;
           for consistency by the dietitian in the subject's presence. Where necessary,&#xD;
           modifications in diet will be made to ensure weight maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Privacy protection Subjects will have their data de-identified. Any databases with&#xD;
           personal health information will be password protected. Also, patient data that has&#xD;
           personal health information (e.g. patient charts) will be kept in locked cabinets, with&#xD;
           the door locked to the room with the cabinets, and the centre door locked after 6 pm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confidentiality of data All subjects will be assigned an identification code to ensure&#xD;
           confidentiality. All data entered into files will use the identification codes. Access&#xD;
           to data files will be limited to the PI, statisticians, dietitians, students, and data&#xD;
           entry personnel working on the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained from the Endo-PAT test will be sent to a private statistical consultant in&#xD;
      the United States for analysis. The dataset will be de-identified and only the statistical&#xD;
      consultant and the research team will have access to this dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Identifiable data Subjects will be primarily identified by a code (number and letter)&#xD;
      assigned by the study statistician. A separate chart with routine clinical information is&#xD;
      maintained for contact with participants' family physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Analysis method, including types of statistical or qualitative methods Results will be&#xD;
      expressed as means ± standard error. The differences between treatment means will be assessed&#xD;
      using the CONTRAST statement in SAS (Statistical Analysis Software) using -2 and zero bloods&#xD;
      as baseline to calculate change and weeks 8, 10 and 12 for the CONTRAST. Pearson's&#xD;
      correlations will be used to assess relationships between dietary compliance and weight&#xD;
      reductions with blood lipid changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Optional Sub-study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our recent diabetes study which looked at the effect of mixed nuts on blood sugar control&#xD;
      (REB# 06-274), 44.8 % (35/78) of participants continued onto follow-up and 24% (19/78)&#xD;
      completed follow-up. All crossed from either the muffin (control) or half dose nut supplement&#xD;
      to the full dose nut (test) supplement. In a recent Portfolio study (REB#04-056), after 24&#xD;
      weeks 62.5% of participants crossed from DASH diet (control) to Portfolio diet (test).&#xD;
      Assuming that in this study participants will also cross from the control diet to the test&#xD;
      diet, we will use a paired t-test with no adjustment for baseline or sequence, as this is not&#xD;
      a true crossover design.&#xD;
