      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is known to serve a number of functions in the knee joint.&#xD;
      Besides providing mechanical stability, it also contributes to proprioceptive function.&#xD;
      Numerous studies reported ACL is rich in mechanoreceptors contribute in proprioceptive&#xD;
      function. ACL augmentation, or selective ACL bundle (AM, anteromedial or PL, posterolateral)&#xD;
      reconstruction, a relatively new technique for partial torn ACL, preserves and augments the&#xD;
      ACL remnant aiming at maintaining or facilitating proprioception, is now gaining its&#xD;
      popularity. Preserving ACL stump is also reported to have merits in providing better&#xD;
      mechanical protection and promoting revascularization to the newly reconstructed graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In local setting, stump preserving ACL surgery is the usual practice in handling partial ACL&#xD;
      tear. With the background of the surgery's potential benefits in restoration of knee&#xD;
      function, a single-blinded, comparative study on the difference in proprioception, postural&#xD;
      stability and clinical outcome between stump preserving ACL surgery and reconstruction is&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is well known to be the knee's primary stabilizer which&#xD;
      would be compromised by ligamentous injury, causing various functional deficits. Currently,&#xD;
      ACL reconstruction is the common management focus on restoration of stability. Beside joint&#xD;
      stabilization, proprioception, defined as the system of joint position sense and movement, is&#xD;
      another function of the ACL which has also been widely studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proprioceptive function of human ACL has been recognized since the 1980's. The first&#xD;
      study by described the presence of mechanoreceptors in human ACL fibres. Study further proved&#xD;
      that ACL is extensively innervated with neural elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies reported ACL is rich in mechanoreceptors which contribute in proprioceptive&#xD;
      function. One study on 29 ACL remnant reported that there are mechanoreceptors including&#xD;
      Ruffini, Pacini receptors, Golgi tendon organ-like receptors and free nerves endings in the&#xD;
      remnant and showed the numbers of mechanoreceptors is significantly related to joint sense&#xD;
      accuracy. Another study performed by same group of researchers reported that a somatosensory&#xD;
      evoked potential could be recorded in ACL remnants after electrical stimulation, confirmed&#xD;
      original sensory neurons are preserved to certain extent, which may help graft neuralization&#xD;
      and restoration of knee function. This further echos with various studies that, in&#xD;
      ACL-deficit knee, loss of proprioceptive function is reported with corelation to the number&#xD;
      of mechanoreceptors. At a result, it comes up with an idea that preserving the ACL remnant&#xD;
      should help maintaining or facilitating proprioceptive function, by the operation technique&#xD;
      of ACL augmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACL augmentation is a relatively new technique which preserves and augments the ACL remnant&#xD;
      using extra graft. Under arthroscopic examination, if any of the ACL bundles, anteromedial&#xD;
      (AM) and posterolateral (PL), shows a partial tear remnant of reasonable size, thickness and&#xD;
      tension, augmentation may be performed instead of reconstruct the whole ligament. Instead of&#xD;
      removing the remaining stump, it would be preserved as much as possible, and a formal ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction would be performed. A commonly used graft is single-bundle autogenous&#xD;
      semitendinosus gracilis tendon. As the retaining ACL fiber contains mechanoreceptor&#xD;
      responsible for proprioception, it is believed that better knee proprioception and postural&#xD;
      sense could be achieved by preserving the ACL remnant. Also, better vascularization and&#xD;
      stronger mechanical protection is expected as native ACL fiber is retained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current management of partial tear ACL injury are mainly conservative treatment and&#xD;
      surgical treatment, including reconstruction and augmentation. For augmentation, the common&#xD;
      practise is to perform a &quot;Selective Bundle Reconstruction&quot;, that is to reconstruct the torn&#xD;
      bundle, either AM or PL reconstruction, and preserve the remaining intact one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical benefits of ACL augmentation had been reported by several studies. A study had&#xD;
      demonstrated good clinical results in International Knee Documentation Commitee (IKDC) knee&#xD;
      evaluation score, Cincinnati Knee Score and KT1000 in augmentation using autologous doubled&#xD;
      and tripled semitendinosus (selective AM or PL) reconstruction at 1 year post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An other comparison study between ACL augmentation (selective AM or PL reconstruction) and&#xD;
      reconstruction showed superior result in knee anterior stability in clinical tests, KT2000&#xD;
      and knee joint position sense in augmentation group at a 2-year follow-up period. This study&#xD;
      has demonstrated the post-operation comparison only and allogenic fascia lata graft was also&#xD;
      used in the control reconstruction group, which is not a common graft to be used in ACL&#xD;
      surgery in local setting. Moreover, as the assessment is performed at 2 years&#xD;
      post-operatively, the more immediate and early post-operative effect of this surgical&#xD;
      technique is still questionable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned above, ACL augmentation may has potential clinical advantages including better&#xD;
      knee stability, mechanical strength and proprioceptive function, yet evidence of the earlier&#xD;
      effect of this technique is still lacking, with joint position sense was demonstrated by one&#xD;
      study only. With the relatively new technique's popularity and potential benefit on&#xD;
      proprioception, it deserves more research on studying the difference in both the clinical and&#xD;
      proprioception outcome from reconstruction. Therefore, a comparative study on the difference&#xD;
      in knee proprioception and postural stability between ACL augmentation and reconstruction,&#xD;
      including early post-operative assessment is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In local setting, if the ACL injury is noted to be partially torn from pre-operative Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI), surgeons would try to preserve the remaining stump as much as&#xD;
      possible with a single bundle ACL reconstruction performed intra-operatively. In order to&#xD;
      make the current study result meaningful and could be generalized in local setting, ACL&#xD;
      augmentation is renamed as ACL stump-preserving surgery, which is the common practice in&#xD;
      local setting.&#xD;
