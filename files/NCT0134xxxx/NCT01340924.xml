    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this research project is to study the impact of preventive practices&#xD;
      on the T2D-related risk profile among women with and without prior GDM and their children&#xD;
      exposed and unexposed to GDM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a growing public health problem owing to its prevalence as well as&#xD;
      its high morbidity and mortality rates. The identification of high-risk populations is of&#xD;
      great importance particularly because the onset of T2D can be prevented or delayed by&#xD;
      lifestyle modifications. Among high-risk populations, women with previously diagnosed&#xD;
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at particularly high risk of developing T2D. The&#xD;
      success in reducing the occurrence of T2D among women with previous GDM could be achieved&#xD;
      only if appropriate preventive measures are undertaken. According to the American Diabetes&#xD;
      Association (ADA) and the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA), lifestyle modifications aimed&#xD;
      at reducing body weight and increasing physical activity are recommended and women are&#xD;
      encouraged to be breastfeeding their infants. Certain factors have been suggested as&#xD;
      determinants of behavioral practices in women with prior GDM including cognitive and&#xD;
      environmental factors. A better understanding of these issues is essential for developing&#xD;
      effective preventive strategies and possibly reducing the prevalence of T2D in the&#xD;
      population. Moreover, in utero exposure to maternal impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes&#xD;
      may increase the risk of developing overweight or diabetes in offspring. Since March 2012 we&#xD;
      thus test the presence of childhood metabolic alterations predictive of future T2D in&#xD;
      GDM-exposed and unexposed offspring and investigate environmental factors during the&#xD;
      postnatal period that are associated with prevention of metabolic alterations.&#xD;

        In order to avoid selection biases, we plan to recruit 450 women with a history of GDM&#xD;
        through administrative data from the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ) and&#xD;
        children of those mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We plan to recruit 125 women without history of GDM through mail sent to students and&#xD;
        employees of local university and children of those mothers.&#xD;
