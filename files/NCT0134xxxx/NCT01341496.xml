  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A tumor cell vaccine is an experimental cancer treatment. Cancer cells are collected from a&#xD;
      patient and then used to develop a vaccine. The vaccine will produce an immune system&#xD;
      response to help destroy other cancer cells in the body. Researchers are studying ways to&#xD;
      improve these tumor cell vaccines. One way is to add an adjuvant. An adjuvant is a substance&#xD;
      that brings about a stronger immune system response. ISCOMATRIX is an adjuvant that has been&#xD;
      used safely in other clinical studies. But it has not been studied with certain tumor cell&#xD;
      vaccines. Researchers want to find out whether a tumor cell vaccine with ISCOMATRIX, given&#xD;
      along with cancer drug treatment, is a safe and effective way to slow or prevent tumor growth&#xD;
      after tumor removal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To assess the safety and effectiveness of tumor cell vaccines given with ISCOMATRIX and&#xD;
      drug therapy after tumor removal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People at least 18 years of age who have had tumor cell vaccines developed from cells taken&#xD;
      from surgically removed tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood and urine&#xD;
           tests, and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be treated with cyclophosphamide (once daily) and celecoxib (twice daily)&#xD;
           for 7 days before the first vaccine dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive the tumor cell vaccine once a month for 6 months. They will&#xD;
           continue to receive drug therapy throughout the vaccine treatment. Patients will be&#xD;
           monitored with regular blood tests and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the first 6 months, patients who have an immune response to the vaccine will&#xD;
           continue treatment with the vaccine and chemotherapy. They will also have regular blood&#xD;
           tests and imaging studies. They will have this treatment for up to 24 months from the&#xD;
           first vaccination or until they no longer have an immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have followup visits for up to 5 years after the first vaccination, or&#xD;
           until the tumor returns.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer-testis (CT) antigens (CTAs) have emerged as attractive targets for cancer&#xD;
      immunotherapy. Whereas cancers of various histologies exhibit CTA expression, primary or&#xD;
      vaccine-induced immune responses to these antigens appear uncommon in patients with these&#xD;
      malignancies, possibly due to low-level, heterogeneous antigen expression, and inadequate&#xD;
      vaccination strategies. Because numerous CT antigens can be induced in tumor cells by DNA&#xD;
      demethylating agents and HDAC inhibitors, it is conceivable that vaccination of cancer&#xD;
      patients with autologous tumor cells exposed to chromatin remodeling agents will enhance&#xD;
      anti-tumor immunity in these individuals. In order to examine this issue, patients undergoing&#xD;
      complete resection of sarcomas, melanomas, germ cell tumors and epithelial malignancies&#xD;
      metastatic to the lungs, pleura or mediastinum will be vaccinated with autologous tumor cells&#xD;
      exposed ex-vivo to decitabine and radiation following completion of appropriate combined&#xD;
      modality therapy. Vaccines will be administered in conjunction with ISCOMATRIX adjuvant as&#xD;
      well as metronomic oral cyclophosphamide (50 mg PO BID x 7d q 14d), and celecoxib (400 mg PO&#xD;
      BID). Serologic responses to a variety of recombinant CTAs as well as delayed type&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to autologous epigenetically modified tumor cells will be assessed before&#xD;
      and after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To assess the safety of an epigenetically modified autologous tumor cell vaccine&#xD;
      administered with ISCOMATRIX adjuvant in combination with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      and celecoxib in patients undergoing thoracic metastasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically or cytologically proven or clinically evident sarcoma,&#xD;
           melanoma, or epithelial malignancies metastatic to lungs, pleura or mediastinum who can&#xD;
           be rendered no evidence of disease (NED) by metastasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status of 0 2, without&#xD;
           evidence of unstable or decompensated myocardial disease. Patients must have adequate&#xD;
           pulmonary reserve evidenced by FEV1 and DLCO equal to or greater than 30% predicted;&#xD;
           pCO2 less than 50 mm Hg and pO2 greater than 60 mm Hg on room air ABG; and be on no&#xD;
           immunosuppressive medications except inhaled corticosteroids at the time vaccination&#xD;
           commences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a platelet count greater than 100,000, an ANC equal to or greater&#xD;
           than 1500 without transfusion or cytokine support, a normal PT, and adequate hepatic&#xD;
           function as evidenced by a total bilirubin of &lt;1.5 x upper limits of normal. Serum&#xD;
           creatinine less than or equal to 1.6 mg/ml or the creatinine clearance must be greater&#xD;
           than 70 ml/min/1.73m(2) at the time vaccination commences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo thoracic metastasectomy using standard of practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Portions of the resected tumors will be transferred to the Thoracic Oncology Laboratory.&#xD;
           Cells will be processed to establish a cancer cell line.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following recovery from surgery and appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation,&#xD;
           patients will be vaccinated with epigenetically-modified autologous tumor cells&#xD;
           periodically over 6 months in conjunction with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
           celecoxib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic toxicities and delayed type hypersensitivity responses to autologous tumor&#xD;
           cells and serologic responses to a variety of CT antigens will be assessed before and&#xD;
           after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be followed with routine staging scans until disease recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As the exact set of comparisons and analyses to be performed will be determined&#xD;
           following completion of the trial, and will be based on limited numbers of patients, the&#xD;
           analyses will be considered exploratory and hypothesis generating rather than&#xD;
           definitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 80 patients will be accrued to this trial in order to obtain up to 20&#xD;
           evaluable patients.&#xD;
