      This study hypothesizes that renal transplantation candidates are diagnosed with significant&#xD;
      Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) equal with non-invasive modalities as with invasive modalities.&#xD;
      Therefore the investigators are investigating the ability of coronary computed tomographic&#xD;
      angiography (cCTA), myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS), acoustic CAD Patch and&#xD;
      combination hereof to detect CAD as defined by invasive Coronary angiography (CAG).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease is the leading cause of mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. After&#xD;
      renal transplantation one-half of all deaths are cardiac, usually in the first 5 years in the&#xD;
      presence of a functional graft. Because of this renal transplantation candidates are&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac pre-transplant risk stratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no consensus regarding which modality should be use for detection of CAD in this&#xD;
      cardiac pre-transplant risk stratification. CAG is known as gold standard but is a invasive&#xD;
      procedure with risk of complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to investigate the ability of detecting CAD as defined by invasive&#xD;
      Coronary angiography (CAG) by clinical examination, blood test and non-invasive test (cCTA,&#xD;
      MPS and acoustic CAD Patch). The investigators hypothesize that a single modality or&#xD;
      combination of these with high sensitivity and specificity could diagnose significant CAD&#xD;
      without the need of further invasive procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 150 renal transplantations candidate.&#xD;
