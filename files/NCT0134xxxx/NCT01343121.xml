      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cell and urine levels of Gemcitabine and its metabolites, 30 mins or 2 hours post infusion,&#xD;
      predict response to GemX chemoradiation at first check cystoscopy, 3 months from the end of&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>To test the hypothesis that plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cell and urine levels of gemcitabine and its metabolites, 30 mins or 2 hrs post-infusion, predict response to GemX chemoradiation at first check cystoscopy, 3 months from the end of radiotherapy. Gemcitabine will be measured in plasma by HPLC-MS using a published validated method. We have developed an assay for intracellular gemcitabine triphosphate which should determine levels in PBMCs from 10 - 15 ml blood. Response at Cystoscopy is measured as either complete response, superficial disease or muscle-invasive disease.</description>

          -  Adequate pre-treatment haematological and biochemical parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No significant co-morbidity thereby excluding patient from having radical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No previous treatment for diagnosis of muscle-invasive bladder cancer or other pelvic&#xD;
             radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child bearing age MUST have a negative pregnancy test prior to study entry&#xD;
             and be using an adequate contraception method, which must be continued for 3 months&#xD;
             after the study, unless child bearing potential has been terminated by surgery/radical&#xD;
             radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have given written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence of significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding which, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial&#xD;
             Any other serious uncontrolled medical conditions&#xD;
