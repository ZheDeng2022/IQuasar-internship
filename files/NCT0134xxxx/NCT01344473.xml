  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fixed dental braces are associated with the risk of developing White Spot Lesions (WSLs),&#xD;
      which appear as white chalky marks on the teeth. They develop as a result of the acid&#xD;
      produced by bacteria in dental plaque dissolving the outer surface of the tooth, known as&#xD;
      demineralisation. Recently, amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) stabilised by casein&#xD;
      phosphopeptide (CPP) has become available, and it is reported to help rebuild the surface of&#xD;
      teeth which have WSLs. CPP-ACP is available incorporated into a crème known as Tooth Mousse&#xD;
      (TM). While there appears to be sufficient evidence regarding the use of CPP-ACP in promoting&#xD;
      general remineralisation, for the first time this study aims to examine the use of CPP-ACP to&#xD;
      treat WSLs in post-orthodontic participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be run in the Orthodontic departments of Dundee Dental School and Perth Royal&#xD;
      Infirmary, both in NHS Tayside. The investigators will recruit a total of 80 participants to&#xD;
      the study. Clinicians within the orthodontic departments will determine when a patient could&#xD;
      be a potential participant of the study, and one visit prior to debonding of their brace, the&#xD;
      treating clinician will discuss the study with the potential participant. If they are&#xD;
      interested in finding out more, the clinician will issue the potential participant with the&#xD;
      appropriate PIL. There will be a PIL for potential participants over sixteen years old, and&#xD;
      separate PILs for those aged twelve to sixteen years old, under twelve years old, and for&#xD;
      parents/guardians of potential participants under sixteen years old.. The clinician will then&#xD;
      inform the PI/SI that a PIL and supporting documentation has been issued. There will be a&#xD;
      potential participant referral form, which can be completed to aid the transfer of&#xD;
      information to the PI/SI. Potential participants under twelve years old will be advised that&#xD;
      a parent or guardian must attend with them for the debond appointment, when written informed&#xD;
      consent (IC) will be sought from the parents/guardians by the Investigators of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once IC has been obtained, resting and stimulated salivary flow rate will be measured by the&#xD;
      Investigators or delegated member of the research team using a Saliva-Check Buffer kit (GC&#xD;
      Corp, Leuven, Belgium). The kit will allow observation of the quantity and viscosity of&#xD;
      resting saliva produced in one minute, and the pH of the sample will also be tested and&#xD;
      recorded. Participants will then chew a piece of paraffin wax for a two-minute period to&#xD;
      produce a stimulated salivary sample. The liquid component of the sample will be measured to&#xD;
      allow a flow rate in ml/minute to be calculated, and the pH again tested and recorded. The&#xD;
      buffering capacity of the stimulated saliva will also be determined by challenging the saliva&#xD;
      with varying amounts of lactic acid. As a lack of saliva would bias the results for the study&#xD;
      due to increased caries risk, and as saliva is essential for the hydrolysis of the CPP-ACP&#xD;
      from the TM, if the resting salivary flow rate is below 0.2ml/min, or the stimulated rate&#xD;
      below 1.0ml/min, then the subject will be excluded from the study. Participants will then be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to the control or the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject included in the study will have their WSLs assessed and categorised clinically&#xD;
      using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System, (ICDASii) (International&#xD;
      Caries Detection and Assessment System Coordinating Committee, 2009a), by ICDASii calibrated&#xD;
      examiners. Examiner reliability will be determined by scoring extracted teeth and teeth&#xD;
      validated by histology. Reproducibility will be measured using Kappa scores. All lesions on&#xD;
      the buccal surfaces of teeth will be included in the study. Intra-oral digital photographs&#xD;
      will also be taken of each participant in a reproducible manner, and the photographs analysed&#xD;
      by two different blinded ICDASii calibrated examiners, who will be recruited to the study&#xD;
      simply to score the clinical photographs. A colour standard (CasMaTCH; Bear medic, Tokyo)&#xD;
      will be used to allow colour matching of the images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group will receive TM crème to use daily. The oral and written instructions&#xD;
      regarding crème application will be provided, indicating that the crème should be applied to&#xD;
      all surfaces of the teeth, agitated (swished) for one minute and then retainers placed for&#xD;
      night-time wear as per crème application protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the control group will not use any crème in their retainers, but will simply be&#xD;
      asked to place their retainer for night-time wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At commencement of the study it will be recorded how long participants fixed appliances had&#xD;
      been in situ, and all participants and clinicians will receive a questionnaire to determine&#xD;
      their fluoride use, oral hygiene regime, diet and preventive interventions e.g. visits to&#xD;
      hygienist, topical fluoride application, during their fixed appliance treatment. The&#xD;
      participants dental records will be reviewed and any record of pre-existing developmental&#xD;
      defects of enamel or WSLs will be documented. Participants will be asked to score their own&#xD;
      perception of the appearance of their teeth, considering the presence of their WSLs, using a&#xD;
      validated Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be reviewed at 6 weeks and at 12 weeks. At both visits WSLs will be&#xD;
      reassessed and categorised by a calibrated examiner (PI/SI) using ICDASii. Digital&#xD;
      photographs will be retaken for analysis by other blinded, calibrated examiners and the where&#xD;
      appropriate, the participants will be asked to bring their tube of unused crème to be weighed&#xD;
      to help determine compliance to the study protocol. A decision has been made not to issue&#xD;
      subject diaries to determine compliance as evidence in the Orthodontic literature hasn't&#xD;
      found self-reporting of this type, in this area to be reliable. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      score the appearance of their teeth using the VAS again and subjects in the experimental&#xD;
      group will complete a questionnaire on acceptability, taste and convenience of using the&#xD;
      crème.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A transition matrix incorporating ICDASii severity and activity scores will be used to assess&#xD;
      the stability, regression or progression of WSLs between baseline and follow-up examinations.&#xD;
