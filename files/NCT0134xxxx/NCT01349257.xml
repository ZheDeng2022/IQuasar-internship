    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical study is to compare the lung exposure of the contents of the trial&#xD;
      drug after administration of the fixed combination between beclomethasone and formoterol&#xD;
      delivered via the new Chiesi dry powder inhaler in comparison to the beclomethasone and&#xD;
      formoterol delivered via the pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) using a spacer device.&#xD;
      To determine lung exposure, the treatments are administered with charcoal block.&#xD;
