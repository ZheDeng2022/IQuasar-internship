    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the circadian rhythm of serum and salivary&#xD;
      phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease and determine its' modification in&#xD;
      response to changes in dietary phosphate load.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In normal healthy individuals, there is a 12-hour and 24-hour circadian rhythm of serum&#xD;
      phosphorus (serum P) with a nadir in early-mid morning, a rise to a minor peak in the&#xD;
      afternoon (around 4:00PM), and a further rise to a major peak just after midnight. In a study&#xD;
      of 6 healthy male patients, Portale et al found that the 12-hour component is modified by&#xD;
      dietary P intake whereas the 24-hour rhythm in serum P is independent of the intake of&#xD;
      phosphorus. Additionally, this trial demonstrated a large swing in amplitude between peak and&#xD;
      nadir serum P in the normal healthy subjects (1.2 mg/dL) and also demonstrated a large&#xD;
      difference in mean 24-hour serum P with normal vs. high dietary P intake, however no&#xD;
      difference in fasting AM serum P results was observed. These findings may suggest the poor&#xD;
      performance of serum P as a biomarker of intervention aimed at P load reductions via&#xD;
      treatment options such as phosphate binders or salivary P-binder chewing gum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the circadian rhythm of serum phosphorus in healthy individuals has been described, no&#xD;
      data exists on the circadian rhythm of salivary P, nor has the circadian rhythm of serum P&#xD;
      been described in subjects with moderate kidney disease exposed to various levels of dietary&#xD;
      P exposure. In recent years, saliva has been found to be a good indicator of the plasma level&#xD;
      of various substances, one of which being phosphorus. Specifically, increased salivary P&#xD;
      excretion has been reported in patients with CKD. Daily salivary secretion volume ranges&#xD;
      between 500 - 700 mL/day, therefore salivary P has recently been established as a previously&#xD;
      unaccounted for source of phosphorus, contributing a conservative estimate of 366 mg/day and&#xD;
      2500 mg/week of immediately bioavailable phosphorus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a significant amount of data available regarding the utilization of serum P as a&#xD;
      biomarker of intervention aimed at phosphorus load reductions; however, minimal information&#xD;
      regarding the timing of phosphorus measurements (i.e. when serum P is assessed during a&#xD;
      24-hour period) is available. Wolf et al, have demonstrated that despite an 80% reduction in&#xD;
      urinary P with dietary P restriction and treatment with P binders over a 2-week period, there&#xD;
      was no change in serum P or in FGF-23. However, both biomarkers were sampled once every 3&#xD;
      days over a 2-week period without regard to the time of day. This suggests that single time&#xD;
      point measurements of serum P in patients with CKD do not accurately reflect phosphate load.&#xD;
      As such, it is plausible that mean 24-hour serum P, or mean 24-hour serum FGF-23 are better&#xD;
      markers of phosphorus load in CKD than single measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, there are no published indicators of 24-hour mean serum P in patients with CKD.&#xD;
      It is reasonable that either salivary P or FGF-23 might be optimal predictors. Therefore,&#xD;
      this study will examine the 24-hour mean serum P and its relationship to both single and mean&#xD;
      salivary P values as well as single and mean FGF-23 values in the controlled setting of&#xD;
      specific low, normal and high phosphate diets. This examination and further understanding of&#xD;
      mean serum P values and how they relate to the biomarkers of FGF-23 and salivary P with&#xD;
      variation in intestinal phosphate load will inform the design and conduct of future&#xD;
      interventional trials assessing reductions in phosphorus load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-center, exploratory trial in subjects with reduced kidney function. A&#xD;
      total of 9 eligible subjects with an estimated GFR between 30 - 45 mL/min ± 10% and 3 normal&#xD;
      healthy subjects as control will be sequentially exposed to three different Phosphorus diets&#xD;
      (normal, low and high).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study assessments will occur in both the inpatient (observation) and outpatient (clinic)&#xD;
      setting. A total of four observational inpatient days (Days 7, 12, 18, and 29) will be&#xD;
      required throughout the study. Serum, saliva, and urine specimens will be collected at&#xD;
      specified time-points beginning at the Day 1 visit and concluding at the Day 36 Follow-Up&#xD;
      visit. During the inpatient study visits, blood, urine, and salivary samples will be&#xD;
      collected every 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be provided with specific diets created using a 1500 mg P base diet&#xD;
      supplemented with NeutraPhos® to achieve the desired P load as described in the table below.&#xD;
      During treatment period 2 (Low P Diet), patients will receive an alternative low P diet and&#xD;
      additionally receive lanthanum carbonate 1000 mg with each meal to ensure a low dietary P&#xD;
      load.&#xD;
