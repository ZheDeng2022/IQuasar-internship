      Intend of use: A blood test for Cancer Associated Auto Antibodies (CAAA) aimed for better&#xD;
      diagnostic management of suspected subjects with breast pathology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description: Blood is collected form patients and serum is tested for the presence of&#xD;
      CAAA on experimental test kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of the CAAA test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population: The study population will include any women with suspected breast mass&#xD;
      detected by any conventional method, scheduled for biopsy, which will result with a&#xD;
      pathological verification of the suspected mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Population: The target population will be any women with suspected breast mass&#xD;
      detected by any conventional method, that today, is scheduled for biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structure: Subjects that will be enrolled for the study will be checked for the presence of&#xD;
      CAAAb, and the results of the CAAAb test will be compared to the pathology submitted by the&#xD;
      physicians in the participating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Total of 1000 samples, of which 620 samples will ensure at least 124 true&#xD;
      positive breast cancer subjects verified by biopsy, and 124 true negative breast cancer&#xD;
      subjects verified by biopsy. Additional 400 samples will be used for calibrations and&#xD;
      training sets.(Multi center study, statistical rationale provided below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Effectiveness Variables: The effectiveness of the test will be defined by the&#xD;
      specificity of the test conditionally that the sensitivity is not lower than a pre-defined&#xD;
      level of 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint: The endpoint of this study is to show that the effectiveness is higher than 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Sponsor: Eventus Diagnostics Ltd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Monitor: For each site a dedicated CRO will be appointed to monitor the clinical&#xD;
      trials. All data will be stored in a protected internet-based database, and any changes of&#xD;
      the data will be traced and recorded.&#xD;

      General Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the mutations of a normal cell that lead to a malignancy, involves changes in the&#xD;
      structure and function of the cells, it could be assumed that the immune system has&#xD;
      recognized some of these changes as antigenic determinates that should be responded against.&#xD;
      For many years, investigators tried to distinguish between cancer patients and healthy&#xD;
      population by the difference in specific autoantibodies level. In the healthy population, a&#xD;
      baseline of the amount of autoantibodies was determined, and the patient population had to&#xD;
      have a statistically significant higher level of autoantibodies. Many examples of this method&#xD;
      can be found in the scientific literature [example references - Naora et.al. (2001); mintz&#xD;
      et. Al. (2003); Korneeva et. Al (2000)]. The presence of autoantibodies in all population in&#xD;
      different levels made it very difficult to find these specifically discriminating antibodies.&#xD;
      To date, no specific autoantibody is distinguishing solely between healthy and cancer&#xD;
      patients (as opposed to autoimmune diseases, where specific autoantibodies can be found in&#xD;
      very high levels in patients only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our work assumes that specific Autoantibodies expression level should be altered in cancer,&#xD;
      and thus these differences can indicate the presence / absence of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this experiment protocol, we are checking for differences in expression levels of specific&#xD;
      autoantibodies of suspected breast pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future CAAA Test Intend of use - Identification of specific breast CAAAs, could provide the&#xD;
      clinician with additional immunological and antigenic information regarding the patient's&#xD;
      condition or medical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test major steps and components - The CAAA test is comprised of a blood collection and&#xD;
      processing step followed by detection of specific auto antibodies with an ELISA based assay&#xD;
      and a mathematical processing, with a subsequent classification of the results as &quot;positive&quot;&#xD;
      or &quot;negative&quot; for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population includes all women that are scheduled for a pathological or cytological&#xD;
      confirmation either by any kind of biopsy or cytology, prior to any anti-cancer treatment.&#xD;
      The clinical suspicion includes one of the following: positive mammography/US/MRI, and&#xD;
      suspected physical check. Final verification (&quot;true positive&quot; or &quot;true negative&quot;) will be&#xD;
      done in relation to pathology/cytology only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;true positive&quot; group consists of all sequential patients that satisfy inclusion criteria&#xD;
      and have positive biopsy results. The &quot;true negative&quot; group consists of sequential patients&#xD;
      that satisfy inclusion criteria and have negative biopsy results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent must be obtained prior to obtaining a blood sample from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be based on multi-centers participation. The minimum number of sites for the&#xD;
      study is 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All sites will be within Hospitals either in the surgery department or the relevant specific&#xD;
      unit which is responsible for providing care for the BC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same protocol and the same monitoring routines will be applied to all sites. All CRF data&#xD;
      will be submitted electronically through a dedicated and secured internet site, all changes&#xD;
      will be tracked. When performing the CAAA tests, the Lab/ Sponsor team will have no&#xD;
      information regarding the nature of the sample. This pathological information will be&#xD;
      provided for statistical evaluation in parallel to the CAAA test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Description - The current study is a single blind case-control validation study,&#xD;
      involving all consecutive breast cancer subjects having positive biopsy results (true&#xD;
      positive) and equal number of patients with negative biopsy results (true negative). The&#xD;
      purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the CAAA test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the study is defined as the specificity of the CAAA test for a pre&#xD;
      defined sensitivity of 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the sensitivity of CAAA test to show that it is not below the&#xD;
      declared level of 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the specificity of CAAA test in the new study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to known results of PPV of mammography in various populations we assume that the&#xD;
      study population will include about 30% of true positive cancer cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of today, large proportion of the suspected subjects was only diagnosed by final pathology&#xD;
      of the biopsy. In this study, the true positive and true negative cases (as verified by&#xD;
      biopsy) will be compared to the CAAA test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the hospital:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, an identified study subject has to sign an informed consent form, and her Eligibility&#xD;
      Form filled ,both should be bar-coded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' clinical information acquired from the patient's medical file, including age,&#xD;
      medical history and results of tests done leading to the diagnostic evaluation of breast&#xD;
      cancer will be recorded on the appropriate, bar-coded, pre-study case report forms. The&#xD;
      reports will be electronic via a dedicated and secured internet site, any changes in the&#xD;
      database will be recorded and will be traceable. A hard copy of the records will be kept in&#xD;
      the department. The study is anonymous and the Department will keep the name of the patient&#xD;
      without reveling it to investigators and to the study sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctor/ nurse/ phlebotomist will collect a heparin vacuum tube (about 8ml), label&#xD;
      (bar-code) them. The tube with the blood will be packaged in a double sealed container.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood will be transported at room temperature (18-25Â°C), according to the relevant&#xD;
      regulations, to the laboratory. Transportation time will be not more than 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood handling laboratory will collect serum according to the protocol, and the serum&#xD;
      will be kept frozen at -80, in properly labeled aliquots. The frozen samples will be sent to&#xD;
      the diagnostic laboratory for antibody tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the diagnostic laboratory ELISA based tests for the detection of Auto Antibodies relative&#xD;
      expression ratios, will be conducted on each sample according to the lab protocol . The&#xD;
      samples will be tested for antibodies levels for the antigens that have been identified on a&#xD;
      previous training set. All the data will be permanently recorded directly into a dedicated&#xD;
      computer. For each sample all antibody results will be put into the coded patient file. A&#xD;
      mathematical algorithm will determine if the sample is positive or negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Hospital, post biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-3 weeks after the biopsy, the CRO will collect from the patient's file the results from the&#xD;
      pathology lab and any other relevant information as to the nature of the suspected mass.&#xD;
      These results will be recorded on the dedicated and secured internet site and a printed&#xD;
      bar-coded CRF will be kept in the Department .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hospital will preserve slices from the suspected masses (either from biopsy or surgery)&#xD;
      for future immuno-histochemical or other studies to be conducted by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final pathology will be compared with the CAAA test results. The results will be analyzed&#xD;
      by a statistician with expertise in cancer population studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in this study are undergoing blood test, and only risks are those&#xD;
      involving in blood collection. As treatment is not affected by the results, no risks are&#xD;
      subjected to the patients participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study is being conducted with no link to the individual patient, there is no immediate&#xD;
      benefit derived from the additional tests run on the blood sample. Future benefit may be&#xD;
      derived from the development of the assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a blind prospective validation study, involving all consecutive&#xD;
      suspected breast pathology subjects being scheduled for biopsy during the study duration. The&#xD;
      purpose of the study is to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the CAAA test for&#xD;
      detection breast cancer in women scheduled for biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened for potential participation in the study, according to the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will include parameters of the clinical and pathological state of the subjects and&#xD;
      results of CAAA ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two goals of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test that the sensitivity of CAAA is not below the pre-defined level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the specificity of CAAA test. Statistical Hypothesis The main condition&#xD;
           determining the sample size is to validate that the sensitivity of the test is not lower&#xD;
           than the predefined level. The classification rule was established in such a way that&#xD;
           the sensitivity in the training set was 100%. We assume that the real sensitivity is not&#xD;
           lower that 99%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis: The sensitivity of the test is not higher than 95%. Alternative hypothesis:&#xD;
      The sensitivity of the test is not less than 99%. Data Management A database management&#xD;
      system shall be designed and maintained, including screen preparation, and edit check&#xD;
      programming. Pre-entry and post-entry quality control of the clinical data shall be performed&#xD;
      at each data entry center. All ELISA test results will be uploaded to the database via an&#xD;
      internet based interface, and will be locked against further changes. In order to change&#xD;
      ELISA test results, unlocking of the database requires consent from the local CRO, the&#xD;
      sponsor and the site physician. Unlocking will be done only by the webmaster, and will be&#xD;
      recorder in the tracing system component, and in a hard copy held both by the sponsor and the&#xD;
      CRO in the site.&#xD;
