  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the&#xD;
      drug AZD5099 after intravenous administration of single doses in healthy volunteers. The&#xD;
      results from this study will form the basis for decisions regarding the future development of&#xD;
      AZD5099 as a novel antibiotic for the treatment of serious infections in humans.&#xD;
