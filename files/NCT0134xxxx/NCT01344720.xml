  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, single-blind, parallel-group study will investigate the efficacy and the&#xD;
      tolerability of a combination treatment of etoricoxib (30 mg/day) plus controlled-release&#xD;
      oxycodone (10 mg/day) compared with a titrated dose of etoricoxib up to 60mg/day as&#xD;
      monotherapy , in patients with Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) who have not responded to the&#xD;
      starting dose of Etoricoxib 30mg/day. A common clinical question is that is it better to&#xD;
      increase the dose of the current monotherapy or to combine both treatments early on, in&#xD;
      patients who do not respond to standard start doses of NSAIDs like etoricoxib.&#xD;

             phantom limb pain from amputation); skin condition in the area of the neuropathy that&#xD;
             could alter sensation (for example, plantar ulcer); other painful conditions (for&#xD;
