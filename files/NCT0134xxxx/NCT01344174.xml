    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of glucocorticoids&#xD;
      in patients with HBV associated pre-ACLF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sponsor: Department of infectious diseases, Southwest Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication: HBV associated acute-on-chronic pre-liver failure(pre-ACLF-HBV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of glucocorticoids in patients with&#xD;
      pre-ACLF-HBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design: Randomized, open label study. Patients with pre-ACLF-HBV will be randomized 1:1&#xD;
      to One of the two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A)Dexamethasone 10mg were intravenously injected po daily for the first 5 days, in&#xD;
      combination with continued lamivudine 100mg po daily and traditional supporting treatments&#xD;
      for 13 weeks. B)Control group. Any glucocorticoids will be not given in all patients.&#xD;
      Continued lamivudine 100mg po daily and traditional supporting treatments will be given for&#xD;
      13 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients: Approximate number of patients to be randomized: N=200 (100 patients in&#xD;
      each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of study: Screening period: 3 days; treatment period: 13 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study: 30 months after first patient randomized, including an recruitment period&#xD;
      of 26 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational treated regimen:Dexamethasone 10mg, iv, once day for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant and Comparative regimen: Lamivudine 100mg po daily, traditional supporting&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of Efficacy Primary endpoint: the survival rate at week 13. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoint:①The levels of serum T-Bil ≤ 51.3µmol/L;②PTA &gt;80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures(summary): After signing informed consent and meeting screening parameters,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups as described under trial&#xD;
      design above. After randomization patients will be seen for evaluation at days&#xD;
      5,10,14,21,28,42,56,70,84,91.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Assume 1:1 randomization. The sample size is calculated for the primary&#xD;
      efficacy variable, the survival rate. Assuming the survival rate equals to: 90% for group A&#xD;
      and 50% for group B. 100 patients in each group are required to yield a 80% chance of&#xD;
      detecting such a difference when a two-tailed test is employed at the 0.05 significance&#xD;
      levels. Every eligible subject will be assigned with a randomization code and receive one of&#xD;
      the two treatments, according to the sequence of enrolled.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Duration of study: 30 months after first patient randomized, including an recruitment period&#xD;

&#xD;
      Investigational treated regimen: Short-term glucocorticoids treatment (10mg dexamethasone,&#xD;
      iv, once day for the first 5 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant and comparative regimen treatments: Lamivudine 100mg po daily, traditional&#xD;
      supporting treatments including: ①Transfusion of magnesium glycyrrhizinate injection (200mg,&#xD;
      1/d) and reduced glutathione (1200mg, 1/d); ②S-adenosyl-L- methionine (500 mg, intravenously,&#xD;
      2/d); ③Transfusion of human albumin (10 g, twice a week) and fresh frozen plasma (200 ml,&#xD;
      twice a week); ④Nutritional supplements and prophylactic therapies for various complications&#xD;
      being given.&#xD;
