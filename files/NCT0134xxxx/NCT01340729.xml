    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of TPI 287&#xD;
      that can be given to patients with metastatic melanoma. Researchers want to find out if TPI&#xD;
      287 can control the disease. The safety of TPI 287 will also be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Study Drug TPI 287 is designed to block tumors from growing by preventing cancer cells&#xD;
      from dividing, which may cause them to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be assigned to a study group based on when they join this study. Up to 4 groups&#xD;
      of 3-6 participants will be enrolled in the Phase I portion of the study, and up to 64&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patient is enrolled in the Phase I portion, the dose of TPI 287 they receive will depend&#xD;
      on when they joined this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose&#xD;
      level of TPI 287. Each new group will receive a higher starting dose of TPI 287 than the&#xD;
      group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the&#xD;
      highest tolerable dose of TPI 287 is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patient is enrolled on one of the earlier dose levels, and they do not experience&#xD;
      intolerable side effects after 2 study cycles, their dose may be increased to the next higher&#xD;
      dose level that has been shown to be safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patient has intolerable side effects, their dose may be lowered, paused, or stopped&#xD;
      completely. This will be up to their doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patient is enrolled in the Phase II portion, they will receive TPI 287 at the highest dose&#xD;
      that was tolerated in the Phase I portion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is about 28 days (+/- 3 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TPI 287 will be given by vein over about 1 hour, on Days 1, 8, and 15 (+/- 2 days) of each&#xD;
      study cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since TPI 287 does not mix well in water, patient will receive doses of TPI 287 that have&#xD;
      been dissolved in cremophor. Cremophor is a chemical that is created from castor oil. Some&#xD;
      participants may be allergic to cremophor. Before patient receives each dose of TPI 287, they&#xD;
      will receive dexamethasone, Benadryl (diphenhydramine), and Pepcid (famotidine) by vein, to&#xD;
      help prevent allergic reaction. Each of these medications will be given over about 10&#xD;
      minutes. Patient will also receive drugs to prevent nausea and vomiting. The study staff will&#xD;
      tell patient more about these drugs and the risks for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all study visits, patient will be asked about any symptoms they may be having and any&#xD;
      drugs they may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 8, 15, and 21 of each cycle, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine&#xD;
      tests. The blood sample on Day 21 may be drawn at a clinic near patient's home. The study&#xD;
      staff will give patient more information about this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 28 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will have a physical exam, including measurement of their height, weight, and&#xD;
           vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, patient will have an MRI scan of the brain to check&#xD;
           the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, patient will have a neurological exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and then every other cycle after that (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on),&#xD;
      patient will have a CT scan of their chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 8 weeks, patient will have a CT or MRI scan of the brain to check the status of the&#xD;
      disease. If patient has brain metastasis, they will have a CT or MRI scan every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient may continue taking the study drug for up to 6 months. Treatment beyond 6 months will&#xD;
      be decided by patient's doctor. Patient will be allowed to continue taking the study drug for&#xD;
      as long as the doctor thinks it is in their best interest. Patient will no longer be able to&#xD;
      take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they&#xD;
      are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's participation on the study will be over once they have completed the&#xD;
      end-of-treatment visit and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 4 weeks after patient stops receiving TPI 287, they will have an end-of-treatment&#xD;
      visit. At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will have a physical exam, including measurement of their weight and vital&#xD;
           signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will be asked about any problems or side effects they may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If patient's doctor thinks it is needed, they will have a CT or MRI scan to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will be contacted by phone or they will come in for a clinic visit. The phone&#xD;
           call should last about 5 minutes. Patient will be asked about any problems or side&#xD;
           effects they may be having:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 2 months unless the disease gets worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then, every 3 months after that.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These follow-ups end 3 years after they enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. TPI 287 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It&#xD;
      is currently being used for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 82 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

          4. Patients may have had up to two prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for their&#xD;
             systemic disease (immunological or targeted therapy e.g. vaccine, IL-2, B-RAF&#xD;
