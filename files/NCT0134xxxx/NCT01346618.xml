  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone age assessment is currently an important tool in final height implication in children.&#xD;
      It is an important tool in the phases of investigation and treatment of short stature, tall&#xD;
      stature, pubertal timing and various endocrinological pediatric situations. It is currently&#xD;
      assessed using hand x-ray. This method has several limitations, including: requirement of&#xD;
      specialized medical staff to interpret results, exposure radiation and usage of equipment&#xD;
      which is only in radiology centers. The investigators aim to study a new equipment, radiation&#xD;
      free, with simple and swift operation which provides an immediate answer, no need for an&#xD;
      experienced observer, a mobile equipment with easy accessibility. The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      assess its reproducibility, validity and safety compared to the x-ray method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize it is as accurate and valid.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Skeletal maturity assessment, defined also as bone age (BA), has an important role in&#xD;
      pediatrics and pediatric endocrinology, used mainly for evaluating growth and puberty related&#xD;
      endocrine disorders. Repeated BA assessment is important during the follow up of children&#xD;
      with short stature, with precocious puberty and those treated by growth promoting&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most commonly used method used for determining skeletal maturity, and thus BA is based on&#xD;
      comparison of a hand and wrist radiographs to a standard series of representative films in&#xD;
      the &quot;Radiographic atlas of skeletal development of the hand and wrist&quot; by Greulich and Pyle&#xD;
      (GP), which has been issued several decades ago. Among the disadvantages and drawbacks in&#xD;
      this BA assessment method are: the obligatory need for using radiology units that are often&#xD;
      available only in special facilities or hospitals, not available at the physicians office,&#xD;
      the exposure to ionizing radiation, and the known limitation of the method for the need of an&#xD;
      endocrinologist to assess the BA, with a known large inter observers variability of the BA&#xD;
      interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The suggested method in this study is based on ultrasound technology, and therefore it is&#xD;
      quick, objective, and radiation-free. It delivers an immediate non biased result without the&#xD;
      need to rely on an observer's evaluation of the hand radiograph and without the need for a&#xD;
      specialized radiology facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique was innovated in order to find an efficient, convenient and non radiation&#xD;
      based method of skeletal maturity assessment for the primary care physician that can be&#xD;
      performed in an office setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to establish a correlation algorithm between the BA assessment by an&#xD;
      ultrasound apparatus (SonicBone) and the X-ray based assessment using Grulich and Pyle&#xD;
      method, and to evaluate the validity and reproducibility of the apparatus, The design of the&#xD;
      study is to perform a concomitant skeletal maturation assessment by reading of a hand X-ray&#xD;
      radiograph by 3 experienced observers using the GP method, and by the ultrasound technique&#xD;
      using the SonicBone apparatus. Skeletal maturation assessment will be performed in females&#xD;
      and males at various age groups.&#xD;
