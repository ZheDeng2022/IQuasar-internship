    <textblock>
      Sustained virological response (SVR) to antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis&#xD;
      C genotype 1 according to subtype (1a vs.1b) has not been extensively investigated. This&#xD;
      observational study was carried out on a large group of &quot;naïve&quot; HCV patients to evaluate&#xD;
      difference, if any, between HCV genotype 1 subtype 1a and 1b on the response to treatment&#xD;
      with peginterferon (Peg-IFN) plus ribavirin.&#xD;

      Despite the challenging perspective of the new antiviral drugs directly acting on hepatitis C&#xD;
      viral replication such as protease and polymerase inhibitors, nowadays the standard treatment&#xD;
      in genotype 1-chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is the combination of peghylated interferon (PEG-IFN)&#xD;
      and ribavirin for 48 weeks. It has been extensively shown that patients infected with HCV&#xD;
      genotype 1 have a lower rate of viral response than those infected with genotype 2 and 3. In&#xD;
      large randomized multinational trials, sustained virological response (SVR) of around 50% has&#xD;
      been obtained with peginterferon α2a plus ribavirin in the more difficult to treat subgroup&#xD;
      of patients infected with HCV genotype 1. Furthermore, advanced fibrosis is a predictive&#xD;
      factor of non response to antiviral treatment in genotype 1 virus [5-7]. Very few studies&#xD;
      have evaluated SVR difference, if any, between subtypes 1a and 1b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have carried out an observational study on a large cohort of HCV &quot;naïve&quot; patients to&#xD;
      evaluate the influence of HCV subtypes 1 on the response to treatment with Peg-INF plus&#xD;
      ribavirin.&#xD;

      HCVRNA determination was performed quantitatively before the treatment (TaqMan Roche&#xD;
      Diagnostics). The TaqMan value utilized to determine the response was 15 IU/ml. TaqMan method&#xD;
      was a standardized method utilized from December 2007 in all the center of the CLEO group.&#xD;
      HCVRNA value was expressed as log10 IU/ml.&#xD;
