      A randomized controlled trial for chronic low back pain in predominantly minority populations&#xD;
      with three treatment arms: yoga, physical therapy, and education. Four cohorts of&#xD;
      participants will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio (yoga:physical therapy:education). Primary&#xD;
      outcomes are pain intensity and measure of disability; secondary outcomes are pain medication&#xD;
      use, treatment adherence, and health-related quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) affects 5-10% of U.S. adults annually and disproportionately&#xD;
      impacts individuals from minority and low income backgrounds due to disparities in access and&#xD;
      treatment. Our previous Yoga Dosing Study of 95 adults with chronic low back pain recruited&#xD;
      from Boston Medical Center and affiliated community health centers showed that both once per&#xD;
      week and twice per week yoga classes for 12 weeks were similarly effective for reducing pain&#xD;
      and improving back related function. We concluded that due to the superior convenience and&#xD;
      lower cost of once per week compared to twice per week classes, a once per week yoga protocol&#xD;
      was optimal for the current study. Evidence from multiple studies supports a moderate benefit&#xD;
      in CLBP for exercise therapy individually-delivered by a physical therapist. Moreover,&#xD;
      physical therapy is the most common, reimbursed, non-pharmacologic treatment recommended by&#xD;
      physicians for CLBP. However, no studies to date have done a head-to-head comparison of the&#xD;
      effectiveness of yoga and physical therapy for CLBP. To ultimately reduce disparities in CLBP&#xD;
      for minority populations, patients, providers, and health insurers need to know how a&#xD;
      complementary therapy such as yoga compares in effectiveness to more well established&#xD;
      treatments such as physical therapy (PT) and education. If yoga is superior to education and&#xD;
      has similar effectiveness as PT but costs less with greater adherence, the potential&#xD;
      therapeutic and economic implications would be substantial. Alternatively, if yoga is&#xD;
      inferior, this information will help guide better treatment decisions and reduce unnecessary&#xD;
      expenditures on inferior treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study (Back to Health) is a 52 week comparative effectiveness randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of once per week yoga classes, individually delivered physical therapy (PT),&#xD;
      and education for chronic low back pain (CLBP) in 320 individuals from predominantly minority&#xD;
      backgrounds recruited from Boston Medical Center and affiliated community health centers. The&#xD;
      52 week trial starts with an initial 12 week Treatment Phase followed by a 40 week&#xD;
      Maintenance Phase. Back to Health has the following three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the 12 week Treatment Phase, we will enroll 320 adults with chronic low back&#xD;
           pain(CLBP) from predominately low-income minority communities and compare the&#xD;
           effectiveness (co-primary endpoints pain and function) between (1) a standardized&#xD;
           protocol of one yoga class per week; (2) a standardized exercise therapy protocol based&#xD;
           on an evidence-based clinical guidelines individually delivered by a physical therapist;&#xD;
           and (3) an educational book on self-care for CLBP&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For adults with CLBP who have completed the initial 12 week yoga or physical therapy(PT)&#xD;
           Treatment Phases, compare effectiveness (co-primary endpoints pain and function)between&#xD;
           patients participating in a structured yoga maintenance program, a structured PT&#xD;
           maintenance program, or no structured maintenance program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the cost-effectiveness of yoga, PT, and education for adults with CLBP at 12&#xD;
           weeks, 6 months, 9 months, and one year from three perspectives: society, third party&#xD;
           payers, and the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 12 week Treatment Phase, participants are randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio into (1) a&#xD;
      standardized once per week hatha yoga class supplemented by home practice; (2) a standardized&#xD;
      evidence-based exercise therapy protocol individually delivered by a physical therapist and&#xD;
      supplemented by home practice; and (3) education delivered through a self-care book. The&#xD;
      study co-primary endpoints are mean pain intensity over the previous week measured on a 11&#xD;
      point numerical rating scale and back-specific function measured using the 23 point modified&#xD;
      Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire. We hypothesize: (1) yoga will be noninferior to&#xD;
      physical therapy; and (2) both yoga and physical therapy will be superior to education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 40 week Maintenance Phase, yoga participants will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      either a structured ongoing maintenance yoga program or no maintenance yoga program.&#xD;
      Similarly, physical therapy participants will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either a&#xD;
      structured ongoing maintenance PT program or no maintenance PT program. Education&#xD;
      participants will be encouraged to continue to review and follow the recommendations of their&#xD;
      educational materials. We hypothesize: (1) maintenance yoga will be non-inferior to&#xD;
      maintenance PT; (2) maintenance yoga and maintenance PT will be superior to no yoga&#xD;
      maintenance and no PT maintenance, respectively; and (3) maintenance yoga and maintenance PT&#xD;
      will both be superior to education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also take advantage of a comprehensive integrated set of patient databases,&#xD;
      self-report cost data, and study records to compare at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and one&#xD;
      year the cost-effectiveness of yoga, physical therapy, and education from three perspectives:&#xD;
      society,third-party payer, and the participant. Qualitative data from interviews and focus&#xD;
      groups will add subjective detail to complement quantitative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from the Back to Health Study will help determine whether it is justifiable for yoga,&#xD;
      currently a &quot;complementary&quot; therapy, to become an acceptable &quot;mainstream&quot; treatment for&#xD;
      chronic low back pain.&#xD;
