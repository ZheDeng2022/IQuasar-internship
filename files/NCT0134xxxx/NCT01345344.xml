  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study design has two components: 1) a cross sectional assessment of brain connectivity&#xD;
      and response to pain in healthy controls and demographically matched fibromyalgia patients,&#xD;
      and 2) a longitudinal assessment of the same outcomes in fibromyalgia patients randomized to&#xD;
      either CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) or a Disease Education condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate 90 fibromyalgia patients who will receive CBT treatment once&#xD;
      a week for 8 weeks, for a total of 8 treatments. Baseline data from these patients will be&#xD;
      compared to results from 30 pain-free controls and 60 education program controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo experimental pain assessments as well as brain neuroimaging.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose to use fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to study CNS pain&#xD;
      processing during the anticipation and experience of acute pain in individuals with FM and&#xD;
      healthy controls. Investigators will recruit patients who are diagnosed with FM as well as&#xD;
      healthy controls. After the baseline visit, FM participants will be randomly assigned into&#xD;
      the CBT or control condition (Education). Overall, FM Participants will attend 8 treatment&#xD;
      visits, and 6 assessment visits (two at baseline, one at mid-treatment, two at the end of&#xD;
      treatment, and one at 6 months post-treatment). These assessment visits include a total of 3&#xD;
      fMRI sessions (at baseline, mid-treatment, and end of treatment). Healthy Controls will&#xD;
      undergo the same baseline procedures as the FM subjects but will not attend any of the&#xD;
      treatment or follow up assessment visits. Findings from this research will provide important&#xD;
      information about catastrophizing's CNS (Central Nervous System) correlates.&#xD;
