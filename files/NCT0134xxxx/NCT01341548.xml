  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intranasally administered&#xD;
      civamide nasal solution in the prevention of cluster headaches during an episodic cluster&#xD;
      headache period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center, phase&#xD;
      III efficacy and safety study of civamide nasal solution 0.01% in the prevention of cluster&#xD;
      headaches during an episodic cluster headache period. Approximately 180 subjects (about 90&#xD;
      per treatment group),will be enrolled and randomized to double-blind treatment with either&#xD;
      civamide nasal solution 0.01% or vehicle solution at approximately 50 study sites with about&#xD;
      2-5 subjects randomized per enrolling site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of four periods beginning with a Screening Period, lasting for a minimum&#xD;
      of 1 day to a maximum of 12 months, during which a subject previously diagnosed with episodic&#xD;
      cluster headaches is not experiencing cluster headaches and is awaiting the onset of their&#xD;
      next episodic cluster headache period and subsequent enrollment. The Screening Period is&#xD;
      followed by a 31-day study, consisting of a 3-day Baseline Period which may begin with the&#xD;
      onset of an episodic cluster headache period and ends on the day prior to initiating&#xD;
      treatment (Day -1). Subjects return for Visit 2 (Day 1, Pre-Dose) and the Treatment Period&#xD;
      begins, consisting of seven (7) days of double-blind treatment. The Treatment Period is&#xD;
      immediately followed by a twenty-one (21) day Post-Treatment Observation Period.&#xD;
