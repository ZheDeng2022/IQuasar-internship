  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even when small cell lung cancer responds well to treatment with chemotherapy, it has a&#xD;
      tendency to grow back and to spread. The investigators are interested in testing new&#xD;
      therapies aimed at decreasing this risk. This study tests a vaccine, which is a substance&#xD;
      injected under the skin which can cause an immune response. The hope is that the body will&#xD;
      make antibodies to the vaccine which will also react against the cancer. The vaccine is&#xD;
      specific for small cell lung cancer. It combines several components (small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      targets) that have been tested individually in patients with small cell lung cancer or other&#xD;
      cancers (GD2, GD3, Globo H, Fucosyl GM1 and N-propionylated polysialic acid). Two other&#xD;
      substances (KLH and OPT-821) are added which boost the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have two groups of patients. The first group will receive the vaccines along&#xD;
      with one cycle of chemotherapy. The second group will receive the vaccines without&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
