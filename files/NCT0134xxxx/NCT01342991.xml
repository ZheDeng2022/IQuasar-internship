      Haemorrhoidectomy (excision of haemorrhoids) is the procedure of choice for grade 3 &amp; 4&#xD;
      symptomatic haemorrhoids. The standard technique in the UK (open Milligan-Morgan) is to&#xD;
      excise the haemorrhoids under general anaesthetic (typically using electrocautery) leaving&#xD;
      raw areas in anal canal. As a result, patients often experience significant post operative&#xD;
      pain which can impact on patient function for weeks following surgery. This would be&#xD;
      considered as the gold standard for the operative treatment for haemorrhoids. Due to the&#xD;
      difficult post operative recovery of this procedure, alternative techniques for performing&#xD;
      haemorrhoidectomy have been explored. One approach, which is gaining some popularity, is&#xD;
      stapled haemorrhoidectomy [1]. In this technique, a circular stapling device is used to&#xD;
      excise proximal mucosa in order to disconnect the haemorrhoidal blood supply and to pull up&#xD;
      the haemorrhoidal mass. The edges of the excised mucosa are simultaneously closed with a row&#xD;
      of staples. In a recent meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials including 2056&#xD;
      patients, stapled haemorrhoidectomy was associated with reduced postoperative pain and&#xD;
      reduction in return to activity by nearly 12 days in comparison to open haemorrhoidectomy&#xD;
      [2]. Although postoperative complication rates were similar, stapled haemorrhoidectomy was&#xD;
      associated with significantly more recurrences in the longer term (relative risk 2.29). The&#xD;
      stapled haemorrhoidectomy technique has not gained universal acceptance. This may be related&#xD;
      to the cost and availability of stapling devices in many centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike specialized stapling devices, lasers are widely available in the operating theatre and&#xD;
      are used in many operations to cauterise tissue. The resulting burn is superficial in&#xD;
      comparison to electrocautery. Consequently, lasers have been used to perform open&#xD;
      haemorrhoidectomy with the expectation of reducing post operative pain. However, randomised&#xD;
      trials comparing the use of lasers versus cold scalpel for open haemorrhoidectomy have shown&#xD;
      no significant differences in post operative pain [3]. Although, the laser appears to offer&#xD;
      no advantage in open haemorrhoidal procedures, an alternative technique for laser&#xD;
      haemorrhoidectomy has been developed by Peter Thompson from Laser Haemorrhoid Centre in&#xD;
      Phoenix, Arizona. In this alternative technique, a laser is used to seal the raw mucosal&#xD;
      edges after excision of the piles. In common with stapled haemorrhoidectomy, the mucosa is&#xD;
      sealed closed rather than left open. Consequently, patients appear to experience markedly&#xD;
      less post operative pain. The technique is also simple and quick with a shallow learning&#xD;
      curve. Due to the speed and relative comfort of the procedure, patients may be routinely&#xD;
      operated on using sedation and local anaesthetic, rather than full general anaesthetic which&#xD;
      is standard practice for most haemorrhoidectomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last 2 years,the investigators have performed laser haemorrhoidectomy for 60&#xD;
      patients. The age range was 32 to 81 years .The ratio for male: female was 31:29. All were&#xD;
      done under local anaesthesia with sedation except one (1.6%) which was converted to general&#xD;
      anaesthesia. All patients except 2 (3.5%) were discharged within two hours of operation. One&#xD;
      was delayed due to administration of general anaesthesia and the second one was admitted for&#xD;
      post operative bleeding and was actively observed for three days, after which he was&#xD;
      discharged. There were four re-admissions (6.6%), two had post operative oedema &amp; two had&#xD;
      oedema and pain. All of them were actively observed and discharged later. Four patients&#xD;
      (6.6%) also developed chronic anal fissures post operatively, two of them healed with six&#xD;
      weeks course of Glyceryl Tri Nitrate (GTN) cream and the other two are on conservative&#xD;
      management for non-healing fissures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to objectively determine whether laser closed haemorrhoidectomy is&#xD;
      associated with significantly less post operative pain and an earlier return to function in&#xD;
      comparison to the Milligan-Morgan Haemorrhoidectomy which is the standard procedure performed&#xD;
      across the trust.&#xD;
