  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two types of external radiation treatments; proton beam and photon beam radiation.&#xD;
      What type of therapy participants will receive will depend upon the location of their tumor.&#xD;
      Standard treatment would involve receiving either proton or photon radiation delivered by a&#xD;
      three dimensional (3-D) conformal radiation technique. 3-D conformal radiation therapy is a&#xD;
      technique where the beams of radiation used in the treatment are shaped to match the tumor in&#xD;
      order to avoid damaging the healthy surrounding tissue. Standard treatment also may include&#xD;
      photon radiation delivered by intensity modulated (IMRT) technique. In this research study we&#xD;
      are using an investigational technique to deliver proton radiation therapy called intensity&#xD;
      modulated proton radiation treatment (IMPT) which is used to target cancer while sparing&#xD;
      healthy tissue. With IMPT (and standard IMRT), radiation intensity can be turned down during&#xD;
      the treatment. This control over the intensity of the radiation dose has the potential to&#xD;
      provide accuracy and allows us to more safely increase the amount of radiation delivered to&#xD;
      the tumor. This accuracy may potentially reduce side effects that patients would normally&#xD;
      experience with 3-D proton radiation therapy. Surgery is often an important component of the&#xD;
      treatment for these tumors and may be integrated with the IMPT.&#xD;

      -  Before beginning radiation therapy, the participants will have a radiation planning&#xD;
           computed tomographic (CT) scan of the tumor site. This is considered standard of care&#xD;
           and the doctor will use the images from this scan to plan the radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may also receive surgery either before or after the study radiation&#xD;
           treatment. This surgery is also considered standard of care and would be done regardless&#xD;
           of being in the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The IMPT technique for delivering radiation is for research purposes only. Radiation&#xD;
           treatment to the affected tumor will be given daily, Monday through Friday.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following procedures will be performed once a week during treatment: assessment of&#xD;
           nerve, neuromuscular, motor and sensory function by clinical exam and toxicity&#xD;
           assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return for follow-up visits after completion of the radiation&#xD;
           treatment at the following intervals: 6 weeks after completion of treatment, 6 months&#xD;
           after treatment, every 6 months thereafter for 4 years, and then each year after for up&#xD;
           to 15 years.&#xD;
