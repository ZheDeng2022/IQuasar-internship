  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Black men who have sex with men (MSM) have the highest rates of HIV infection in the United&#xD;
      States and represent a population in need of new HIV prevention interventions. Although 20 to&#xD;
      40% of Black MSM are estimated to have female partners, no interventions tailored to the&#xD;
      needs of Black MSM/W have been developed and rigorously evaluated. This project will develop,&#xD;
      implement, and evaluate an individual-level intervention (ILI), titled &quot;RISE&quot;, that will&#xD;
      assist Black MSM/W to reduce their risk for acquiring and transmitting HIV infection. This&#xD;
      intervention will address the effect of individual level factors, interpersonal relationships&#xD;
      including sexual, peer and family relationships, and socio-cultural influences on the sexual&#xD;
      risk behaviors of MSM/W. The intervention will consist of six counseling sessions held&#xD;
      between a trained counselor and participant, and will be guided by three theoretical&#xD;
      perspectives: an ecological perspective of behavior, stress and coping theory, and social&#xD;
      cognitive theory. The COLOURS Organization, the sole agency in Philadelphia dedicated to&#xD;
      exclusively serving the Black LGBT community, will be a key collaborator in the development&#xD;
      and implementation of the intervention. The evaluation design utilizes a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to test the effectiveness of the proposed intervention. Chain referral,&#xD;
      based on principles of respondent-driven sampling, will be used to recruit 250 HIV-positive&#xD;
      and HIV-negative Black bisexually-active men into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this research are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  develop a new theoretically-based individual-level HIV prevention intervention&#xD;
           culturally tailored to the needs of HIV-positive and HIV-negative Black MSM/W;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the intervention with a randomized control group design, using RDS to recruit&#xD;
           250 Black MSM/W who do not inject drugs and who report recent unprotected sex;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess the efficacy of the intervention and test the intervention model through the&#xD;
           collection of behavioral risk assessments and HIV and STD testing at three time points:&#xD;
           baseline, immediately post-intervention and three-months post-intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  examine and describe individual factors, interpersonal relationships and network&#xD;
           factors, and socio-cultural factors that may affect risk behaviors for HIV infection and&#xD;
           transmission among Black MSM/W;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  develop recommendations for recruiting Black bisexually-active men and providing them&#xD;
           with targeted HIV prevention interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation data collection will be conducted using ACASI. Data analysis will include Repeated&#xD;
      Measures ANOVA to make assessments of changes over time and intervention dose effects and&#xD;
      structural equation modeling to assess causal associations between factors in the conceptual&#xD;
      model. This proposed study has significance for increasing our understanding various types of&#xD;
      factors that may affect sexual risk behaviors of Black MSM/W as well as potentially providing&#xD;
      an important new tool for HIV prevention specifically targeting the needs and risk behaviors&#xD;
      of Black MSM/W.&#xD;
