  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study to compare unpolarized (conventional) to polarized light&#xD;
      colposcopy. Subjects will be asked to participate in the study when they arrive for their&#xD;
      prescheduled colposcopic examination. The study doctor will use a conventional or standard&#xD;
      colposcope to perform the examination. His/her impression of the exam will be noted and if&#xD;
      necessary a biopsy specimen will be obtained. The study doctor will then perform a colposcopy&#xD;
      using a polarized light. His/her impression of the exam will be noted and a biopsy specimen&#xD;
      will be obtained if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that polarized light colposcopy is more&#xD;
      sensitive and more specific than standard, un-polarized light colposcopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women scheduled for a colposcopic examination at GRU or CerviCusco were asked to participate&#xD;
      in the study. Interested patients read and signed an IRB-approved Informed Consent Document&#xD;
      (ICD) that described the study and their potential involvement. The study coordinator read&#xD;
      and or translated the ICD to women who spoke languages other than English or Spanish (i.e.&#xD;
      Quechua).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pertinent disease specific demographic information was collected from each patient. Following&#xD;
      insertion of a vaginal speculum and a one minute application of 5% acetic acid, polarized and&#xD;
      non-polarized high resolution digital RGB images were taken of the ectocervix. Thereafter,&#xD;
      non-polarized light colposcopy was performed as standard of care. The colposcopist derived a&#xD;
      colposcopic impression and indicated whether a biopsy was necessary. So as not to compromise&#xD;
      the next examination, Lugol's Iodine was not applied. Then, a polarized light colposcopy was&#xD;
      performed. As before, the colposcopist derived an impression, indicated whether a biopsy was&#xD;
      necessary and annotated the site of pending biopsy. Then if indicated, a minimum of one&#xD;
      cervical biopsy was obtained from the area(s) representing the most severe colopscopic&#xD;
      changes as seen during the non-polarized exam. The exact biopsy site was annotated.&#xD;

    <description>We will examine 300 women scheduled for colposcopy using unpolarized and polarized light. To determine whether polarized light increases the sensitivity and specificity over unpolarized light, the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC) will be calculated. We anticipate that it will take approximately 8-10 months to enroll 300 subjects.</description>
