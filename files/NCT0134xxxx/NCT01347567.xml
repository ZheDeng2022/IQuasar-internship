      The purpose of this study is to determine if heart failure subjects whose treatment is&#xD;
      assisted by home BNP measurements integrated into a home health management system will have&#xD;
      better clinical outcomes than subjects whose treatment includes home health management&#xD;
      without BNP or than subjects treated by standard care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Systolic dysfunction heart failure subjects with low ejection fraction and elevated BNP&#xD;
      levels admitted to hospital or treated as outpatient for decompensated Heart Failure (HF) are&#xD;
      at hight risk for recurrent decompensation and readmission. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate if these patients may benefit from enhanced home monitoring of their HF status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 3 study arms (BNP, Health Management and control groups) home fingerstick BNP levels&#xD;
      will be obtained so that frequent data points are available for analysis of trends and&#xD;
      variability. These results will remain blinded to the subjects in all study arms and their&#xD;
      care providers in the health management and control arms, the investigator and staff will&#xD;
      have access to the BNP results only for subjects in the BNP arm and will use this information&#xD;
      to aid in therapy decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are monitored for 180 days as this time period is likely sufficient to differentiate&#xD;
      normal biological variation in BNP changes due to impending decompensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed at Day 30,90 and 180 after randomization HF status, patient&#xD;
      clinical outcome and treatment adjustments are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up telephone calls to subjects at 3 and 6 months after completion of home testing will&#xD;
      be conducted in order to determine the possible long-term benefit of home health management&#xD;
      with daily BNP testing.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adults (18 years of age and &lt;75 years of age); AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Admitted to the hospital or treated in an outpatient clinic with a diagnosis of&#xD;
             decompensated HF for which treatment will be administered;&#xD;
&#xD;
        i. BNP &gt; 300 pg/mL (or NT-pro-BNP &gt; 1500 pg/mL) during hospital admission or clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR c. Seen in an outpatient setting (i.e. heart failure clinic, general practice or&#xD;
        cardiology office, urgent care unit) with a documented history of HF and with signs of&#xD;
        worsening HF condition or decompensation, where worsening HF condition is defined as one or&#xD;
        more of the following;&#xD;
&#xD;
        i. Increase in NYHA class with worsening symptoms (i.e. dyspnea, fatigue) at same level of&#xD;
        activity ii. Symptoms requiring change in dosage of one or more of the following&#xD;
        medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. diuretic&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. beta blocker&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ACE inhibitor iii. Physical evaluation consistent with worsening HF signs (i.e.&#xD;
             elevated JVP, ankle edema, dyspnea, abdominal distension, &gt;4 lb or &gt;1.8 kg weight&#xD;
             increase in past week) iv. HF admission in last 30 days with a documented BNP &gt; 300&#xD;
             pg/mL (or NT-pro-BNP &gt; 1500 pg/mL) during or since admission AND d. Presence of left&#xD;
             ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt;40%); e. Successfully trained and&#xD;
             deemed proficient on how to perform a fingerstick and to use the Test System. Each&#xD;
             subject will undergo two proficiency assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. The first assessment will be performed at the time in which the subject is found to&#xD;
             meet the inclusion criteria, and deemed willing, able and reliable to complete the&#xD;
             study tasks, and following initial training on the use of the test system. Successful&#xD;
             completion of this first proficiency assessment will result in the enrolment of the&#xD;
             subject into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The second assessment will be performed following one week (7 days Â± 2 days) of home&#xD;
             testing to demonstrate retention of the training. Successful completion of this second&#xD;
             proficiency assessment will result in randomization of the subject into one of the&#xD;
             three study arms of the study. Failure to demonstrate proficiency at this second&#xD;
             assessment will result in the withdrawal of the subject from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Unwilling or unable to provide written informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) that is a primary diagnosis; or secondary diagnosis&#xD;
                  that is concomitant with the primary diagnosis of decompensated HF and for which&#xD;
                  treatment will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Note: A history of ACS is not cause for exclusion if it is not concomitant with&#xD;
                  the present decompensated HF for which admission is being made. Small elevations&#xD;
                  in cardiac troponin that are considered by the treating physician to be&#xD;
                  associated with myocardial injury due to the acute decompensated HF and not due&#xD;
                  to a concomitant ACS or myocardial infarction are not a basis for exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Previous cardiac transplantation - or cardiac transplantation anticipated within&#xD;
                  3 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Current or planned use of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), use of&#xD;
                  outpatient intravenous inotropic HF therapy, major surgical procedure or&#xD;
                  percutaneous coronary intervention within 3 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Life expectancy less than 6 months due to causes other than HF or cardiovascular&#xD;
