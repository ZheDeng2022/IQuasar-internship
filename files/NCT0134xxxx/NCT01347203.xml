  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a study existing of 4 periods, to evaluate for a single dose of 4 different&#xD;
      tablets of DPOC-4088 the absorption and elimination from the body and the potential effect on&#xD;
      blood clotting. The differences between the tablets are the dose (100 or 200 mg) and the rate&#xD;
      of release of DPOC-4088 from the tablet (16 or 20 hours). The allocation of the tablets in&#xD;
      each period will be determined by chance but is known upfront.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, open-label, single oral dose study. The 4-period crossover study&#xD;
      will determine and compare the PK and PD profiles of DPOC-4088 when administered as a single&#xD;
      oral dose of 100 mg and 200 mg of DPOC-4088 in two prolonged release formulations (16 and 20&#xD;
      hr) in 12 evaluable young healthy male subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject (in a fasting state) will receive each of the 4 treatments (A, B, C, and D) in a&#xD;
      balanced, 4-period crossover design. Each treatment consists of a single oral dose of 100 mg&#xD;
      or 200 mg of DPOC-4088 in either prolonged release formulation (16 or 20 hr). Subjects will&#xD;
      arrive at the study unit for an overnight fast of at least 10 hrs the evening before each&#xD;
      dosing period and remain in the unit for at least 24 hrs after dosing. Standard meals will be&#xD;
      provided and subjects will receive their first meal after dosing at 4 hrs post-dose. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be drawn for PK and PD evaluations immediately prior to dosing and at specified&#xD;
      time intervals for 48 hrs post-dosing. Each dosing period will be separated by at least a&#xD;
      5-day washout period that is preferentially not to exceed 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In healthy young male subjects, the safety, tolerability, and the PK profile of DPOC-4088&#xD;
      will be assessed. Additionally, this study will assess the PD profile and the relationship of&#xD;
      PK/PD in terms of the ability of DPOC-4088 to inhibit thrombin activity (based on&#xD;
      prolongation of aPTT, ECT, TT and PT).&#xD;
