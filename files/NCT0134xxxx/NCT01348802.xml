      Pain is a problem for many Canadians. Unfortunately, many doctors, nurses, therapists, and&#xD;
      psychologists have trouble keeping up to date and applying the latest research that might&#xD;
      help patients suffering with pain. This study will determine whether sending alerts about new&#xD;
      pain research directly to these health professionals, and providing them with access to&#xD;
      accumulated alerts, will help. The study will compare knowledge and decisions made by health&#xD;
      professionals about managing pain problems. The investigators will compare physicians,&#xD;
      nurses, rehab therapists and psychologists at the beginning of the study and after having&#xD;
      access to different ways to find out about new pain research. One group will receive alerts&#xD;
      about new pain studies that have been found to be high quality and relevant to patient care,&#xD;
      and will be able to search the alerts database. The other group will be able to find the same&#xD;
      studies,but must go to the database of research studies to locate them. The investigators&#xD;
      will include 670 doctors, nurses, rehab therapists, and psychologists in this study. A&#xD;
      process like tossing a coin will determine which way they are able to get pain research&#xD;
      information. The investigators will monitor how much information they access and how they&#xD;
      apply it to managing pain problems. The investigators expect that reminding health care&#xD;
      providers about new research findings directly will help them, since difficulty finding&#xD;
      studies and lack of time prevent them from using the latest research. The investigators&#xD;
      expect that reminders about the latest research will help them make better decisions about&#xD;
      caring for patients' pain.&#xD;

      The Problem: Pain affects all Canadians during acute injury or disease. Chronic noncancer&#xD;
      pain affects 29% of Canadians, half of whom are unable to participate in their usual&#xD;
      work/social roles. Pain is the primary reason that patients consult health practitioners.&#xD;
      Research has shown the benefits, harms, and costs of numerous interventions for pain, but&#xD;
      uptake of this knowledge is far from satisfactory. Optimizing pain care requires ready access&#xD;
      and use of best evidence within and across different disciplines and settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Research Question: The purpose of this randomized trial is to determine whether a&#xD;
      technology-based &quot;push&quot; of new, high-quality pain research to physicians, nurses,&#xD;
      rehabilitation and psychology professionals results in better knowledge and clinical&#xD;
      decision-making around pain, when offered in addition to traditional &quot;pull&quot; evidence&#xD;
      technology. A secondary objective is to identify disciplinary variations in response to&#xD;
      evidence and differences in the patterns of accessing research evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Sample: 670 Physicians, nurses, occupational/physical therapists and psychologists&#xD;
      ((80/group X 2 comparison groups X 4 disciplines) + 30 for dropouts)will be recruited through&#xD;
      professional associations, websites/conferences and social media. This provides &gt; 90% power&#xD;
      to detect main effects; 80% power for subgroup effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes are uptake and application of evidence. Uptake will be&#xD;
      determined by embedded tracking of what research is accessed during use of the intervention.&#xD;
      A random subset of 30 participants/discipline will undergo chart-stimulated recall (CSR) to&#xD;
      assess the nature and depth of evidence utilization in actual case management (0, 9 months).&#xD;
      A different random subset of 30 participants/discipline will be tested for their skills in&#xD;
      accessing evidence using a standardized simulation test (final 3 months). Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include usage and self-reported evidence-based practice attitudes and behaviours (0, 3, 9,&#xD;
      15, 18 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention/Methods: Participants who agree to this study of a free literature service will&#xD;
      be randomly allocated to Push + Pull versus Pull evidence support. Push + Pull is evidence on&#xD;
      pain that is extracted from medical, nursing and rehabilitation journals and appraised for&#xD;
      quality and relevance and sent out to clinicians (derived from the successful&#xD;
      MacPLUS/Evidence Updates), delivered by e-mail alerts or available for searches of the&#xD;
      accumulated database). Pull will be an intervention with a similar front-face but requires&#xD;
      clinicians to go to the site and extract evidence from an electronic database. The trial will&#xD;
      begin with a 3-month (repeated) baseline, during which average participant use of the&#xD;
      standard PULL resource will be monitored. Participants will then be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      receive PUSH + PULL or continue to use the PULL resource. After six months, participants will&#xD;
      cross over to the alternate intervention for an additional six months. To complete the trial,&#xD;
      both groups will finish with three months of PUSH + PULL access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: The investigators will use an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), where discipline and&#xD;
      setting are covariates to assess differential responses across main effects of Push + Pull&#xD;
      vs. Pull. Content analysis of the CSR interview will be use to describe the application of&#xD;
      evidence within actual cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact/Timeliness: The trial will inform our understanding on information preferences and&#xD;
      behaviours across disciplines/practice settings. If this intervention is effective, sustained&#xD;
      support will come through professional/health system initiatives emerging to optimize pain&#xD;
      management in Canada.&#xD;
