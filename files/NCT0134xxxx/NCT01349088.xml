  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2008 there were more than 40,000 deaths caused by metastatic breast cancer in the United&#xD;
      States. The development of new treatment strategies is essential to improve outcome for&#xD;
      patients with metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is significant preclinical and clinical evidence indicating that creating new blood&#xD;
      vessels (neoangiogenesis) to provide nutrients to solid tumors, including breast cancer,&#xD;
      provides the necessary conditions to allow tumor growth. Vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF) is one of the important molecules regulating new blood vessel formations and&#xD;
      subsequent invasion and metastases. As a result, agents that inhibit VEGF are of substantial&#xD;
      interest for the treatment of advanced diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will further the body of research of motesanib which has been shown in preclinical&#xD;
      pharmacology and clinical pharmacology studies to be a potent, orally bioavailable&#xD;
      multi-kinase inhibitor with anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity achieved by selectively&#xD;
      targeting all known VEGF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and Kit receptors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endocrine therapy and chemotherapy (using either sequential single agents or combination&#xD;
      regimens) remain the principal treatments for women with metastatic breast cancer. A wide&#xD;
      variety of classes of chemotherapeutic agents have demonstrated anti-tumor activity as single&#xD;
      agents or in combination regimens. Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents have been the mainstay&#xD;
      of cancer therapies for many years and have improved survival in many disease settings.&#xD;
      Median survivals remain approximately two years for women with metastatic breast cancer, and&#xD;
      less than 3% of patients experience long-term survival after initiation of treatment. The&#xD;
      development of new treatment strategies is therefore essential to improve outcome for&#xD;
      patients with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most promising pathways for the development of new anti-neoplastic agents is&#xD;
      targeting tumor vascular endothelium. There is significant preclinical and clinical evidence&#xD;
      indicating that tumor neoangiogenesis is critical in pathogenesis and progression of solid&#xD;
      tumors, including breast cancer. Of the numerous known growth factors that have been&#xD;
      implicated in tumor angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the&#xD;
      important molecules regulating new blood vessel formations and subsequent invasion and&#xD;
      metastases. As a result, agents that inhibit VEGF are of substantial interest for the&#xD;
      treatment of advanced diseases. More thorough elucidation of mechanisms behind intrinsic and&#xD;
      acquired resistance therefore is imperative disease and to identify patients most likely to&#xD;
      benefit from treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motesanib has been shown in preclinical pharmacology and PK studies to be a potent, orally&#xD;
      bioavailable multi-kinase inhibitor with anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity achieved by&#xD;
      selectively targeting all known VEGF, PDGF and Kit receptors. It has an acceptable safety&#xD;
      profile in both non-clinical and clinical studies, and a PK profile that appears suitable for&#xD;
      daily oral dosing in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational product motesanib (Amgen) is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor&#xD;
      with high efficacy against VEGFR and c-Kit kinases. C-kit has been detected in 12% of breast&#xD;
      cancers, correlating with basal or triple-negative breast cancer. In addition, efficacy of&#xD;
      the drug has been noted to PDGFRα, which is expressed in approximately 40% of breast cancers&#xD;
      and is associated with aggressive disease, metastatic invasion and poor prognosis.&#xD;
      Importantly, in more than half (56%) of these cases, the carcinoma cells bearing the&#xD;
      receptors expressed the PDGF-A ligand, suggesting an autocrine loop and a cancer&#xD;
      cell-autonomous process. Cancer cell-autonomous pathways are especially attractive as drug&#xD;
      targets against metastatic breast cancer because they are expected to continue to be&#xD;
      functional at metastatic sites, since they do not depend on stromal factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary molecular target of motesanib, VEGFR, is intriguing because neovascularization is&#xD;
      expected to be required also at metastatic sites. A preliminary analysis revealed that VEGF&#xD;
      expression correlated with the triple-negative, basal breast cancer subtype and poor outcome.&#xD;
      Importantly, PDGF receptors are also present on vascular pericytes, cells required for&#xD;
      adequate vascularization. Thus, motesanib is a unique multikinase inhibitor that targets both&#xD;
      growth factor receptors on the carcinoma cells and growth factor receptors related to&#xD;
      neovascularization.&#xD;
