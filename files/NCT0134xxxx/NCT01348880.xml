  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as a multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo&#xD;
      controlled, crossover design. The investigational drug (vardenafil ODT (Orally Disintegrating&#xD;
      Tablet)/placebo) will be given as a single administration at a dose of 10 mg vardenafil ODT&#xD;
      during Period 1 or 2; the blinded matching placebo will be given as a single administration&#xD;
      during the opposing period. The random code will determine the order of active drug&#xD;
      (vardenafil ODT) and placebo for each subject. Blood pressure and heart rate profiles will be&#xD;
      recorded by automated device pre-dose for 8 hours post-dose during Periods 1 and 2. The non&#xD;
      investigational drug product (vasodilator), Procardia XL, will be background treatment for&#xD;
      hypertension, taken daily by each subject. All subjects must be stable on the vasodilator for&#xD;
      at least 4 weeks prior to Day 1 of Period 1. Special conditions for this study include the&#xD;
      requirement that all subjects will be male, are between the ages of 65 and 80 years, and will&#xD;
      have a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction (ED), as well as hypertension. Planned sample size&#xD;
      will be 40 subjects evaluable for the primary analysis. Of the 40 subjects valid for this&#xD;
      analysis, 20 will be between the ages of 65 and 69 years, and 20 subjects will be between the&#xD;
      ages of 70 and 80 years. The total duration of the study will be approximately one year from&#xD;
      first subject treated to last subject treated, including replacement of any subjects who fail&#xD;
      to complete both periods of crossover dosing.&#xD;
