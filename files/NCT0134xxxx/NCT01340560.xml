      Objective To evaluate the effect of local injury to the endometrium for implantation,&#xD;
      pregnancy and live birth rates in ICSI -ET cycles with recurrent implantation failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Randomized controlled clinical study. Setting A clinical will assist reproductive&#xD;
      center of Selcuk University Meram Medical Faculty Hospital in the Konya, Turkey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population A group of 100 women, who failed to conceive during one or more cycles of IVF and&#xD;
      embryo transfer (ET), will treat with a long protocol for controlled ovarian&#xD;
      hyperstimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The IVF treatment and ET will precede by repeated endometrial biopsies, in a randomly&#xD;
      selected 50 of a total of 100 women.&#xD;

      The clinical study will take place in clinical assisted reproductive center of Selcuk&#xD;
      University Meram Medical Faculty Hospital in the Konya, Turkey. A group of 100 women who&#xD;
      apply to our clinic due to infertility and who undergo one or more failed fresh IVF cycles&#xD;
      previously will be included in our study for ICSI-ET (intracytoplasmic sperm injection-embryo&#xD;
      transfer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will exclude women with factors as hydrosalpinx, trombophilia, submucous myoma and found&#xD;
      to have a negative impact on implantation. Women will be given information about the study,&#xD;
      and written informed consents will be obtained. Our study also received approval of ethic&#xD;
      committee of our faculty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women of the study group (n=50) will randomly selected. The random allocation will base on&#xD;
      computer generated random numbers. All 100 women will treate with long protocol for COH&#xD;
      (control group=group 1, n=50 and study group=group 2, n=50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, the women in the study group (group 2, n=50) will undergo endometrial&#xD;
      biopsies with one-week intervals at the luteal phase of nontransfer cycle. Endometrial biopsy&#xD;
      will performe with biopsy catheter (Pipelle; de Cornier, Prodimed, Neuilly-en-Thelle,&#xD;
      France). The catheter will be passed through the cervical os and will rotate in uterine&#xD;
      cavity and apply 3-4 times after withdrawing the piston.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment schedules Administration of Leuprolide acetate (Lucrin; Abbott, France) at a&#xD;
      subcutaneous dose of 1 mg/day will be started at the 21st day of menstrual cycle on the&#xD;
      patient selected for therapy. All of the women will be protected by one of non-hormonal&#xD;
      contraception method during this cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After administration of GnRH analog at 2nd-3rd day of next menstruation or at least for 14&#xD;
      days in women without menstruation, patients with criteria including serum estrogen (E2)&#xD;
      level is below 50 pg/ml, endometrial thickness is &lt;5mm, lack of observation of active&#xD;
      follicle on transvaginal ultrasonography will be accepted as down regulation, and&#xD;
      gonadotropin therapy [recFSH; Puregon (Organon), Gonal F (Serono), u-FSH/HMG; Merional&#xD;
      (IBSA), Menogon (Ferring)] will be started at a properly adjusted dose for each patient.&#xD;
      Estimated ovarian response will be considered for each case while determining initial dose.&#xD;
      While starting SC/I.M. gonadotropin of average dose 225 IU/day, GnRH analog (Leuprolide&#xD;
      acetate; Lucrin, Abbott) will be maintained until hCG day by reducing to 0.5 mg/day doze&#xD;
      uninterruptedly. When leading follicle will become 18-20 mm or two of follicles will become&#xD;
      17 mm, ovulation will be triggered by administering 10.000 IU urinary hCG (Pregnyl amp;&#xD;
      Organon, Turkey).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follicle aspiration and oocyte collection procedure will be performed at the range of&#xD;
      35th-37th hours following hCG administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semen specimens will be collected on the day when follicle aspiration will be performed&#xD;
      several hours before the procedure by masturbation method generally after sexual fasting of&#xD;
      2-4 days. Sperms of total 6 men, equally 3 men from each group, will be obtained by TESA/TESE&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microinjection procedure into suitable and adequate number of oocytes will be performed&#xD;
      following oocyte collection procedure. Development of fertilized oocytes will be followed up&#xD;
      under suitable laboratory conditions in culture dish (5% CO2, 95% humidity, 37ยบ C&#xD;
      temperature). Fertilization rates will be evaluated at the subsequent 18th hour and embryo&#xD;
      development will be evaluated at 24th-48th-72nd hours. On 2nd-3rd or 4th day following oocyte&#xD;
      collection, maximum 3 embryos having highest quality scores (grade 3 or 4 embryos will be&#xD;
      considered to be good quality embryos) will be selected, and will be transferred into&#xD;
      intrauterine cavity with accompaniment of ultrasonography. Wallace 23 mm soft catheter&#xD;
      (Smiths, England) will be used as transfer catheter. Follicle aspiration and embryo transfer&#xD;
      procedures will be performed by same physician in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Luteal phase support will be started at the evening of follicle aspiration on all women. Use&#xD;
      of intravaginal micronized progesterone 3x200 mg (Progeston soft capsule; Kocak ilac,&#xD;
      Turkey), intramuscular progesterone 25 mg/day (Progeston in oil), prednisol tablet for 5 days&#xD;
      in 16 mg/ day p.o. dose (Mustafa Nevzat, Turkey) and Estraderm TTS 100 (Novartis Pharma,&#xD;
      Basel, Switzerland) 100 microgram/ on alternate days will be recommended until pregnancy&#xD;
      result became apparent.&#xD;
