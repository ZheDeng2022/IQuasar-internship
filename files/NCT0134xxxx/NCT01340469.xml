      The purpose of this study is to determine whether oral probiotic supplementation could reduce&#xD;
      the incidence of nosocomial infections in preterm infants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are growing numbers of evidence indicating the beneficial effects of normal enteric&#xD;
      flora (probiotics) with regard to the host defense against infection. In vitro and in vivo&#xD;
      studies have shown that probiotics such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria have inhibitory&#xD;
      effects on other pathogenic bacteria.This evidence, along with the results of recent clinical&#xD;
      studies, has demonstrated the beneficial effects of probiotics in the prevention of NEC in&#xD;
      VLBW infants.However, most of the studies reported nosocomial infection as a secondary&#xD;
      outcome and the findings were controversial regarding probiotics efficacy in preventing&#xD;
      nosocomial infections. There is only one study that was aimed to investigate effects of&#xD;
      probiotic on the incidence of nosocomial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the potential benefit of probiotics against infection and the lack of clinical studies&#xD;
      in this regard, we conducted a randomized clinical trial to determine whether probiotic&#xD;
      supplementation (in the form of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis) could&#xD;
      reduce nosocomial infection rate among preterm VLBW infants in a intensive care nursery&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;

    <description>Daily enteral probiotic supplementation (live Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis) at a dose of 2.5 x 108 CFU of each strain once a day.The supplementation was started on the first day of enteral feeding and continued for at least 28 days or until discharge. The study drug was in liquid form and mixed with breast milk or formula before given to the infants. The preparation was made on a daily basis by one person who was not involved in the care of the infants.</description>
