      Hypothesis: The MSP3-LSP/Alum vaccine, administered to children will have a protective&#xD;
      efficacy of at least 30% (lower bound of confidence interval of 0) against malaria disease&#xD;
      occurring during a period beginning from 14 days after the 3rd immunization until 1 year&#xD;
      after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial will be to assess&#xD;
      the clinical efficacy of MSP3-LSP/AlOH vaccine when administered by subcutaneous route in&#xD;
      children aged 12-48 months against all clinical malaria episodes occurring during a period&#xD;
      beginning from 14 days after the 3rd immunization until 3 months after 3rd immunization, when&#xD;
      administered according to the following schedule:- Primary administration: Three doses of&#xD;
      administered 4 weeks apart&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary administration (Boost): One dose 3 months after the third dose in year 1 of the&#xD;
      trial; and two doses, given exactly one year after the date corresponding to the third dose&#xD;
      and the first boost given during Year 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case definition for an episode of malaria is a febrile illness with axillary temperature of ≥&#xD;
      37.5ºC with P. falciparum parasitemia ≥ 5000 per μL&#xD;

      This is a Phase 2 b, randomized, controlled trial, comparing MSP3-LSP experimental malaria&#xD;
      vaccine with the comparator Verorab rabies vaccine (primary series) and normal saline&#xD;
      (secondary/booster series). The trial is being conducted in two sites, Doneguebougou and&#xD;
      surroundings (Koulikoro) and Bougoula Hameau and surroundings (Sikasso).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each site will enroll 400 subjects. Subjects aged 12-48 months will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 30 µg of MSP3-LSP/AlOH in 0.5 mL or the control&#xD;
      vaccine, Verorab Rabies subcutaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary series of vaccinations will be given on days 0, 28 and 56. The first of the&#xD;
      secondary/booster series will be administered 3 months after completing the primary series&#xD;
      (D146) in Year 1, and the subsequent booster doses will be administered one year after the&#xD;
      3rd dose (D416) and one year after the first booster dose (D506) in Year 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety, occurrence of adverse events will be solicited during daily home visit by field&#xD;
      workers for 6 days after each vaccination. Unsolicited adverse events will be documented for&#xD;
      the following 28 days after each dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For efficacy, suspect cases will be detected through weekly home visits following the 1st&#xD;
      vaccination and continuing throughout the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to active case detection through home visits, parents and care-givers of the&#xD;
      subjects will be advised of signs and symptom of illness and instructed to bring sick&#xD;
      children to the on-site clinic for assessment and treatment. Study clinical staff will be&#xD;
      available round-the clock for the entire duration of the trial. During these unscheduled&#xD;
      visits malaria smears, blood paper filter and hemoglobin will be done in case of signs or&#xD;
      symptoms compatible with clinical malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be followed for two years following the first vaccination. Clinic visits are&#xD;
      scheduled throughout the follow-up period for clinical assessment, malaria smear, blood paper&#xD;
      filter and hemoglobin systematically on days 0, 28, 56, 86, 116, 146, 180, 236, 326, 416,&#xD;
      446, 506, 536 and 730. The humoral immune response to the vaccine antigen will be assessed&#xD;
      using ELISA on days 0, 28, 56, 86, 116, 146, 180, 236, 416, 446, 506, and 730. Cellular&#xD;
      immune responses to the vaccine antigens (MSP3-LSP and peptides a,b,c,d) will be assessed on&#xD;
      days 0, 86,146, and 416 using CBA on a subset of 50 MSP3 vaccinated individuals. The&#xD;
      functionality of the induced immune responses using Western Blot (WB) method and ADCI&#xD;
      technique will be evaluated at screening and on days 86, 146, 236, 416, 506 and 730.&#xD;
