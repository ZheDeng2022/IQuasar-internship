      This research study is studying biomarkers in blood and tissue samples from patients with&#xD;
      uterine cancer. Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer in the&#xD;
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes the occur in DNA and identify biomarkers&#xD;
      related to cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine whether synuclein-γ (SNCG) expression in primary tumor is associated with&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) in uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine whether SNCG expression is associated with clinical covariates (age at&#xD;
      diagnosis, race, surgical stage, depth of myometrial invasion, presence of lymph vascular&#xD;
      space invasion, lymph node status, location of extrauterine disease, chemotherapy, and&#xD;
      radiation therapy) in UPSC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine whether SNCG expression is associated with other biomarker expression,&#xD;
      including TP53 (p53), HER-2, folate receptor alpha (FOLR1), estrogen receptor (ER),&#xD;
      progesterone receptor (PR), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), phosphorylated AKT (pAKT),&#xD;
      pERK, and p16 in primary tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine whether SNCG expression is associated with progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine whether SNCG expression is associated with synchronous or metachronous breast&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine whether SNCG can be detected in sera from UPSC patients. II. Determine whether&#xD;
      serum SNCG in UPSC patients differs from that in normal healthy control women and women with&#xD;
      endometrioid endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine whether serum SNCG in UPSC patients is associated with overall survival (OS),&#xD;
      clinical covariates (listed above), tumor expression of biomarkers (listed above), PFS, and&#xD;
      synchronous or metachronous breast cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Develop prediction models with a panel of biomarkers and clinical prognostic factors for&#xD;
      OS, PFS, and synchronous or metachronous breast cancers in UPSC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Archived serum and tumor tissue samples are analyzed for synuclein-γ (SNCG) expression and&#xD;
      other biomarker expression, including TP53 (p53), HER-2, folate receptor alpha (FOLR1),&#xD;
      estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN),&#xD;
      phosphorylated AKT (pAKT), pERK, and p16 by microarray analysis, IHC assays, and western&#xD;
      blot. Results are then compared with patients' existing clinical, demographic, and pathology&#xD;
      data, including history of breast cancer (metachronous) or breast cancer diagnosed at the&#xD;
      same time as the endometrial cancer (synchronous).&#xD;
