      The use of amniotic membrane in ophthalmic surgery has been shown to provide an alternative&#xD;
      for corneal and conjunctival reconstruction in many clinically challenging situations. It has&#xD;
      without doubt provided an option where previously none existed in some conditions.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, it is has its limitations and is not universally successful for every&#xD;
      indication. The indications for its use are ever increasing, often on anecdotal evidence. In&#xD;
      some instances where it is successfully used, existing and at times simpler options are&#xD;
      equally effective. The collective global experience with the membrane is now vast, and the&#xD;
      field should now move into proper randomized controlled studies to evaluate its true&#xD;
      potential.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human amniotic membrane (AM) is composed of three layers: a single epithelial layer, a thick&#xD;
      basement membrane, and an avascular stroma. The amniotic membrane was first used along with&#xD;
      the chorion as a biologic membrane to promote healing of skin burns in 1910. In&#xD;
      ophthalmology, it was used in 1940 in the management of conjunctival defects. Its revival in&#xD;
      the 1990s was due to its ability to reduce ocular surface inflammation and scarring, promote&#xD;
      rapid epithelialization due to the presence of growth factors, and antimicrobial&#xD;
      properties.1,2 The amniotic membrane is a biologic tissue that has been used as a graft for&#xD;
      corneal and conjunctival reconstruction in a variety of ocular surface diseases. It is&#xD;
      avascular and possesses anti-angiogenetic, anti-scarring and antiinflammatory properties. It&#xD;
      is not a substitute but rather a substrate upon which cells can migrate and regenerate,&#xD;
      forming new and healthy tissue.2 Amniotic membrane has several properties and is extremely&#xD;
      useful in ocular surgery2,3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Promotes Epithelialization:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Amniotic membrane acts like a basement membrane and facilitates the migration of&#xD;
           epithelial cells.4 It reinforces adhesion of basal epithelial cells, promotes epithelial&#xD;
           differentiation, prevents epithelial apoptosis, and improves corneal sensitivity and&#xD;
           tear film stability,5 although the exact mechanism is not known. It also produces growth&#xD;
           factors that promote epithelial cell growth.6 It is believed to expand and maintain&#xD;
           epithelial progenitor cells ex vivo.7&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inhibits Fibrosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fibroblasts are normally responsible for the scarring associated with wound healing and&#xD;
           are activated by transforming growth factor TGF-β. Amniotic membrane downregulates&#xD;
           TGF-βand the receptor expression by fibroblasts and thus reduces fibrosis. Choi and&#xD;
           Tseng 8,9 implanted dispase-treated amniotic membrane with and without cultured rabbit&#xD;
           corneal epithelial cells intrastromally into rabbit corneas. They observed that the&#xD;
           amniotic membrane alone did not induce keratocyte differentiation into myofibroblasts&#xD;
           and the cornea remained clear. Amniotic membrane also suppressed the TGF-β signaling in&#xD;
           corneal and limbal fibroblasts and in conjunctival and pterygial fibroblasts.10&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Antiinflammatory and Antiangiogenic Factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are several reports of reduction of inflammation with amniotic membrane.11 The&#xD;
           exact mechanism is not known. The amniotic membrane probably acts as a barrier against&#xD;
           the tear film resulting in a reduced amount of inflammatory cells and hence the amount&#xD;
           of inflammatory mediators.12 In addition, the presence of proteinase inhibitors may&#xD;
           promote healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Antimicrobial and Antiviral Properties:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Amniotic membrane seems to have antimicrobial properties that decrease the risk of&#xD;
           postoperative infection. It also contains cystatin E, an analogue of cysteine proteinase&#xD;
           inhibitors, which has complementary antiviral properties.13 Its antimicrobial and&#xD;
           possible antiviral properties warrant further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. High Hydraulic Conductivity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different layers of the placenta have been studied, and it has been found that the&#xD;
      amniotic membrane has a high hydraulic conductivity, thus facilitating its use in bleb repair&#xD;
      following glaucoma-filtering surgery.14 Amniotic membrane transplantation is currently being&#xD;
      used for a continuously widening spectrum of ophthalmic indications. Amniotic membrane&#xD;
      transplantation has been shown to be effective in the reconstruction of the corneal surface&#xD;
      in the setting of persistent epithelial defects, sterile corneal ulcerations, and partial&#xD;
      limbal stem cell (LSC) deficiency states, including those secondary to chemical or thermal&#xD;
      burns. The amniotic membrane has several properties that promote epithelialization and reduce&#xD;
      inflammation, and these have prompted its use in the management of persistent epithelial&#xD;
      defects,15,16 deep ulcers,17,18 neurotrophic ulcers,19 and perforations,20,21 with initial&#xD;
      success rates varying from 50% to 90%. Multiple layers of AM restore stromal thickness in&#xD;
      deep and perforated noninfectious ulcers and probably provides a substrate for collagens and&#xD;
      growth factors for epithelial healing. AMT was also used for huge pterygium or recurrent&#xD;
      pterygium.27 The limitations of AMT include continuous tissue destruction beneath the graft,&#xD;
      the need for adequate stem cells at the limbus and normal keratocytes in the surrounding&#xD;
      tissue, and intact sensory innervation for healing.15 In mild to moderate chemical injuries,&#xD;
      AMT restores corneal and conjunctival surfaces. It prevents symblepharon formation in severe&#xD;
      burns.22,23 In severe cases, owing to extensive ocular surface inflammation with deep stromal&#xD;
      ischemia and near-total destruction of the limbal stem cells, the amniotic membrane may at&#xD;
      best reduce inflammation, prevent further stem cell damage, and prevent symblepharon&#xD;
      formation in the acute stages. Joseph et al 24 describe the complete failure of AMT in 4&#xD;
      cases of acute grade 4 chemical burns with complete loss of vision in all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the development of cell therapy, amniotic membrane can be also used as a carrier of&#xD;
      limbal stem cells or their progeny, cultivated in vitro.2,25,26 Most recently, ex vivo&#xD;
      cultivation and expansion of limbal epithelial cells has been performed utilizing AM as a&#xD;
      matrix. However, the superiority of AMT over other treatment modalities in many of these&#xD;
      settings needs to be substantiated by controlled clinical trials.5 The use of amniotic&#xD;
      membrane in ophthalmic surgery has been shown to provide an alternative for corneal and&#xD;
      conjunctival reconstruction in many clinically challenging situations. It has without doubt&#xD;
      provided an option where previously none existed in some conditions. Nevertheless, it is has&#xD;
      its limitations and is not universally successful for every indication. The indications for&#xD;
      its use are ever increasing, often on anecdotal evidence. In some instances where it is&#xD;
      successfully used, existing and at times simpler options are equally effective. The&#xD;
      collective global experience with the membrane is now vast, and the field should now move&#xD;
      into proper randomized controlled studies to evaluate its true potential.1,2,28&#xD;
