      Proof of concept study is to compare the best corrected visual acuity obtained via&#xD;
      First-Sight lenses with the clinical &quot;gold standard&quot; of manifest refraction and&#xD;
      autorefraction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uncorrected refractive error is a frequent cause of visual impairment in the global&#xD;
      population. In 2006, the World Health Organization released global estimates on visual&#xD;
      impairment. According to their findings, there are approximately 314 million people in the&#xD;
      world whose vision is impaired. Of this population 90% of those individuals live in&#xD;
      developing countries and 153 million cases are believed to be due to uncorrected refractive&#xD;
      error. The impact of uncorrected refractive error is great, including, but not limited to,&#xD;
      loss of employment opportunities, inability to care for family, and inability to receive an&#xD;
      education. The challenge is to determine the most effective and accessible method of&#xD;
      detecting refractive error and dispensing spectacles for better vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical setting, refractive error is corrected by prescribing spectacles or contact&#xD;
      lenses on a daily basis. Typically the patient will first undergo autorefraction, in which a&#xD;
      computer-controlled machine is used to objectively calculate the refractive error present as&#xD;
      a starting point for the subjective refraction test. This machine, however, is cumbersome and&#xD;
      not easily transportable abroad. Typically the machine is held up to the patient's forehead&#xD;
      and they are asked to look into the machine at a distant object. While they are looking at&#xD;
      this object the machine calculates the refractive error. Next, the patient undergoes manifest&#xD;
      refraction, a subjective refractive test that requires the use of trial lenses and patient&#xD;
      responses to improve the results calculated by autorefraction, resulting in the best&#xD;
      corrected visual acuity for that patient and a prescription for the patient to receive&#xD;
      spectacles tailored to their need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a testimony to how prevalent uncorrected refractive error is in the developing world,&#xD;
      refractive error in Nigerian adults and the prevalence of spectacle use was studied. In an&#xD;
      article titled Refractive errors in Nigerian adults: prevalence, types and spectacle&#xD;
      coverage, researchers looked at types of refractive errors and the ability of off the shelf&#xD;
      spectacles to meet the corrective need in the 13,599 Nigerian adults. Patients underwent&#xD;
      autorefraction and a detailed clinical exam and it was discovered that uncorrected refractive&#xD;
      errors were responsible for 77.9% of visual impairment at the 20/40 to 20/60 level, and 57.1%&#xD;
      at the 20/60 to 20/200 level. It also found that spectacles could improve the vision of 1,279&#xD;
      adults in the 20/40 range and 882 participants at the 20/60 level. However, only 3-4% of&#xD;
      those individuals wore spectacles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First-Sight is a simplified way to correct refractive error. It is easily portable, making it&#xD;
      accessible to remote areas of the world. Unlike the study cited above, First-Sight can be&#xD;
      brought to remote areas where clinics are not available and patients are not able to afford&#xD;
      to pay for the clinic visit. As it is a simplified technique, local health care workers may&#xD;
      easily be able to learn how to use First-Sight and dispense spectacles to those in need.&#xD;
      Lastly, the sponsor of First-Sight will provide the refracting kits and custom-made&#xD;
      spectacles at no cost to the health care workers and patients.&#xD;
