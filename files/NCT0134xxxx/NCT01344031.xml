    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of MK 2206 (Akt inhibitor&#xD;
      MK2206) when given with anastrozole, fulvestrant, or anastrozole and fulvestrant in treating&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Estrogen&#xD;
      can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using anastrozole or fulvestrant&#xD;
      may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. Akt inhibitor&#xD;
      MK2206 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Giving Akt inhibitor MK2206 together with anastrozole, fulvestrant, or anastrozole&#xD;
      and fulvestrant may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MK-2206 in combination with anastrozole&#xD;
      based on toxicities observed during cycle 1 therapy. (Phase IA) II. To evaluate the&#xD;
      tolerability of prolonged administration (3 months) of MK-2206 in combination with&#xD;
      anastrozole at the MTD defined in Phase IA. (Phase IB) III. To determine the recommended&#xD;
      phase II treatment dosing (RPTD) of MK-2206 in combination with anastrozole based on&#xD;
      toxicities observed with prolonged drug administration. (Phase IB) IV. To determine the&#xD;
      tolerability of fulvestrant (Arm C), or fulvestrant plus anastrozole (Arm D), respectively,&#xD;
      in combination with MK-2206 (at the RPTD defined in Phase 1B). (Arms C and D) V. To determine&#xD;
      the recommended phase II treatment dose (RPTD) of fulvestrant (Arm C) or fulvestrant plus&#xD;
      anastrozole (Arm D), respectively, in combination with MK-2206 based on toxicities observed&#xD;
      with prolonged drug administration (3 months). (Arms C and D) VI. To evaluate the toxicity&#xD;
      profile of MK-2206 in combination with fulvestrant (Arm C) or fulvestrant plus anastrozole&#xD;
      (Arm D), respectively, with prolonged drug administration. (Arms C and D)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the toxicity profile of MK-2206 in combination with anastrozole, or&#xD;
      fulvestrant, or anastrozole plus fulvestrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the clinical benefit rate (CBR: complete response [CR]+partial response&#xD;
      [PR]+stable disease [SD] &gt; 6 months), response rate (CR+PR), and percent of patients&#xD;
      progression free at 6 months with the treatment of MK-2206 in combination with anastrozole,&#xD;
      or fulvestrant or anastrozole plus fulvestrant in patients with estrogen receptor positive&#xD;
      (ER+) metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine serum levels of estradiol prior to and following 1 cycle of MK-2206 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine baseline tumor specimens for alterations in phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase&#xD;
      (PI3K) and other pathway genes and to explore their relationship with treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the effect of MK-2206 on tumor cell v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene&#xD;
      homolog 1 (AKT) signaling, proliferation, and apoptosis using serially collected tumor&#xD;
      samples in available cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine changes in tumor cell glucose uptake by positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      with 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) at baseline and 24 h post day 1 MK-2206. (Phase&#xD;
      IA) IV. To examine the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit&#xD;
      alpha (PIK3CA) mutation status in circulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at baseline and&#xD;
      following study therapy and to correlate with tumor tissue PIK3CA status and treatment&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of Akt inhibitor MK2206 followed by a&#xD;
      recommended phase II dose (RPTD) study. Patients are assigned to the treatment arm that is&#xD;
      currently open.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive anastrozole orally (PO) on days 1-28. Beginning in course 2, patients&#xD;
      receive Akt inhibitor MK-2206 PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: The RPTD of Akt inhibitor MK2206 with anastrozole is determined after 3 courses,&#xD;
      administered as in Arm A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C: Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, fulvestrant&#xD;
      intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 and day 15 of course 1 and then on day 1 of each course in each&#xD;
      subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM D: Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 PO as in Arm A, anastrozole PO on days 1-28 and&#xD;
      fulvestrant IM on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: As of 8/19/2015, in all Arms, patients no longer receive Akt inhibitor MK2206.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

             Aromatase Inhibitor or Fulvestrant on NCI Protocol 8762,&quot; in which case the FES-PET in&#xD;
             Protocol 9167 has to be performed a minimum of 48 hours and a maximum of 30 days&#xD;
             before the first dose of MK-2206; in addition, all FES-related side effects must have&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of&#xD;
             similar chemical or biologic composition to MK-2206 or other agents used in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP 450 3A4) are&#xD;
             ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: one week washout period is required in patients who were previously taking&#xD;
                  strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 3A4; patients who are currently taking&#xD;
                  moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 3A4 are encouraged to switch to other&#xD;
                  medications that do not interact with CYP450 3A4&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with diabetes or in risk for hyperglycemia should not be excluded from trials&#xD;
             with MK-2206, but the hyperglycemia should be well controlled on oral agents before&#xD;
             the patient enters the trial (i.e. HbA1c =&lt; 8% and fasting glucose =&lt; 120 mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiovascular: baseline QT Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt; 450 msec (male) or QTcF &gt; 470&#xD;
             msec (female) will exclude patients from entry on study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would&#xD;
             limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing patients are excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive status are excluded&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have had disease progression on anastrozole (Phase IA and Phase IB),&#xD;
             fulvestrant (Arm C), both anastrozole and fulvestrant (Arm D) in either the&#xD;
             neoadjuvant, adjuvant (defined as disease recurrence identified within 6 months of&#xD;
             adjuvant discontinuation), or metastatic setting&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have had grade 3 or intolerable grade 2 adverse events during run-in&#xD;
             aromatase inhibitor (AI) or fulvestrant therapy prior to starting MK-2206&#xD;
