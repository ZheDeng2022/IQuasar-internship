    <textblock>
      The broad objective of this research is to effectively utilize a unique window of opportunity&#xD;
      during the hospitalization period following a recent suicide attempt to deliver a brief and&#xD;
      targeted intervention for suicidal individuals.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Suicide remains a serious public health problem as the 4th leading cause of death among&#xD;
      individuals 15-44 years old and the 2nd leading cause of death in the military. Developing&#xD;
      effective interventions for suicide behavior has been a stated goal of the National Strategy&#xD;
      for Suicide Prevention. To date, only a limited number of controlled studies have examined&#xD;
      the efficacy of psychosocial interventions in reducing suicide behavior. Preliminary findings&#xD;
      from the University of Pennsylvania (Brown et al., 2005) indicate that outpatient cognitive&#xD;
      therapy reduces the likelihood of repeat suicide attempts by approximately 50%. Yet the&#xD;
      efficacy of this promising new intervention has not been tested in other medical settings or&#xD;
      in other specific at risk groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose an adaptation of Beck and colleagues cognitive therapy suicide protocol for&#xD;
      implementation, feasibility, and pilot testing at an inpatient psychiatry setting for&#xD;
      specific delivery to military service members and their family members with a recent suicide&#xD;
      attempt. Suicide attempt behavior is one of the most powerful risk factors for repeat suicide&#xD;
      behavior as well as eventual death by suicide. Delivering a brief and possibly potent&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic intervention during a patient's inpatient hospitalization aims to directly&#xD;
      target individuals at high risk for future suicide behavior, i.e., young adult, mostly males&#xD;
      with a recent suicide attempt, under direct stress of a military career. We expect that the&#xD;
      adapted intervention, titled Post Admission Cognitive Therapy (PACT), will show promise in&#xD;
      reducing the likelihood of post-hospitalization suicide attempt behavior as well as&#xD;
      psychological risk factors associated with suicide such as depression, hopelessness, suicide&#xD;
      ideation, and posttraumatic symptoms. Our proposed design is a randomized controlled pilot&#xD;
      trial with blinded outcome assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: (1) To develop and evaluate a new manual of Post-Admission Cognitive Therapy&#xD;
      (PACT) as a targeted inpatient treatment for individuals admitted for a recent suicide&#xD;
      attempt to a military hospital. (2) To assess the feasibility of the study's assessment&#xD;
      procedures by monitoring the completion rate of outcome measures during face-to-face as well&#xD;
      as follow-up phone and web-based administrations. (3) To evaluate the degree of change and&#xD;
      variability of response to Post-Admission Cognitive Therapy in comparison to Enhanced Usual&#xD;
      Care at post-intervention and follow-up (1-, 2-, and 3-Month) on subsequent suicide attempt&#xD;
      behavior (primary outcome) as well as on levels of depression, hopelessness, and suicide&#xD;
      ideation (secondary outcomes). (4) To examine in a preliminary manner whether improvements on&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcome measures are associated with enhanced problem solving abilities&#xD;
      which is viewed as a potential mechanism of change in cognitive therapy for the reduction of&#xD;
      suicide behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: We plan to randomize 24 patients hospitalized at the Walter Reed National&#xD;
      Military Medical Center for a recent suicide attempt to one of two conditions: (1)&#xD;
      Post-Admission Cognitive Therapy + Enhanced Usual Care (PACT+EUC) or (2) Enhanced Usual Care&#xD;
      (EUC). Individuals who are over the age of 18, able to communicate in English and willing to&#xD;
      provide informed consent will be recruited. The PACT+EUC condition will consist of six 60-90&#xD;
      minute individual cognitive therapy sessions administered preferably over 3 days. The EUC&#xD;
      condition will consist of the usual care patients receive at an inpatient facility during&#xD;
      their hospitalization in addition to assessment services provided by independent evaluators&#xD;
      who work directly with our research team. The primary outcome variable is the number of&#xD;
      subsequent suicide attempts. We expect that patients in the control condition will reattempt&#xD;
      suicide at an earlier date and at a higher frequency as compared to patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      intervention condition. Secondary outcome measures include the severity of depression,&#xD;
      hopelessness, and suicide ideation. Patients in both conditions will be assessed on the&#xD;
      dependent measures at baseline and at 1-, 2-, and 3- month follow-up intervals. Data analyses&#xD;
      will provide estimates of the statistical power of PACT relative to EUC over time via the&#xD;
      usage of repeated observation data. Our preliminary effect size estimates will be used for&#xD;
      future sample size calculations to conduct a larger randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      definitively determine the efficacy of PACT.&#xD;
