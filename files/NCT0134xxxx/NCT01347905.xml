  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate if weight loss, in particular due to adipose&#xD;
      tissue loss, in obese patients will reverse the obesity-related reduction of iron absorption,&#xD;
      and if this is due to a decrease in hepcidin concentrations. Additionally, the investigators&#xD;
      will investigate changes in iron incorporation into erythrocytes due to a reduction of iron&#xD;
      sequestration by the adipose tissue and reticuloendothelial system. The investigators expect&#xD;
      that by decreasing adiposity, circulating hepcidin levels will decrease, iron absorption and&#xD;
      incorporation into erythrocytes will increase and as a result iron status will be improved.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until now adiposity has been associated with low iron status and with higher hepcidin levels.&#xD;
      Moreover, weight loss and thereby loss of fat mass, has been associated with decreased&#xD;
      hepcidin levels and improved iron status. However, until now no direct measures of iron&#xD;
      absorption or incorporation into erythrocytes have been assessed before and after losing&#xD;
      weight/fat mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body fat loss in obese women and men will improve iron absorption, corrected for iron&#xD;
           status, from a labeled test meal measured by using a stable isotopes technique by on&#xD;
           average 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body fat loss in obese women and men will decrease the related inflammatory state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  greater subclinical inflammation in obese women and men will be correlated with a&#xD;
           decreased incorporation of iron into erythrocytes, and that this will improve after loss&#xD;
           of body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective cohort in which iron bioavailability will be assessed in obese&#xD;
      women and men before and after weight loss and associated loss of body fat over a period of 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron absorption will be estimated using stable-isotope techniques where incorporation of 57Fe&#xD;
      and 58Fe into erythrocytes is measured 14 days after administration. Preparation of&#xD;
      isotopically labelled iron will be done at the Laboratory of Human Nutrition of the Swiss&#xD;
      Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zürich).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline venous blood sample will be drawn 6-8 weeks after the surgery when surgery-related&#xD;
      inflammation has been resolved. The subjects will receive a test drink, containing 6 mg of&#xD;
      57Fe labelled ferrous sulphate. One hour later, 2 ml of an aqueous solution containing 100 μg&#xD;
      58Fe as iron citrate in 250 cc of normal saline will be infused over 50 min. This infusion&#xD;
      protocol has been used safely and successfully to examine iron metabolism in both adults and&#xD;
      infants. Fourteen days later, a second venous blood sample will be drawn. This procedure will&#xD;
      be performed at baseline (6-8 weeks post-surgery) and at the end of the study (6 months post&#xD;
      baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study could provide important information to establish the mechanism by which&#xD;
      obesity-mediated inflammation could induce iron deficiency. This will be the first human&#xD;
      trial that will evaluate if the obesity-related reduction of iron absorption is reversible in&#xD;
      a context where obesity and iron deficiency are both highly prevalent.&#xD;
