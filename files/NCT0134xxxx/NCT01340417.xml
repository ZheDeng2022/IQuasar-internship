      The general goal of the present study is to examine the developmental changes caused by&#xD;
      melatonin in preterm and term newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major brain lesions associated with cerebral palsy and cognitive impairment in preterm&#xD;
      infants are periventricular white matter damage (WMD). At the present time, despite major&#xD;
      improvements in neonatal care, there are no established therapeutic regimens for the&#xD;
      treatment of brain lesions in preterms. Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland;&#xD;
      melatonin's neuroprotective action has been well documented in animal experimental models.&#xD;
      Neuroprotection is believed to stem from its direct free radical scavenging, indirect&#xD;
      antioxidant activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Originality Several reports have described melatonin secretion in older children, but only a&#xD;
      few have observed melatonin concentrations during the first year of life. Very little is&#xD;
      known about the fetal pineal melatonin synthesis and nothing at what prenatal age melatonin&#xD;
      synthesis starts. Premature infants have a 3 months delay in the development of melatonin&#xD;
      rhythmicity compared to full-term infants. One study found discordant data with decreasing&#xD;
      melatonin value around term. The absence of longitudinal study and the low number of children&#xD;
      included make the interpretation difficult of the secretion of melatonin at the newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Infants born before 28 weeks gestation have melatonin deficiency (50pg/ml),&#xD;
      compared to newborns at term (100pg/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: prospective, longitudinal, multicenter trial in 3 Neonatal Intensive Care Units&#xD;
      in Ile de France. Specific aim is to compare the developmental changes of melatonin in&#xD;
      preterm and term newborns (200 infants and their mothers: 4 groups of 50 infants: 24-27GA +6d&#xD;
      ; 28-32 GA +6d ; 33-36 GA +6d ; 37-41 GA +6d). Secondary aims are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine Melatonin creatinin excretion in preterm infants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  correlate between serum melatonin secretion and urinary melatonin and&#xD;
           6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine endogenous melatonin production in the human pineal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  correlate genetic variations between different levels of melatonin in premature infants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess clinical and neurological outcomes at term Clinical impact The present clinical&#xD;
           project is part of a translational approach, expected data for infants born before 28&#xD;
           weeks gestation is melatonin deficiency which should participate in determining the&#xD;
           potential use of melatonin as a neuroprotectant in human preterm neonates.&#xD;

      The general goal of the present study is to examine the developmental changes caused by&#xD;
      melatonin in preterm compared to term newborns. This secretion is studied in child and&#xD;
      mother's blood, child's urine, the mother's milk for the women who breastfeed (200 infants&#xD;
      and their mothers: 4 groups of 50 infants: 24-27 gestational age (GA) +6d ; 28-32 GA +6d ;&#xD;
      33-36 GA +6d ; 37-41 GA +6d). Secondary aims are the following: determine Melatonin creatinin&#xD;
      excretion in preterm infants, correlate between serum melatonin secretion and urinary&#xD;
      melatonin and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion, determine endogenous melatonin production in&#xD;
      the human pineal, correlate genetic variations between different levels of melatonin in&#xD;
      premature infants, assess clinical and neurological outcomes at term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration for each patient Study duration is one year (inclusion time: 9 months)&#xD;
      Duration of mother's inclusion:3 days if delivery between 34 and 41+6d weeks of gestation&#xD;
      (two blood samples in maternal vein and umbilical vein after delivery and one mother's milk&#xD;
      sample on the third day after delivery, D3) 15 days to 3 months if delivery between 24 and&#xD;
      33+6d weeks of gestation (two blood samples in maternal vein and umbilical vein after&#xD;
      delivery and mother's milk sample on the third day after delivery,D10-D15, D30, D60 until&#xD;
      term age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of infant's inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 days if delivery between 34 and 41+6d weeks of gestation (1 blood sample on the third&#xD;
           day (D3) after delivery and 4 urinary samples at birth and on D3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15 days to 3 months if delivery between 24 and 33+6d weeks of gestation (blood and&#xD;
           urinary samples on the third day after delivery,D10-D15, D30, D60 until term (37-42&#xD;
           weeks gestational age)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population study All the preterm and term newborns in 3 participating centers, will be&#xD;
      evaluated in term of eligibility. Their clinical characteristics will be compared to the&#xD;
      criteria of inclusion and exclusion before entering into the study. The inclusion of the&#xD;
      preterm from 24 GA is justified by the assumption of responsibility of more in earlier of&#xD;
      this population in 2009 (limit of viability from 24 GA and/or birth weight &gt; 500g).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group of the term infants (37-41 GA +6d) will correspond to the inclusion of new-born&#xD;
      babies in good health in maternity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis The quantitative variables will be described in the form of average&#xD;
      (standard deviation) or median (quartiles) according to their Gaussian nature or not. The&#xD;
      qualitative variables will be described by their manpower and frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyzes of criteria of judgment The principal analysis will compare the rate of children&#xD;
      deprived of melatonin between the 4 groups. This comparison will be carried out by a test of&#xD;
      the chi-2 or Fisher if suitable. Nevertheless this analysis will be refined by modeling the&#xD;
      plasmatic secretion according to the gestational age and of the hour of melatonin&#xD;
      measurement. This modeling will use either a mixed model, or a nonlinear model like the&#xD;
      models used into pharmacokinetic. In the same way will be modeled the urinary levels of&#xD;
      melatonin and in the mother's milk by taking of account the same parameters as previously and&#xD;
      the repetition of the measurements. Some parameters will be used like variables of adjustment&#xD;
      like the luminous environment, the preeclampsia, the sex, the intrauterine growth restricted&#xD;
      infants, multiple pregnancies, the way of childbirth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan of statistical analysis will be finalized at the end of the study and before data&#xD;
      management and will be the subject of Master into biostatistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of cortisol, parameters of the ionogram, urea, creatinin, serotonin will be&#xD;
      compared between the 4 groups by using parametric tests (ANOVA) or not parametric&#xD;
      (KRUSKALL-Wallis) according to the Gaussian nature or not of the variables. The other&#xD;
      measurements (blood, urines) will be described in the course of time according to gestational&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyzes will be carried out with software SAS 9.02 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present clinical project is part of a translational approach, expected data for infants&#xD;
      born before 28 weeks gestation is melatonin deficiency which should participate, in addition&#xD;
      with existing data and other ongoing studies in an animal model, in determining the potential&#xD;
      use of melatonin as a neuroprotectant in human preterm neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's important to underline that this study must be considered as an interventional study.&#xD;
      Indeed, in this study patients have many takings modality while in common practice patients&#xD;
      haven't those takings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measurements of melatonin levels in urine, blood, milk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measurements of Serum Cortisol concentrations and urinary excretion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measurements of Serum Serotonin level&#xD;
