      Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS) is a condition causing numbness, tingling and weakness in&#xD;
      patient's upper limbs. Symptoms are due to compression and restriction of the nerves and&#xD;
      blood vessels (neurovascular bundle) that extend from the neck into the upper limb exerted by&#xD;
      a patient's various anatomical structures. Neurovascular bundle compression can result in&#xD;
      decreased nerve conduction and blood flow through the arteries supplying structures&#xD;
      downstream from the restricted site. These anatomical restrictions include tight scalene&#xD;
      muscles in the neck, tightened pectorialis minor muscle in the chest and extra ribs growing&#xD;
      from the C7 vertebra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TOS can be diagnosed by using special tests designed to re-elicit neurovascular bundle&#xD;
      compression. Upon obtaining a positive test, the patient can undergo osteopathic manipulative&#xD;
      treatments (OMT) to change the anatomical restrictions allowing for a decrease of symptoms&#xD;
      and even eradication of the syndrome altogether.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although diagnosis and treatment of TOS is common in osteopathic medicine, the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the diagnostic special tests and treatment has not been thoroughly investigated. This&#xD;
      study aims to examine the effectiveness of the special tests (Adson's, Wright's&#xD;
      hyperabduction and Halstead maneuver) in diagnosing a change in blood flow through the&#xD;
      arteries of the upper arm compared to evaluation with Doppler ultrasound to measure blood&#xD;
      flow while the tests are performed. Patients with positive tests will be treated with OMT&#xD;
      including myofascial release, soft tissue, and articulation to relieve restricting&#xD;
      structures. Upon completion of treatment, the special tests will be performed again along&#xD;
      with the Doppler ultrasound to measure blood flow through blood vessels. Results then are&#xD;
      analyzed statistically for significance of the ability correctly diagnose and treat TOS&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study will contribute towards the validity of teaching special tests in&#xD;
      osteopathic medical schools and allow for a non-invasive treatment protocol for patients with&#xD;
      TOS.&#xD;

      In today's hectic society it becomes a great disadvantage to individuals when they develop&#xD;
      pain and discomfort that decreases their ability to function efficiently. Thoracic Outlet&#xD;
      Syndrome (TOS) is a condition that causes pain in the upper extremity, typically extending&#xD;
      along the inner aspect of the arm and hand. Other symptoms include weakness, numbness and&#xD;
      tingling in the upper extremity. A neurovascular bundle that consists of the brachial plexus,&#xD;
      subclavian artery and vein travels from the neck into the arm. TOS symptoms result when the&#xD;
      nerves or blood vessels are compressed by the surrounding anatomical structures. In&#xD;
      performing this research study, our team would like to improve awareness of TOS to all health&#xD;
      care professionals as an entrapment neuropathy and differential diagnosis to neck pain with&#xD;
      referred pain. We would also like to bring osteopathic medicine, physical therapy and other&#xD;
      paradigms of musculoskeletal manual medicine/therapy together to develop a standardized and&#xD;
      valid approach to the diagnosis and treatment of TOS which is not currently available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are multiple possible causes of TOS, majority of which results in anatomic&#xD;
      restrictions. These possible causes include trauma to the shoulder girdle and more commonly&#xD;
      postural disturbances. Individuals with TOS often sit at a computer or desk for an extended&#xD;
      period of time for work or school. They develop rounded shoulders and a forward head carriage&#xD;
      which changes the length and tone of certain muscles and the relationship of structures in&#xD;
      relation to the neurovascular bundle. The anatomic disturbances that contribute and is of the&#xD;
      greatest interest to osteopathy includes hypertonicity of the anterior and middle scalene&#xD;
      muscles in the neck, hypertonicity of the pectorialis muscle from the upper extremity to the&#xD;
      3-5th ribs, somatic dysfunctions of the clavicle, upper thoracic region and ribs (especially&#xD;
      the first rib) (Ward, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TOS is often the resulting diagnosis after elimination of other possible conditions that&#xD;
      cause similar symptoms. These other possible conditions include disc herniations,&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, tumors and nerve entrapment syndromes such as carpal tunnel syndrome.&#xD;
      Currently discrepancies exist between clinicians about the correct approaches to diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment of TOS. Today's technological advancements can help provide more information&#xD;
      about the patient's anatomy, however none can be used for diagnosis alone. MRIs are usually&#xD;
      best used for confirmation for the evaluation of the region of interest, however in TOS,&#xD;
      findings are frequently inconclusive. One reason for this may be the difficulty to evaluate&#xD;
      the extent of a muscle spasm or rib somatic dysfunction and the degree to which it is&#xD;
      compressing a nerve structure. (Koknel 2005). X-rays are used to eliminate extra ribs in the&#xD;
      cervical region as a cause for symptoms. Anomalous cervical ribs are found in 0.17% to 0.74%&#xD;
      each year, however, only 10% of individuals experience TOS symptoms and the onset of these&#xD;
      symptoms often relates to cervical spine trauma (Novak, Mackinnon, 2002). The diagnosis of&#xD;
      TOS remains to be best based on the patient's subjective complaints, physical examination and&#xD;
      the exclusion of other pathologies (Novak, Mackinnon, 2002). Clinical assessment of TOS is&#xD;
      best achieved by reproduction of symptoms with compression and special orthopaedic&#xD;
      provocative tests that re-produces symptoms based on patient position (Koknel, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These orthopedic special tests will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wright Test (See picture appendix 2): Wright Test, or Hyperabduction Test, is done by&#xD;
      bringing the arm into full abduction with the shoulder externally rotated and the elbow&#xD;
      extended while monitoring the radial pulse throughout (Magee DJ, 2008). If there is a&#xD;
      decrease or absence of pulse the test is positive showing that axillary artery is compressed&#xD;
      by either the pectoralis minor muscle or the coracoid process. (KÃ¶knel Talu G, 2005)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adson Test (See picture appendix 3): For Adson Maneuver the examiner externally rotates and&#xD;
      extends the effected arm with the elbow extended while monitoring the radial pulse. The&#xD;
      patient is then instructed to rotate the head toward the affected side, extend the neck and&#xD;
      take a deep breath and hold it. The absence of disappearance of a pulse indicates a positive&#xD;
      test (Magee DJ, 2008). In 1947, Adson first described this test with the explanation that an&#xD;
      alteration of the radial pulse or an alteration in blood pressure is considered a&#xD;
      pathognomonic sign of scalenus anticus syndrome indicating that the vascular component of&#xD;
      neurovascular bundle is compressed by scalenus anticus muscle. (Mackinnon SE, 2002)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Halstead Maneuver (See picture appendix 4): The Reverse-Adson Maneuver, or Halstead Maneuver,&#xD;
      is also done with the patient's arm externally rotated and extended with the elbow extended.&#xD;
      The examiner monitors the radial pulse as the patient rotates the head away from the affected&#xD;
      side and extends the neck. The patient is instructed to take a deep breath and hold it. The&#xD;
      absence or disappearance of a pulse indicates a positive test a suggesting the presence of a&#xD;
      cervical rib (Magee DJ, 2008)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Roos Test (See picture appendix 5): This test will be used to screen interested participants&#xD;
      during the recruitment phase. The patient stands and abducts the arms to 90 degrees,&#xD;
      externally rotates the shoulder and flexes the elbows to 90 degrees. The patient is then&#xD;
      directed to open and close the hands slowly for three minutes. A positive test will cause&#xD;
      increased symptoms such as ischemic pain, heaviness or profound weakness of the arm or&#xD;
      numbness and tingling of the hand. Minor fatigue is considered a negative test. (Magee DJ,&#xD;
      2008) Positive findings indicate compression of the neurovascular bundle specific to&#xD;
      structures in the thoracic outlet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous studies testing the efficacy of the TOS special tests, Doppler ultrasonography&#xD;
      was shown to visualize vascular abnormalities and confirmed the diagnosis in patients with at&#xD;
      least five positive provocative (special) tests. (Gillard, Perez-Cousin, Hachulla, Remy et al&#xD;
      2001). Our research team would like to confirm this previous finding and further expand on&#xD;
      this topic by examining for the changes in blood flow with Doppler ultrasonography during the&#xD;
      performance of these special tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic ultrasound has been in use since the late 1950s. There are no confirmed adverse&#xD;
      biological effects on patients from this usage. Although no hazard has been identified that&#xD;
      would limit the use of diagnostic ultrasound on patients in education and research,&#xD;
      experience from normal diagnostic practice may or may not experience hazards due to extended&#xD;
      exposure times and altered conditions. Participants enrolled in this study will be informed&#xD;
      about the anticipated exposure conditions and how these compare with normal diagnostic&#xD;
      practice (AIUM, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to evaluation of the effectiveness of the TOS special tests, the effects of&#xD;
      Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) to help alleviate TOS symptoms is also of interest.&#xD;
      OMT of TOS is directed towards improving mechanics of the cervical, upper thoracic spine,&#xD;
      upper ribs, clavicles and muscles of the neck, shoulder and pectoral girdle. OMT procedures&#xD;
      such as myofascial release and articulatory techniques can be useful in reducing the&#xD;
      dysfunctions of these regions which is causing compression on the nerve. Myofascial release&#xD;
      involves manipulating the soft tissues, articulation is taking a joint through its available&#xD;
      range of motion to improve its normal physiological movement (Ward, 2003). By performing this&#xD;
      research we can improve the body of research in osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) and&#xD;
      provide a proven means of treating the pain experienced by individuals with TOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TOS diagnosis and treatment is taught to osteopathic medical students, physical therapy&#xD;
      students as well as other health professionals that employ manual therapy strategies to&#xD;
      diagnose and treat musculoskeletal disorders. Despite this information being included as part&#xD;
      of the education of these health care professionals, there is little literature outside of&#xD;
      patient anecdotes that supports the reliability and validity of these tests and treatments.&#xD;
      We hope to contribute towards increasing the evidence of these tests and treatments for TOS&#xD;
      to ensure that students especially those at the health professions division at NSU will be&#xD;
      educated on reliable and proven orthopaedic/special tests and to extrapolate our results to&#xD;
      all educators and health care professionals that diagnose TOS.&#xD;
