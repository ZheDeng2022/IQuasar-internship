  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding on the brain due to a ruptured aneurysm) is a&#xD;
      serious condition with a high morbidity (incidence of having ill health) and mortality&#xD;
      (death). There are approximately 11 cases per 100,000 in the population per year, and&#xD;
      approximately 40% of these cases are fatal. (Ingall) Among the fortunate subjects who survive&#xD;
      the initial bleed, vasospasm and subsequent stroke are a major cause of morbidity. Vasospasm&#xD;
      is defined as a prolonged severe, although reversible cause of arterial narrowing that occurs&#xD;
      after bleeding into the subarachnoid space, most commonly after aneurysmal rupture. (Youman)&#xD;
      The reduced arterial diameter inhibits blood flow and deprives the brain of oxygen, which&#xD;
      often results in a stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vasospasm is a major problem when treating subjects with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.&#xD;
      For these reasons, it is essential to diagnose cerebral vasospasm early, before permanent&#xD;
      deficits develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be another option to solve this dilemma. The field of neuro-monitoring&#xD;
      (neurological monitoring) has the technology available to continuously monitor brain activity&#xD;
      of these sedated ICU subjects. This may allow for early diagnosis and possibly identify&#xD;
      changes in neurologic function before they become symptomatic. In the past, neuro-monitoring&#xD;
      was primarily used in the operating room to monitor neurologic function during surgery in and&#xD;
      around the spinal cord. Surgery to the spine or spinal cord also carries its own form of&#xD;
      risk, either from mechanical trauma to the spinal cord or its nerve roots, or from&#xD;
      interruption of the blood supply to these structures. Should damage to nerve fibers occur,&#xD;
      the end result could be paralysis, loss of sensation, and onset of severe burning (i.e.&#xD;
      neuropathic) pain. The field of intraoperative neuro-monitoring (IOM) was developed to&#xD;
      address these risks during spine surgery, whereby nerves rostral (toward the head) or caudal&#xD;
      (toward the feet) to the site of surgery are stimulated (usually via electrical pulses) and&#xD;
      signals are recorded from the side opposite to the site of stimulation. Thus, the signals&#xD;
      carried by nerve fibers are forced to pass through the region at risk from the surgery. In&#xD;
      the event that changes in nerve responses are seen, the surgical team is notified, and they&#xD;
      can change what they're doing to try and restore signals, thereby preserving function in the&#xD;
      nerve fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This same technology has been used in the neurosurgical ICU to monitor subjects with severe&#xD;
      brain injury from trauma, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Using&#xD;
      continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring combined with somatosensory evoked&#xD;
      potentials (SSEPs) (a type of neuro monitoring) has been used to determine prognosis,&#xD;
      identify subjects in subclinical status epilepticus (state of brain being in a constant&#xD;
      seizure), predict elevations in the intracranial pressure Increased pressure within the&#xD;
      skull), and diagnose cerebral hypoxia (not enough oxygen in the brain) (Amantini)&#xD;

      Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a serious condition with a high morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. There are approximately 11 cases per 100,000 population per year, and&#xD;
      approximately 40% of these cases are fatal. (Ingall) Among the fortunate subjects who survive&#xD;
      the initial bleed, vasospasm and subsequent stroke are a major cause of morbidity. Vasospasm&#xD;
      is defined as a prolonged severe, although reversible cause of arterial narrowing that occurs&#xD;
      after bleeding into the subarachnoid space, most commonly after aneurismal rupture. (Youman)&#xD;
      The reduced arterial diameter inhibits blood flow and deprives the brain of oxygen, which&#xD;
      often results in a stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vasospasm is a major problem when treating subjects with aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage.&#xD;
      Up to 75% of subjects with aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage will develop vasospasm, and 30%&#xD;
      of subarachnoid hemorrhage subjects will become clinically symptomatic, with muscle weakness&#xD;
      as the primary symptom. (Dorsch) Even with intervention, 12% of patents with symptomatic&#xD;
      vasospasm will develop permanent clinical deficits (after a ruptured aneurysm) including&#xD;
      hemiplegia, aphasias, and visual loss. Less severe strokes may lead to modest loss of&#xD;
      strength and sensation on one side of the body, and/or deterioration in higher brain&#xD;
      functions, such as memory, speech comprehension, and planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous Neuro-monitoring has previously been used in the trauma ICU setting as a means to&#xD;
      detect deterioration in brain function after closed head injury (Amantini, Daubin), ischemic&#xD;
      encephalopathy (Hakimi) and in subjects with MCA stroke to determine function (Tzvetanov). It&#xD;
      was also observed that monitoring changes occur prior to ICP elevations in critically ill&#xD;
      subjects (Amantini). These studies have demonstrated the feasibility as well as the safety of&#xD;
      monitoring in an ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No studies to date have attempted monitoring for vasospasm in subjects who suffered an&#xD;
      aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Motor evoked potential have also not been trialed in the&#xD;
      ICU, although MEP may be more useful to determine both cerebral ischemia, as well as&#xD;
      functional outcome.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        All adult subjects who have a subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm and require&#xD;
        high levels of sedation, or a poor neurologic exam and mechanical ventilation will be&#xD;
        eligible for the study. Hunt and Hess Grade 4 and 5(worst grades; highest mortality;&#xD;
        highest level of dependence if survived) subarachnoid hemorrhage subjects by definition&#xD;
        have a severely depressed exam, and will require intubation and mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
        Those subjects whose respiratory status deteriorates necessitating intubation and high&#xD;
        levels of sedation will also qualify.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects who have subarachnoid hemorrhage from undetermined source, such as angiogram&#xD;
        negative subarachnoid hemorrhage, those who have a reliable neurological exam such as Hunt&#xD;
        and Hess grade 1-3 subarachnoid hemorrhage subjects, and those who are intubated, but&#xD;
        require minimal sedation and therefore have a consistent neurological exam will be excluded&#xD;
        from the study. Also, any subject that has a body temperature of less then 32 degrees&#xD;
        Celsius will be excluded.&#xD;
