  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that early aggressive use of medicines may stop rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      (RA)or slow its damage. The key to this is to find people with early symptoms which could be&#xD;
      RA and have them get a diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit persons who've gone to the internet looking for information about&#xD;
      their symptoms. After answering a screening survey, the person with possible symptoms will be&#xD;
      linked to the study website for a more detailed symptom questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing that questionnaire the person will receive information about the second part&#xD;
      of the study which includes an examination with a rheumatologist (arthritis doctor)and&#xD;
      laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the joint examination and laboratory tests, the rheumatologist will tell the person&#xD;
      the likelihood of having RA, and make recommendations and if needed a referral for care and&#xD;
      treatment. Treatment is not a part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also compare the information on the subject's questionnaires to the doctor's&#xD;
      joint examination and the laboratory tests with the hope of developing a simple inexpensive&#xD;
      case finding questionnaire.&#xD;
