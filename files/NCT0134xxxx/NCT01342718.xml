      The aims of this study are to investigate the effect of famous herbal formula extract and&#xD;
      probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, and to determine whether these two&#xD;
      experimental items affect intestinal permeability and the composition of intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder characterized by&#xD;
      abdominal pain and alteration of bowel habits in the absence of structural abnormality, has a&#xD;
      prevalence of approximately 15% in western populations1,2. Patients with IBS can be&#xD;
      classified by their predominant bowel habits: diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS),&#xD;
      constipation-predominant IBS, or IBS with alternating bowel movements3. Although&#xD;
      smooth-muscle relaxants, bulking agents, and anti-diarrheal agents are commonly used as&#xD;
      conventional IBS treatments, many IBS patients turn to alternative treatments because of the&#xD;
      lack of therapeutic advantages of these treatments4. Therefore, the development of a new&#xD;
      therapy is necessary for IBS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gwakhyangjeonggisan (GJS; Kkako-shoki-san in Kampo Medicine; Huoxiang-zhengqi-san in&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese Medicine), which was recorded originally in the famous ancient herbal&#xD;
      formula literature &quot;Formularies of the Bureau of people's Welfare Pharmacies&quot;, consists of 13&#xD;
      common crude herbs. GJS contains the chemical ingredients naringin, hesperidin, thymol,&#xD;
      honokiol and magnolol5. GJS has been shown to protect intestinal barrier function6, contract&#xD;
      the colonic muscle7, and regulate infectious diarrhea8 in vivo. In traditional Korean&#xD;
      medicine, this herbal formula has long been used for relieving abdominal pain, diarrhea, and&#xD;
      vomiting as an over-the-counter or prescribed medicine9-11. However, there have been no&#xD;
      clinical trials to investigate the efficacy of GJS in IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics are defined as viable microorganisms, which confer potential health benefits on&#xD;
      the host when taken in proper amounts12. They are easily available, do not require a&#xD;
      prescription, and are administered extensively for the relief of abdominal symptoms13.&#xD;
      According to a recent systematic review and meta-analysis study, probiotics caused a modest&#xD;
      improvement in the overall IBS symptoms14. The rationale for using probiotics for IBS is&#xD;
      based on the assumption that they modify the composition of the intestinal microflora15 and&#xD;
      regulate intestinal permeability by modulating the epithelial tight junctions16. Duolac7S&#xD;
      (DUO), a probiotic mixture, contains 7 bacterial species including Bifidobacterium,&#xD;
      Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus. Each of these bacterial species is reportedly beneficial&#xD;
      for IBS17. DUO has been approved by the Korean Food and Drug Administration for restoring the&#xD;
      ecological balance of intestinal microflora and improving intestinal symptoms18. Although DUO&#xD;
      has been widely used as an over-the-counter product for IBS-related symptoms, no clinical&#xD;
      trials have investigated the efficacy of DUO on IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, several herbal formulas and probiotics have been simultaneously administered to IBS&#xD;
      patients for relieving abdominal symptoms19. In addition to lack of clinical evidence for the&#xD;
      use of GJS or DUO, the efficacy of their combined treatment for IBS has not been elucidated.&#xD;
      Thus, there is a need to evaluate the safety and efficacy of administration of GJS, DUO, or a&#xD;
      combination therapy as a frequently used treatment for IBS. In the current trial, we&#xD;
      identified the safety and efficacy of GJS, DUO, or a combination therapy on D-IBS by&#xD;
      evaluating IBS symptoms and quality of life. To investigate their mechanisms in humans,&#xD;
      intestinal permeability and composition of intestinal microbiota were assessed.&#xD;
