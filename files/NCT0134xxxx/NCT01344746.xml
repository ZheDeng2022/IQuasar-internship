    <textblock>
      Our goals are to demonstrate an active leukotrienes (LTs) mediated inflammatory response is&#xD;
      involved in pathophysiology of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), and to provide a theoretical&#xD;
      evidence for LTs modify therapy in treating pediatric patients with SDB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have hypothesized that the pathophysiology of pediatric SDB involves&#xD;
      specific systemic and local upper airway inflammatory response mediated by LTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. LT concentration assays reveal higher levels in serum for both leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and&#xD;
           cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) and in morning urine for LTE4 of SDB children, in&#xD;
           comparison to healthy ones, and LTs productions emerge disease severity-dependent&#xD;
           increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is a positive correlation between LTs production and other systemic markers such&#xD;
           as neutrophil counts and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Children with SDB have higher leukotriene receptor-1 (LT1-R) and leukotriene receptor-2&#xD;
           (LT2-R) expressions in adenotonsillar tissues of SDB children compared to recurrent&#xD;
           infectious tonsillitis subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Levels of LTs are positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) z-score, waist height&#xD;
           ratio (WHtR), adenotonsillar size and polysomnography (PSG) indices including&#xD;
           apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), obstructive apnea index (OAI), oxygen desaturation index&#xD;
           (ODI), arousal index, percentage of time spend saturation lower than 90% (SLT90%) and&#xD;
           negatively correlated with mean and minimal pulse oximetric saturation (SpO2), which&#xD;
           indicates synergistic role of obesity and hypoxia are the determinants of LTs production&#xD;
           in SDB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In adenotonsillar mixed cell culture system, the addition of LTs can increase cellular&#xD;
           proliferation rates and exhibit dose-dependent responses, whereas leukotriene receptor&#xD;
           antagonists (LTRAs) elicit dose-dependent cellular reductions.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SDB in children markedly differs from that seen in adults, in particular with respect to&#xD;
      clinical manifestations, PSG (Polysomnography) findings, and treatment approaches. Pediatric&#xD;
      SDB is due to a combination of increased upper airway resistance and repetitive pharyngeal&#xD;
      collapsibility leading to intermittent hypoxemia and arousals during sleep. It is a common&#xD;
      and highly prevalent disorder in pediatric age, affecting 4 to 11% of all children. If left&#xD;
      untreated, it can result in serious morbid consequences including cardiovascular morbidity&#xD;
      and neurocognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms leading to SDB in childhood have not been&#xD;
      clearly elucidated, but may include a complex interplay between anatomic (mainly&#xD;
      adenotonsillar hypertrophy, ATH), neuromuscular factors and an underlying genetic&#xD;
      predisposition toward the disease. However, more evidences have identified that both local&#xD;
      airway and systemic inflammation also contribute to its pathogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among major inflammatory mediators, leukotrienes (LTs) are a class of closely structurally&#xD;
      related lipid compounds that derive from the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid&#xD;
      metabolism. The LTs family includes LTA4, LTB4 and LTC4/D4/E4 (cysLTs), all of which are&#xD;
      potent leukocytes chemoattractants and activators. LTA4, an unstable intermediate, can be&#xD;
      further metabolized to LTB4 or cysLTs. LTC4 and LTD4 both have very short half-lives, whereas&#xD;
      LTE4 appears to be most stable. The effects of mediators occur after their interaction with&#xD;
      receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent investigations in western countries have revealed LTs may be involved in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of SDB, and accelerate the progress of the disease by exacerbating local&#xD;
      inflammatory response, then promoting the proliferation of the upper airway lymphoid tissues.&#xD;
      And in the later pediatric investigation, it was determined that LTs production emerged&#xD;
      disease severity-dependent increases in exhaled breath condensate of SDB patients.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, few studies have investigated the role of LTs in systemic inflammation of SDB,&#xD;
      and whether LTs productions is a independent risk factor of SDB, or is a obesity-dependent or&#xD;
      ATH -dependent risk factor of SDB remains controversial. Moreover, no research work in China&#xD;
      has been carried out to investigate the LTs pathway in a large population of Chinese snoring&#xD;
      children with SDB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive children referred to the sleep center for PSG due to symptoms of SDB from&#xD;
      December 2009 to June 2010 were enrolled in the study. Normal age-, sex-, and weight-matched&#xD;
      children without a history of snoring participated as control subjects, who were recruited&#xD;
      from a community-based physical check-up activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grouping:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five groups of participants were formed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Snoring group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects with snoring and AHI ≥ 20 episodes/h (severe SDB).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Snorers with AHI &lt; 20 episodes/h and ≥ 5 episodes/h (moderate SDB)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Snorers with AHI &lt; 5 episodes/h and ≥ 1 episodes/h (mild SDB)&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Non-snoring control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When testing serum and urinal samples, healthy children without snoring will be chosen&#xD;
           as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When testing lymphoid tissue samples, patients with recurrent infectious tonsillitis (at&#xD;
           least five tonsillar infections in less than 6 months) but without snoring will be&#xD;
           selected as controls before surgery and recruited to the study, because adenotonsillar&#xD;
           tissue can't be obtained from normal children for obvious ethical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The five study groups having at least 45 participants respectively will be compared regarding&#xD;
      subjects' characteristics, PSG indices, metabolic and inflammatory variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data are presented as mean ± SD or median (interquartile range) depending on the&#xD;
           distribution unless stated otherwise. PSG indexes, hsCRP values and LT concentrations&#xD;
           will be log-transformed (natural logarithm) and SpO2 will be logit-transformed to&#xD;
           correct for skewed distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc tests for pair comparisons (Bonferroni&#xD;
           test) will be used for continuous variables and X2 test (Yates correction) for&#xD;
           categorical characteristics. If data can't be transformed to approach normal&#xD;
           distribution, Kruskal-Wallis test followed by nonparametric Bonferroni multiple&#xD;
           comparison test will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Correlations will be analyzed without adjustment by using Pearson correlation or&#xD;
           spearman rank test depending on data distribution. Partial correlation will be applied&#xD;
           to assess the linear association of LTs concentrations with other systemic inflammatory&#xD;
           marks and PSG indices after adjustment for covariates including age, glucose, lipids,&#xD;
           and BMI z-score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Stepwise multiple regressions will be performed to identify independent predictors of&#xD;
           LTs production.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. All statistical analyses will be conducted using statistical software (version 16.0;&#xD;
           SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Using Dunnett's test, a two-tailed p value &lt; 0.01 was&#xD;
           considered statistically significant.&#xD;
