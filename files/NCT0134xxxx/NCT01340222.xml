  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The threat of preterm labour (PTL) is the first cause of hospitalization in the course of&#xD;
      pregnancy. Its diagnostic is based on clinical examination with a positive predictive value&#xD;
      of about 40 %. The role of the Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in delivery has been&#xD;
      suggested by its secretion in the amniotic fluid during labour and by the increase in the&#xD;
      expression of its RNA messengers in the peripheral maternal blood. We have also shown that&#xD;
      the proportion of MCP-1-expressing monocytes is higher in women with vaginal delivery&#xD;
      compared with those with caesarean delivery prior the onset of labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES : Primary To seek link between the respective proportions of circulating maternal&#xD;
      monocyte and lymphocyte subpopulations and the true onset of PTL characterised by delivery&#xD;
      occurring within 7 days post admission. Secondary: to (1) compare the predictive values of&#xD;
      these new markers with those currently used, e.g. quantification of fœtal fibronectin and&#xD;
      assessment of cervical length and effacement, (2) Compare the respective proportions of&#xD;
      monocytes and lymphocyte subpopulations in maternal blood and fœtal membranes, (3) determine&#xD;
      if a correlation exists between the activation markers expressed by maternal monocyte and&#xD;
      lymphocyte subpopulations and the neonatal outcomes of preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: 200 patients with a singleton pregnancy between 24 and 34 weeks of&#xD;
      amenorrhea and complicated PTL, will be prospectively included in the maternity wards of&#xD;
      Galway (Ireland) and of Dijon with the support of the perinatal network of Burgundy. A 2X5ml&#xD;
      blood sample will be collected upon admission, at D1, D2, D4 and D6 for women who did not&#xD;
      deliver within the first 7 days; finally, another blood sample will be drawn upon discharge.&#xD;
      After delivery, foetal membranes will be collected to characterize and compare the various&#xD;
      monocyte and lymphocyte subpopulations in the maternal blood. The characterization and the&#xD;
      study of the level of activation of blood and foetal membrane cells will be performed using&#xD;
      flow cytometry technique with suitable markers. The main judgment criteria will be the&#xD;
      percentage of monocytes positively expressing MCP-1 for all three monocyte subpopulations&#xD;
      (&quot;inflammatory&quot;, &quot;residents or patrollers&quot; and &quot;intermediates&quot;, according to CD14, CD16, CCR2&#xD;
      and MCP-1 markers. Lymphocyte subpopulations will be assessed using the following markers:&#xD;
      CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8 (T lymphocytes), HLA-DR (activated T lymphocytes), CD19 (B lymphocytes),&#xD;
      CD16/CD56 (NK Cells), intracellular IFN-gamma (Th1 lymphocytes), intracellular IL-4 (Th-2&#xD;
      lymphocytes), intracellular IL-17 and CCR6 (Th17 lymphocytes), CD4, CD25, Foxp3 and CD127&#xD;
      (Tregs). Univariate statistical analysis of quantitative data will be performed using the&#xD;
      Mann and Witney test or ANOVA, after verification of the conditions of application. The&#xD;
      comparisons of percentages will be done using Chi-square Pearson tests and the Fisher's exact&#xD;
      test, as appropriate. The multivariate analysis will be performed using a stepwise descending&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSLATIONAL DIMENSION: The characterization of the various monocyte and lymphocyte&#xD;
      subpopulations in the maternal blood and in the foetal membranes might constitute an &quot;&#xD;
      immunological signature &quot; of the labour and therefore validate the relevance of a predictive&#xD;
      marker for clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS AND PERSPECTIVES: The study of the various monocyte and lymphocyte&#xD;
      subpopulations in the maternal blood will allow to better characterise the immunological&#xD;
      mechanisms occurring at the start of premature labour and to identity predictive markers of&#xD;
      the preterm delivery, to validate prospectively in order to optimize the management of PTL&#xD;
