  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liquid allergen extracts contain proteins, such as (but not limited to) tree, weed, cat,&#xD;
      cockroach, and nuts, and are used to identify allergies by observing the body's reaction to&#xD;
      the introduction of extract underneath the skin. There are a few dog allergen extracts&#xD;
      commercially available in the US for allergy testing; however, none of these products are&#xD;
      standardized, meaning they are not required to be the same strength. Because some extracts&#xD;
      are not as potent (strong) as others, it's possible that some patients' allergies are&#xD;
      misdiagnosed. Typically, the most potent (strong), but safe extract should be used so that&#xD;
      allergic patients are correctly diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and potency of an investigational (not&#xD;
      approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) dog allergen&#xD;
      extract with two commercially available dog extracts, which are of differing potencies.&#xD;

      This study is designed to assess the potency of a modified dog hair and dander extract in&#xD;
      comparison with the two commercially available dog hair and dander extracts. This is a pilot&#xD;
      study to estimate a target strength of dog extract in order to proceed to further studies.&#xD;
