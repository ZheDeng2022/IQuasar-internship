  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      32 (16 per treatment group) healthy male or female subjects, 18 - 45 years old will be&#xD;
      enrolled.Subjects will receive two single oral doses of 400mg TMC207, first on Study Day 1&#xD;
      followed by a 28-day wash-out, the second on Study Day 29. On Study Day 28, any abnormal&#xD;
      safety labs will be reviewed by study physician and be determined not to meet the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria before administration of the second dose of TMC207. Rifabutin 300mg (Group 1) or&#xD;
      rifampin 600mg (Group 2) will be administered once daily during Period 2 from Study Day 20&#xD;
      through Study Day 41. The primary endpoint for the study (pharmacokinetics, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of TMC207 (and its M2 metabolite) will be determined on the final study visit,&#xD;
      Day 57 (28 days after the last TMC207 dose in Period 2).&#xD;

        clinically relevant abnormality and includes a physical examination, medical history,&#xD;
        electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, ophthalmologic exam, the results of blood&#xD;
        biochemistry, and hematology tests, and a urinalysis carried out at screening (See Section&#xD;

        greater (&gt; 1.0 x ULN), c.Hemoglobin grade 1 or greater (&lt;/= 10.5 g/dL), d.Platelet count&#xD;
        grade 1 or greater (&lt;/= 99000/mm^3), e.Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine&#xD;
