      This is a safety and tolerability trial to evaluate the effect of subretinal injection of&#xD;
      human embryonic stem cell derived retinal pigment epithelium cells in patients with dry Age&#xD;
      Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and to perform exploratory evaluation of potential&#xD;
      efficacy endpoints to be used in future studies retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cellular&#xD;

      This study is a Phase I/II, open-label, non randomized, sequential, multi-center clinical&#xD;
      trial. There will be 5 cohorts, the 4 low vision cohorts will contain 3 patients, the better&#xD;
      vision cohort will contain 4 patients. The enrolled cohorts will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three AMD patients- 50,000 MA09-hRPE cells transplanted Three AMD patients- 100,000 MA09-hRPE&#xD;
      cells transplanted Four Better Vision AMD patients- 100,000 MA09-hRPE cells transplanted&#xD;
      Three AMD patients- 150,000 MA09-hRPE cells transplanted Three AMD patients- 200,000&#xD;
      MA09-hRPE cells transplanted&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled sequentially, and within each cohort of 3 patients, each patient's&#xD;
      clinical course over the first 6 weeks following cell transplantation will be reviewed by an&#xD;
      independent (DSMB) before enrollment is opened for the next 2 patients. A full safety&#xD;
      assessment of all 3 patients in each cohort will be made by the DSMB when the 3rd patient in&#xD;
      each cohort completes 4 weeks of follow-up, and before the first patient in the next cohort&#xD;
      receives a cell transplant. The exception is the better vision group where all patients may&#xD;
      be enrolled once DSMB approval has been received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cohort will be enrolled sequentially in turn, with the exception of the better vision&#xD;
      cohort which may be enrolled in parallel with the other cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of the cell implantation will be Day 0, and patients will remain in the study until&#xD;
      the last visit at 12 months.&#xD;
