      Recent research examines many types of complementary and alternative (CAM) therapies.&#xD;
      However, &quot;real-world&quot; use of CAM has been largely overlooked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project consists of four discrete sets of project activities (that largely follow one&#xD;
      another chronologically).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase1 uses information from the EMR (patient electronic medical records) to identify unique&#xD;
      clusters of patients with CMP (chronic musculoskeletal pain), their care within the health&#xD;
      plan, and to examine how those in unique clusters may have different uses for A/C&#xD;
      (acupuncture and chiropractic) services and/or differential outcomes associated with such&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will conduct a survey of CMP patients from KPNW (Kaiser Permanente Northwest region)&#xD;
      to establish a broad sample of patients and their use of out-of-plan CAM services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 will collect qualitative data (focus groups and individual interviews) from KP&#xD;
      members, KP providers, and acupuncturists and chiropractors from the community to examine KP&#xD;
      providers' decision to recommend A/C services, A/C services delivered to KP patients, and&#xD;
      patients' decisions to pursue and retain CAM care. A secondary purpose is to have KP members&#xD;
      with CMP review planned assessment instruments to improve understandability of the&#xD;
      instruments. They will provide feedback on: relevancy, any notable omissions of domains&#xD;
      important in patients' decision to use CAM services for pain treatment. They will also&#xD;
      provide insight to broader health and quality of life outcomes associated with such CAM&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4 is a prospective cohort study to evaluate health services/costs and broader clinical&#xD;
      and functional outcomes associated with the receipt of A/C relative to carefully matched&#xD;
      comparison participants receiving traditional CMP services.&#xD;

      Substantial recent research examines the efficacy and biological basis of many types of&#xD;
      complementary and alternative (CAM) therapies. However, &quot;real-world&quot; use of CAM has been&#xD;
      largely overlooked, despite calls for CAM therapies to be studied in the manner in which they&#xD;
      are practiced and urging high prioritization for research that includes clinical outcomes,&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness, and the decision-making process for patients and providers. There is,&#xD;
      therefore, heightened need for enriched understanding-particularly given CAM's growing&#xD;
      popularity, which fortunately offers stores of new data for research. Recent studies suggests&#xD;
      that Americans seek CAM treatments far more often for chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) than&#xD;
      for any other condition. Among CAM treatments for CMP, acupuncture and chiropractic (A/C)&#xD;
      care are among those with the highest acceptance by physician groups and the best evidence to&#xD;
      support their use. Further, recent alarming increases in delivery of opioid treatment and&#xD;
      surgical interventions for chronic pain-despite their high costs, potential adverse effects,&#xD;
      and modest efficacy-suggests the need to evaluate the outcomes associated with promising&#xD;
      non-pharmacological/non-surgical CAM treatments for CMP, which are often well accepted by&#xD;
      patients and increasingly used in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study responds to the NCCAM program announcement PAR-08-045, &quot;Outcomes,&#xD;
      Cost-Effectiveness and the Decision Making Process to Use CAM.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because this project consists of four discrete sets of project activities (that largely&#xD;
      follow one another chronologically), the investigators plan to submit separate IRQs to cover&#xD;
      each set of project activities as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Phase1) Retrospective study using information from the EMR to identify unique clusters of&#xD;
      patients with CMP, their trajectories of care within the health plan, and to examine how&#xD;
      those in unique clusters may have differing propensities for the use of A/C services and/or&#xD;
      differential outcomes associated with such care. The IRQ for this study has been submitted&#xD;
      (Phase 2) The administration of an out-of-plan CAM survey to determine from a broad sample of&#xD;
      KP members their use of such services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Phase 3) The collection of qualitative data (focus groups and individual interviews) from KP&#xD;
      members, KP providers, and acupuncturists and chiropractors from the community to examine KP&#xD;
      providers decision to recommend A/C services, A/C services delivered to KP patients, and&#xD;
      patients' decisions to pursue and retain CAM care. A secondary purpose is to have KP members&#xD;
      with CMP review planned assessment instruments for phase 4 of the study to provide feedback&#xD;
      on: relevancy, any notable omissions of domains important in patients' decision to use CAM&#xD;
      services for pain treatment and broader health and quality of life outcomes associated with&#xD;
      such CAM treatments, as well as to review understandability of the assessment instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Phase 4) A prospective cohort study to evaluate health services/costs and broader clinical&#xD;
      and functional outcomes associated with the receipt of A/C relative to carefully matched&#xD;
      comparison participants receiving traditional CMP services.&#xD;
