      The purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of men with known or suspected&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD) and/or peripheral arterial disease (PAD) that have angiographic&#xD;
      identifiable erectile related artery (ERA) atherosclerotic disease defined as at least one&#xD;
      ERA stenosis greater than or equal to 50% (per core lab Quantitative Vascular Analysis -&#xD;
      QVA).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Vascular insufficiency is a commonly cited cause of Erectile Dysfunction (ED) and the most&#xD;
      common treatments of ED target aspects of the penile vasculature. Initial pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      typically focuses on the penile microvasculature; however, surgical revascularization has&#xD;
      also been used to treat ED caused by lesions in the internal iliac artery (IIA) and/or&#xD;
      internal pudendal artery (IPA) and penile arteries. Anatomically, surgical revascularization&#xD;
      connects the inferior epigastric artery to the dorsal artery of the penis or a combination of&#xD;
      the dorsal artery and vein of the penis. The pudendal artery or deep artery of the penis is&#xD;
      usually not the target of surgical bypass. Recent advances in percutaneous revascularization&#xD;
      have sparked interest in penile revascularization to treat ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, as this new percutaneous treatment modality evolves, several important clinical&#xD;
      questions remain unanswered. Important among these are what is the normal angiographic&#xD;
      anatomy of the erectile related arteries (ERA), and how do angiographic findings correlate&#xD;
      with symptoms of ED? Also, how many men could possible benefit from percutaneous&#xD;
      revascularization?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normal IPA anatomy by contrast angiography is not well defined and there are no studies&#xD;
      that correlate IPA findings with erectile function. While studies have been done on&#xD;
      populations of men with suspected vasculogenic and chronic ED, no study has established the&#xD;
      normal angiographic anatomy of the IPA or evaluated the prevalence of angiographic IPA&#xD;
      occlusive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, an angiographic prevalence study will assist in determining the population of men&#xD;
      who could potentially benefit from percutaneous treatment of atherosclerotic IPA lesions.&#xD;
