      This study will conduct an evaluation of the World Health Partners (WHP) private provider&#xD;
      project to see if the social franchising and telemedicine project has an impact on health&#xD;
      outcomes in treatment vs. control areas. The evaluation will also estimate specific&#xD;
      parameters of the WHP program that can be used to maximize financial sustainability and&#xD;
      replicability/scalability of the program.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2011, World Health Partners (WHP) will launch a large social franchising program of&#xD;
      healthcare delivery in Bihar, India, with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation&#xD;
      (BMGF). The WHP project is particularly innovative in integrating a social franchising&#xD;
      delivery model with a telemedicine platform. Although social franchising models of delivery&#xD;
      are becoming increasingly common, to our knowledge, none of these efforts has been rigorously&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHESIVE-India plans to undertake an evaluation of the BMGF-financed WHP project. The&#xD;
      overarching focus of the evaluation project (called Bihar Evaluation of Social Franchising&#xD;
      and Telemedicine (BEST)) is to provide evidence on the performance and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      WHP program. In addition to studying the overall impact and effectiveness of the social&#xD;
      franchising and telemedicine program, the evaluation will estimate how the WHP model&#xD;
      influences outcomes related to two target diseases of interest to BMGF: childhood diarrhea&#xD;
      and childhood pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Evaluation Design The core objective of the evaluation is to estimate the causal impact&#xD;
      of the WHP program on BMGF target disease outcomes as well as other indicators of its primary&#xD;
      health care success. The key design feature of the evaluation is that it relies on the&#xD;
      franchisee network model of the WHP program. The evaluation design involves identifying&#xD;
      villages in Bihar that have asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) connectivity where WHP&#xD;
      is likely to find providers who would participate in the program. The areas surrounding these&#xD;
      villages that form catchment areas for providers will be identified; 360 such areas will be&#xD;
      randomly sampled from the list and divided into 180 treatment and 180 control areas for&#xD;
      implementation of the WHP program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also includes a detailed costing component to estimate the costs associated with&#xD;
      the target diseases and the benefits from the program intervention. In doing so, the&#xD;
      evaluation strategy addresses specific policy-relevant questions about sustainability,&#xD;
      affordability, replicability, and future Government support for privately provided healthcare&#xD;
      options in Bihar as well as in other parts of India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, COHESIVE-India, with funding from external sources also plans to conduct studies&#xD;
      that will provide insights on how to improve the effectiveness of the WHP model, as well as&#xD;
      its financial sustainability. These studies include the distribution of vouchers for WHP&#xD;
      services to estimate household's willingness to pay for them, as well experiments on&#xD;
      financial incentives to learn how to improve the performance of network providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation is closely aligned with the objectives of the Government of Bihar to reduce&#xD;
      the burden of disease. Through a rigorous evaluation of the WHP program, this study will&#xD;
      provide evidence on whether this model of rural health service delivery is efficient and&#xD;
      whether it can be scaled up. The stated goals of the WHP program indicate the many potential&#xD;
      health and economic benefits to the people of Bihar. The evaluation will provide an empirical&#xD;
      and objective assessment of the impact of WHP's effort on quality of care available in rural&#xD;
      areas (the program anticipates a significant improvement), increases in access to healthcare&#xD;
      providers and improved drug supply, reductions in time lapse between onset of disease and&#xD;
      optimal care, as well as reductions in unnecessary healthcare expenditures.&#xD;
