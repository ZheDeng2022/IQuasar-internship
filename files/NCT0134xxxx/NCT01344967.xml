  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone is the most common site of spread of breast cancer and bone metastases will occur in&#xD;
      roughly 70% of women with advanced disease. These patients are at risk of developing bone&#xD;
      complications that cause significant impact on both patient morbidity and mortality. Close to&#xD;
      two-thirds of women with bone metastases will go on to develop at least one of these&#xD;
      complications, termed a skeletal related event (SRE), defined as 1) pathological fractures,&#xD;
      2) pain requiring radiation or surgical intervention, 3)spinal cord compression, and 4)&#xD;
      hypercalcemia. In addition to SREs, most breast cancer patients with bone metastases have&#xD;
      some degree of pain associated with their disease. Understandably these factors negatively&#xD;
      impact their quality of life. Furthermore, the development of an SRE in this population has&#xD;
      been shown to be associated with shorter overall survival. Prevention or delay in onset of&#xD;
      these complications is therefore an important therapeutic goal.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Radiological or pathological evidence of bone metastases. (positive bone scan, MRI, or&#xD;
             CT or pathological fracture, or pathological sample from bone biopsy showing evidence&#xD;
             of metastatic breast cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has not yet started on BP therapy for metastatic breast cancer to bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Renal (serum creatinine, BUN), hepatic (AST, ALT, Bilirubin) function within the&#xD;
             institutional normal range as assessed within 1 month of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age &gt;/= 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Karnofsky performance status â‰¥ 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Life expectancy &gt; 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients may receive any chemotherapy, biological or endocrine treatment considered&#xD;
             appropriate by the treating physician. This can be changed during the course of the&#xD;
             study as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients may be on another clinical trial, if allowed by the Trial Steering Committee&#xD;
             for that trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients are willing to take calcium and vitamin D supplements as recommended, while&#xD;
             on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Hypersensitivity or known allergy to bisphosphonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient currently taking Bisphosphonate therapy for metastatic breast cancer to bone&#xD;
             (Clodronate, Pamidronate, Zoledronic Acid, Ibandronate, Calcitonin). Bisphosphonates&#xD;
             for the treatment of other bone disease (osteoporosis, osteopenia, Paget's disease,&#xD;
             etc) but not Zoledronic Acid, are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Acute or chronic renal insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Hypocalcemia as defined by serum calcium less than institutional normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Evidence of infection/abscess on dental exam or recent dental extraction (within last&#xD;
             4 weeks), or presence of osteonecrosis of the jaw.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Acute pathological fracture, spinal cord compression, or hypercalcemia requiring&#xD;
             urgent treatment (patient may enter study after acute issues are resolved).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with baseline hypocalcemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients who have received ZA for prevention of breast cancer treatment-induced&#xD;
             osteopenia or osteoporosis within the last 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History and/or electrocardiographic evidence of atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pregnancy or lactation.&#xD;
