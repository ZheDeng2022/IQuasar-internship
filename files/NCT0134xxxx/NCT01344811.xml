      1. Objectives : To evaluate superiority of U(Ubiquitous)-Healthcare(hereinafter referred to&#xD;
           as Smart Care) Service being combined conventional treatment with health care service,&#xD;
           in comparison to conventional treatment in obese patients with metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test and control group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Test groups : The subject group who is receiving health care services using&#xD;
                conventional treatment (hospital visit) and Smart Care Service (Telemonitoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Control group : The subject group who is receiving conventional treatment (hospital&#xD;
                visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Target Subject: Obese patients with metabolic syndrome.&#xD;

    <description>The control group will receive a weighting scale and pedometer. They should perform the same weight measurement (minimum three times a week) like the intervention group during the study, and measured results should be recorded in a diary of self body weight and the number of steps. In addition, the subjects should visit the site once per every three months (12 weeks).</description>
