      Lipidome and microbiome analysis in subjects with acne on doxycycline. Investigators will&#xD;
      look at the skin lipidome, blood lipidome, gut micro biome and skin micro biome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will look at the changes between acne subjects and control participants, but&#xD;
      also the changes that occur after the use of antibiotics and how this is altered.&#xD;

      We will look at acne subjects, and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will look at four things&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. skin lipidome&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. skin microbiome&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. gut microbiome&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. blood lipidome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will assess this in acne participants before and after doxycycline and compare&#xD;
      them to controls.&#xD;
