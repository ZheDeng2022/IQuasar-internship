      This study aimed to evaluate effectiveness of initial limb rehabilitation compare therapy&#xD;
      took place within 48h with therapy took place after 48h for patients with stroke (modified&#xD;
      Rankin Scale Score 3-4).&#xD;

      Early rehabilitation after stroke is thought to contribute to the effects of stroke-unit&#xD;
      care. However, time of initial rehabilitation therapy is poorly defined and not underpinned&#xD;
      by strong evidence in patients with stroke (modified Rankin Scale Score 3-4). The&#xD;
      investigators do this parallel-group, single-blind, randomized controlled trial in shengjing&#xD;
      hospital of China Medical University. Participants (aged≥18 years) with ischaemic or&#xD;
      haemorrhagic stroke, first or recurrent, who meet physiological criteria are randomly&#xD;
      assigned (1:1), to receive usual stroke therapy. Treatment with recombinant tissue&#xD;
      plasminogen activator is allowed. Randomisation is stratified by study site and stroke&#xD;
      severity. The primary outcome was a outcome 3 months after stroke, defined as a modified&#xD;
      Rankin Scale score of 3-4. The investigators do analysis on an intention-to-treat basis.&#xD;
