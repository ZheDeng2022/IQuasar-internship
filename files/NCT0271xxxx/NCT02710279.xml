  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is a major health problem that causes annually a million death worldwild. In the&#xD;
      stress-vulnerability model, suicidal behavior (SB) results from the interaction between an&#xD;
      individual's predisposition and stressful condition. We hypothesized that the sensitivity to&#xD;
      social exclusion may represent a core component of the suicidal vulnerability Recent evidence&#xD;
      also suggest that inflammatory mediators plays a critical role in SB. Furthermore, social&#xD;
      stressors are particulary strong and specific triggers of inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To sum up, patients carrying a suicidal vulnerability are expected to present greater&#xD;
      responses to social rejection in terms of inflammatory activity and psychological pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the psychological and inflammatory responses to a social&#xD;
      stressor validated, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) . We will also investigate the&#xD;
      moderating effect of childhood abuse, attachment, trait rejection sensitivity and social&#xD;
      isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of the study, we will also investigate the prospective association between&#xD;
      inflammatory responses induces by laboratory paradigms of social rejection and the occurrence&#xD;
      of social distress, suicidal ideation and psychological pain in response to social exclusion&#xD;
      events in real life (using ecological momentary assessment).&#xD;

      Over one year, we will recruit 140 female outpatients suffering from a major depressive&#xD;
      episode with (n=70) and without any history of suicide attempt (n=70) from a specialized&#xD;
      clinic for mood disorders and SB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First visit: clinical, biological and neuropsychological assessment Second visit: The TSST is&#xD;
      a standardized laboratory psychosocial stress protocol that involves public speaking, role&#xD;
      play, and mental arithmetic tasks in front of a panel of confederate judges. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be obtained before the introduction to the TSST and immediately after and at + 30, + 60,&#xD;
      + 90, and + 120 min. Self-ratings of emotional states, anxiety, anger and psychological pain&#xD;
      will be completed at the same times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third visit: Participants will be instructed to carry a smartphone with them for one week,&#xD;
      and to record at each alarm signal daily life events, negative emotions, psychological pain,&#xD;
      suicidal ideas, and specific attributions to these events. Participants will be signalled&#xD;
      five times a day during the period. Subjects will be contacted by telephone halfway through&#xD;
      the assessment period to monitor and encourage compliance.&#xD;

    <description>For the TSST the participants are instructed to imagine having applied for their &quot;dream job&quot; and that they are now invited to a job interview. Three successive phases: (1) A preparation period (3 min), (2) a free speech: explain why you are the best candidate for the job (5 min), (3) a mental arithmetic complex task (5 min). The two tasks (task 2 and 3) are performed in front of a selection committee, three persons dressed in white lab coats, acting in a reserved manner and providing no facial or verbal feedback. Additionally, participants are told that they are video-taped and told that their performance will be evaluated. (in fact, there is no video-tape, just a false camera). After the TSST, patients have to answer to a questionnaire on their smartphone, 5 times a day during 7 days.</description>
