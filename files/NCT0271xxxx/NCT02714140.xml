  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite worldwide efforts to promote HIV Counseling and Testing (HCT), rates of testing&#xD;
      remain low. Understanding how high risk groups decide to test and adapting available testing&#xD;
      options to their preferences has the potential to broadly improve HCT uptake and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness. This study proposes to use a Discrete Choice Experiment, a survey method&#xD;
      increasingly used by health economists for the design of patient-centered health care&#xD;
      options, to rigorously quantify HIV testing preferences among two high-risk populations,&#xD;
      identify their preferred testing options, and evaluate, in a pragmatic randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT), the effect of a preference-based HIV counseling and testing (PB-HCT)&#xD;
      intervention on testing uptake. At a time of heightened focus on health preferences research&#xD;
      and patient-centered care, this study evaluates the critical link between preference-based&#xD;
      intervention design and efficacy. If the RCT indicates that PB-HCT increases testing rates,&#xD;
      the testing options evaluated in this R01 can be offered to high-risk populations in the&#xD;
      study area, and the preference elicitation method and tools can be used to inform the design&#xD;
      of testing options that better match the preferences of other high-risk populations and in&#xD;
      other settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV counseling and testing (HCT) is a highly cost-effective intervention for increasing&#xD;
      serostatus awareness, a point of entry into HIV care and treatment, and an important means of&#xD;
      primary and secondary HIV prevention. Public health officials have called for dramatic&#xD;
      increases in HIV testing to achieve an HIV-free generation. Yet, testing rates are plateauing&#xD;
      and rates of repeat-testing among those with ongoing risk remain low. Thus, there is a need&#xD;
      to better understand and address deterrents of HIV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations of population preferences for testing have typically focused on the acceptability&#xD;
      of specific venue-based testing options, such as home-based, provider-initiated, or workplace&#xD;
      testing, usually without consideration or offer of other options. Results from these&#xD;
      assessments do not probe the potential diversity in testing preferences of target&#xD;
      populations; they do not ascertain how individuals value diverse characteristics of testing&#xD;
      options; nor can they identify combinations of testing options that could maximize uptake of&#xD;
      testing. The investigators posit that systematically designed HIV testing interventions,&#xD;
      matched specifically to the heterogeneous preferences of diverse target populations, hold&#xD;
      potential to greatly improve uptake of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will extend the use of the DCE method to design an HIV&#xD;
      testing intervention that is matched to the specific preferences of two high-risk populations&#xD;
      and to establish, in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, whether a Preference-Based HIV&#xD;
      Counseling and Testing (PB-HCT) intervention increases uptake of HIV testing. In short, the&#xD;
      investigators are adapting concepts from health and behavioral economics, marketing, and&#xD;
      patient-centered care to apply a groundbreaking, client-focused perspective to the context of&#xD;
      HIV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This application will address the following Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 will identify which combination of HIV counseling and testing options is expected to&#xD;
      maximize uptake of HIV testing in two high-risk populations. We will use formative work and&#xD;
      DCE surveys with female barworkers and male Kilimanjaro mountain porters, two high HIV risk&#xD;
      populations in Moshi, Tanzania, to quantify the relative importance of characteristics such&#xD;
      as home-based vs. facility-based testing, venipuncture vs. finger prick vs. oral swab,&#xD;
      individual vs. couples counseling, the availability of services such as health check-ups, and&#xD;
      options for HIV serostatus disclosure, for individuals' testing decisions. Latent class&#xD;
      analysis of DCE choice data will identify distinct sets of testing preferences within each&#xD;
      high-risk population, and identify a combination of testing options that is predicted to&#xD;
      maximize uptake of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 will evaluate whether an HIV testing offer, matched to the testing preferences of each&#xD;
      high-risk population, increases testing uptake relative to a common option. Representative&#xD;
      samples of 600 female barworkers and 600 male mountain porters will be randomized into three&#xD;
      groups (Groups A, B, and C). Participants will be offered one common option (this option is&#xD;
      the same regardless of which group a participant is randomized into) and 3 group-specific&#xD;
      testing options. Group A participants will be offered 3 currently available testing options&#xD;
      targeted at the distribution of preferences among participants. Group B participants will be&#xD;
      offered 3 preference-informed &quot;enhanced&quot; testing options, which include features that may not&#xD;
      yet be available in the study area. Group C participants will be offered an equal number of&#xD;
      predicted less-preferred options. The primary outcome is uptake of HIV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from this project have significant public health relevance. The proposed study&#xD;
      will a) rigorously characterize the HIV testing preferences of two high-risk populations; b)&#xD;
      identify feasible HIV testing interventions that are predicted to increase HCT uptake; and c)&#xD;
      identify the effect of a preference-informed HIV testing intervention on rates of testing.&#xD;
      More generally, this study evaluates the critical link between an intervention that is&#xD;
      systematically designed to match a population's preferences and the efficacy of that&#xD;
      intervention. If successful, preference assessments among small samples from key populations&#xD;
      could be used widely as an implementation research tool to inform the design of diverse HIV&#xD;
      prevention, testing, and treatment interventions; preference-informed interventions, in turn,&#xD;
      hold potential to broadly increase intervention uptake and efficacy, both internationally and&#xD;
      in the United States.&#xD;
