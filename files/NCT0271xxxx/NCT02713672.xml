  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cytochrome P450 (CYP) is a group of metabolic enzymes, from which the 2D6 and CYP2C19&#xD;
      polymorphisms are specifically related to the metabolism of psychiatric drugs. The prevalence&#xD;
      of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 polymorphisms differs among ethnicities. Depending on the number of&#xD;
      functional alleles, individuals are classified as Poor Metabolizer (PM), Intermediate&#xD;
      Metabolizer (IM), Extensive Metabolizer (EM) or Ultra Rapid Metabolizer (UM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has suggested that PM genotype is a predisposing factor for antipsychotic-induced&#xD;
      side-effects. Besides susceptibility for side effects and lower quality of life, also, a&#xD;
      relationship between phenotype and costs of care has been shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines recommend that PM, IM and UM genotypes need dose adjustment, to optimize the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the drug and/or to reduce side effects. No research has been done to&#xD;
      investigate cost-effectiveness of implementation of genotyping in daily clinical psychiatric&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates the effectiveness of implementation of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotyping&#xD;
      in psychiatric patients in Curacao and analyzes the costs of genotyping versus health&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;

      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is carried out on the Caribbean island Curacao and in the Netherlands. The&#xD;
      population (approx. 150,000 inhabitants) of Curacao is mainly of Negroid descent.&#xD;
      Participants were recruited from the Klinika Capriles, (the only psychiatric hospital on the&#xD;
      island) the psychiatric ward in the prison (FOBA) and the psychiatric polyclinic on the&#xD;
      island (Psychiaters Maatschap Antillen). The study protocol was approved by the Medical&#xD;
      Ethical Review Board (Maastricht) and study participants gave written informed consent after&#xD;
      explanation about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria were: (i) An Antillean ethnicity, defined in line with the Dutch Central&#xD;
      Bureau of Statistics as birth on the former Dutch Antilles and birth of at least one parent&#xD;
      on the former Dutch Antilles. (ii) Age 18 years or older. (iii) The use of an antipsychotic&#xD;
      or antidepressant and (iv) informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients were genotyped and grouped according to predicted phenotype for CYP2D6 and&#xD;
      CYP2C19. Information about medication use was collected. Patients using CYP2D6 or CYP2C19&#xD;
      inhibiting medication according to Flockhart were selected. Enzyme activity scores of&#xD;
      patients using a strong inhibitor were multiplied by 0 which meant they converted&#xD;
      automatically to a PM phenotype. In patients using medium inhibitors, activity scores were&#xD;
      multiplied by 0.5. This is a widely used and accepted method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All prescribed antipsychotics were calculated to a &quot;Defined Daily Dose&quot; (DDD) as defined by&#xD;
      the World Health Organization (WHO). For every patient the total equivalent of the DDD was&#xD;
      calculated. In this way it was possible to analyse if there were differences in total dose of&#xD;
      antipsychotics being used between the phenotype groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who needed dose adjustment based on phenotype according to the Royal Dutch&#xD;
      Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy were selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were selected were matched with controls on gender, age and depot or oral&#xD;
      medication use. All participants received a 25 guilder gift token if they cooperated in the&#xD;
      study at both measuring points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective experience, psychopathology, extrapyramidal side effects, quality of life, global&#xD;
      functioning and metabolic parameters were assessed at baseline (T0) and 4 months after dose&#xD;
      adjustment (T1). A medical doctor, trainee in psychiatry, blind for the intervention, was&#xD;
      responsible for all the measurements and was being trained in investigating extra pyramidal&#xD;
      side effects and measuring global functioning. Patients receiving depot medication were&#xD;
      measured in the same moment in the depot in T0 and T1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity of patients' psychopathology was assessed with Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale&#xD;
      (BPRS), which measures 24 symptoms of psychiatric disease and is validated in Dutch 20.&#xD;
      Extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed with the St. Hans Ratings Scale (SHRS), which is a&#xD;
      multidimensional rating scale for the evaluation of hyperkinesia, parkinsonism, akathisia and&#xD;
      dystonia induced by neuroleptics. The dyskinesia is scored in two situations: in passive and&#xD;
      active circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Akathisia was being measured by the Barnes Rating Scale (BARS) for Drug-Induced Akathisia.&#xD;
      Subjective experience of the patients was measured with the Subjective Well-Being Under&#xD;
      Neuroleptics Scale (SWN-20), which is a 20- item, self-rating scale which assesses the&#xD;
      subjective experience over the preceding 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life was assessed with the EurolQol 5-D (EQ 5-D), which is a widely used rating&#xD;
      scale, that measures health status on five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities,&#xD;
      pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global functioning was assessed with the World Health Organization Disability Assessment&#xD;
      Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS-36) 36 item proxy-administered version. The questionnaire measures&#xD;
      disability in 6 domains and was being administered by a personal care giver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic parameters measured were blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI), waist size,&#xD;
      cholesterol, High Density Lipo-protein (HDL), Low Density Lipo-protein (LDL), triglycerides,&#xD;
      glucose, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C). Prolactin was also being measured. In patients receiving&#xD;
      antipsychotics metabolized by CYP2D6, plasma levels of antipsychotics were measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline measurements, another medical doctor, trainee in psychiatry made dose&#xD;
      adjustments according to guidelines of the Royal Dutch Association for the Advancement of&#xD;
      Pharmacy (KNMP) which was updated July 2013. Generally three options were available: 1.&#xD;
      Lowering/ enhancing the dose to 50-75% of the original dose 2. Prescription of medication not&#xD;
      being metabolized by CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 3. Stop CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 inhibiting medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard procedure for dose adjustments was being followed: Lowering the dose was done in&#xD;
      steps according to http://wiki.psychiatrienet.nl/index.php/SwitchAntipsychotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an alternative antipsychotic had to be prescribed, first choice was flupentixol, second&#xD;
      choice olanzapine, third choice quetiapine. Inhibiting medication meant to tranquilize was&#xD;
      being replaced by benzodiazepines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complex cases were discussed with the research team and individual dose adjustment plans were&#xD;
      being made.&#xD;
