      Inflammatory paranasal diseases are among the most common diseases in ENT In Russia, puncture&#xD;
      method has been conventional approach to treatment of maxillary sinusitis. However, this&#xD;
      procedure is associated with a number of drawbacks A promising trend for the treatment of&#xD;
      purulent sinusitis is a reasonable antibacterial therapy Fluoroquinolones, particularly&#xD;
      levofloxacin, are highly active against pneumonocci and are more active vs. the drug products&#xD;
      of the second generation against intracellular agents (Chlamydia spp., Mycoplasma spp., M.&#xD;
      tuberculosis, rapidly growing atypical mycobacteria (M. avium, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to high activity against the agents causing bacterial upper and lower respiratory tract&#xD;
      infections they are sometimes called &quot;respiratory&quot; fluoroquinolones&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Inflammatory diseases of paranasal sinuses occupy one of the leading positions in the overall&#xD;
      structure of ENT-diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Puncture method has been a conventional approach to the treatment of suppurative maxillary&#xD;
      sinusitis in Russia until present. However, this relatively simple and conventional treatment&#xD;
      method has a number of disadvantages. Fear of an unpleasant procedure is justified.&#xD;
      Generally, single puncture does not ensure healing, and the doctor has to install drainage or&#xD;
      of perform repeated manipulations significantly reducing quality of life during the disease&#xD;
      period. There is also a certain risk of puncture needle penetration into adjacent areas.&#xD;
      Sometimes direct contraindications to punctures exist (intolerance of topical anesthetics,&#xD;
      blood clotting disorders, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The puncture itself, as an independent method, is a relieving procedure rather than a&#xD;
      pathognomonic treatment method, especially regarding severe combined forms of sinusitis with&#xD;
      risk of intracranial complications. Due to lacking standardized antibacterial drugs to be&#xD;
      injected into the sinus, multiple punctures are erroneously considered to be able of&#xD;
      eliminating the bacterial agent successfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the promising trends regarding the treatment of suppurative maxillary sinusitis is an&#xD;
      adequate antibacterial therapy. Fluoroquinolones of last generations, levofloxacin in&#xD;
      particular, which are highly active against pneumococci, are more effective vs. generation II&#xD;
      drugs against intracellular agents (Chlamydia spp., Mycoplasma spp., M.tuberculosis, rapidly&#xD;
      growing atypical mycobacteria (M.avium, etc.). At that activity towards other gram-negative&#xD;
      bacteria is not reduced. An important property of these drugs consists in activity regarding&#xD;
      a number of bacteria resistant to generation II fluoroquinolones. Due to high activity&#xD;
      against the agents of upper and lower respiratory bacterial infections they are sometimes&#xD;
      called &quot;respiratory&quot; fluoroquinolones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a publication, Levofloxacin 500 mg q.d. for 5 days eliminated radiological signs&#xD;
      of the disease by the end of the course in 65% subjects, while 35% showed positive changes&#xD;
      only (М.А. Panyakina, 2012). Based on these findings, otolaryngologists have to obtain higher&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy levels with the same 5-day course, since this treatment term&#xD;
      demonstrates violated compliance most frequently. One of the options is an elevation of daily&#xD;
      dose. In particular, Rameez Shah (2013) published data concerning high efficacy of&#xD;
      levofloxacin at a daily dose of 750 mg for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Necessity to search ways to shorten the current course of antibiotic therapy is being under&#xD;
      discussion at all levels. Particularly, 24th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and&#xD;
      Infectious Diseases performed on May 10-13, 2014 in Barcelona (ECCMID 2014) repeatedly raised&#xD;
      question concerning revision of the current treatment standards and clinical recommendations&#xD;
      concerning duration of antibiotic therapy and dosing regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above-mentioned findings, it would be interesting to evaluate efficacy of&#xD;
      various antibiotic schemes (respiratory fluoroquinolones or protected aminopenicillin) in&#xD;
      hospital conditions.&#xD;
