      Asthma is an important chronic disease that causes a significant public health problem and&#xD;
      the commonest medical conditions treated in health clinics giving rise to considerable&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Several studies suggested that improvement of patient knowledge has&#xD;
      become a key component of asthma management. In the study setting the education material for&#xD;
      Asthma patient is available however the proper cannel to deliver it to patient remains a&#xD;
      puzzle to the researcher, therefore this study is trying to close the gap between Asthma&#xD;
      education material and patient.The aim of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      Asthma Education Program (AEP) result in improvement of patient's knowledge, medication&#xD;
      adherence and inhaler technique.This is an experimental study a clinical trials. Data will be&#xD;
      gathered utilising three an adapted instrument to assess patient knowledge of their disease,&#xD;
      medication adherence and inhaler technique. Patients who are came to Asthma Bay in Emergency&#xD;
      Department, Respiratory Clinic for routine follow up and admitted to ward will be recruited&#xD;
      as study subjects. Subject who are agree to enrol in the study will be randomized into&#xD;
      intervention and control group. Subjects in intervention group will be undergone one session&#xD;
      of an AEP, however there are no intervention for control group but continue routinely follow&#xD;
      up in Respiratory Clinic. To obtain the study result descriptive and inferential statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed. To analyse the statistical significant of the change in patients'&#xD;
      health outcome the pre and post of AEP independent t-test or chi-square test will be used.The&#xD;
      expected finding of this study is to determine the effectiveness of AEP result in of&#xD;
      patients' knowledge regarding asthma disease, medication adherence and inhaler technique, pre&#xD;
      and post of AEP.&#xD;

      Asthma is an important chronic disease and a significant public health problem. Prevalence of&#xD;
      asthma is on the rise in all regions of the world, affecting all ages but more commonly among&#xD;
      children.The burden and suffering caused by chronic respiratory disease has been identified&#xD;
      by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a priority. In Malaysia, asthma is among the&#xD;
      commonest medical conditions treated in health clinics giving rise to considerable morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality (Bahari, Mohd Nur &amp; Rahman, 2003).Much of the morbidity from asthma is believed&#xD;
      to be due to factors such as denial of having a chronic condition (GINA, 2002), poor&#xD;
      knowledge of the disease process and medication use (Gibson et al., 2004) , poor&#xD;
      understanding on the use of inhalers (Thapar, 1994) and poor self-management (Wilson et al.,&#xD;
      1993; Hilton, Sibbald, Anderson &amp; Freeling, 1986). Patient education is becoming an essential&#xD;
      area of service provision, with our increasing population of people with chronic diseases and&#xD;
      conditions requiring long-term management in the community. Inadequate patient education has&#xD;
      been cited as a potential cause of re-attendance and the optimal format of education is&#xD;
      uncertain. Numerous studies worldwide have evaluated the impact of patient education and&#xD;
      indicated that each of the above components is amenable to asthma education (GINA, 2002).&#xD;
      Thus, patient education has become a key component of asthma management for asthma patients&#xD;
      at all age groups (Lai, et al., 2002; Harrison, 1998). Despite the means to control asthma&#xD;
      effectively, many asthma sufferers in Malaysia are not availing themselves of such&#xD;
      strategies, leading to avoidable problems that can range from frequent asthma attacks to even&#xD;
      death in certain circumstances. Much of the morbidity from asthma is believed to be due to&#xD;
      factors such as denial of having a chronic condition (Gibson, et al., 2004), poor knowledge&#xD;
      of the disease process and medication use (Thapar, 1994), poor understanding on the use of&#xD;
      inhalers (Wilson, et al., 1993) and poor self-management (Lai, et al., 2002; Hilton, Sibbald,&#xD;
      Anderson &amp; Freeling, 1986). However the effectiveness of patient education for asthma in a&#xD;
      hospital-based setting in Malaysia has not been previously evaluated and remains a puzzle to&#xD;
      the researcher. With the concern the researcher would like to explore the effectiveness of&#xD;
      Asthma Education Programme in improvement of patients' knowledge regarding asthma, medication&#xD;
      adherence and inhaler technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question. Does an Asthma Education Programme result in improvement of patient's&#xD;
      knowledge regarding asthma disease and inhaler technique?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research aims. i. To compare patient knowledge regarding asthma disease between intervention&#xD;
      and control group . ii. To compare patient inhaler technique between intervention and control&#xD;
      group. iii. To assess the association between patient's demographic data and health outcomes&#xD;
      (Knowledge and inhaler technique).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. This is an experimental study a clinical trials. The period of this study is&#xD;
      six month which is start from July 2015 to January 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting This study will be conducted in Ampang Hospital a government public tertiary&#xD;
      specialist hospital in Ampang, Selangor Malaysia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population (N). Asthmatic patients who treated in Ampang Hospital during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Population. Asthmatic patients who will be presented in Asthma Bay, Respiratory Clinic&#xD;
      or who are admitted to general medical wards for uncontrolled acute asthma attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size (n). The sample size of the study calculated using formula of hypothesis testing&#xD;
      for difference in proportions and the researcher determine effect size of 15% as significant&#xD;
      change, so the study need at least 129 subjects in each of arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient above age of 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have confirmed diagnosis of bronchial asthma in the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patient with significant medical comorbidity such as heart disease, chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease, chronic renal disease, stroke, psychiatric problem or inability to follow&#xD;
      instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling method. Patients who are presented in Asthma Bay, Respiratory Clinic and been&#xD;
      admitted to general medical ward and fulfil the inclusion criteria will be recruited to be&#xD;
      subject of the study. Patients' will be given an explanation about the study and written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained who are agreeing to participate in the study. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized using simple computer randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrument. The data for the study will be collected utilizing three adapted instrument from&#xD;
      previous study and the permission to use the questionnaire will be obtained through email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire (Part A) : Demographic data Part A consist of information about subjects&#xD;
      demographic data, such as age, sex, race, education level, history of childhood asthma and&#xD;
      number of ward admission or ED visits in the past one year. In the post test questionnaire&#xD;
      this part will be omitted but the subsequent layouts were similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire (Part B) : Asthmatic patients' knowledge about their disease. Part B consists&#xD;
      of twenty close ended question, to assess respondents' basic knowledge on their disease,&#xD;
      medication and treatment maintenance. The questionnaire adapted from previous study by Baez&#xD;
      Saldana, et.al (2007). Responses will be made on selection of three choice of answer which is&#xD;
      &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; or &quot;c&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire (Part C) : Multiple checklist of inhaler technique. To evaluate the&#xD;
      respondents' inhaler technique a single page with multiple checklist created by Vicky&#xD;
      Kritikos will be adapted. The checklists contain six types of inhaler technique medication,&#xD;
      such as Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) with spacer, MDI, Turbuhaler, Accuhaler, Intranasal device&#xD;
      and Handihaler. Subjects will be asked by investigator to demonstrate how they use the&#xD;
      inhaler medication individually. Incorrect step of inhaler technique will be highlighted and&#xD;
      emphasis during the AEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validity and Reliability. The validity and reliability of instruments content will be checked&#xD;
      by expertise panel such as a respiratory physician and pilot study will be held for&#xD;
      test-retest and Cronbach alpha test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection. There are three phases involve in data collection of this study. Following&#xD;
      Ethic Committee approval the researcher will meet up with Head Department of Emergency&#xD;
      Department, Medical and respiratory physician in charge of Respiratory Clinic to notify them&#xD;
      about the study and formal letter explaining the purpose of the study and copy of ethical&#xD;
      approval will be given to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Recruitment and randomization. Patients who are fullfill the subjects inclusion&#xD;
      criteria in those units will be approached and subject will be given briefly explanation&#xD;
      about the study and written consent will be obtained. Subjects (single blind study) will be&#xD;
      randomized using simple computer randomization. Subjects in intervention group will be given&#xD;
      an appointment date to attend the an Asthma Education Programme and subjects in control group&#xD;
      will routinely go for the normal follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Baseline data collection and AED session for intervention group. Baseline data&#xD;
      collection for subject in control group will be held in wards or Respiratory Clinic and for&#xD;
      subject recruited from Asthma Bay the baseline data will be collected during their routine&#xD;
      follow up in Respiratory Clinic. Upon completion collection of baseline data subject will be&#xD;
      given appointment date 4 weeks or same day clinic visit for second session of data&#xD;
      collection. For intervention group the baseline data collection will be held prior to Asthma&#xD;
      Education Programme and appointment date will be given after 4 weeks for second data&#xD;
      collection.The Asthma Education Programme consists of four items.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Education video for Asthmatic patient adapted from Info Sehat by Bahagian Pendidikan&#xD;
           Kesihatan Kementerian Kesihatan Malaysia which is explaining about Asthma disease,&#xD;
           medication and patient responsibility in Asthma management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Small group discussion with subject's to help them understand better in Asthma&#xD;
           management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Face to face demonstration and teaching of inhaler technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pamphlet will be given to subjects which is prepared by Bahagian Pendidikan Kesihatan&#xD;
           Kementerian Malaysia containing vital information about Asthma disease and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Second data collection, After four weeks collection of the baseline data, both group&#xD;
      of subjects who are attending follow-up in Respiratory Clinic or by appointment given by the&#xD;
      researcher will be required to answer the same questionnaire and demonstrate their inhaler&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis The collected data will be reviewed by researcher and cross-check by two&#xD;
      independent individuals. The data will be entered into Statistical Package for Social Science&#xD;
      (SPSS) version 20 and will be analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical.&#xD;
      Questionnaire Part A will be analysed using frequency and mean statistical, the result will&#xD;
      be displayed in tables.To analyse the association between subjects' demographic data and&#xD;
      knowledge status and inhaler technique Chi-square test or independent t-test will be used.&#xD;
      Part B of the questionnaire containing of 20 items asking regarding respondents' knowledge of&#xD;
      their disease, medication and treatment maintenance. &quot;. Responses will be made on a three&#xD;
      choice of answer. Each of the correct answer will be given scores 1, and 0 scores for wrong&#xD;
      answers. Researchers will determined the status of respondents' knowledge in two categories,&#xD;
      which is the total score from 15 to 20, is in category of good knowledge and total score from&#xD;
      one to 14 is in poor knowledge category. In order to obtain result descriptive statistic&#xD;
      (mean(SD) analysis will be performed. For result comparison between statistic (mean (SD)&#xD;
      analysis will be performed. For result comparison between intervention and control group&#xD;
      Independent t- test analysis will be used. Part C of the questionnaire is to evaluate the&#xD;
      respondents' inhaler technique using a single page with multiple types of inhaler technique&#xD;
      checklist such as Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI), MDI with spacer, Turbuhaler, Accuhaler,&#xD;
      Intranasal device and Handihaler.&#xD;
