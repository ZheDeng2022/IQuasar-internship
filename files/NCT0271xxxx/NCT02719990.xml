      An open-label extension study to evaluate the safety of long-term twice-monthly&#xD;
      administration of somavaratan in adults with Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD). This&#xD;
      multicenter study is open to subjects completing a Versartis adult GHD study as well as&#xD;
      approximately 40 new somavaratan naïve subjects (either rhGH treatment naïve or currently&#xD;
      receiving daily rhGH therapy). All subjects will receive twice-monthly (every 15 days ± 2&#xD;
      days) subcutaneous (SC) somavaratan. Doses will be titrated to each subject's individual&#xD;
      IGF-I responses based on the IGF-I level 7 days post-dose until a maintenance dose is&#xD;
      achieved. Subjects receiving somavaratan in a previous somavaratan study will have their dose&#xD;
      decreased by half (minimum dose of 20 mg, 40 mg for women on estrogen, rounded down to the&#xD;
      nearest even number) and will be titrated per the Dose Titration Plan. New subjects enrolling&#xD;
      in this study will be assigned to one of two cohorts based on sensitivity to rhGH and&#xD;
      titrated per the Dose Titration Plan.&#xD;
