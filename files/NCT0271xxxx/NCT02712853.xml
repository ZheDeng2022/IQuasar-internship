      The goal of this project is to identify specific miRNAs that are increased or decreased in&#xD;
      the saliva of children with developmental delay and are useful for screening toddlers for&#xD;
      ASD. Such a screening tool would improve the specificity of diagnosis, streamline referrals&#xD;
      to developmental specialists, and expedite the arrangement of early intervention services.&#xD;

      The central aim of this project is to characterize the expression of exosomal microRNA&#xD;
      (miRNA) in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Currently, the CDC estimates the&#xD;
      prevalence of ASD in U.S. children to be 1 in 68. Yet, the biological causes, diagnosis, and&#xD;
      treatment of this disease remain ambiguous. Growing evidence implicates a genetic role in&#xD;
      ASD. miRNAs regulate genetic expression and are altered in lymphocytes, neurons and serum of&#xD;
      patients with ASD. Recent studies of miRNAs have shown that they can be packaged into&#xD;
      exosomal vessels and extruded from neurons as extracellular signaling tools. This knowledge&#xD;
      provides a novel approach for examining the genetic regulation of the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to measure the expression of extracellular miRNA in children with ASD. Expression&#xD;
      levels of miRNA from blood and saliva will be compared between children with autism and&#xD;
      normally developing controls. The goal of this study will be to identify genetic regulatory&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in ASD and provide potential biomarkers for diagnostic screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characterization of brain-related miRNA in the saliva of children with ASD and typically&#xD;
           developing control children between the ages of two and five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identification of sets of miRNAs in saliva and plasma that are predictive of both ASD&#xD;
           diagnosis and severity of ASD symptoms. This aim will enroll ASD and control children&#xD;
           age 12-24 months (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include the identification of miRNA expression patterns that correlate&#xD;
      with ASD symptom severity measured with standardized neuropsychologic testing and to&#xD;
      characterize parental knowledge and attitudes towards epigenetic testing in the context of&#xD;
      ASD..&#xD;

        and 6 years, 11 months of age:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 1: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), diagnosed by a qualified clinical&#xD;
        specialist using DSM-5 criteria and confirmed with ADOS, CASD, or some additional&#xD;

        phenotype.&#xD;
