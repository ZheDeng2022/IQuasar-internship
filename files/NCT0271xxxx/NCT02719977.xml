  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CX5461 is a new type of drug for many types of cancer, particularly cancers that cannot&#xD;
      easily repair damage to their cells. This may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may&#xD;
      cause cancer cells to die. CX5461 has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been&#xD;
      studied in a few people and seems promising but it is not clear if it can offer better&#xD;
      results than standard treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the dose of a new therapy, CX5461, that can be tolerated&#xD;
      without causing very severe side effects and to see what effects the study drug has this&#xD;
      cancer. Participants are given CX5461 and are watched very closely to see what side effects&#xD;
      they have and to make sure the side effects are not severe. If serious side effects are seen&#xD;
      in patients at the first dose level, doses of CX5461 may be lowered in subsequent patients.&#xD;
      If the side effects are not serious, then more participants are asked to join this study and&#xD;
      are given higher doses. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe but&#xD;
      temporary side effects. Doses higher than that will not be given.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Tumour Type Phase I Escalation: Patients must have histologically/and or cytologically&#xD;
        confirmed solid malignancy that is advanced/metastatic/recurrent or unresectable and for&#xD;
        which no curative therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase I Expansion: Patients must have metastatic/recurrent/locally advanced/unresectable&#xD;
        breast cancer with known BRCA1/2 or HRD germline aberrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have a formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue block (from primary&#xD;
             or metastatic tumour) available and must have provided informed consent for the&#xD;
             release of the block. All patients must also have provided informed consent for a&#xD;
             whole blood sample (after implementation of amendment 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients enrolled after the implementation of Amendment 2 must also have provided&#xD;
             informed consent for, and be willing to undergo, a skin biopsy (of an area including&#xD;
             hair follicles, that is not sun-exposed) prior to treatment (after registration) and&#xD;
             after cycle 1 day 15 (C1D16). Paired tumour biopsies will also be required for 6-8&#xD;
             patients enrolled to the RP2D expansion. Note: During accrual to this portion of the&#xD;
             study, it may be necessary to restrict accrual to patients who are suitable for, and&#xD;
             have consented to, tumour and skin biopsies. Paired tumour biopsies are strongly&#xD;
             recommended for all patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of clinically and/or radiologically documented disease. All radiology studies&#xD;
             must be performed within 28 days prior to registration (within 35 days if negative).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Phase I: patients do not need to have measurable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Phase I Expansion: patients must have measurable disease&#xD;
&#xD;

             chemotherapy is considered an advanced regimen) Note: initially, there is no&#xD;
             limitation to the use of prior platinumor PARPi containing regimens. During the&#xD;
             expansion accrual may be limited to patients considered to be platinum naive, or&#xD;
             platinum sensitive (no evidence of disease progression on or within 3 months of the&#xD;
             last dose) or PARPi naïve or exposed. Sites will be informed at the time of the&#xD;
             opening of the cohorts&#xD;

        radiotherapy is not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previous surgery is permitted provided that a minimum of 28 days (4 weeks) have elapsed&#xD;
        between any major surgery and date of registration, and that wound healing has occurred.&#xD;
