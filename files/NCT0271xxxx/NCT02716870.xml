  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fructose-containing sugars have been implicated in the epidemics of obesity, diabetes and&#xD;
      related cardiometabolic disorders. This view is supported by lower quality evidence from&#xD;
      ecological observations, animal models, and select human trials. Higher level evidence from&#xD;
      controlled trials and prospective cohort studies have been inconclusive. Whether sugars&#xD;
      contribute to cardiometabolic complications independent of their calories remains unclear. To&#xD;
      address the uncertainties, the investigators propose to conduct a series of systematic&#xD;
      reviews and meta-analyses of the totality of the evidence from controlled trials to&#xD;
      distinguish the contribution of fructose-containing sugars from that of energy in the&#xD;
      development of markers of cardiometabolic risk. The findings generated by this proposed&#xD;
      knowledge synthesis will help improve the health of consumers through informing&#xD;
      evidence-based guidelines and improving health outcomes by educating healthcare providers and&#xD;
      patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Sugars have emerged as one of the most important public health concerns.&#xD;
      Attention has focused particularly on fructose-containing sugars (fructose, sucrose, high&#xD;
      fructose corn syrup, honey, etc), which collectively have been indicted as drivers of various&#xD;
      cardiometabolic complications. This special view rests on the unique metabolic and endocrine&#xD;
      responses to fructose. Unlike glucose, fructose is thought to bypasses negative feedback&#xD;
      controls acting as an unregulated substrate for de novo lipogenesis and impair satiety&#xD;
      signaling resulting in weight gain. In support of these mechanisms, animal models,&#xD;
      low-quality ecological studies, and select human trials of overfeeding at levels of exposure&#xD;
      far beyond population intakes have reported adverse metabolic effects of sugars. Higher level&#xD;
      evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of controlled trials, however, suggests&#xD;
      that any effects of sugars are mediated by excess calories rather than the sugars per se. It&#xD;
      remains unclear whether fructose-containing sugars contribute to cardiometabolic&#xD;
      complications independent of their calories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for proposed research: High quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses of controlled&#xD;
      trials represent the highest level of evidence to support dietary guidelines and public&#xD;
      health policy development. As dietary guidelines and public health policy have shifted toward&#xD;
      food and dietary-pattern based recommendations, there is an urgent need for systematic&#xD;
      reviews and meta-analyses comparing the role of different food sources of sugars in the&#xD;
      development of cardiometabolic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The investigators will conduct a series systematic reviews and meta-analyses to&#xD;
      distinguish the effect of fructose-containing sugars from that of energy on measures of&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk in controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Each systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted according to the Cochrane&#xD;
      Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported according to the Preferred&#xD;
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials&#xD;
      (Clinical Trials; CENTRAL) will be searched using appropriate search terms supplemented by&#xD;
      hand searches of references of included studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: The investigators will include randomized and non-randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials &gt;= 7-days in duration to assess the effect of fructose-containing sugars (fructose,&#xD;
      sucrose, high fructose corn syrup, honey, etc) on measures of cardiometabolic risk. To allow&#xD;
      for the separation of the effect of sugars from that of energy, 4 trial designs will be&#xD;
      considered: (1) 'substitution' trials, in which fructose-containing sugars added to foods and&#xD;
      beverages are compared with other macronutrient sources (usually starch or other sugars)&#xD;
      under energy matched conditions; (2) 'addition' trials, in which fructose-containing sugars&#xD;
      supplement a diet with excess energy compared to the same diet alone without the excess&#xD;
      energy; (3) 'subtraction' trials, in which energy from fructose-containing sugars (usually in&#xD;
      the form of sugars-sweetened beverages) is reduced by displacing it with water and/or&#xD;
      no-calorie or low-calorie sweeteners or by eliminating it altogether from the background&#xD;
      diet; and (4) 'ad libitum' trials, in which energy from fructose-containing sugars are freely&#xD;
      replaced with other sources of energy (usually complex carbohydrates or fat) without any&#xD;
      strict control of either the study foods or the background diet. Trials will be categorized&#xD;
      by sources of fructose-containing sugars (fruits, fruit juices, sugars-sweetened beverages,&#xD;
      liquid meal replacements, dairy products, sweets/desserts/baked goods, mixed sources) and chi&#xD;
      squared tests will be used to determine between-group differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Two or more investigators will independently extract relevant data and&#xD;
      assess risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. All disagreements will be resolved&#xD;
      by consensus. Standard computations and imputations will be used to derive missing variance&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Five sets of outcomes will be assessed: (1) glycemic control (glycated blood&#xD;
      proteins [HbA1c, fructosamine, glycated albumin], fasting glucose, and fasting insulin), (2)&#xD;
      blood lipids (Established therapeutic lipid targets [LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol,&#xD;
      apolipoprotein B (apo B), HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides]), (3) blood pressure (systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure), (4) uric acid, (5) non-alcoholic fatty liver&#xD;
      disease (NAFLD) (intrahepatocellular lipids [IHCL], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate&#xD;
      aminotransferase [AST]) and inflammation (c-reactive protein [CRP], IL-6, TNF-alpha).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis: Mean differences will be pooled using the generic inverse variance method for&#xD;
      each food source of fructose-containing sugars. Random-effects models will be used even in&#xD;
      the absence of statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more&#xD;
      conservative summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity.&#xD;
      Fixed-effects models will only be used where there is &lt;5 included studies. Paired analyses&#xD;
      will be applied for crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be assessed by the Cochran Q&#xD;
      statistic and quantified by the I2 statistic. To explore sources of heterogeneity, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct sensitivity analyses, in which each study is systematically&#xD;
      removed. If there are &gt;=10 studies, then the investigators will also explore sources of&#xD;
      heterogeneity by a priori subgroup analyses by age (children [=&lt;18 years of age], adults),&#xD;
      health status (metabolic syndrome criteria, diabetes, overweight/ obese, healthy), comparator&#xD;
      type, fructose- containing sugar form (sucrose, high fructose corn syrup [HFCS], honey,&#xD;
      fructose), dose (=&lt;10% energy, &gt;10%), baseline measurements, randomization, study design&#xD;
      (parallel, crossover), energy balance (positive, neutral, negative), follow-up (&lt;8-weeks,&#xD;
      &gt;=8-weeks), feeding control (metabolic, supplemented, dietary advice), funding (agency,&#xD;
      industry, agency+industry, not reported), and risk of bias. Meta-regression analyses will&#xD;
      assess the significance of categorical and continuous subgroups analyses. When &gt;=10 studies&#xD;
      are available, publication bias will be investigated by inspection of funnel plots and formal&#xD;
      testing using the Egger and Begg tests. If publication bias is suspected, then the&#xD;
      investigators will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by imputing the missing study&#xD;
      data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence Assessment: The strength of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: The results will be disseminated through interactive&#xD;
      presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in&#xD;
      high impact factor journals. Target audiences will include the public health and scientific&#xD;
      communities with interest in nutrition, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Feedback will be incorporated and used to improve the public health message and key areas for&#xD;
      future research will be defined. Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers will network among&#xD;
      opinion leaders to increase awareness and participate directly as committee members in the&#xD;
      development of future guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the role of&#xD;
      dietary fructose-containing sugars and important food sources of these sugars in the&#xD;
      development of cardiometabolic diseases, strengthening the evidence-base for guidelines and&#xD;
      improving health outcomes by educating healthcare providers and patients, stimulating&#xD;
      industry innovation, and guiding future research design.&#xD;
