  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the impact of a randomized intervention aimed at increasing&#xD;
      consumption of whole grain foods among children from low-income households that participate&#xD;
      in the Special Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or &quot;food stamps&quot;). A total of 60 obese&#xD;
      children (8 to 16 years) will be recruited from a clinical population (Healthy Eating Active&#xD;
      Living Program) at University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Benioff Children's Hospital&#xD;
      Oakland. Participants and their caregivers will all receive education about whole grain&#xD;
      foods, and will be randomized to either an intervention or control group. The intervention&#xD;
      group will receive a monthly reimbursement allotment of up to 10% of their usual SNAP benefit&#xD;
      for specific whole grain foods purchased during the three month study period. The control&#xD;
      group will not have the financial incentive for purchasing whole grain foods during the 12&#xD;
      week study period. The investigators will assess the feasibility of the intervention, the&#xD;
      impact of the intervention on household grocery purchases, and the impact on the child's&#xD;
      anthropometrics, dietary intake of whole grain foods (24-hour recall), and markers of&#xD;
      metabolic risk.&#xD;

      RUN-IN PHASE (Weeks -4 to 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will participate in a &quot;run-in phase&quot; where they will be asked to keep all&#xD;
           grocery receipts for a 4 week period&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION (Week 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Child participants with caregivers who are able to successfully complete the run-in&#xD;
           phase are then randomized at that point to be either in the intervention arm or the&#xD;
           control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be block randomized by age group (8-11 and 12-16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTIVE PHASE (Weeks 0-12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be given education about whole grains and whole grain preparation.&#xD;
           Intervention and control participant activities described elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RETURN VISIT (Week 24)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 weeks after the completion of the active phase of the study, patients will be asked&#xD;
           to return for a final visit at the research center, during which they will also have&#xD;
           blood tests and other study activities repeated for one final time.&#xD;

    <description>Using the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR) for 24-hour food recall, intake of whole grains (and refined grains, and proportion of grains that are whole) will be assessed. The change in this dietary outcome at the end of 3 months will be evaluated for intervention participants compared to controls.</description>
