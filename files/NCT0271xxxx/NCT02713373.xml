      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of cetuximab when given together&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab in treating patients with colorectal cancer that has spread from the&#xD;
      primary site (place where it started) to other places in the body (metastatic) or that cannot&#xD;
      be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetixumab and pembrolizumab, may block&#xD;
      tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the objective response rate of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer&#xD;
      treated with pembrolizumab and cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the 6-month progression free survival (PFS) rate of patients with metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer treated with pembrolizumab and cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine the adverse event profile of combining pembrolizumab and cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the PFS of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the objective response rate by immune-related response criteria (irRC) of&#xD;
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine the overall survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab and cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Identify tumor and peripheral blood biomarkers of response and/or resistance to the study&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 120 minutes on day 1, 8, and 15 (as&#xD;
      monotherapy for cycle 1 only) and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 3 weeks for 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients may continue pembrolizumab treatment for up to 1 year if they experience&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
