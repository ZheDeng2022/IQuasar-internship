  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study proposes adding BMP-2 (INFUSE), an anabolic agent, at the surgical site of&#xD;
      TPA (tibial pseudarthrosis) repair in children with NF1, compared to a control group of&#xD;
      patients treated surgically without BMP-2. The following Specific Aims will be addressed: 1)&#xD;
      to determine if use of an osteogenic agent (BMP-2) at the time of surgical repair of TPA in&#xD;
      NF1 patients will result in improved bone healing; 2) to document safety of BMP-2 in a&#xD;
      pediatric NF1 population; and 3) to collect, process, and preserve biologic specimens at the&#xD;
      time of surgery for future studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized study will be performed by a multi-center group of the NF Consortium. A total of&#xD;
      54 patients will be randomized for treatment with or without INFUSE Bone Graft at the time of&#xD;
      surgical repair. For all patients, a standard surgical procedure will be used, including:&#xD;
      resection of pseudarthrosis tissue; placement of a rigid intramedullary rod; and placement of&#xD;
      autogenous bone graft from iliac crest. For patients in the BMP group, the INFUSE device&#xD;
      containing BMP-2 will in addition be applied intraoperatively to the osteotomy site. Fracture&#xD;
      union will be determined by scoring of radiographs (RUST score) for cortical bone fusion and&#xD;
      callus formation at the osteotomy site. RUST score at 12 months post-surgery will be the&#xD;
      primary outcome measure to determine efficacy. Secondary measures will include determination&#xD;
      of time to healing (months); quality of life measures; functional walking measures; and&#xD;
      incidence of refracture after surgery. This study, once successfully completed, will&#xD;
      determine if use of INFUSE Bone Graft improves healing of tibial pseudarthrosis in NF1 and&#xD;
      will document safety issues. Regardless of results, the better performing of the two groups&#xD;
      (control or BMP) will be able to serve as a much-needed control arm for future studies of&#xD;
      additional targeted therapeutic agents for NF1-related bone disease. An international working&#xD;
      group of orthopaedic surgeons and NF specialists has been formed and is committed to&#xD;
      successful completion of this trial.&#xD;

    <description>The RUST scale (Radiographic Union Score for Tibial fractures; RUST) was developed in 2010 as a measure of tibial fracture healing and has been validated in the NF1 population. This was used as the primary outcome measure in this trial. The score is based on radiographic evaluation of the bone cortex based on AP (anterior-posterior) and lateral xrays. Four cortices of tibial bone seen in these views are each given a score of 1 to 3, with 1 representing no healing, 2 representing some callus present, and 3 representing healing of the bone cortex. The 4 scores are totaled, to give a total score range of 4 to 12. For the purpose of this study, a total RUST score of 9 to 12, with at least 2 evaluable cortices having a score of 3, is considered to be healed. Scores of 5 to 8 are considered to represent partial healing, and a score of 4 is considered to be no healing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Time to Healing in Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 12 months post-surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Time to healing is determined by RUST scores calculated at 3 month intervals after surgery. The first time point at which a score of 9 to 12 is achieved on the RUST Scale will be considered the time to complete healing. One time point is reported which is the time point of first healing.</description>

          <title>RUST score</title>
          <description>The RUST scale (Radiographic Union Score for Tibial fractures; RUST) is a measure of tibial fracture healing. Score is based on radiographic evaluation of the bone cortex based on AP and lateral xrays. Four cortices of tibial bone are each given a score of 1 to 3, with 1=no healing, 2=some callus present, and 3=healing of the bone cortex. The 4 scores are totaled for a total score range of 4 to 12. For this study, a total RUST score of 9 to 12, with at least 2 evaluable cortices having a score of 3, is considered to be healed. Scores of 5 to 8 = partial healing, and a score of 4 = no healing.</description>

        <title>RUST Score</title>
        <description>The RUST scale (Radiographic Union Score for Tibial fractures; RUST) was developed in 2010 as a measure of tibial fracture healing and has been validated in the NF1 population. This was used as the primary outcome measure in this trial. The score is based on radiographic evaluation of the bone cortex based on AP (anterior-posterior) and lateral xrays. Four cortices of tibial bone seen in these views are each given a score of 1 to 3, with 1 representing no healing, 2 representing some callus present, and 3 representing healing of the bone cortex. The 4 scores are totaled, to give a total score range of 4 to 12. For the purpose of this study, a total RUST score of 9 to 12, with at least 2 evaluable cortices having a score of 3, is considered to be healed. Scores of 5 to 8 are considered to represent partial healing, and a score of 4 is considered to be no healing.</description>
        <time_frame>12 mos post surgery. The score at 12 mos post surgery will be used to determine success of healing and is the score reported.</time_frame>
        <population>The population consisted of 2 evaluable participants. Three (3) participants withdrew for various reasons (see participant flow).

            <description>Children with NF1 and tibial pseudarthrosis who require surgery will receive the standard surgical protocol only. This includes resection of abnormal pseudarthrotic tissue, placement of a rigid intramedullary rod (of the surgeon's choice) and placement of autogenous bone graft from the iliac crest.&#xD;
Control Group: The control group will receive the standard surgical protocol, without addition of the INFUSE device.</description>

          <title>Pain Intensity</title>
          <description>Pain Intensity was measured using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) for patients aged 4 years and older. This is a self-report pain scale, where children chose one of 6 faces to indicate their current pain. Scores range from 0 to 10, with 0 representing no pain (happy face) and 10 representing the most pain.</description>
          <population>Participants were all too young to report on this scale (younger than age 4 years). No results are reported.</population>

In addition, a Global Functioning Scale is computed. Scores for each subscale range from 0 to 100, with lower scores representing better quality of life.</description>

      <desc>The population consisted of 2 evaluable participants. Three (3) participants withdrew for various reasons (see participant flow). The study was closed for further enrollment due to poor recruitment. The study was closed after the last participant completed study procedures. No participants were randomized to the control group.</desc>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>In June 2019 at the recommendation of the study protocol chairs, the study was closed for enrollment with plans to terminate the study after the last patient completed study procedures. Therefore limited data is available for analysis.</limitations_and_caveats>
