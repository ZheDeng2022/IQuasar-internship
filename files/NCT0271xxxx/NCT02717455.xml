    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of panobinostat in treating younger&#xD;
      patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Panobinostat may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Stratum 1 treats patients&#xD;
      with DIPG that has returned or gotten worse (progressed). Stratum 2 treats patients with DIPG&#xD;
      that has not yet gotten worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, only Stratum 2 is enrolling patients.&#xD;

      Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, phase 1 trial of Panobinostat (LBH589) for children with diffuse&#xD;
      intrinsic pontine glioma tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panobinostat is a pan-HDAC inhibitor of Class I, II and IV histone deacetylases (HDACs)&#xD;
      involved in the deacetylation of histone and non-histone cellular proteins. Panobinostat&#xD;
      inhibits purified total cellular histone deacetylase activity (IC50 = 0.03 uM) and activities&#xD;
      of most HDAC isoforms (IC50 &lt;10nM). In addition, panobinostat induces expression of the&#xD;
      cell-cycle control genes including CDKN1A (p21), and selectively inhibits the proliferation&#xD;
      of a variety of tumor cells compared to normal cells. It has been extensively profiled for&#xD;
      its in vitro and in vivo pharmacological activity on a variety of tumor cell lines and tumor&#xD;
      xenograft mice models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the in vitro and in vivo activity of panobinostat in preclinical models using DIPG&#xD;
      cell cultures and orthotopic xenograft model systems, and the potentially important role of&#xD;
      histone deacetylases and histone 3 K27M mutations in relation to pontine malignancies, the&#xD;
      investigators are conducting a Phase 1 study of panobinostat in children with&#xD;
      recurrent/progressive DIPG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the study are to (1) describe the toxicity profile and define the&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicities of panobinostat in children with recurrent/progressive DIPG, or with&#xD;
      non-progressed DIPG taken every other week; (2) estimate the maximum tolerated dose and/or&#xD;
      the recommended Phase 2 dose of panobinostat in children with recurrent/progressive DIPG, or&#xD;
      with non-progressed DIPG taken every other week; and (3) evaluate and characterize the plasma&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of panobinostat in children with recurrent/progressive DIPG, or with&#xD;
      non-progressed DIPG taken every other week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schema&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATUM 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients with recurrent or progressive DIPG will be enrolled initially. Panobinostat&#xD;
      will be administered every other day, 3 times/week, p.o. preferably on a&#xD;
      Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule for three weeks, followed by a rest period. Three weeks of&#xD;
      therapy plus the one week rest period (total 4 weeks) will constitute one course. Treatment&#xD;
      will continue for up to two years (26 courses) unless the patient experiences progressive&#xD;
      disease, unacceptable toxicity or any of the off-study criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starting dose (dose level 1) is 10 mg/m2/day. Below are the proposed dose levels to be&#xD;
      studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose level # Panobinostat oral dose (mg) Minimum BSA Restriction&#xD;
&#xD;
      0*: 5 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a&#xD;
      BSA ≥ 0.80 m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 (starting dose level): 10 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28&#xD;
      days). Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.65 m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2: 16 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a&#xD;
      BSA ≥ 0.65 m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3: 22 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a&#xD;
      BSA ≥ 0.65 m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4: 28 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a&#xD;
      BSA ≥ 0.50 m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5: 36 mg/m2/day MWF, three weeks on, one week off, (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a&#xD;
      BSA ≥ 0.50 m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panobinostat will be administered as a single agent&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Dose level 0 represents a potential treatment dose for patients requiring a dose reduction&#xD;
      from dose level 1 and may be used as a contingency dose level if the starting dose level of&#xD;
      panobinostat is not tolerated in the initial cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATUM 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with DIPG who have received adequate radiation therapy but have not yet progressed&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the currently open Stratum 2. Panobinostat will be administered every&#xD;
      other day, 3 times/week, every other week p.o. preferably on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday&#xD;
      schedule. Total 4 weeks will constitute one course. Treatment will continue for up to two&#xD;
      years (26 courses) unless the patient experiences progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      or any of the off-treatment criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starting dose (dose level 1) is 16 mg/m2/day. Below are the proposed dose levels to be&#xD;
      studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose level # Panobinostat oral dose (mg) Minimum BSA Restriction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Negative 1*: 5 mg/m2/day MWF, every other week (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a BSA&#xD;
      ≥ 0.80 m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0*: 10 mg/m2/day MWF, every other week, (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.65&#xD;
      m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 (expected starting dose level): 16 mg/m2/day MWF, every other week, (1 course = 28 days).&#xD;
      Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.65 m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2: 22 mg/m2/day MWF, every other week, (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.65&#xD;
      m2.&#xD;
&#xD;

      m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4: 36 mg/m2/day MWF, every other week, (1 course = 28 days). Patients must have a BSA ≥ 0.50&#xD;
      m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panobinostat will be administered as a single agent&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Dose levels 0 and -1 represent potential treatment doses for patients requiring a dose&#xD;
      reduction from dose level 1 and may be used as a contingency dose level if the starting dose&#xD;
      level of panobinostat is not tolerated in the initial cohort.&#xD;
