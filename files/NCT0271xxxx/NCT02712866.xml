      Background: Infiltration of GI by T lymphocytes is a pathogenic mechanism both in ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis (UC) and in Crohn's disease (CD). Vedolizumab (VDZ) is a humanized monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody binding with high affinity to α4β7 integrin blocking α4β7+-MAdCAM-1 interaction,&#xD;
      hence blocking a key step in GI lymphocytes T infiltration. VDZ has demonstrated a&#xD;
      therapeutic effect in UC and CD. Investigators still lack of adequate biomarkers to predict&#xD;
      clinical response to biological treatments, specially avoiding invasive procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Study whether circulating CD4+ and CD8+ α4β7+ memory T lymphocytes and some of&#xD;
      their surface markers might be molecular markers of response to VDZ treatment in patients&#xD;
      with UC and CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Prospective (pilot) study including 24 adult IBD patients (12 UC patients and 12 CD&#xD;
      patients (patients with fistulizing perianal disease will be excluded) with active disease&#xD;
      and prior failure to anti-TNFα treatments starting treatment with VDZ. They will received VDZ&#xD;
      in standard induction (300mg intravenously, 0-2-6 weeks) and maintenance schemes (300mg&#xD;
      intravenously, every 8 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological and clinical data from every patient will be recorded prospectively. Disease&#xD;
      activity at weeks 0, 2, 6 and 14 weeks will be evaluated through validated clinical scores,&#xD;
      biological parameters and fecal biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 14 response to the treatment will be evaluated by ileocolonoscopy or enteroMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood will be obtained from every patient at baseline, before the third infusion&#xD;
      of VDZ (6th week) and before the first maintenance dose (14th week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood lymphocytes will be isolated and multicolor flow cytometry will be performed on stored&#xD;
      circulating memory T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percentage and absolute values of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ α4β7+ memory T lymphocytes as&#xD;
      well as several surface markers related to their activation state (HLA-DR, CD25), Th17&#xD;
      phenotype (IL23R, CCR6, intracellular IL17A) and Th1 phenotype (INFγ)will be assessed on&#xD;
      α4β7+ memory T cells.&#xD;
