  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise therapy in MS patients has proven benefits on mobility, mood, motor function and&#xD;
      quality of life. While the beneficial effects of exercise on cardiovascular and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal function are well known, there has recently been increased focus on the&#xD;
      positive effects of exercise on brain structure and function. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      determine whether exercise can promote beneficial changes in brain function in MS patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, disabling neurologic disease characterized by damage to&#xD;
      myelin and axons in the central nervous system (CNS). Current therapy for MS primarily&#xD;
      consists of immunomodulatory drugs aimed at preventing future CNS injury; no treatments are&#xD;
      currently available to repair existing damage, and symptomatic treatments to improve&#xD;
      neurological function are quite limited. Rehabilitation approaches, such as exercise, have&#xD;
      long been a staple of MS therapy. Exercise therapy in MS patients has proven benefits on&#xD;
      mobility, mood, motor function and quality of life. While the beneficial effects of exercise&#xD;
      on cardiovascular and musculoskeletal function are well known, there has recently been&#xD;
      increased focus on the positive effects of exercise on brain structure and function. The&#xD;
      overall aim of this proposal is to determine whether exercise can promote beneficial changes&#xD;
      in brain function in MS patients. The investigator's central hypothesis is that&#xD;
      cardiovascular exercise alters both brain structure and brain function in MS patients, and&#xD;
      that these changes can be identified and monitored via imaging techniques that evaluate&#xD;
      regional brain volumes and functional connectivity. When brain activity measured at one area&#xD;
      fluctuates in a coherent manner with that recorded in a different area, those brain regions&#xD;
      are considered to be functionally connected. Using resting-state magnetoencephalography&#xD;
      (MEG), the investigator's laboratory has demonstrated that these patterns of correlated brain&#xD;
      activity are abnormal in MS patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MS by revised McDonald criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-6.0, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to understand the consent process, and the use of the wristband activity tracker.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sedentary by self-report (answers no to the question: &quot;Do you exercise regularly?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to make sincere effort to comply with the study objective of increasing their&#xD;
             physical activity as much as possible (with goal of at least 100% increase) and to&#xD;
             maintain that increased activity level for six months (if randomized to the exercise&#xD;
             group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current serious medical condition which would likely limit subject's ability to&#xD;
             achieve sustained increase in physical activity, or put them at risk for doing so in&#xD;
             the investigators' opinion (e.g. significant cardiovascular or respiratory disease,&#xD;
             cancer, cancer, orthopedic disease, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects that have a central nervous system disorder (in addition to MS) that is not&#xD;
             considered secondary to MS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects that have implanted metal, pacemaker, etc. that may interfere with the&#xD;
             MEG/MRI scan or who are otherwise unable to complete the MEG/MRI scan procedure&#xD;
             without sedation (e.g. due to claustrophobia, obesity)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  weight &gt; 300 pounds&#xD;
