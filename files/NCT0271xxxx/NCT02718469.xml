    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety profile of the Zaire Ebola vaccine and the&#xD;
      strength of the immune response.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ebola Zaire is a filovirus that has caused devastating epidemics of hemorrhagic fever in&#xD;
      South Africa. Research is underway to create a safe and effective vaccine to protect against&#xD;
      Ebola disease, especially for the military and health care workers. Promising animal studies&#xD;
      with this vaccine indicate safety and immunogenicity, and the vaccine platform used to&#xD;
      deliver the Ebola protein antigen has been successful in creating a safe and protective&#xD;
      immune response in people. Note that only one Ebola protein is used in this vaccine; since&#xD;
      the entire intact Ebola virus is required for infection, it is impossible to get Ebola&#xD;
      disease from this vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study targets enrollment of 39 healthy adults. These participants are divided into 3&#xD;
      groups that will be administered one of three dose levels of the vaccine (low, medium, high).&#xD;
      The study participants will receive two doses of vaccine: one on day 1 and the second on day&#xD;
      28 (1 month). Three participants at each dose level will act as controls and receive a&#xD;
      placebo instead of the active vaccine. A total of 13 visits to the clinic are required over a&#xD;
      period of 26 weeks. The total study is expected to take 9 months.&#xD;
