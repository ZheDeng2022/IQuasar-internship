    <textblock>
      Although the last decade has brought major advances with respect to our knowledge of certain&#xD;
      risks associated with fetal exposure to psychiatric medications, critical information&#xD;
      regarding the long-term neurobehavioral impact of fetal exposure is lacking. With a&#xD;
      prevalence rate of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use across pregnancy in&#xD;
      Western countries noted to be as high as 5-8%, this study aims to close the gap in knowledge&#xD;
      regarding long-term neurobehavioral sequelae of in utero exposure to this class of&#xD;
      antidepressants. Importantly, the assessment of the impact of antenatal psychotropic&#xD;
      medication use must be conducted with an appreciation of the potential direct and indirect&#xD;
      effects of maternal psychiatric illness during pregnancy and throughout childhood. The&#xD;
      outcomes of this study will help to inform the care of reproductive age women treated with&#xD;
      psychiatric medications as they, along with the clinicians prescribing for them, weigh the&#xD;
      relative risks of using these agents during pregnancy.&#xD;

      Neuropsychological evaluation of older children than previously studied with histories of&#xD;
      fetal exposure to antidepressants and maternal depression during pregnancy is needed and may&#xD;
      inform whether a signal for neural disruption exists following fetal selective serotonin&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) exposure. Identification of genetic factors which may afford&#xD;
      resilience or particular vulnerability to fetal exposure to antidepressants is a logical&#xD;
      component of this translational initiative designed to answer the proposed research question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-based&#xD;
      drugs has the influence excitatory/inhibitory balance and to shift critical periods, there is&#xD;
      reason to believe that some aspects of brain development may also be altered. To this end,&#xD;
      this project aims to &quot;scan&quot; a variety of brain functions that include memory, attention, and&#xD;
      executive functions; in addition, it will also examine the extent to which face and speech&#xD;
      processing are altered in the target sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess older children ages 6-17 with histories of fetal exposure to&#xD;
      antidepressants and/or maternal depression during pregnancy. It will evaluate child behavior&#xD;
      based on maternal report and utilize neuropsychological evaluation to inform whether a signal&#xD;
      for neural disruption exists following fetal SSRI or depression exposure. The&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessments will be paired with an analysis of genetic factors which may&#xD;
      afford resilience or particular vulnerability to fetal exposure to antidepressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study leverages unique patient resources with respect to children of mothers with well&#xD;
      documented histories of SSRI exposure who have been prospectively followed across pregnancy.&#xD;
      The multidisciplinary collaboration between the lead investigator, Dr. Lee S. Cohen of the&#xD;
      Center for Women's Mental Health (CWMH), and the Laboratories of Cognitive Neuroscience,&#xD;
      Boston Children's Hospital (Dr. Charles Nelson), the Department of Molecular and Cellular&#xD;
      Biology, and the Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Genetics Unit at Massachusetts General&#xD;
      Hospital (Dr. Jordan Smoller) is a remarkable opportunity to better understand the effects of&#xD;
      maternal antidepressant exposure during pregnancy on neuropsychological development of&#xD;
      children.&#xD;

        This study will be composed of two components: a maternal assessment based at Massachusetts&#xD;
        General Hospital (MGH) and a child evaluation based at Boston Children's Hospital. Mother&#xD;
        and child pairs may elect to complete both components of the study. If either participant&#xD;
        does not want the child to take part in the research, the maternal component may be&#xD;
        completed alone. Similarly, the child may enroll in the research study without the&#xD;
        enrollment of the mother with parental consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who are interested and eligible for the study may choose to complete the study&#xD;
        in-person at MGH or to be evaluated remotely by a phone interview and set of online&#xD;
        surveys. All child subjects must participate in an in-person visit at Boston Children's&#xD;
        Hospital.&#xD;
