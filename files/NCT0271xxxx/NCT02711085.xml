      This study will explore the contribution of stress-system activity to pain and functional&#xD;
      disability in the acute stage of traumatic musculoskeletal injury, and to the maintenance of&#xD;
      symptoms after 3, 6 and 12 months post-injury.&#xD;

      Purpose: The purpose of this protocol is to establish a longitudinal database of data&#xD;
      collected from people having experienced an acute traumatic injury to their musculoskeletal&#xD;
      system. This includes injuries commonly considered 'non-catastrophic' or 'minor' soft tissue&#xD;
      injuries such as whiplash, low back injuries, sports or slip and fall-type injuries that&#xD;
      result in sprain/strain of muscle, tendon, ligament or other such soft tissues. Uncomplicated&#xD;
      bony fractures (those that are managed through casting only, non-surgical) will also comprise&#xD;
      this cohort. The data will include biological specimens, psychological and cognitive&#xD;
      profiles, and social/environmental indicators. This protocol represents the start of the&#xD;
      SYStematic Merging of Biology, Mental health and Environment (SYMBIOME) project from the&#xD;
      emerging Solving Traumatic pain and disability through Advanced Research Translation (START)&#xD;
      research group centred at Western. Over time, this database will allow rich exploration of&#xD;
      complex interactions between biology, psychology and environment as they relate to the&#xD;
      resolution of traumatic pain and disability, or similarly the persistence thereof. Additional&#xD;
      research ethics board (REB) applications will be submitted as those projects are ready to be&#xD;
      formally conducted.&#xD;
