      This research study is studying a combination of study drugs as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      relapsed and refractory Multiple Myeloma. The interventions involved in this study are&#xD;
      elotuzumab, pomalidomide, bortezomib, dexamethasone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a phase II clinical trial, the investigators are studying the safety&#xD;
      and response rate of the combinations of elotuzumab, pomalidomide, bortezomib, dexamethasone&#xD;
      (elo-PVD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved each of those drugs elotuzumab,&#xD;
      pomalidomide, bortezomib, dexamethasone as a treatment option for Refractory or relapsed&#xD;
      multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomalidomide is a drug that changes that enhances or suppresses your immune systems reaction&#xD;
      to a stimulus.This change may help the body destroy tumor cells. Bortezomib is an inhibitor&#xD;
      that targets how cells dispose of unneeded proteins. By blocking this process, bortezomib can&#xD;
      help destroy unwanted cells. Dexamethasone is a steroid, that helps prevent inflammation in a&#xD;
      wide variety of organs and acts against myeloma cells. Elotuzumab is a monoclonal antibody,&#xD;
      Elotuzumab targets a protein that is highly common on the surface of multiple myeloma cells&#xD;
      called SLAMF7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of the drugs may provide an unique approach for treating the disease.&#xD;
