      The Italian Society of Invasive Cardiology Registry on Percutaneous Aortic Valve is a&#xD;
      prospective Italian registry including several centers performing TAVI, collecting baseline,&#xD;
      procedural and outcome data.&#xD;

      Aortic valve stenosis is the most common degenerative valve disease in the elderly, the&#xD;
      prevalence is about 1-2% in the age group&gt; 65 years and 4% in patients aged&gt; 85. The natural&#xD;
      history is characterized by a poor prognosis with a survival rate of 62% at 1 year, 32% at 5&#xD;
      years and 18% at 10 years from symptom onset. Predictors of death were age&gt; of 75 years, poor&#xD;
      left ventricular ejection fraction, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease, severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard therapy, with improved survival, for severe aortic stenosis is the surgical&#xD;
      aortic valve replacement with mechanical or biological prosthesis. Cardiac surgery is therapy&#xD;
      of choice for patients with severe aortic valve stenosis with left ventricular dysfunction or&#xD;
      when symptomatic for lipothymia or syncope, angina pectoris, heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for high surgical risk are: left ventricular failure, coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      previous cardiac surgery for coronary artery bypass , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,&#xD;
      and/or advanced age and comorbidity , which can be a contraindication to intervention.&#xD;
      Frequently cardiac surgery is not performed in elderly patients for the high surgery risk. In&#xD;
      the Euro Heart Survey up to 33% of patients with single valve disease, New York Heart&#xD;
      Association class III or IV, were not operated for concomitant disease or reduced life&#xD;
      expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need to provide a therapeutic option for patients considered at high surgery risk, has&#xD;
      stimulated the development of prosthetic valve implantable with a percutaneous transcatheter&#xD;
      techniques. The percutaneous treatment of valvular aortic stenosis has potential advantages&#xD;
      in terms of reduction of hospitalization of elderly patients with high risk of peri-operative&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity, as well as avoiding treatment with oral anticoagulants. The&#xD;
      experience up to now is very positive, with immediate favorable results in terms of&#xD;
      hemodynamic and clinical improvement. Since the procedure is at initial stage of clinical&#xD;
      application, it becomes necessary a uniform and standardized data collection to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the procedure, the incidence of acute and late complications, and the&#xD;
      performance of the biological valve prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose the establishment of an observational registry of percutaneous&#xD;
      aortic valve replacement performed in the Italian Interventional Cardiology Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record the clinical criteria used to asses indication for percutaneous aortic valve&#xD;
           replacement in different centers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record the anatomical and morphological criteria of vascular access and thoraco&#xD;
           abdominal aorta, evaluated with noninvasive and invasive diagnostic tests&#xD;
           (echocardiography, multislice angiographic computed tomography, aortography) in&#xD;
           particular calcification and tortuosity of aorto-iliac-femoral axis, degree of&#xD;
           calcifications of the aortic valve and thoracic aortic wall calcifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record the types of devices used for percutaneous aortic valve replacement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observe different way of procedure (type of access, anesthetic protocols, procedural&#xD;
           delay, aortic valvuloplasty, and so forth)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow the procedure-related complications and / or of prosthesis implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acute complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Cerebral ischemia&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Arrhythmias&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Pericardial effusion / cardiac tamponade&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Aortic valve insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Periprosthesis insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Myocardial ischemia&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Kidney diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Conversion to cardiac surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Complications related to arterial vascular access&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Late complications&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Residual aortic valve insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Arrhythmias with need of pacemaker&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Coronary Ischemia&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Kidney diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Endocarditis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post Procedure hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the results at 30 days, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  echocardiographic mean transvalvular aortic gradient&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  valvular and/or periprosthesis insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluate the clinical outcomes at 30 days, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  New York Heart Association functional class&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Medical therapy for heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Number of hospitalization for heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information obtained will be analyzed and used to standardize and make more appropriate&#xD;
      indications for percutaneous aortic valve replacement to improve and standardize the&#xD;
      protocols of procedure, to assess the immediate and long-term effectiveness of the technique,&#xD;
      to monitor acute and late complications related and especially to verify the performance of&#xD;
      tissue valves in the medium to long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hemodynamics centers wishing to join the register will send a completed form to the&#xD;
      steering committee. Once registered they will receive an identification code and pass word&#xD;
      for recording data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registration of patients that underwent percutaneous aortic valve replacement with prosthetic&#xD;
      heart valves with the CE mark, consecutively enrolled during period of 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of paper and electronic case report forms, divided into 4 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Personal details, medical history, clinical assessment / Instrumental II. procedure III.&#xD;
      Post-procedure hospital stay (24 hours, 48 hours, discharge) IV. Follow up to 30 days, 6&#xD;
      months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be compiled and analyzed on a quarterly basis and discussed with the&#xD;
      participating centers with semi-annual meetings&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-points will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Feasibility of the procedure (functioning of the device, procedural success)&#xD;
&#xD;
