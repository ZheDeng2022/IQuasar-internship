  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate long-term clinical performance of a glass&#xD;
      hybrid restorative system (glass-ionomer) vs. composite resin material over a period of five&#xD;
      years. The secondary objective is to evaluate the suitability of intraoral impressions for&#xD;
      the assessment of wear of teeth and restorative materials over five years. For that purpose&#xD;
      the replica method and scanning 3-D laser equipment and matching software will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first null hypothesis is that there would be no difference in clinical performance&#xD;
      between restorative materials after five years. The second null hypothesis is that wear&#xD;
      between the restorative materials will be the same after five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentre, controlled clinical study conducted in Croatia, Italy, Turkey and&#xD;
      Serbia. Eligible participants are all adults aged 18 or over with indication of restorative&#xD;
      treatment on vital teeth in posterior molar region, limited to two surface in a healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Exclusion criteria are presence of full dentures or crowns and bridges in occlusal&#xD;
      contact with teeth indicated for restorative treatment, severe bruxing and unstable&#xD;
      physiological or medical health, pregnancy and lactation, radiation therapy or using drugs.&#xD;
      Each patient is receiving two restorative treatment (GIC-EQUIA Forte and composite resin&#xD;
      material Tetric EvoCeram) each of which will be localized on molar teeth on either side of&#xD;
      the mouth. Two independent examiners will evaluate the restorations at each site one week&#xD;
      after placement and at one, two, three, four and five years according to the FDI criteria.&#xD;
      After, three and five years recall, impressions of both restorations is taken and the casts&#xD;
      is analysed by a 3D laser scanner.&#xD;

      Tooth vitality will be confirmed with cold test (ethyl chloride) and registrated. Bleeding of&#xD;
      the gingiva will be recorded using a periodontal probe. Local anesthesia will be applied to&#xD;
      prevent pain and discomfort during cavity preparation. Tooth surface will be cleaned using a&#xD;
      commercial non fluoride prophy paste (Cleanic, fluoride free, Kerr dental). The cavity&#xD;
      preparations will be performed by removing old fillings or/and opening carious lesions using&#xD;
      rounded and cylindric diamond burs (Komet). Round tungsten carbide burs (Komet) and hand&#xD;
      instruments will be used to excavate carious dentine in both groups. For composite resin&#xD;
      restoration, sound dentin verification will be based on probing and tactile sensation. No&#xD;
      marginal bevel will be prepared and a horizontal platform (avoid apical shift) in approximal&#xD;
      box will be made. Before placement of the materials, impressions will be taken to registrate&#xD;
      cavity depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restorations with EQUIA Forte (GC corp., Tokyo, Japan) will be placed according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer recommendations. The site will be isolated with cotton rolls. A sectional metal&#xD;
      matrix system and wedge will be placed. GC cavity conditioner (20% polyacrylic acid, GC) will&#xD;
      be applied for 10 sec., rinsed and the cavity will be dried with a cotton pellet. EQUIA Forte&#xD;
      (GC) will be prepared according to the manufacturer instructions, applied in bulk and&#xD;
      compacted with a condenser. The self-curing restoration will be finished after hardening,&#xD;
      approximately 2 minutes 30 seconds after the start of the capsule mixing, using Arkansas&#xD;
      stones under water cooling. Occlusion and articulation will be checked by using two sided and&#xD;
      coloured articulating paper (blue for occlusion and red for articulation) 20 microns&#xD;
      thickness. EQUIA Forte restoration will be rinsed and gently dried. EQUIA Forte Coat (GC)&#xD;
      will be applied to the surfaces using a micro-tip applicator. The coated surface will be&#xD;
      light cured with D-light (GC) for 20 seconds. Patients will be instructed not to eat during&#xD;
      one hour after the restoration placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For composite resin restoration, rubber-dam will be applied, and the same matrix system will&#xD;
      be used. Enamel will be etched with 37% orthophosphoric acid (Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan,&#xD;
      Liechtenstein) for 10 sec., avoiding etching dentine as much as possible. The acid gel will&#xD;
      be rinsed with air-water spray and the cavity will be carefully dried with a mild stream of&#xD;
      air until the etched enamel appears white-frosted and dentin dull (avoiding to over-dry of&#xD;
      dentine surface). The adhesive (Adhese 2, Ivoclar Vivadent) will be applied according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instruction and light cured with D-light (GC, 1200 mW/cm2, slow mode) for 10&#xD;
      sec. The composite resin (Tetric EvoCeram, Ivoclar Vivadent) will be placed with an&#xD;
      incremental technique (2 mm layers). Composite will be light-cured with D-light (20 sec) from&#xD;
      the occlusal direction by placing the light tip as close as possible to the restoration.&#xD;
      After removing of matrix, additional light curing will be performed from vestibular and&#xD;
      palatal/lingual direction. Finishing will be performed using diamond burs. Restorations will&#xD;
      be finished with fine diamond burs in high-speed hand-piece for gross finishing (Komet)&#xD;
      followed by fine carbide burs in slow speed hand-piece for fine finishing (Komet). Occlusion&#xD;
      and articulation will be checked by using two sided and coloured articulating paper (blue and&#xD;
      red) 20 microns of thickness. Polishing will be performed using flexible polishing discs&#xD;
      (Komet), rubber points (Compo system, Komet) with a diamond particle paste (1μm) (Gradia&#xD;
      diapolisher). Fine polishing stripes will be used for proximal surface below the contact&#xD;
      point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after the placement of the restorations, baseline evaluation will be performed and&#xD;
      follow-up evaluations will be done on yearly bases up to five years. Two experienced,&#xD;
      blinded, calibrated examiners (e-calib) who will not perform clinical procedures will&#xD;
      evaluate the restorations. Evaluation will be done by using loops (magnification x 2.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impressions obtained before procedure, after cavity preparation, at baseline, three and five&#xD;
      years will be directly scanned using 3D laser scanning device (GC Aadva Lab scan). After&#xD;
      direct impression scanning, a gypsum cast (GC Fujirock EP OptiXscan) will be also made&#xD;
      (baseline, three and five years). These models will be scanned for wear analysis with the GC&#xD;
      Aadva software in order to compare two different evaluation methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and at every recall, four photos will be taken: one photo from the occlusal view,&#xD;
      buccal view, oral view and direct view.&#xD;
