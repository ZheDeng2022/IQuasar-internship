      The purpose of this study is to determine if priming attention prior to practicing a motor&#xD;
      task will have an effect on the ability to acquire and learn that motor task. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the acquisition and learning of a motor task will improve if&#xD;
      attention is primed prior to practicing that motor task when compared to a group who does not&#xD;
      receive the prime.&#xD;

      This proposed study is a randomized trial on the effects of using an attention demanding&#xD;
      prime prior to practicing a previously untrained motor task in a population of young and&#xD;
      healthy individuals. Therefore, The investigators will randomize a group into a motor&#xD;
      learning paradigm. The experimental group will prime with an activity that requires high&#xD;
      attention demands . The control group will perform an activity that is matched for practice&#xD;
      amount but requires less attention demands. Both groups will perform this activity&#xD;
      immediately prior to practicing a previously untrained motor task. The objectives of our aims&#xD;
      will be to compare the experimental group to the control group to determine the effects of&#xD;
      the attention demanding prime on the amount, rate, and transfer of acquisition and learning&#xD;
      of the motor task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day one of the study, participants will be consented. Demographic information,&#xD;
      participant's hand dominance (self-report), and level of arousal will then be documented.&#xD;
      Level of arousal will be assessed by using the Stanford Sleepiness Scale. Each participant&#xD;
      will then perform baseline measures on the previously untrained motor task, a functional task&#xD;
      that simulates feeding, and two other motor task that will not be practiced which will be&#xD;
      used to determine transfer of the practiced task. One task will be a card sorting task, which&#xD;
      shares similar spatio-temporal characteristics to the simulated feeding task. The other&#xD;
      transfer task will be a buttoning task which has dissimilar spatio-temporal characteristics&#xD;
      when compared to the simulated feeding task. Baseline measurements will consists of two&#xD;
      trials for each motor task and trial order will be randomized between all tasks. Each&#xD;
      participant will then be randomized into either the experimental group or the control group&#xD;
      using a block randomization technique. Participants randomized to the experimental group will&#xD;
      perform the attention demanding task, a variant of the Simon Task, and will be told to&#xD;
      emphasize accuracy over speed in order to prime for attention. Participants randomized to the&#xD;
      control group will perform a similar task; however will be told to emphasize speed over&#xD;
      accuracy; thereby creating a sham prime. Following completion of the cognitive tasks, both&#xD;
      groups will immediately begin practicing 50 trials of the simulated feeding task. Following&#xD;
      completion of practice on the simulated feeding task, participants will again perform 2&#xD;
      trials of both the card sorting task and the buttoning task to determine transfer of the&#xD;
      unpracticed task. Participants will then return on day 2 and will perform 2 trials of the&#xD;
      simulated feeding task to assess for short term retention. Participants will again return on&#xD;
      day 8 and will complete two trials of each motor task (simulated feeding task, card sorting&#xD;
      task, and buttoning task) to determine delayed retention and transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Attention Demanding Activity: The attention demanding activity will be a variant of the&#xD;
      Simon Task, a choice reaction time task. In this task, participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      respond as quickly and accurately as possible, pushing one of two buttons corresponding to&#xD;
      the direction of arrows presented visually on a computer screen, ignoring the spatial&#xD;
      location of the arrows. Arrows will be presented in one of two conditions: congruent and&#xD;
      incongruent. Each arrow will be preceded by a fixation cross presented for 250 milliseconds&#xD;
      in the center of the display followed by a blank screen for 100 milliseconds. The arrow will&#xD;
      then be presented until the participant responds or 250 milliseconds or 750 milliseconds&#xD;
      elapse depending on the group. In the congruent conditions, arrows will appear on the same&#xD;
      side of the space as the direction they are facing (e.g. a right facing arrow on the right&#xD;
      side of the space). In the incongruent condition, arrows will be presented on the opposite&#xD;
      side of the space as the direction they are facing (e.g. a right facing arrow on the left&#xD;
      side of the space). There will be a high proportion of congruent trials (75%; 480 trials) to&#xD;
      incongruent trials (25%; 160 trials). In addition to verbal instructions, response deadlines&#xD;
      will be in place. In order to ensure that the experimental group focuses on accuracy over&#xD;
      speed, the deadlines throughout their activity will be 750 milliseconds. The control group&#xD;
      will only have 250 milliseconds to respond to the on-screen stimulus which will ensure a&#xD;
      focus on speed over accuracy. If a deadline is not met on a given trial, a message will&#xD;
      appear to the participant as &quot;Deadline Missed. Faster!&quot; Every 15 trials, this was evaluated,&#xD;
      and if more than 33% of deadlines are missed, a message will appear indicating that the&#xD;
      participants are missing too many deadlines and that it is imperative that the deadlines be&#xD;
      met, even if errors result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The previously untrained motor task: The investigators have chosen to use a functional upper&#xD;
      extremity motor task that simulates feeding. This task requires participants to spoon beans&#xD;
      (kidney, raw) from a central, proximal &quot;start&quot; cup to 3 distal &quot;target&quot; cups as fast as&#xD;
      possible. The cups (9.5 centimeters in diameter) will be secured to a board with 3 cups&#xD;
      secured radially at 45 degrees, 90 degrees, and 135 degrees around the start cup at a&#xD;
      distance of 16 centimeters. The start cup will be oriented along the participant's midline&#xD;
      and 15 centimeters in front of the seated participant. One repetition of the motor task will&#xD;
      consist of spooning 2 beans at once from the start cup to a target cup with the non-dominant&#xD;
      hand, with one trial equaling 15 repetitions. During each trial, participants will move first&#xD;
      to the ipsilateral target cup, next to the center target cup, and then to the contralateral&#xD;
      cup, relative to the hand used (right vs. left). This sequence will be repeated five times to&#xD;
      complete the trial. The participant will begin each trial with their non-dominant hand to the&#xD;
      side of the spoon. Each trial will begin as the administrator gives a verbal cue &quot;go&quot; and&#xD;
      will end when the spoon is returned to the starting position (5 centimeters lateral to the&#xD;
      start cup). The time it takes to complete the 15 repetitions (&quot;trial time&quot;) will be the&#xD;
      measure of performance, with faster times indicating better performance. All trials will be&#xD;
      timed to the nearest 100th of a second via stopwatch. Participants will be given no explicit&#xD;
      feedback (i.e. knowledge of performance or results) after each trial. They will also not be&#xD;
      encouraged or coached to use a specific pattern of upper extremity kinematics during&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfer task that has similar spatio-temporal characteristics: This task will be a card&#xD;
      sorting task. This task requires participants to place a standard playing card from a&#xD;
      central, proximal &quot;start&quot; box to three distal target boxes as fast as possible. The boxes (9&#xD;
      centimeters X 9 centimeters) will be secured to a board with 3 boxes secured radially at 45&#xD;
      degrees, 90 degrees, and 135 degrees around the start box at a distance of 16 centimeters.&#xD;
      The start box will be oriented along the participant's midline and 15 centimeters in front of&#xD;
      the seated participant with the cards face down. One repetition of the motor task will&#xD;
      consist of placing one card at a time; face up, from the start box to a target box with the&#xD;
      non-dominant hand with one trial equaling 15 repetitions. During each trial, participants&#xD;
      will move first to the ipsilateral target box, next to the center target box, and then to the&#xD;
      contralateral box, relative to the hand used (right vs. left). This sequence will be repeated&#xD;
      ten times to complete the trial. The participant will begin each trial with their&#xD;
      non-dominant hand to the side of the start box. Each trial will begin as the administrator&#xD;
      gives a verbal cue &quot;go&quot; and will end when the participant places their hand back at the&#xD;
      starting location after the last card is at rest in the target box. The time it takes to&#xD;
      complete the 30 repetitions (&quot;trial time&quot;) will be the measure of performance, with faster&#xD;
      times indicating better performance. All trials will be timed to the nearest 100th of a&#xD;
      second via stopwatch. Participants will be given no explicit feedback (i.e. knowledge of&#xD;
      performance or results) after each trial. They will also not be encouraged or coached to use&#xD;
      a specific pattern of upper extremity kinematics during training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfer task that has dissimilar spatio-temporal characteristics: This task will require&#xD;
      fastening buttons sequentially. At the start of each trial, participants will begin buttoning&#xD;
      the top of ten buttons (3 centimeters apart) that will be sewed 2 centimeters apart&#xD;
      vertically on a piece of plain weave cotton fabric. Both pieces of the fabric will be secured&#xD;
      to a wooden board with the placket centered in line with the subject's non-dominant shoulder.&#xD;
      The button side of the fabric will be folded onto the board, while the buttonhole side of the&#xD;
      fabric will be unfolded onto the table prior to each trial. Buttons will be fastened through&#xD;
      horizontal buttonholes in a left over right order, relative to the participant. Participants&#xD;
      will fasten all ten buttons sequentially and then will unfasten each button in the reverse&#xD;
      order using their non-dominant hand. The time it takes to fasten and unfasten all 10 buttons&#xD;
      will be the trial time or measure of performance, with faster times indicating better&#xD;
      performance. All trials will be timed to the nearest 100th of a second via stopwatch.&#xD;
      Participants will be given no explicit feedback (i.e. knowledge of performance or results)&#xD;
      after each trial. They will also not be encouraged or coached to use a specific pattern of&#xD;
      upper extremity kinematics during training. This task will be performed with the subject's&#xD;
      non-dominate upper extremity.&#xD;
