    <textblock>
      Patients with atopic dermatitis and eczema often struggle with habitual scratching that is&#xD;
      not well-controlled even with optimal medical therapy. Our goal is to create a behavioral&#xD;
      intervention to help children with eczema reduce scratching. The investigators hope that the&#xD;
      intervention will improve clinical outcomes and quality of life, as well as provide an easily&#xD;
      implemented way for clinicians to educate patients and parents about behavioral modification&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;

      Background Psychological interventions for atopic dermatitis (AD) in children are not&#xD;
      well-studied, despite the potential benefits, which may include: decreased need for&#xD;
      medications and improved long-term control of both dermatologic symptoms as well as other&#xD;
      secondary symptoms that may impact quality of life, such as anxiety, insomnia, and&#xD;
      psychosocial distress. Chida and colleagues (2007) conducted a meta-analysis of psychological&#xD;
      interventions for AD. Of the eight studies that were included in the meta-analysis, only four&#xD;
      studies examined pediatric patients. A wide-range of psychological interventions were&#xD;
      evaluated, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, stress management programs, aromatherapy&#xD;
      massage, psychodynamic therapy, and structured educational programs focusing on a wide range&#xD;
      of medical and psychological topics (e.g., nutrition, relaxation). Seven of the eight studies&#xD;
      showed some positive effects on measures of eczema severity, scratching/itching, use of&#xD;
      topical steroids, and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, Ersser and colleagues (2014) evaluated the literature on psychological and&#xD;
      educational interventions for AD focusing on studies conducted among children. Ten randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials were reviewed, including 9 educational interventions and one study that&#xD;
      evaluated a psychological intervention.Particular promise in terms of modest improvement in&#xD;
      disease severity and quality of life was noted in a large study (N=992) that utilized a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary group education intervention in an inpatient setting. However, the authors&#xD;
      of the review concluded that there is a lack of research on this topic. Accordingly,&#xD;
      additional studies evaluating psychological and educational interventions are needed.&#xD;
      Previous studies have evaluated time- and resource-intensive interventions that may not be&#xD;
      practical outside of a randomized controlled trial or a large academic research setting.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, adjunctive psychological interventions are promising for reducing symptoms&#xD;
      associated with severe dermatologic issues. To address this gap, the current study will&#xD;
      evaluate the utility and acceptability of a brief self-help behavioral intervention in a&#xD;
      pilot study, which emphasizes the effectiveness of the study design. A brief self-help&#xD;
      intervention that utilizes well-supported cognitive and behavioral psychological strategies&#xD;
      will be distributed to interested patients and families to augment the standard skin-directed&#xD;
      treatments for eczema or AD. The self-help intervention will be distributed to and discussed&#xD;
      with a family in less than five minutes in an outpatient clinic setting by clinical staff&#xD;
      with no special training in psychology. The target population is children with AD aged 4-12&#xD;
      years with prominent excoriations and their guardians. At the standard 1-4 month follow-up&#xD;
      visit, feasibility and acceptability of the self-help intervention will be assessed. Brief&#xD;
      evaluations of medical and behavioral symptoms will be conducted at the initial visit and the&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The purpose of the current study is to pilot a brief self-help behavioral&#xD;
      intervention that will be implemented in conjunction with treatment as usual in children with&#xD;
      AD or eczema between the ages of 4 and 12 years. The acceptability and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention will be evaluated. The intervention aims to reduce the severity of AD or eczema&#xD;
      symptoms and improve the quality of life in children. It is hypothesized that the adjunctive&#xD;
      self-help behavioral treatment will reduce the severity of eczema and improve quality of life&#xD;
      for patients who receive the intervention compared to patients who only receive standard&#xD;
      dermatologic treatment. Additionally, itching intensity, scratching behaviors, and anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms will be included as outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims Aim 1: Pilot a brief self-help behavioral intervention to be delivered to&#xD;
      children with eczema or AD and their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate feasibility and acceptability of a brief self-help behavioral intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Evaluate effectiveness of the self-help intervention for reducing symptom severity and&#xD;
      improving quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period This study will occur over a two year period from July 1, 2015 thru June 30,&#xD;
      2017. Interested patients will receive the treatment information at the first appointment and&#xD;
      then a follow up visit will be conducted 1-4 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methodology Study Design This will be a randomized, case-controlled, prospective trial&#xD;
      that compares treatment as usual to treatment as usual with the addition of the brief&#xD;
      self-help intervention. Half of the patients will receive the self-help intervention and the&#xD;
      other half will not receive the self-help intervention. A priori block randomization&#xD;
      procedures will be conducted in attempt to secure an equal distribution of participants in&#xD;
      each condition. The block randomization involves randomizing blocks of 6-8 participant&#xD;
      numbers, where half of the participants in the treatment as usual group and half of the&#xD;
      participants in the treatment group. Then, the order of the blocks are randomized. The&#xD;
      physician (Dr. Jacks) recruiting participants will be blind to the condition until after the&#xD;
      patient has consented to participate. All patients will receive the standard of care for&#xD;
      eczema or atopic dermatitis, which may include dry skin care with emollients, topical&#xD;
      steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and oral antihistamines. All patients will undergo&#xD;
      initial evaluation and then a follow up evaluation at 1-4 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Participants (N = 150) Children between the ages of 4 and 12 and their parents who&#xD;
      are presenting to the UMMC pediatric dermatology clinic will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      study. It is anticipated that 75 parent-child dyads will enroll in the study procedures, for&#xD;
      a total of 75 children and 75 parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Inclusion criteria: (1) children presenting to the pediatric dermatology&#xD;
      clinic; (2) current or new diagnosis of eczema or AD; (3) between the ages of 4 and 12; and&#xD;
      (4) excoriation is reported by the patient or parent or noted by the clinical staff to be a&#xD;
      prominent issues within the past month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Exclusion criteria: (1) inability to complete English-language&#xD;
      questionnaires; (2) patients requiring systemic immunosuppressives such as systemic&#xD;
      prednisone, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or cyclosporine; (3) Patients&#xD;
      with known comorbidities that cause immunodeficiency, such as HIV, treatment with&#xD;
      chemotherapy, or genetic syndromes; (4) Patients who are being treated by a mental health&#xD;
      provider (e.g., counselor, psychologist) or psychiatrist for issues specifically related to&#xD;
      excoriation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure. Recruitment will occur through the UMMC pediatric dermatology clinic. Clinical&#xD;
      staff will identify potential study participants through Epic database searches and chart&#xD;
      reviews of eczema and atopic dermatitis pediatric patients seen in the UMMC Dermatology&#xD;
      Clinic practice. The treating physician (Dr. Jacks) will approach potential participants&#xD;
      either by phone or in person at the clinic to inform them of the study and its procedures and&#xD;
      to see if they are interested in participating. If interested, screening criteria will be&#xD;
      reviewed with the patients and their parents. If the patient is eligible for the study, they&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in the study. Consent, parent permission, and child assent&#xD;
      will be obtained children and their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial visit, after the patient has received standard care or while in the&#xD;
      examination room waiting for standard care, the patients and their parents will complete&#xD;
      several brief self-report questionnaires that will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
      These questionnaires will assess socio-demographic information, symptom intensity, quality of&#xD;
      life, anxiety symptoms, and symptom severity. A priori randomization will determine whether&#xD;
      the participant receives the self-help intervention or not. For participants randomized to&#xD;
      receive the treatment, the self-help intervention will be briefly described by a member of&#xD;
      the clinical staff, and a brief pamphlet will be distributed to the parent or guardian at the&#xD;
      end of the visit. The pamphlet describes behavioral strategies for coping with and reducing&#xD;
      scratching behaviors. Participants randomly selected to not receive the treatment will not&#xD;
      receive the pamphlet at the end of the visit. A routine follow-up appointment will be&#xD;
      scheduled with all patients, which is typically scheduled 1-4 months after the initial visit.&#xD;
      This is a routine follow-up interval for children with active eczema or AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the follow-up visit, verbal consent for the follow up assessment will be obtained from&#xD;
      participants. Patients and their parents who provide verbal consent will complete a second&#xD;
      set of brief self-report questionnaires in the waiting room or while in the examination room.&#xD;
      The questionnaires are expected to take approximately 10 minutes to complete. The&#xD;
      questionnaires will include measures assessing acceptability and feasibility of the self-help&#xD;
      intervention, quality of life, anxiety symptoms, and dermatology symptom severity (i.e.,&#xD;
      SCORAD). For patients who are unable to come in for the follow-up visit, typical clinical&#xD;
      procedures for following up with a missed appointment will be followed. Additional attempts&#xD;
      to contact the participant will be made by the research personnel to contact the parents by&#xD;
      telephone to either to complete the questionnaires over the telephone or to come in for the&#xD;
      brief follow up study visit. If participants chose to attend the study session, but not the&#xD;
      follow up dermatology appointment, then they would not receive the standard care visit, but&#xD;
      would only complete the study procedures and accordingly would not be billed. If the&#xD;
      participant expresses that they are not interested in participating in the follow up study&#xD;
      visit, study personnel will cease attempts at study contact and follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures. Screener. A brief screener will be conducted with the patient and the parent to&#xD;
      verify eligibility in the study per the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Co-variates Socio-demographics Form. The parents/guardians of patients will be&#xD;
      asked questions related to their and their child's demographics, including age, race, marital&#xD;
      status, socioeconomic status, and medical history (including current medications).&#xD;

    <description>The PAS and the SCAS are well-validated, self-report measures that are commonly utilized for the clinical assessment of anxiety symptoms in children. The PAS-Parent Version is validated to assess symptoms among children between 3 and 5 years, and the SCAS is utilized for children between 6 and 18 years. The measures are not diagnostic instruments, but indicate the severity of a range of anxiety symptoms. The PAS is completed by a parent and includes 34 items that assess anxiety symptoms on a 0 (not true at all) to 4 (Very often true) scale. Similarly, the SCAS-Parent Version is a 39-item scale measuring child anxiety on six different domains. The items are rated by the parent on a likert scale from 0 (Never) to 3 (Always). Total and subscale scores are computed by adding the corresponding items.</description>
