  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to test if serum level of myokines are associated with protein energy wasting,&#xD;
      inflammation and atherosclerotic vascular disease among Taiwanese dialysis patients. Some&#xD;
      novel myokines levels, anthropometric parameters, cardiovascular risk factors, and presence&#xD;
      of endothelial dysfunction will be examined in 250 subjects. The distribution of some&#xD;
      recently identified myokines such as irisin, myotatin etc levels will be studied and&#xD;
      correlated markers of malnutrition, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and insulin&#xD;
      resistance. In the present study, the investigators will further follow and investigate&#xD;
      whether serum myokines levels are associated with long-term mortality from all causes and&#xD;
      from cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

      Study Design and Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients who underwent stable hemodialysis at least 3 months at Tung Taichung&#xD;
      Metroharbor Hospital will be enrolled. Baseline clinical data such as age, sex, height,&#xD;
      bodyweight , clinical etiology of Chronic kidney disease(CKD) if possible, comorbidities,&#xD;
      blood pressure, laboratory measures [such as serum creatinine, albumin, C-reactive protein&#xD;
      (CRP), total cholesterol, complete blood counts, urine routines, anthropometric information&#xD;
      and various potential indicators of protein energy wasting [such as body mass index,&#xD;
      waist/hip ratio, mid-arm circumference (MAC), triceps skinfold thickness (TSF), mid-arm&#xD;
      muscle circumference (MAMC), mid-arm muscle area (MAMA), SGA, BIS analyses, dual energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry(DEXA),handgrip (HG)] will be collected. For the laboratory tests, fasting&#xD;
      blood and urine samples are obtained from each patient and performed by means of routine&#xD;
      methods in the investigators hospital. All patients received echocardiograms studies&#xD;
      performed within 3 months after enrollment, which were used to estimate congestive heart&#xD;
      failure(CHF, defined as an ejection fraction of &lt;50%) or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH,&#xD;
      defined as left ventricle mass index &gt;125 g/m2 in men and 100 g/m2 in women).Cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease( CVD) was defined as a previous history of CHF, LVH, ischemic heart disease(including&#xD;
      prior history of angina, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting and&#xD;
      percutaneous cardiac catheter intervention) or cerebrovascular disease (including prior&#xD;
      history of transient ischemic attack and stroke). Information about conventional clinical&#xD;
      risk factors, such as smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, medication and other&#xD;
      necessary data at baseline will be obtained from a standardized interview and examination.&#xD;
      The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is made according to the criteria of the American Diabetes&#xD;
      Association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with malignant disease, acute infectious disease, inflammatory disease (such as&#xD;
      collagen disease), advanced liver disease, and those taking any type of immunosuppressive&#xD;
      medication were also excluded. Patients with clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis,&#xD;
      congestive heart failure, history of stroke, a previous history of coronary intervention or&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and presence peripheral vascular disease were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometrics, and Handgrip Strength&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body weight was measured with light clothing on up to 0.1 kg. Height was measured up to 0.1&#xD;
      cm. Waist circumference was measured at the midpoint between upper iliac and lower costal&#xD;
      level up to 0.1 cm at the end of normal expiration. Hip circumference was measured around the&#xD;
      largest part of the hip. Anthropometric measurements were obtained immediately after the HD&#xD;
      session by a trained researcher. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as body mass divided by&#xD;
      stature squared. The International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism(ISRNM) panel&#xD;
      recommends that a BMI lower than 23 kg/m2 is a marker of Protein Energy Wasting(PEW).&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements include TSF used skinfold calipers; MAC measured by a stretchable&#xD;
      measuring tape, MAMC equals MAC(centimeter) - 3.14 x TSF (millimeter)/10 and MAMA equals&#xD;
      (MAMC2/4π). Muscle mass area (MMA) was calculated using the following equation: MMA = ([MAC&#xD;
      {cm} - π x triceps skinfold {cm}]2/4π) -n, where n = 10 for men and 6.5 for women . Muscle&#xD;
      strength as hand grip strength (HGS) test was measured by Hand Dynamometer. HGS was measured&#xD;
      3 times for both left and right hands with patients in a standing position using a&#xD;
      dynamometer in units of kilograms. Patients held the dynamometer at thigh level and were&#xD;
      encouraged to squeeze the instrument as hard as possible for 3 s. The maximum grip strength&#xD;
      among all measurements was used for this study. Three sets of measurements at each site were&#xD;
      averaged and used in the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malnutrition Inflammation Score&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome(MICS), also known as the Kalantar&#xD;
      score, developed, and validated by Kalantar- Zadeh et al. was measured at baseline. The&#xD;
      Malnutrition-Inflammation Score(MIS) has ten components [change in end dialysis dry weight,&#xD;
      dietary intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, functional capacity, comorbidities, decreased fat&#xD;
      stores or loss of subcutaneous fat (according to SGA), signs of muscle wasting (according to&#xD;
      SGA), BMI, serum albumin, and total iron binding capacity], each with four levels of&#xD;
      severity, from 0 (normal) to 3 (severely abnormal). The sum of the MIS components ranges from&#xD;
      0 (normal) to 30 (severely malnourished), in which a higher score reflects greater&#xD;
      malnutrition and inflammation severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comorbidity component was scored as 0 if no comorbidities were present; 1 if there were&#xD;
      mild comorbidities present and major comorbid conditions (MCCs) were absent (such as New York&#xD;
      Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure, severe coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, moderate- to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease, and metastatic malignancies); 2 if moderate comorbidities were present, including&#xD;
      one MCC; and 3 if multiple severe comorbidities were present, including two or more MCCs.&#xD;
      Subjective global assessments (SGAs) were performed by an experienced physician according to&#xD;
      conventional SGA guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole-body scans are performed according to manufacturer's instructions, and body fat, lean&#xD;
      tissue mass (LTM) and bone mineral content (BMC) are analysed using the manufacturer's&#xD;
      software. DEXA estimate of fat-free mass (FFM) was calculated as a sum of LTM and BMC&#xD;
      estimates. All patients were examined by the same observer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioelectric impedance spectroscopy (BIS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIS measurement was performed in each of the participants enrolled in the study by a specific&#xD;
      member of staff who had completed a training course in the BIS technique, using a portable&#xD;
      whole body bioimpedance spectroscopy device, the body composition monitor. The body&#xD;
      composition monitor(BCM) measures the impedance spectroscopy at 50 different frequencies&#xD;
      between 5 kilohertz(kHz) and 1 megahertz (MHz). Measurements were taken on the midweek&#xD;
      dialysis session before the start of the hemodialysis treatment with the patient calm,&#xD;
      supine, and relaxed in the dialysis bed for 10 minutes. Specific exclusion criteria were&#xD;
      dictated by the device and included history of a pacemaker, defibrillator, metallic sutures,&#xD;
      or stent implantation and amputation of a major limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were taken in a nonfasting state before a midweek hemodialysis session.&#xD;
      Complete blood count, creatinine, urea, albumin, transferrin, total carbon dioxide, hsCRP ,&#xD;
      triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C),&#xD;
      low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and fasting blood glucose are measured by&#xD;
      routine laboratory methods. Another blood samples will be stored at -80 degree centigrade for&#xD;
      subsequent assay of items such as insulin, interleukin-6, pentraxin, nitrotyrosine for&#xD;
      markers of endothelial dysfunction such as Asymmetric dimethylarginine( ADMA), adropin and&#xD;
      insulin resistance (adiponectin, resistin and leptin). Homeostatic Model Assessment Insulin&#xD;
      Resistance(HOMA-IR) was calculated as fasting insulin (U/l) × fasting glucose (mg/dl)/405, as&#xD;
      described by Matthews et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum total p-cresol and indoxyl sulfate (i.e. combined free and protein-bound fractions)&#xD;
      were analyzed with High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Briefly, serum samples were&#xD;
      deproteinized for the determination of indoxyl sulfate by the addition of three parts&#xD;
      methanol to one part serum. Total p-cresol (i.e. the combined free and protein-bound&#xD;
      fraction) was analysed after deproteinization (acid and heat) and extraction (ethyl acetate)&#xD;
      of serum samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of serum myostatin, irisin and myonectin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum myostatin levels are measured with a competitive immunoassay kits according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's protocol. Serum irisin concentration was measured using the enzymelinked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay). The assay was proven to be highly sensitive to human irisin. Serum&#xD;
      myonectin (Circulating Complement-C1q Tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-Related Protein 15) Serum&#xD;
      myonectin was determined with a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit.&#xD;
