  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is one of the most common and distressing symptoms in teenage and young adult cancer&#xD;
      patients. Despite this, there has been virtually no research evaluating treatment for&#xD;
      cancer-related fatigue in this young patient group. The investigators are undertaking a small&#xD;
      qualitative study to co-design a fatigue intervention, that will then be evaluated in future&#xD;
      research to assess its effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This small qualitative study will involve 7-10 patients who are within one year of completing&#xD;
      cancer treatment, as well as some parents. Participants will be recruited from one centre,&#xD;
      the Cambridge Teenage and Young Adult cancer Principal Treatment Centre. The three phases&#xD;
      will involve a) participants being interviewed individually and attending a focus group, b)&#xD;
      patients receiving the prototype co-designed intervention, and c) participants being&#xD;
      interviewed after the intervention to provide feedback to allow further refinement of the&#xD;
      intervention. The intervention will be delivered by an Allied Health Professional in the&#xD;
      setting that participants have chosen. It is likely to involve, at a minimum, education about&#xD;
      fatigue and support with increasing activity. It will not include administration of any&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
