  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a social network-based PrEP adherence intervention as part of a&#xD;
      comprehensive, context-specific approach to HIV prevention for TW in Lima, Peru. In order to&#xD;
      be effective, PrEP-based prevention strategies need to address not only biological efficacy,&#xD;
      but also individual behavioral decision-making processes, interpersonal partnership contexts&#xD;
      of risk, peer norms of sexual behavior and PrEP adherence, and structural access to&#xD;
      prevention technologies. Using a health promotion behavioral model that combines Social&#xD;
      Action Theory with social network theories of information dissemination and collective&#xD;
      behavior change, the investigators propose to develop and refine a network-based intervention&#xD;
      that promotes PrEP adherence in the existing social networks of TW. Formative research will&#xD;
      outline individual, partner-level, and network-based contexts of sexual risk behavior,&#xD;
      patterns of social network interactions, anticipated adoption and use of new prevention&#xD;
      technologies, and optimal content for a PrEP adherence intervention. Findings will be used to&#xD;
      define the elements of a prevention intervention using social networks of TW and social media&#xD;
      technologies to generate, implement, and reinforce social norms of PrEP adherence and risk&#xD;
      behavior reduction for TW.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) has biological efficacy in reducing risk for HIV acquisition&#xD;
      but its clinical effectiveness is strongly influenced by patient adherence, which is in turn&#xD;
      influenced by social and behavioral factors. Trials conducted among serodiscordant&#xD;
      heterosexual African couples who were engaged in supportive romantic partnerships found PrEP&#xD;
      to be highly effective for HIV prevention. In contrast, studies with socially marginalized&#xD;
      populations in Latin America without strong interpersonal support networks, such as&#xD;
      transgender women (TW), found substantially lower levels of adherence and, as a result,&#xD;
      effectiveness. We believe that new, social network-based strategies to promote PrEP&#xD;
      adherence, coupled with behavioral interventions to minimize risk compensation, will be&#xD;
      critical to controlling the spread of HIV among TW in Latin America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TW in Peru are at high risk for HIV infection (30-33% HIV prevalence) and in urgent need of&#xD;
      new approaches to prevention that adequately address HIV risk as part of their life contexts.&#xD;
      Due to their social and economic marginalization and lack of support from traditional&#xD;
      neighborhood and family networks, TW frequently neglect traditional approaches to HIV/STI&#xD;
      prevention that have been developed for men who have sex with men (MSM), and report high&#xD;
      rates of compensated sex, unprotected intercourse, and sexually transmitted infection (STI)&#xD;
      co-infections. Despite their socially marginalized status, communities of TW in Lima are&#xD;
      frequently connected through dense social and geographic networks that provide support&#xD;
      outside of traditional community systems, disseminate new information and ideas, and define&#xD;
      and maintain standards of behavior. While these social networks provide a critical framework&#xD;
      for the dissemination and maintenance of TW community norms, they have not previously been&#xD;
      used as a framework for HIV prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a social network-based PrEP adherence intervention as part of a comprehensive,&#xD;
      context-specific approach to HIV prevention for TW in Lima, Peru. In order to be effective,&#xD;
      PrEP-based prevention strategies need to address not only biological efficacy, but also&#xD;
      individual behavioral decision-making processes, interpersonal partnership contexts of risk,&#xD;
      peer norms of sexual behavior and PrEP adherence, and structural access to prevention&#xD;
      technologies. Using a health promotion behavioral model that combines Social Action Theory&#xD;
      with social network theories of information dissemination and collective behavior change, we&#xD;
      propose to develop and refine a network-based intervention that promotes PrEP adherence in&#xD;
      the existing social networks of TW. Formative research will outline individual,&#xD;
      partner-level, and network-based contexts of sexual risk behavior, patterns of social network&#xD;
      interactions, anticipated adoption and use of new prevention technologies, and optimal&#xD;
      content for a PrEP adherence intervention. Findings will be used to define the elements of a&#xD;
      prevention intervention using social networks of TW and social media technologies to&#xD;
      generate, implement, and reinforce social norms of PrEP adherence and risk behavior reduction&#xD;
      for TW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To conduct an open evaluation of a social network-based PrEP adherence intervention&#xD;
      for TW in Peru. The intervention will be piloted with a group of 10-15 TW recruited from a&#xD;
      social network within a single geographic area. Using a dynamic process of implementation,&#xD;
      refinement, and re-implementation over a 6-month period, we will assess acceptability and&#xD;
      feasibility of specific intervention and evaluation components. Data will be used to finalize&#xD;
      the study design, intervention manual, and quantitative assessment tools for the pilot&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To conduct a pilot RCT of a social network-based PrEP adherence intervention for TW in&#xD;
      Peru. The investigators plan to enroll 6 social network clusters of TW (3 clusters per arm,&#xD;
      recruited from 2 seeds matched from 3 geographical areas in Lima, Peru) (total N=90 TW&#xD;
      enrolled [15 TW per cluster] to achieve at least N=60 TW completers [10 TW per cluster]) that&#xD;
      will be randomized to participate in either the network-based PrEP adherence intervention or&#xD;
      a control intervention. The primary outcome will be adherence to PrEP (measured via&#xD;
      laboratory analysis of presence of detectable drug in serum, laboratory analysis of presence&#xD;
      of detectable drug in hair, and participant self-report). The major secondary outcome will be&#xD;
      behavioral risk compensation, specifically the degree to which participants in the two arms&#xD;
      do or do not modify HIV risk behaviors while taking PrEP. Behavioral and biological&#xD;
      assessments will be conducted at Baseline, 3-month, and 6-month intervals.&#xD;
