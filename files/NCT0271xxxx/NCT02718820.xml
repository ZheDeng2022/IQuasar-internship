  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, which accounts for 90% of head and neck&#xD;
      cancers, is the tenth most common cancer worldwide with over 650000 new cases per year. The&#xD;
      major risk factors for HNSCC development comprise alcohol and tobacco consumption. During the&#xD;
      last decades human papilloma virus infection (HPV) has been identified to contribute to the&#xD;
      development of oropharyngeal HNSCC in a subgroup of patients5. Standard treatment options&#xD;
      include surgery, (chemo)radiation and chemotherapy. Despite improvements of treatment&#xD;
      regimens the recurrence rate of stage III/IV disease after curative therapy is about 30-40%.&#xD;
      In locoregionally unresectable recurrent or metastatic disease palliative poly-chemotherapy&#xD;
      is the mainstay of therapy.The median survival time of these patients is 6-8 months. Based on&#xD;
      the results of the EXTREME study a combination regimen containing a platinum drug, 5&#xD;
      fluorouracil (5-FU) and weekly cetuximab has become standard of care in this setting. For&#xD;
      patients, who progressed after platinum based therapy, treatment options are scarce. Besides&#xD;
      platinum drugs, taxanes such as paclitaxel or docetaxel were shown to be of particular use in&#xD;
      this setting. Apart from that there has been increasing preclinical and clinical evidence&#xD;
      that immune-checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab might play a role in HNSCC. Thus, it&#xD;
      is the aim of this study to test if the combination of docetaxel and pembrolizumab after&#xD;
      platinum failure is an effective and safe regimen.&#xD;
