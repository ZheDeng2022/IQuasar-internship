      The main purpose of this study is to explore the therapeutic effect of CD20-targeted chimeric&#xD;
      antigen receptor T(CAR-T) cells in the treatment of B cell malignancies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The anti-CD20 antibody has been broadly used in the treatment of B cell malignancies and&#xD;
      exhibited good clinical outcomes. The CD19-targeted CAR-T has shown exellent therapeutic&#xD;
      efficiency in B cell malignancies,especially in acute lymphocytic leukemia. However, patients&#xD;
      treated with CD19-targeted CAR-T may face relapse of CD19 mutation. Other targets aimed CAR-T&#xD;
      is in need. Therefore we constructed CD20-targeted CAR-T cells and hope to start a&#xD;
      clinicaltrial to explore the therapeutic effect of CD20-targeted CAR-T cells in the treatment&#xD;
      of B cell malignancies.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. CD20-expressing B cell malignancy must be assured and must be relapsed or refractory&#xD;
             disease after at least one standard chemotherapy and one salvage regimen. According to&#xD;
             current traditional therapies, there must be no available alternative curative&#xD;
             therapies and subjects must be either ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant&#xD;
             (SCT), have refused SCT, or have disease activity that prohibits SCT at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients enrolled must have an evaluated score above 60 with KPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. CD20 expression of the malignant cells must be detected by immunohistochemistry or by&#xD;
             flow cytometry. In general immunohistochemistry will be used for lymph node biopsies,&#xD;
             flow cytometry will be used for peripheral blood and bone marrow samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Gender is not limited, age from 14 years to 75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease at the time of enrollment, which&#xD;
             may include any evidence of disease including minimal residual disease detected by&#xD;
             flow cytometry, cytogenetics, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients are expected to survive for more than 3 months by their physicians at the&#xD;
             time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate absolute CD3 count estimated need to be assured for obtaining target cell&#xD;
             dose based on dosage cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with the following CNS status are eligible only in the absence of neurologic&#xD;

&#xD;
             CNS 1, defined as absence of blasts in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) on cytospin&#xD;
             preparation, regardless of the number of WBCs; CNS 2, defined as presence of &lt; 5/uL&#xD;
             WBCs in CSF and cytospin positive for blasts, or &gt; 5/uL WBCs but negative by&#xD;
             Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm CNS3 with marrow disease who has failed salvage systemic&#xD;
