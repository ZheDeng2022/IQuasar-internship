  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to test the effectiveness of nab-paclitaxel + carboplatin +&#xD;
      MPDL3280A for treatment of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), which is a type of lung&#xD;
      cancer. The study aims to determine if chemotherapy combined with immune-based therapy can&#xD;
      lead to improvement in tumor response rates over historical response rates with chemotherapy&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most common cancer in both men and women worldwide, accounting for 13% of&#xD;
      incident cancers. In 2015, it was estimated there would be 221,200 new lung cancers diagnosed&#xD;
      in the United States, with 158,040 lung cancer deaths. Approximately 85% of all lung cancers&#xD;
      are characterized as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated studies have shown neoadjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy to be safe prior to surgical&#xD;
      resection of NSCLC with no difference in extent of surgical procedures performed, operative&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. The debate remains as to whether neoadjuvant or adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy is the best approach, with advantages and disadvantages to each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that new therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors that&#xD;
      demonstrate promising clinical activity in the advanced disease setting must be incorporated&#xD;
      into the neoadjuvant setting, in order to maximize benefit early in a patient's treatment&#xD;
      course, and with a suitable surrogate endpoint that can be used to establish a preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy signal, prior to initiation of a large confirmatory study.&#xD;

    <description>MPDL3280A is a human, Fc optimized, monoclonal antibody directed against the protein ligand programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Atezolizumab binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1) expressed on activated T-cells, which may enhance the T-cell-mediated immune response to neoplasms and reverse T-cell inactivation. MPDL3280A 1200 mg will be administered as a 60 minute IV infusion on first administration, then over 30 minutes subsequently if tolerated.</description>

    <intervention_name>Carboplatin</intervention_name>
    <description>Carboplatin is a second-generation platinum compound with a broad spectrum of antineoplastic properties. Carboplatin contains a platinum atom complexed with two ammonia groups and a cyclobutane-dicarboxyl residue. This agent is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups, thereby inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links. These carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition. Carboplatin area under the curve (AUC)=6 will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion immediately after nab-paclitaxel.</description>

    <description>Nab-paclitaxel is an albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation of the natural taxane paclitaxel with antineoplastic activity. Nab-paclitaxel binds to and stabilizes microtubules, preventing their depolymerization and so inhibiting cellular motility, mitosis, and replication. Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion.</description>
