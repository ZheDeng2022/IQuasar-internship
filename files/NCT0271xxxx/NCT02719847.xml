    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the results of EBUS-TBNA with the&#xD;
      results of PET/CT scans to learn about the accuracy of these ways to find evidence of early&#xD;
      stage lung cancer.&#xD;

      EBUS-TBNA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant agrees to take part in this study, as a part of participant's&#xD;
      standard-of-care, participant will have an EBUS-TBNA before SBRT. Participant will have this&#xD;
      performed as an out-patient procedure while under general anesthetic. Participant will&#xD;
      receive a separate consent for this that will explain the procedure and the risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples collected from the EBUS-TBNA will be tested and compared with the results of&#xD;
      participant's standard PET/CT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a part of participant's standard-of-care, after SBRT participant will have a physical exam&#xD;
      and chest CT scan to check the status of the disease every 3 months for the first 2 years,&#xD;
      and then twice a year for the following year. After 3 years, participant will have these&#xD;
      visits 1 time a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's medical information from these follow-up visits will be collected for this&#xD;
      study. All the information for the study will be stored in a password-protected system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's active participation in this study will be over after participant's tissue&#xD;
      samples are collected by EBUS-TBNA. Participant's medical information will continue to be&#xD;
      collected as long as participant is coming for follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The EBUS-TBNA is performed using FDA-approved and&#xD;
      commercially available methods. It is investigational to compare the results of EBUS-TBNA and&#xD;
      PET/CT scans to learn about the accuracy of these ways to find evidence of early stage lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 150 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;
