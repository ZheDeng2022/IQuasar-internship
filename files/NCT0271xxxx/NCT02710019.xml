      The purpose of this pilot study is to explore whether the Back to Reality series of video&#xD;
      games - Harry's Journey, Harry's Journal, and Pathways to care map - increase knowledge of&#xD;
      the emotional, social, and psychiatric sequelae of problematic underage marijuana use among&#xD;
      homeless and street involved youth. Additional objectives were to explore whether the video&#xD;
      games promote awareness of the risk of psychosis associated with regular marijuana use among&#xD;
      vulnerable youth.&#xD;

      This project pilots the use of educational video games designed to help youth gain awareness&#xD;
      of the risk of mental health issues associated with regular marijuana use. By playing the&#xD;
      Back to Reality video games, youths may absorb knowledge about where and how to access&#xD;
      community care for symptoms associated with psychosis and problematic cannabis use. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to pilot test the use of the Back to Reality series at increasing&#xD;
      awareness of the social and emotional implications of underage substance use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study explores the effects of the Back to Reality video games compared to control video&#xD;
      games (no content about mental health and addiction). Street involved and homeless youth&#xD;
      registered with Good Shepherd services between the ages of 16 and 19 years of age will be&#xD;
      recruited. The results will be assessed using quantitative questionnaires and qualitative&#xD;
      interviews. The data will be statistically analyzed for significant differences in knowledge&#xD;
      about the risk of psychosis linked to marijuana use among vulnerable youth. The qualitative&#xD;
      interview assesses the participants understanding and views of potential emotional, social,&#xD;
      and psychiatric sequelae associated with excessive marijuana use during.&#xD;
