  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylosis, also called tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis, is a prevalent,&#xD;
      painful syndrome of the elbow. It is refractory to conservative treatment measures, including&#xD;
      rest, excentric and concentric exercises in approximately 20% of patients after 6 months.&#xD;
      Corticosteroid injections can provide relief in the short term. Mini-open surgery may be&#xD;
      proposed when the conservative treatment fails and studies have shown an efficacy of 70%.&#xD;
      Ultrasound-guided tendon fenestration is a minimally-invasive technique which stimulates the&#xD;
      physiological healing mechanisms of the tendon and appears promising for the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic tendinopathies. To our knowledge, no studies have compared the US-guided fenestration&#xD;
      technique to mini-open surgery for the treatment of chronic lateral epicondylosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to compare the efficacy of US-guided&#xD;
      fenestration to mini-open surgery to reduce pain and improve functional status in workers&#xD;
      suffering from chronic lateral epicondylosis refractory to 6-month conservative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective single-blind randomized pilot study. Sixty-four subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized into two intervention groups for treatment either by US-guided fenestration or&#xD;
      mini-open surgery. The primary outcome of the study will be the Patient Rated Tennis Elbow&#xD;
      Evaluation (PRTEE) score at 6 month post-procedure.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II, prospective, two-arm, single-blind randomized controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 64 patients (56 + 15% loss to follow-up) suffering from chronic lateral epicondylosis&#xD;
      will be recruited by one of two orthopedists working in a specialized outpatient clinic, at&#xD;
      the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM), a tertiary care academic center.&#xD;
      Ultrasound examination of the elbow will be performed before the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a computerized randomization list, the subjects will be randomized into the 2 treatment&#xD;
      arms to be treated either by an US-guided tendon fenestration technique or by mini-open&#xD;
      surgery. Randomization will be stratified by block sizes of 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW UP Subjects' follow-up will extend over a period of 12 months - i.e., at 6 weeks and&#xD;
      3, 6 and 12 months post-intervention. The primary outcome will be the PRTEE score. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will evaluate the impact of each procedure on: Pain-free grip (dynamometer),&#xD;
      Medication Quantitative Scale, working activity (QuickDASH general and work modules; RA-WIS),&#xD;
      Patient Global Impression of Change and Patient Satisfaction. The ultrasound examination will&#xD;
      be repeated at 6 and 12 months. The predictive value of various B-mode parameters, color&#xD;
      Doppler and elastography will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects in each intervention arm presenting a&#xD;
      reduction of at least 11/100 of the PRTEE score at 6 months post-intervention. The Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test will be used to compare the proportion of subjects in each treatment group. The&#xD;
      primary analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle. Regarding the secondary&#xD;
      endpoints, an ANOVA for repeated measures with two factors (time and group), a Fisher's exact&#xD;
      test or a recursive partitioning analysis will be performed as appropriate.&#xD;
