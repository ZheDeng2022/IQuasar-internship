    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate local tolerability of the new&#xD;
      Econazole/Benzydamine product, in comparison with the Econazole and Benzydamine stand-alone&#xD;
      products and placebo. Pharmacokinetics of the study products after single and repeated&#xD;
      applications once a day for 15 days, safety of the investigational products and comfort of&#xD;
      use will also be evaluated as secondary objectives.&#xD;
