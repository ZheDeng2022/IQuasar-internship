      This prospective study, Randomized Trial of Indwelling Double-J Ureteral Stent Versus&#xD;
      Externalized Modified-Salle Stent for Pyeloplasty will consist of four steps: 1.) Enrolling&#xD;
      subjects in the study and signing the consent form 2.) Randomly divide subjects into 2&#xD;
      groups, group 1 will have internal stent and group 2 will have external stent 3.) At the time&#xD;
      of stent removal in the clinic or in the OR subjects parents/ subjects will fill a&#xD;
      questionnaire about pain after the procedure, stent care and stent tolerance and 4) Data from&#xD;
      the questionnaires and procedure cost will be collected and all the data will be analyzed&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The pyeloplasty is a surgical procedure to treat kidney obstruction due to congenital or&#xD;
      acquired causes. Congenital like congenital stenosis in the Uretero-pelvic junction (UPJ) or&#xD;
      due to crossing blood vessels. Acquired causes like UPJ obstruction post stone disease or&#xD;
      renal trauma. For the congenital or the acquired causes the principle of the surgery is to&#xD;
      remove the UPJ stenosis (the diseased segment of the ureter) and reconnect the ureter to the&#xD;
      renal pelvis again. This procedure is known as dismembered pyeloplasty. It was described in&#xD;
      1940 by Anderson and since then still the gold standard procedure regardless of the approach&#xD;
      (open, laparoscopic or robotic). One of the principles of the procedure is to 'Splint' the&#xD;
      anastomosis, i.e put something across the anastomosis during the healing process that&#xD;
      includes internal and external stents. Also there are surgeons even don't believe in keeping&#xD;
      anything across the anastomosis, but they leave a nephrostomy tube only that will not cross&#xD;
      the anastomosis. In our division at CHP, we believe that we should keep a stent across the&#xD;
      anastomosis to help in the healing process and decrease that chance of intra-abdominal urine&#xD;
      leak and to increase the chance of success (90-99%). So for the internal stent, we use to&#xD;
      approaches to insert it: 1- Retrograde by cystoscopy and this will take 10 minutes before&#xD;
      starting the surgical procedure itself and we put the stent under fluoroscopy guidance and&#xD;
      this is the commonest way we use now to put the internal stents. 2- ante grade, and this is&#xD;
      basically inserting the stent during the surgical procedure itself from the kidney down to&#xD;
      the ureter and this is done without fluoroscopy. For the external stent we use one method, we&#xD;
      choose were we will leave the stent and then we create a small hole in the kidney and then&#xD;
      pull the stent through the hole and then create small hole in the abdominal fascia and then&#xD;
      the skin, all this done under direct vision and control. So now the sent is outside the&#xD;
      patient and connected directly to the kidney and the renal pelvis, then the distal part of&#xD;
      the stent will be inserted across the anastomosis and before closing the renal pelvis (also&#xD;
      under vision) toward the ureter. The external stent will be connected at the end of the&#xD;
      procedure to a urine bag. The type of the procedure will not affect out choice of the type of&#xD;
      the stent, as both stents can be inserted using the open, laparoscopic or robotic approach.&#xD;
      No difference in the choice for antibiotics or pain medication, again because we will perform&#xD;
      the same exact surgery (open, lap or robotic pyeloplasty) and so the same incisions. All out&#xD;
      patients receive pre and post-operative antibiotics and this will not be different in both&#xD;
      groups. For the alternative method, simply is choosing the first patient for example for&#xD;
      internal stent, the second patient we will use external stent, the third patient we will use&#xD;
      internal stent, then external , then internal..etc. We will not choose the patient according&#xD;
      to age or sex. Of course after we tell the parents and the patient about the study and they&#xD;
      choose not to enroll, we will use the internal stent as we usually do. Basically all the&#xD;
      pyeloplasty surgeries (open, Lap or robotic) are done as inpatient. All the patients will&#xD;
      spend the night in the hospital with Foley catheter and next day and after full evaluation&#xD;
      most of the patients will be sent home. All the pyeloplasty surgeries are done under general&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is prospective study to compare the post-operative pain, stent tolerance, stent care and&#xD;
      total cost of a common procedure in pediatric urology which is pyeloplasty. The patients will&#xD;
      be randomized into 2 groups. All female subjects will undergo a standard urine pregnancy test&#xD;
      to rule out pregnancy. The first group will be patients who will have internal Double-J&#xD;
      stents and the second group will be patients who will have external Pippi-Salle&#xD;
      nephron-ureteric stent. The parents and the patient will be informed at the day of the&#xD;
      surgery about the type of stent he/she will have at the end of the surgery. In the&#xD;
      post-operative period, the patient will stay overnight (as for all the non-study patients)&#xD;
      and next morning his/her Foley catheter will be removed. The patient and his/her family will&#xD;
      receive instructions about the care for external stent (if he/she has one) and receive the&#xD;
      regular prescriptions for pain medicine and Oxybutynin (if the patient has internal stent).&#xD;
      All patients will be given contact information to call in case they have concerns or&#xD;
      questions about the study, the procedure itself or the stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to the two different post-operative stent treatments using block&#xD;
      randomization with permuted blocks. Block randomization will help ensure that by the end of&#xD;
      the study we have a reasonably similar number of patients in each treatment group. Given that&#xD;
      the investigators are necessarily unmasked in this study since they are placing the stents,&#xD;
      randomly permuted blocks will ensure that the investigators cannot identify the pattern and&#xD;
      predict the stent the next patient will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The website www.randomization.com has been used to generate a randomization schedule using&#xD;
      block sizes of 9 and 6. This suggests an estimated 45 patients will be recruited at a single&#xD;
      site so that across 2 institutions about 90 patients will be recruited with approximately 30&#xD;
      patients total per treatment group by the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator is Dr. Michael C. Ost, M.D, chief of the division of Pediatric&#xD;
      urology with the research pediatric urology fellow Dr. Pankaj Dangel, M.D and the clinical&#xD;
      pediatric urology fellow Dr. Moira Dwyer, M.D. All the patients' names, details of the&#xD;
      procedures and the parents/patients questionnaires will be kept as part of medical records&#xD;
      that is protected by the HIPPA regulations for confidentiality.&#xD;

The data in the study will be presented in descriptive format for example we may find that 30% of the patients with internal stents have bladder spasms, and 40% of patients with external stents have site related pain.</description>
