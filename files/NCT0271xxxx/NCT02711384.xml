      Background: We determined the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane for&#xD;
      maintaining bispectral index (BIS) below 50 (MACBIS50) in patients undergoing coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass grafting during normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass phase. Method: Fifteen patients,&#xD;
      American Society of Anestesiology physical status III or IV, aged 40-70, undergoing elective&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass grafting, were enrolled in our study. The predetermined target&#xD;
      end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was maintained for at least ten minutes during&#xD;
      normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass phase. BIS values were then recorded at an interval of 10&#xD;
      s for 1 min. The dial settings were adjusted to attain an end-tidal sevoflurane concentration&#xD;
      of 1% in the first patient. If a given patient had an average BIS of &lt; 50, the sevoflurane&#xD;
      concentration was reduced by 0.1% in the subsequent patient, whereas if a given patient had a&#xD;
      BIS ≥ 50, the sevoflurane concentration was increased by 0.1% in the next patient. MACBIS50&#xD;
      was calculated using the midpoint concentration of patients involving a crossover according&#xD;
      to the up-down method. Average of the crossover midpoints in each pair defined effective dose&#xD;
      50. Data were also analyzed by a logistic regression test to obtain the probability of BIS &lt;&#xD;
      50 versus end-tidal sevoflurane concentration. Result: MACBIS50 of sevoflurane was 0,82% (95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals: 0,47-1,16) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting&#xD;
      during normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass phase. Conclusion: MACBIS50 determined in this&#xD;
      study was 15% lower compared to MACBIS50 in middle-aged adults after tracheal intubation.&#xD;

      Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is defined as the minimum alveolar concentration at sea&#xD;
      level of inhaled anaesthetic required to prevent apparently purposeful movement in 50% of&#xD;
      patients in response to surgical incision1,2. A similar approach to the one described to&#xD;
      ascertain MAC has been used to determine the potency of inhaled anaesthetics for other&#xD;
      desirable clinical end-points of general anaesthesia, such as to maintain bispectral index&#xD;
      (BIS) below 50 (MACBIS50). Therefore, MACBIS50 is defined as the minimum alveolar&#xD;
      concentration of inhaled anaesthetic for maintaining BIS below 50 in 50% of patients.&#xD;
      MACBIS50 was determined in different age groups and clinical conditions of patients, but not&#xD;
      in cardiac surgery3-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine the minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane for&#xD;
      maintaining bispectral index below 50 in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting&#xD;
      during normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods After obtaining approval from the institutional ethics committee and written informed&#xD;
      consent, fifteen patients, American Society of Anestesiology physical status III or IV, aged&#xD;
      40-70, undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting, were enrolled in our study.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria included history of psychiatric or neurological diseases, drug abuse or&#xD;
      medications that affect the central nervous system, pregnancy, combined surgeries,&#xD;
      reoperation in cardiac surgery, emergency procedures and neuraxial block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No premedication was given. Intraoperative monitoring consisted of a five-lead ECG, pulse&#xD;
      oximetry, gas analyzer, bladder catheterization, invasive arterial pressure in the radial&#xD;
      artery, esophageal thermometer, central venous catheter inserted through the subclavian vein,&#xD;
      transesophageal echocardiography (when indicated), train-of-four monitoring (TOF) and BIS&#xD;
      (BIS Vista™; Covidien). Breath-by-breath inspired/end-tidal sevoflurane and carbon dioxide&#xD;
      (CO2) concentrations were measured with a multigas analyzer and it was calibrated before each&#xD;
      experiment. The anaesthetic system used was a semi-closed system (Primus® - Draeger).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane in 6 L.min-1 oxygen using the incremental increase&#xD;
      technique via a face mask until the loss of consciousness and BIS value between 40-60. After&#xD;
      then sufentanil (0.5 µg.kg-1) and pancuronium (0.1 µg.kg-1) were given and assisted&#xD;
      ventilation was started. The T4/T1 ratio was measured using the TOF every minute until&#xD;
      orotracheal intubation. The patient was intubated with the following parameters: BIS value&#xD;
      between 40-60 and TOF = 0. Mechanical ventilation was initiated using controlled-volume mode&#xD;
      (tidal volume of 6 mL.kg-1, ventilatory frequency of 12-15 bpm, PEEP of 5 mmHg and minute&#xD;
      ventilation adjusted to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide tension with the range of 35-40&#xD;
      mmHg). Neuromuscular block was maintained under deep block (TOF = 0 and PTC ≥ 1) using&#xD;
      pancuronium up to one hour before the end of the procedure. Anesthesia was maintained using&#xD;
      sufentanil (1 µg.kg-1 before the surgical incision) and up to 1 MAC of the end-tidal&#xD;
      sevoflurane to maintain a BIS between 40-60. Continuous norepinephrine infusion was started&#xD;
      if the mean arterial pressure was less than 60 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were anticoagulated with heparin (400 U.kg-1) before insertion of the aortic&#xD;
      cannula. Anesthesia was maintained using up to 1 MAC of the end-tidal sevoflurane to maintain&#xD;
      a BIS between 40-60 during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), measured by the gas analyzer&#xD;
      positioned after the membrane oxygenator of the CPB circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The predetermined target end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was maintained for at least ten&#xD;
      minutes during normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass phase (36,5 degrees celsius). BIS values&#xD;
      were then recorded at an interval of 10 seconds for 1 min. The dial settings were adjusted to&#xD;
      attain an end-tidal sevoflurane concentration of 1% in the first patient. If a given patient&#xD;
      had an average BIS of &lt; 50, the sevoflurane concentration was reduced by 0.1% in the&#xD;
      subsequent patient, whereas if a given patient had a BIS ≥ 50, the sevoflurane concentration&#xD;
      was increased by 0.1% in the next patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG data were continuously observed by a monitor. The impedance of each electrode was&#xD;
      maintained at &lt; 2 kΩ. The smoothing window was set at 15s, which was used for interpreting&#xD;
      the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Patient characteristic and intraoperative data were collected and presented as&#xD;
      mean ± standard deviation. The Dixon's up-and-down method needs six pairs of failure-success&#xD;
      for statistical analysis. MACBIS50 was calculated using the midpoint concentration of&#xD;
      patients involving a crossover (BIS &lt; or ≥ 50) according to the up-down method. Average of&#xD;
      the crossover midpoints in each pair defined effective dose (ED50). The up-and-down sequences&#xD;
      were also analyzed by the probit test, which enabled us to derive the sevoflurane&#xD;
      concentration for maintaining BIS of 50, with 95% confidence limits of the mean. Data were&#xD;
      also analyzed by a logistic regression test to obtain the probability of BIS &lt; 50 versus&#xD;
      end-tidal sevoflurane concentration, the maximum likelihood estimators of the model&#xD;
      variables, and a goodness of fit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results A total of fifteen patients were recruited for this study (figure 1). The patient&#xD;
      characteristics and intraoperative data are shown in Table 1. Sequences of individual&#xD;
      patients according to up-down method are shown in Figure 2. MACBIS50 of sevoflurane was 0,82%&#xD;
      (95% confidence intervals: 0,47-1,16) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting&#xD;
      during normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass phase. MACBIS50 value estimated with probit&#xD;
      analysis (Figure 3) was 0,73% (95% confidence intervals: 0,45-1,00), which was similar to&#xD;
      that derived from up-down method. Corresponding ED95 values (minimum concentration of&#xD;
      sevoflurane required for maintaining BIS value &lt; 50 in 95% subjects) was 1,39 (95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals: 0,42-2,37).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No patient had dysrhythmia, hypotension or bradycardia at the moment of BIS measurement.&#xD;
      Dobutamine (0.5 µg.kg-1.min-1) was administered for all patients during normothermic&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion This study showed that MACBIS50 of sevoflurane was calculated to be 0,82% (95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals: 0,47-1,16) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting&#xD;
      during normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass phase. This value was 15% lower compared to&#xD;
      MACBIS50 in middle-aged adults after tracheal intubation (0.97%; 95% confidence intervals:&#xD;
      0.89- 1.05)3. Matsuura et al. showed that MACBIS50 of sevoflurane in young, middle-aged, and&#xD;
      elderly patients was 1.28% (1.24-1.32), 0.97% (0.89-1.05), and 0.87% (0.84-0.90),&#xD;
      respectively. The MACBIS50 was significantly higher in young patients and significantly lower&#xD;
      in elderly patients than those in middle-aged patients3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding our study, decreased MACBIS50 may be related to some factors such as hemodilution&#xD;
      and use of opioids during surgery. Administration of 5% isotonic dextrose reduced both&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid sodium and osmolality. This dilution of cerebrospinal fluid sodium was&#xD;
      associated with a reduction in MAC. That correlation did not occur with other solutions6.&#xD;
      Therefore, perhaps the hemodilution of the CPB circuit with 0.9% saline solution did not&#xD;
      interfere with the determination of MACBIS50 of sevoflurane in our study. In the other hand,&#xD;
      MAC consistently decreased with a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid sodium6. In this way, it&#xD;
      may have been a limiting factor for the determination of MACBIS50 of sevoflurane in our&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies using loading doses followed by infusions of sufentanil administered until just&#xD;
      before CPB have demonstrated a decrease in sufentanil concentrations of 30-55% on commencing&#xD;
      CPB7,8. Concentrations are stable during hypothermic CPB and then increase on rewarming,&#xD;
      indicating that relatively large amounts of sufentanil are sequestered in the tissues during&#xD;
      hypothermic CPB and released during rewarming. Immediately after CPB, sufentanil&#xD;
      concentrations approach pre-CPB values. The increase in sufentanil concentration on rewarming&#xD;
      implies that binding of sufentanil to the CPB circuit is unlikely, and the stability of the&#xD;
      concentrations during CPB suggests that metabolism and excretion do not occur during this&#xD;
      period8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the other hand, studies on infusions of sufentanil throughout CPB have demonstrated a&#xD;
      decrease of less than 20 % in total sufentanil concentration on commencing CPB9. There was no&#xD;
      correlation between sufentanil concentration and either total protein or albumin&#xD;
      concentrations, which both decreased by a greater percentage. The relatively small decrease&#xD;
      in sufentanil concentration is explained by rapid redistribution of free drug from the&#xD;
      tissues to the blood. Sufentanil has a large volume of distribution and hence the change in&#xD;
      volume as a result of the prime is small8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the pharmacokinetic characteristics of sufentanil in CPB, there is interaction&#xD;
      between opioids and inhaled anesthetics. Sufentanil produces similar reduction in isoflurane&#xD;
      MAC, with an initial steep reduction at lower concentrations and a plateau effect at higher&#xD;
      concentrations10. We used a total dose of 1.5 µg.kg-1 of sufentanil (0.5 µg.kg-1 for&#xD;
      anesthetic induction and 1.0 µg.kg-1 before the surgical incision). Therefore, the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic characteristics of sufentanil in CPB associated with the interaction between&#xD;
      opioids and inhaled anesthetics may justify a lower MACBIS50 in the population of our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nussmeier et al. showed that washin of isoflurane appeared to occur more slowly during CPB&#xD;
      than during administration via the lungs in normothermic patients, presumably because&#xD;
      hypothermia increases tissue capacity. During rewarming, washout appeared to occur as rapidly&#xD;
      as from the lungs of normothermic patients11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We used BIS value below 50 as an index of the depth of anaesthesia. We considered the&#xD;
      end-tidal concentrations to maintain BIS below 50 as an appropriate concentration to achieve&#xD;
      hypnotic responses. As supportive evidence, this value has been used previously by other&#xD;
      researchers3,12. We did not investigate other BIS values such as 40 or 60. Assessment of the&#xD;
      relationships between anaesthetic concentrations and a variety of BIS values would warrant&#xD;
      further study, but BIS value below 50 is supposed to play a role as an index indicative of&#xD;
      adequate depth of anaesthesia. However, BIS values more than 60 would entail a risk of&#xD;
      awareness during procedure13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAC increased significantly only during ephedrine infusion. Mephentermine, phenylephrine,&#xD;
      metaraminol, methoxamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline did not change MAC14. However, no&#xD;
      studies on the effects of dobutamine infusion and MAC of inhaled anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, our study is a pioneer in determining MACBIS50 in patients undergoing coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass grafting during normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass phase. Therefore, further&#xD;
      studies to determine the MACBIS50 of sevoflurane in different age groups should be developed&#xD;
      in the context of coronary artery bypass grafting and other cardiac procedures.&#xD;
