    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a serious mental health disorder that affects approximately 1% of the&#xD;
      population. Auditory hallucinations are present in as many as 50-75% of patients with this&#xD;
      diagnosis. The hallucinations experienced by patients vary greatly and can severely impact an&#xD;
      individual's ability to function on a daily basis. In approximately 25-30% of these patients,&#xD;
      medication is an ineffective mechanism for managing these symptoms. These hallucinations are&#xD;
      known as medication refractory auditory hallucination (MRAH). For those whose auditory&#xD;
      hallucinations do not respond to medication, non-surgical brain stimulation (NBS) has&#xD;
      recently shown promise as a therapeutic intervention. Two specific types of NBS, called&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial random noise stimulation&#xD;
      (tRNS), seem particularly well suited to treating MRAH. They have yet to be compared to each&#xD;
      other in large samples of patients with MRAH. The goal of the study is to investigate whether&#xD;
      tRNS and tDCS are effective in the treatment of MRAH and if one is better than the other when&#xD;
      compared directly.&#xD;

      Purpose and Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schizophrenia is a serious mental health disorder with a constellation of positive, negative,&#xD;
      and cognitive symptoms. Negative symptoms can include characteristics such as affective&#xD;
      flattening, avolition, and alogia. Positive symptoms can include delusions, hallucinations,&#xD;
      and disorganized speech or behavior. Auditory hallucinations (AH) are a hallmark of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. They are reported in as many as 50-75% of patients with this diagnosis. The&#xD;
      hallucinations experienced by patients vary greatly and can severely impact an individual's&#xD;
      ability to function on a daily basis. In approximately 25-30% of patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      schizophrenia, medication is an ineffective mechanism for managing these symptoms. These&#xD;
      hallucinations are known as medication refractory auditory hallucinations (MRAH). They are&#xD;
      defined as &quot;the persistence of daily hallucinations without remission despite antipsychotic&#xD;
      medication at an adequate dosage for at least three months&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those whose AH do not respond to medication, non-surgical brain stimulation (NBS) has&#xD;
      recently shown promise as a therapeutic intervention. Specifically, the use of conductive&#xD;
      electrical approaches termed transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). One method of tES&#xD;
      that has received renewed interest due to its high portability, safety, and modulatory&#xD;
      effects is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS involves applying a weak&#xD;
      electrical current using saline soaked electrode sponges, causing either increases or&#xD;
      decreases in cortical excitability, respectively. Research has shown in both healthy subjects&#xD;
      and patients (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and depression) that&#xD;
      tDCS has the potential to modulate synaptic and neurotransmitter-dependent plasticity&#xD;
      underlying changes in behavior and learning. Brunelin et al utilized tDCS to successfully&#xD;
      reduce MRAH in a population diagnosed with schizophrenia. They were able to reduce AH by&#xD;
      approximately 30% in their sample after 5 days of twice-daily treatment and this effect was&#xD;
      maintained for approximately three months following treatment. This finding has yet to be&#xD;
      replicated in a similar study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with tDCS, other new methods of NBS are being investigated across various disease&#xD;
      states. One such study looked at the impact of tES on tinnitus. They tested whether type of&#xD;
      tES made a difference in efficacy. They compared tDCS to tRNS. tRNS is very similar to tDCS&#xD;
      except that it superimposes a random &quot;white noise&quot; gaussian waveform (from 0.1 hz to 640 hz)&#xD;
      on top of the DC current. They found that tRNS induced a larger suppressive effect on&#xD;
      tinnitus loudness and tinnitus-related distress when compared to tDCS. While their findings&#xD;
      were in tinnitus, there are now multiple scholarly works describing a relationship of&#xD;
      tinnitus and AH, possibly as a continuum or dimension underlying a variety of normal and&#xD;
      disease states. This relationship suggests strategies found to be efficacious for tinnitus&#xD;
      may in fact also be efficacious for AH. Recently, there was a case series showing possible&#xD;
      efficacy in AH using tRNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to examine the efficacy of tES in the treatment of MRAH of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. The hypothesis is that tRNS will provide a larger reduction of AH in those&#xD;
      with schizophrenia as compared to tDCS and no treatment (i.e. sham). Confirmation of this&#xD;
      hypothesis would provide an exciting new option for treatment and may provide an even higher&#xD;
      level of efficacy than is seen in tDCS. Further, this study would also provide replication of&#xD;
      the work by Brunelin et al. and further support of tES as a compelling tool for the&#xD;
      management of severe MRAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine efficacy of tES as a treatment for MRAH. Hypothesis 1a: tDCS is more effective&#xD;
           than sham in the treatment of MRAH shown by a reduction in both total and subscores of&#xD;
           the AHRS. Hypothesis 1b: tRNS is more effective than both sham and tDCS in the treatment&#xD;
           of MRAH as shown by a reduction in both total and subscores of the AHRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Demonstrate safety and tolerability of tES in the treatment of MRAH. Hypothesis 2a: tDCS&#xD;
           is safe and well tolerated in the treatment of MRAH as demonstrated by the TSEQ.&#xD;
           Hypothesis 2a: tRNS is safe and well tolerated in the treatment of MRAH as demonstrated&#xD;
           by TSEQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exploratory: Detect tES sensitive subtypes of AH based on the MUPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is double-blind, between group, and sham-controlled. Subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      to one of three arms (tRNS, tDCS, or sham) and will remain in that arm for the duration of&#xD;
      the study. All subjects will complete an enrollment visit, ten treatment visits (2 visits per&#xD;
      day), and 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up visits. Given that durability of effect has been&#xD;
      suggested in the literature to be less than 6 months, patients will not be followed beyond 6&#xD;
      months. The outcome of this study will be measured by standard auditory hallucination rating&#xD;
      scales including the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), Auditory Hallucinations&#xD;
      Rating Scale (AHRS), and psychotic symptom rating scales (PSYRATS). Both the AHRS and PSYRATS&#xD;
      are included as outcome measures to ensure generalizability to existing studies on tES (which&#xD;
      use the AHRS) along with the broader body of AH research (which use the PSYRATS). The primary&#xD;
      efficacy parameter will be the PSYRATS as this has shown the most evidence for accurate&#xD;
      representation of AH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will replicate and expand on previous research regarding the use of tES as a&#xD;
           treatment for medication refractory auditory hallucinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Based on the findings, this study could have potential application as a non-invasive&#xD;
           clinical intervention for treating MRAH which affect 25% of medicated patients with&#xD;
           schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit individuals who are receiving outpatient services at the Minneapolis&#xD;
      VA Medical Center, the University of Minnesota Department of Psychiatry, or the University of&#xD;
      Minnesota Medical Center--Fairview. Patients will be referred by clinical staff from multiple&#xD;
      departments including Mental Health, Polytrauma, and Social Work. Referral will be based on a&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective disorder with medication refractory&#xD;
      auditory hallucinations as assessed by the patient's clinical provider. Subjects will also&#xD;
      have the ability to self-identify to flyers and local newspaper ads. Brunelin et al found a&#xD;
      large and significant effect size (d=1.58, p&lt;0.001) which the investigators have used to&#xD;
      guide our power analysis. The investigators power analysis was performed for three arms using&#xD;
      an alpha of 0.025, a power of 0.8, and a desired effect size of 1.00. This analysis results&#xD;
      in a need for approximately 20 subjects per arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reduce subject burden, the investigators will obtain a waiver of HIPAA&#xD;
      authorization and informed consent for recruitment and screening to allow potential subjects&#xD;
      to be pre-screened by chart review and in person or by telephone prior to scheduling&#xD;
      potential participants for initial visit. Potential participants will be provided with&#xD;
      information about the study and asked a series of questions to determine if they meet basic&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, such as a history of MRAH. They will be told about the basic&#xD;
      aims of the study, and those interested in participating will be scheduled for an initial&#xD;
      visit at which time they will complete consent paperwork.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiation Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initiation visit (visit 1) starts with completion of informed consent, HIPAA, and the&#xD;
      Modified Dysken Tool to assess capacity to consent. The participant must score 7 / 10 on the&#xD;
      Dysken Tool in order to participate in the study. Should the participant score less than 7,&#xD;
      s/he will be offered remedial teaching and re-assessment. Should the subject agree via&#xD;
      consent and demonstrate capacity to consent, s/he is enrolled into the study. A full baseline&#xD;
      evaluation is then performed. This includes assessment via MINI, MUPS, PANSS, AHRS, PSYRATS&#xD;
      and Edinburgh Handedness Inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2 - 10 are exclusively treatment visits. At each visit the participant completes the&#xD;
      tES Side Effect Questionnaire (TSEQ) both pre and post treatment. Visits occur twice daily&#xD;
      for 5 days. Visits must be spaced at least 2 hours apart. Depending on the arm participants&#xD;
      have been randomized into, s/he will receive treatment with either tDCS, tRNS, or sham.&#xD;
      Treatment will be provided using the Starstim Neurostimulator (Neuroelectrics, Inc.) This&#xD;
      device has been approved for use in research in the United States without an investigational&#xD;
      device exemption due to meeting criteria for non-significant risk. The same energetic&#xD;
      parameters are used for both tDCS and tRNS (2mA for 20 min) as well as the same electrodes&#xD;
      (SPONSTIM-25 25cm2 electrodes). Both tDCS and tRNS are initiated in a ramp-like fashion over&#xD;
      10s from 0mA to 2mA. Once at 2mA, tDCS is held constant for the entire session whereas the&#xD;
      tRNS consists of an alternating current of 2mA with a 0mA offset applied at random&#xD;
      frequencies over a range of 0.1 to 100 Hz. The sham procedure involves only 40 sec&#xD;
      stimulation at 2mA and then drops to 0mA with 15msec pulses every 550msec. Should the&#xD;
      participant not be able to tolerate a current of 2mA due to pain or irritation, the current&#xD;
      will be decreased down to a minimum of 1.5mA. If 1.5 mA is still not tolerable, the&#xD;
      participant will be removed from the study. Electrode placement is based on the international&#xD;
      10-20 electrode placement system. The anode is placed at the midpoint between F3 and FP1, a&#xD;
      location corresponding approximately to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the&#xD;
      cathode placed at the midpoint between T3 and P3, a location corresponding to left&#xD;
      temporo-parietal junction. Placement and parameters in tDCS are consistent with Brunelin et&#xD;
      al, 2012). Placement and parameters in tRNS are consistent with. Stimulation setup and&#xD;
      administration takes approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 11 is run the same as visits 2 - 10 but after completion of the final (10th)&#xD;
      stimulation session, the subject will again complete the PANSS, AHRS, and PSYRATS. This visit&#xD;
      typically takes 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 12 - 14 are follow-up assessment only visits and occur at 1 month, 3 month, and 6&#xD;
      months post treatment. Participants will not receive stimulation but instead will be assessed&#xD;
      via PANSS, AHRS, and PSYRATS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missed Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that a participant misses a session of treatment, the session will be&#xD;
      re-scheduled and treatment continued as soon as possible. The deviation from treatment will&#xD;
      be noted in the study record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent Process&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting will take place in a private office at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System,&#xD;
      University of Minnesota 717 Delaware office, the Ambulatory Research Center of the University&#xD;
      of Minnesota Department of Psychiatry, or the UMPhysicians MINCEP clinic, depending on&#xD;
      patient preference. Only the study staff obtaining consent, the subject, and any family&#xD;
      members invited by the subject will be present. The research coordinator or other trained&#xD;
      research staff will explain the study to the participants. After explaining the study, the&#xD;
      participants will be allowed as much time as needed to review the HIPAA and consenting&#xD;
      documents and ask any questions that might arise before making the decision to participate.&#xD;
      If necessary, participants can delay participation for up to a week. Subjects will be allowed&#xD;
      to review the consent form in private for as long as they need. Subjects will be allowed to&#xD;
      ask any and all questions prior to providing consent. Study personnel obtaining consent will&#xD;
      emphasize first and foremost that the study is voluntary and will not influence that&#xD;
      subject's clinical care through the VA Medical Center, University of Minnesota Medical&#xD;
      Center--Fairview, or the University of Minnesota Department of Psychiatry. To ensure&#xD;
      comprehension of the information provided in the informed consent forms, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to complete the Modified Dysken Tool and answer 7 out of 10 questions correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications of Lack of Capacity to Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Potential participant has severe formal thought disorder that does not allow him or her&#xD;
           to ask understandable questions or to answer the questions on the Dysken Tool&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Potential participant is unable to maintain attention to the description of the consent&#xD;
           form long enough to perceive the individual basic points in the consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Potential participant, either due to catatonia or otherwise, the potential participant&#xD;
           cannot ask questions or respond sufficiently to indicate agreement&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Potential participant expresses delusions related to the research protocol that&#xD;
           significantly distort his or her basic understanding of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No participant will be under legal commitment at the time of their consent or during their&#xD;
      participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed for group by time effects of stimulation method as compared to sham.&#xD;
      Tolerability will also be assessed by looking at total side effect score compared to&#xD;
      stimulation type. The data will be further analyzed using a clustering technique to&#xD;
      understand the impact of symptom cluster and severity on overall treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks and Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves the use of a tES device. With tES, both tDCS and tRNS are considered to&#xD;
      be safe brain stimulation techniques that rarely result in adverse events. There is currently&#xD;
      no evidence of serious side-effects. Criteria for discontinuation that may rarely occur are&#xD;
      sores at the tCS administration site, headaches that impair global functioning, and worsening&#xD;
      psychosis. Mild side-effects that typically resolve upon discontinuation tCS include light&#xD;
      itching under the electrode at the beginning of administration, headache, fatigue, and&#xD;
      nausea. The participant may choose to discontinue stimulation at any time during the session&#xD;
      if experiencing discomfort or side effects. No other risks are anticipated. Nonetheless, in&#xD;
      order to minimize risks, study staff will be using standards of administration that have been&#xD;
      shown to be safe in numerous other studies and across more than 2000 studies using tES; this&#xD;
      includes length of administration, magnitude of the current, size of electrode sponges used,&#xD;
      and method of applying stimulation. Any unanticipated problems or adverse events will be&#xD;
      reported according to MVAHCS standard operating procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will use private (medical or educational) records during the recruitment process.&#xD;
      Therefore, the use of protected health information may be associated with negative feelings&#xD;
      about sharing medical/educational history. Participants may experience mild stress and/or&#xD;
      discomfort with completing surveys/interview. Participants could also experience temporary&#xD;
      feelings of stress or mental fatigue due to the behavioral assessment measures used in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, breach of confidentiality is a potential risk due to the use of sensitive&#xD;
      private information. The results of this study may be published or presented but the&#xD;
      participant's identity and records will not be revealed unless required by Federal Law. A&#xD;
      Federal Law allows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office for Human Research&#xD;
      Protections, Government Accountability Office and other Federal agencies, the Research and&#xD;
      Development Committee, representatives of USAMRMC, Henry M. Jackson Foundation, and/or the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Human Studies Subcommittee of the VA Medical Center or&#xD;
      University of Minnesota to review records. Because of the need for these inspections,&#xD;
      absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. However, every effort would be made to&#xD;
      minimize these risks by providing the participant with a unique numerical identifier at the&#xD;
      beginning of the study in order to protect their actual identification and maintain complete&#xD;
      confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that a participant may have a reduction of symptoms from the tES treatment but&#xD;
      there are no anticipated direct or societal benefits to participation in this research&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
      A MVAHCS or University of Minnesota staff will act as an independent research monitor for&#xD;
      this study. Her/His duties may include discussing the research protocol and recruitment with&#xD;
      the investigator and staff, monitoring utilization of the tES device, follow-up with any&#xD;
      participants in which an adverse event was reported, and reporting findings to the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Privacy, Confidentiality, and Information Security&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-report data will be collected on paper and scanned and stored in a password protected&#xD;
      database behind the MVAMC or University of Minnesota firewalls. All personal identifiers will&#xD;
      be stored on the consent form and in a master participant list within the database. All other&#xD;
      documents will contain the unique participant ID. All paper documents related to this study&#xD;
      will be stored in a locked file cabinet within locked research study offices. Access to&#xD;
      research data and documents will be restricted to research personnel listed on the study&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be maintained at the MVAHCS and University of Minnesota indefinitely per&#xD;
      requisite data retention policies. No data will be destroyed. Information regarding research&#xD;
      results will not be shared with study participants.&#xD;

At the end of stimulation, current is decreased in a ramp-like fashion over 10s from 2mA to 0mA. Should the participant not be able to tolerate a current of 2mA due to pain or irritation, the current will be decreased down to a minimum of 1.5mA. If 1.5 mA is still not tolerable, the participant will be removed from the study. Electrode placement is based on the international 10-20 electrode placement system. The anode is placed at the midpoint between F3 and FP1, a location corresponding approximately to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the cathode placed at the midpoint between T3 and P3, a location corresponding to left temporo-parietal junction</description>

            <description>The sham procedure involves only 40 sec direct current stimulation at 2mA and then drops to 0mA with 15msec pulses every 550msec.&#xD;
Transcranial Sham Stimulation: Energetic parameters are 2mA for 20 min with SPONSTIM-25 25cm2 electrodes. The sham procedure involves only 40 sec stimulation at 2mA and then drops to 0mA with 15msec pulses every 550msec. Should the participant not be able to tolerate a current of 2mA due to pain or irritation, the current will be decreased down to a minimum of 1.5mA. If 1.5 mA is still not tolerable, the participant will be removed from the study. Electrode placement is based on the international 10-20 electrode placement system. The anode is placed at the midpoint between F3 and FP1, a location corresponding approximately to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the cathode placed at the midpoint between T3 and P3, a location corresponding to left temporo-parietal junction</description>
