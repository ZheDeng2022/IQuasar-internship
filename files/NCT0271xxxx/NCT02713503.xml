      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a variety of technologies in a driving simulator.&#xD;
      Specifically, this research will provide a direct comparison of driver performance measures&#xD;
      under various modes of mobile device interaction. The study will be conducted at CU-ICAR&#xD;
      using the DriveSafety CDS-250 driving simulator. The experiment will be a key step in&#xD;
      understanding what driver performance challenges and errors may occur under various&#xD;
      interaction modes in the driving context. Results will investigate differences in driving&#xD;
      performance in the presence and absence of full device pairing with vehicle electronics and&#xD;
      what criteria might be considered for proposed pairing requirements. The driving simulator&#xD;
      tasks will focus on visual scanning ability while engaging in secondary tasks using mobile&#xD;
      devices such as (but not limited to) handheld phones with and without Bluetooth, mounted&#xD;
      touchscreen displays, various voice-based interfaces, and the novel display system. Tasks&#xD;
      will include activities such as making voice calls, text messaging, searching for points of&#xD;
      interest on maps, and traditional in-vehicle activities such as changing the temperature, fan&#xD;
      speed, radio station, etc. The number of tasks and interaction modes will vary between&#xD;
      participants with up to 6 modes included per participant (e.g. handheld, mounted ipad, voice&#xD;
      control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technologies will be integrated with the DriveSafety CDS-250 driving simulator.&#xD;
      Participants will complete the Functional Object Detection (FOD) visual scanning task that&#xD;
      requires a driver to maintain lane position, respond to brake events in the central field of&#xD;
      view, and respond to target events that appear in the periphery. In addition, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to concurrently complete the mobile-device tasks using the interaction modes&#xD;
      described previously and occasionally respond to notifications simulating connected-vehicle&#xD;
      interactions. Primary outcomes will include driving performance (lane tracking and speed&#xD;
      maintenance), FOD peripheral task performance (% identified, response time), FOD braking task&#xD;
      performance (% identified, response time, false positive responses), and subjective measures&#xD;
      including workload, interface preferences, and open ended items describing their reactions to&#xD;
      each interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete training to get comfortable driving the simulator while driving on&#xD;
      a straight road and then repeat the task using the cruise control prior to driving the&#xD;
      experimental conditions. Participants will be recruited by word of mouth as well as through&#xD;
      the use of flyers, newspaper advertisements, and talks in the community. All data will be&#xD;
      collected in the driving simulator lab at CU-ICAR. We plan to share the findings of this&#xD;
      research with designers, practitioners and researchers at conferences and through academic&#xD;
      publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a vision screening using a standard eye chart and will complete a&#xD;
      visual scanning task using an interactive light board where the participants will stand (or&#xD;
      sit) in front of a board with moving lights and asked to identify the locations, colors,&#xD;
      letters and numbers of the lights by pressing their location on the board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DriveSafetyâ„¢ CDS-250 Driving Simulator The CDS-250 driving simulator is designed as a&#xD;
      rehabilitation tool which occupies a smaller footprint than traditional driving simulators.&#xD;
      The simulator has a partial cab consisting of an adjustable driver's seat, center console,&#xD;
      instrument cluster, and standard vehicle controls (steering wheel, accelerator, brake). Two&#xD;
      input buttons are located on the steering wheel in the &quot;3:00&quot; and &quot;9:00&quot; positions. The&#xD;
      display consists of three 19&quot; (diagonal) LCD screens each with a resolution of 1440 X 900&#xD;
      pixels. The left and right screens are each rotated 30 degrees off-plane from the center&#xD;
      screen toward the driver. The total horizontal width of this display configuration is 49&quot;. In&#xD;
      addition to using the driving simulator for driving related tasks, a variety of reaction time&#xD;
      tasks have been developed to work on patients' coordinated muscle movements, information&#xD;
      processing, and reaction times.&#xD;
