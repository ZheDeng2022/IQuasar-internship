  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to characterize cancer patients' responses to learning&#xD;
      their secondary findings arising from tumor genomic profiling, and the process and outcomes&#xD;
      of their decisions to communicate these results to their families.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For Phase 1 of this study, the investigators will conduct a prospective, observational study&#xD;
      with cancer patients undergoing tumor genomic profiling (n = 300) and their family members&#xD;
      (anticipated n â‰ˆ 150). Data collection will occur through an embedded mixed methods design,&#xD;
      in which both quantitative (i.e., survey) and qualitative (i.e., semi-structured interview)&#xD;
      data are collected at the same timepoint in order to obtain a more complete understanding of&#xD;
      specific processes and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be recruited from those who already enrolled in protocol #12-245, and who agree to&#xD;
      receive their secondary findings through Consent Part C of this existing protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Phase 2 of this study, participants (n=500) who have received pathogenic secondary&#xD;
      findings through protocol #12-245 will be recruited.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients (Phase I):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has consented to MSK IRB protocol #12-245, Consent A and Part C&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has not received secondary findings as a result of MSK IRB protocol #12-245, Consent&#xD;
             Part C as per EMR and/or patient report&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with a solid tumor as per EMR and/or clinician judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English-fluent; the surveys were designed and validated in English and are not&#xD;
             currently available in other languages. Translation of questionnaires into other&#xD;
             languages would require reestablishing the reliability and validity of these measures.&#xD;
             Therefore, participants must be able to communicate in English to complete the&#xD;
             surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Family members (Phase I):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age or older as per self report&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nominated by the patient participant as a family member with whom the secondary&#xD;
             findings have been shared (spouses/partners are eligible as &quot;family members&quot; for the&#xD;
             purposes of this study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English-fluent; the surveys were designed and validated in English and are not&#xD;
             currently available in other languages. Translation of questionnaires into other&#xD;
             languages would require reestablishing the reliability and validity of these measures.&#xD;
             Therefore, participants must be able to communicate in English to complete the&#xD;
             surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients (Phase 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age of older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has consented to MSK IRB protocol #12-245, Consent Part A and C&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English-fluent; the surveys were designed and validated in English and are not&#xD;
             currently available in other languages. Translation of questionnaires into other&#xD;
             languages would require reestablishing the reliability and validity of these measures.&#xD;
             Therefor, participants must be able to communicate in English to complete the surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received genetic testing in the past that resulted in a pathogenic finding or a&#xD;
             variant of unknown significance as reported in the EMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major psychiatric illness or cognitive impairment that in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator or study staff would preclude study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patients who are unable to comply with the study procedures as determined by the&#xD;
             study investigators or study staff.&#xD;
