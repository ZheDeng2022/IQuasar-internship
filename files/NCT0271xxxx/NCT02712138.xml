      Development of a new MS-based biomarker for the early and sensitive diagnosis of Gilbert&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gilbert syndrome is a mild genetic liver disorder in which the body cannot properly process&#xD;
      bilirubin, a yellowish waste product that is formed when old or worn out red blood cells are&#xD;
      broken down (hemolysis). It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with Gilbert syndrome have elevated levels of bilirubin (hyperbilirubinemia),&#xD;
      because they have a reduced level of a specific liver enzyme required for elimination of&#xD;
      bilirubin. Most affected individuals have no symptoms or may only exhibit mild yellowing of&#xD;
      the skin, mucous membranes, and whites of the eyes (jaundice). Jaundice may not be apparent&#xD;
      until adolescence. Bilirubin levels may increase following stress, exertion, dehydration,&#xD;
      alcohol consumption, fasting, and/or infection. In some individuals, jaundice may only be&#xD;
      apparent when triggered by one of these conditions. Some affected individuals have reported&#xD;
      vague, unspecific symptoms including fatigue, weakness and gastrointestinal symptoms such as&#xD;
      nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gilbert syndrome is diagnosed more often in males than females. The disorder affects&#xD;
      approximately 3-7 percent of individuals in the general population, and affects individuals&#xD;
      of all races. It is present at birth, but may remain undiagnosed until the late teens or&#xD;
      early twenties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gilbert syndrome is caused by mutations to the UGT1A1 gene located on the long arm (q) of&#xD;
      chromosome 2 (2q37). The UGT1A1 gene contains instructions for creating (encoding) a liver&#xD;
      enzyme known as uridine disphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 (UGT1A1). This enzyme is&#xD;
      required for the conversion (conjugation) and subsequent excretion of bilirubin from the&#xD;
      body. Individuals with Gilbert syndrome retain approximately one third of the normal UGT1A1&#xD;
      enzyme activity and are able to conjugate enough bilirubin to prevent symptoms from&#xD;
      developing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mild jaundice associated with Gilbert syndrome occurs due to reduced amounts of this enzyme,&#xD;
      which results in the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the body. Bilirubin circulates&#xD;
      in the liquid portion of the blood (plasma) bound to a protein called albumin; this is called&#xD;
      unconjugated bilirubin, which does not dissolve in water (water-insoluble). Normally, this&#xD;
      unconjugated bilirubin is taken up by the liver cells and, with the help of the UGT1A1&#xD;
      enzyme, is converted to form water-soluble bilirubin glucuronides (conjugated bilirubin),&#xD;
      which are then excreted in the bile. The bile is stored in the gall bladder and, when called&#xD;
      upon, passes into the common bile duct and then into the upper portion of the small intestine&#xD;
      (duodenum) and aids in digestion. Most bilirubin is eliminated from the body in the feces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic&#xD;
      alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future&#xD;
      the disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it is the goal of the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from&#xD;
      the plasma of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose&#xD;
      and thereby with an earlier treatment.&#xD;

      Laboratory Blood Test&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectrometry 7,5 ml&#xD;
      EDTA blood and a dry blood spot filter card are taken. To proof the correct Gilbert diagnosis&#xD;
      in those patients where up to the enrollment in the study no genetic testing has been done,&#xD;
      sequencing of Gilbert disease will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses will be done at:&#xD;
