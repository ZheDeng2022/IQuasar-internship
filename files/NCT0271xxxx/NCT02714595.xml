          <title>Total APACHE II Score</title>
          <description>Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II is a severity-of-disease classification applied within 24 hours of admission of a patient to an intensive care unit (ICU). The APACHE II score consists of three parts: 12 acute physiological variables, age, and chronic health status. The range of the score is 0 to 71, where higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death.</description>

        <description>Microbiological outcomes per Baseline pathogen were determined by the sponsor according to the following criteria established for each infection site:&#xD;
HAP/VAP/HCAP: Eradication was defined as the absence of the Baseline Gram-negative pathogen from an appropriate clinical specimen (sputum, tracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, protected specimen brush, pleural fluid, or lung biopsy). If it was not possible to obtain an appropriate clinical culture and the participant had a successful clinical outcome, the response was presumed to be eradication.&#xD;
BSI/Sepsis: Absence of the Baseline Gram-negative pathogen from a blood culture and/or other primary source as applicable.

cUTI: a culture taken any time after documented eradication at TOC, and a urine culture obtained at FU showed that the Baseline uropathogen found at entry at ≥10⁵ CFU/mL remained &lt; 10³ CFU/mL.&#xD;
Overall per-participant response was defined as sustained eradication of all Baseline Gram-negative pathogens after documented eradication at TOC.</description>

        <description>Microbiological outcome per Baseline carbapenem-resistant pathogen were determined according to the following criteria for each diagnosis:&#xD;
HAP/VAP/HCAP: Eradication was defined as the absence of the Baseline Gram-negative pathogen from an appropriate clinical specimen. If it was not possible to obtain an appropriate clinical culture and the participant had a successful clinical outcome, the response was presumed to be eradication.&#xD;
BSI/Sepsis: Absence of the Baseline Gram-negative pathogen from a blood culture and/or other primary source as applicable. In the case of sepsis, if the participant had a successful clinical outcome and it was not possible to obtain an appropriate clinical culture, the response was presumed to be eradication.&#xD;
cUTI: a urine culture that showed that the Gram-negative uropathogen identified at Baseline at ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL was reduced to &lt; 10³ CFU/mL.&#xD;
Overall per-participant eradication was defined as eradication of all Baseline Gram-negative pathogens.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Microbiologic Eradication at Follow-up By Baseline Carbapenem-resistant Pathogen</title>
        <description>Microbiological outcomes per Baseline pathogen at FU were determined according to the following criteria for each diagnosis:&#xD;
HAP/VAP/HCAP: Sustained eradication was defined as the absence of the Baseline Gram-negative pathogen from an appropriate clinical specimen after TOC.&#xD;
BSI/Sepsis: Absence of the Baseline Gram-negative pathogen from a blood culture or other primary source after TOC as applicable.&#xD;
For HAP/VAP/HCAP and sepsis if an appropriate clinical culture could not be obtained and the participant had a successful clinical response after TOC, the response was presumed sustained eradication.&#xD;
cUTI: a culture taken any time after documented eradication at TOC, and a urine culture obtained at FU showed that the Baseline uropathogen found at entry at ≥10⁵ CFU/mL remained &lt; 10³ CFU/mL.&#xD;
Overall per-participant response was defined as sustained eradication of all Baseline Gram-negative pathogens after documented eradication at TOC.</description>

        <description>Clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) is a surrogate for diagnosis and treatment response. Points (0, 1, or 2) are assigned for observed findings for 5 variables including body temperature, white blood cell count, tracheal secretions, ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2), and chest radiograph infiltrates. The total score ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores may indicate a higher likelihood of mortality; a negative change from Baseline indicates improvement</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)</title>
        <description>The SOFA score is a scoring system to determine the extent of a patient's organ function or rate of failure. The score is based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological systems. Each score is from 0 to 4, and the total score ranges from 0 to 24, where higher scores indicate a higher likelihood of mortality. A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)</title>
          <description>The SOFA score is a scoring system to determine the extent of a patient's organ function or rate of failure. The score is based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological systems. Each score is from 0 to 4, and the total score ranges from 0 to 24, where higher scores indicate a higher likelihood of mortality. A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement.</description>
