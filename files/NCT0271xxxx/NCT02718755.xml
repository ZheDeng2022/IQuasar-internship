      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if fludarabine, cytarabine (ARA-C), and&#xD;
      erwinase (also known as asparaginase [erwinia]) in combination can help to control relapsed&#xD;
      or refractory hematologic malignancies. The safety of these drugs will also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will receive&#xD;
      treatment in 2 phases: Induction and Consolidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose level of fludarabine, cytarabine, and erwinase.&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed, the study drug doses may be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will receive 1-2 cycles during the Induction phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1-5, participant will receive fludarabine by vein over about 30 minutes and&#xD;
      cytarabine by vein over about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1-7, participant will receive erwinase by vein over about 2 hours or as an injection&#xD;
      into the muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease does not respond during Cycle 1, participant may be allowed to receive an&#xD;
      additional Induction cycle. If the disease does respond to Induction, participant can move to&#xD;
      the Consolidation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consolidation Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will receive up to 3 cycles during the Consolidation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1-4, participant will receive fludarabine by vein over about 30 minutes and&#xD;
      cytarabine by vein over about 2 hours. If the doctor thinks it is needed, this may be reduced&#xD;
      to Days 1-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 and then every other day for 15 days (3, 5, 7 and so on), participant will receive&#xD;
      erwinase by vein over about 2 hours or as an injection into the muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 (Â± 3 days) of every cycle, participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction Cycle(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 8, 9, and 12 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine, biomarker, and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
           (PD) testing. Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be related to how the&#xD;
           leukemia reacts to the study drug. PD testing measures how the level of study drug in&#xD;
           participant's body may affect the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Days 9 and 12 only, blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
           (PK) testing. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time&#xD;
           points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 7 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1-2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PK testing&#xD;
      before the dose and then 8 more times over the next 24 hours after the dose. Some of these&#xD;
      blood samples will also be used for antibody testing. Antibodies are created by the immune&#xD;
      system and may attack foreign cells or substances, such as the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 21 of Cycle 1, participant will have a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy for biomarker and&#xD;
      PD testing and to check the status of the disease. If the doctor thinks it is needed,&#xD;
      participant may have additional bone marrow aspirations/biopsies while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant has a second Induction Cycle and the doctor thinks it is needed, they will&#xD;
      have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy at the end of the second Induction Cycle for biomarker and&#xD;
      PD testing and to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consolidation Cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 1-2 weeks, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK testing before the dose&#xD;
      and then 8 more times over the next 24 hours after the dose. Some of this blood sample will&#xD;
      also be used for antibody testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant did not have 2 induction cycles, at the end of Cycle 1 of Consolidation, if&#xD;
      the doctor thinks it is needed, they will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy for biomarker&#xD;
      and PD testing and to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant may continue taking the study drugs for up to 3 cycles of Consolidation after&#xD;
      Induction. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets&#xD;
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's participation in the study will be over after the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 4-8 weeks after participant's last dose of study drugs, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons)&#xD;
      will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6-12 months after the last dose of study drugs, the study staff will check on how&#xD;
      participant is doing. This will either be done by phone or during a regularly scheduled&#xD;
      clinic visit. If participant is contacted by phone, the phone call should last about 10&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This follow-up will last until participant withdraws from the study or the study ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patient's participation in this study is over, they will be given the option to enroll&#xD;
      in a long-term follow-up study (DR09-0223). Participant's doctor will explain this to them in&#xD;
      more detail, and they will be required to sign a separate consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Fludarabine and cytarabine are FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of leukemia. Erwinase is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for use in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Its use in this study is&#xD;
      investigational. The combination of these drugs is investigational. The study doctor can&#xD;
      explain how the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;
