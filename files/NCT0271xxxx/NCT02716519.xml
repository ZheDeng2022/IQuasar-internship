    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the comparative effectiveness of SANTYL® versus standard of&#xD;
      care in the treatment of pressure ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers within the continuum of&#xD;
      care of an ACO. After meeting study criteria, participants will be randomly assigned to apply&#xD;
      Santyl or standard care to their pressure ulcer or diabetic foot ulcer for up to 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for one year from the date of randomization to assess ulcer&#xD;
      status and ulcer complications.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provide written informed consent, which will consist of reading, signing, and dating&#xD;
             the informed consent document after the Investigator, sub-Investigator or other&#xD;
             designated study staff member has explained the study procedures, risks, and contact&#xD;
             information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Eighteen (18) years of age or older, of either sex, and of any race or skin type.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Willing and able to make all required study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Able to follow instructions and perform the dressing changes at home or have a&#xD;
             caregiver who can perform the dressing changes according to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is currently being treated in an in-patient acute care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing to use an appropriate off-loading device to keep weight off of foot ulcers;&#xD;
             currently receiving adequate pressure redistribution according to local protocol in&#xD;
             the affected area for pressure ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. For DFU: An ulcer present on any part of the plantar surface of the foot or plantar&#xD;
             surface of the hallux which is 0.5 cm2 - 10 cm2 inclusive (as measured at the&#xD;
             Screening Visit using the ARANZ Silhouette imaging device).&#xD;
&#xD;
             For PU: Stage II-IV ulcer that is 1 cm2 to 64 cm2 inclusive (as measured at the&#xD;
             Screening Visit using the ARANZ Silhouette imaging device).&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Subjects may have more than one ulcer without limitation on the ulcer burden, but&#xD;
             only one qualifying ulcer per subject will be selected for the study (selection based&#xD;
             on greatest clinical need, as determined by the Investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For lower extremity ulcers: Adequate arterial blood flow as evidenced by an ankle&#xD;
             brachial index (ABI) of &gt; 0.70 and ≤ 1.2. If ABI &gt; 1.2, perfusion at or near the site&#xD;
             of the ulcer must be confirmed: i.e., the foot is warm to the touch and has palpable&#xD;
             pulses. Availability of an ABI completed within the 90 days of Screening is&#xD;
             acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Separation of at least 5 cm (closest ulcer edge to other closest ulcer edge) as&#xD;
             measured using the ARANZ Silhouette imaging device if ≥ 2 ulcers are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Target ulcer is not infected based on clinical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Contraindications or hypersensitivity to the use of clostridial collagenase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participation in another clinical trial within thirty (30) days of Screening, or&#xD;
             planned participation overlapping with this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Bleeding disorder that would preclude sharp debridement during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active cellulitis of the target ulcer, lymphangitic streaking, deep tissue abscess, or&#xD;
             infection of muscle, tendon, joint or bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Co-morbidities leading to systemic organ dysfunction or severe single- or multi-organ&#xD;
             failure that in the opinion of the Investigator would preclude safe subject&#xD;
             participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A target ulcer which involves the underlying tissues of tendon.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease, leukocyte adhesion defects, or severe&#xD;
             neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Current treatment (at the time of the Screening Visit) with any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids. If corticosteroid treatment was for ≥ 10 days, there&#xD;
                  must be a 1 week interval between discontinuation and screening.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Systemic antibiotic therapy for acute wound-related infection&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Topical antibiotic treatment of the target ulcer&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Treatment of target ulcer with bioactive therapies within 1 month of screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet-derived growth factor (e.g., Regranex)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cellular or Tissue-based Products (e.g., Apligraf, Dermagraft, Integra, Oasis,&#xD;
                  etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Amniotic membrane products (e.g., EpiFix, Grafix, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Prior treatment of target ulcer for any length of time with CCO (SANTYL) within 30&#xD;
             days of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any prior radiation therapy to the affected area&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Medical or physical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude&#xD;
             safe subject participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Blood counts and blood chemistry values as follows:&#xD;
