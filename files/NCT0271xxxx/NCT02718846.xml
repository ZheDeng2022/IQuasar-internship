        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  20 - 80 years of age (in full)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A definite Meniere's disease patient according to the diagnostic criteria of AAO-HNS&#xD;
             (1995), who has had 2 or more episodes of rotary dizziness lasting more than 20&#xD;
             minutes within the last 3 months (12 weeks) and 1 or more episodes of hearing loss&#xD;
             recorded by audiometry, and has tinnitus or ear fullness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For female subjects with the possibility of pregnancy during the study period, a&#xD;
             subject whose urine pregnancy test result was negative at the time of the screening&#xD;
             visit. A subject in menopause for at least one year, one who has no possibility to&#xD;
             become pregnant through surgery, or one who effectively uses an acceptable&#xD;
             contraceptive measure. A subject who definitely agreed to use an adequate&#xD;
             contraceptive measure during the clinical study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient with the history of ear surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient with the history of endolymphatic sac surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient who used steroids or gentamycin in the eardrum within the last 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient to whom Isobide was administered within 3 months at the time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient who has an infection in the ear, paranasal sinuses or the upper airway&#xD;
             system&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient who has a disease, other than Meniere's disease, that manifests as&#xD;
             repetitive dizziness (e.g. Migrainous vertigo, vertebrobasilar transient ischemic&#xD;
             attack, acoustic neuroma)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient who has acute intracranial hematoma (If this drug is administered to a&#xD;
             patient suspected of having an acute intracranial hematoma without checking for the&#xD;
             existence of an intracranial hematoma, bleeding that had been stopped temporarily by&#xD;
             brain pressure can occur again when intracranial pressure is reduced. Thus, eliminate&#xD;
             the cause of bleeding and administer the drug after ensuring that there are no&#xD;
             concerns of rebleeding)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient with anuria (with urinary output of less than 100 mL/day)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A severely dehydrated patient (loss of 10% or more of body weight)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient with acute pulmonary edema&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or higher)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A patient with pheochromocytoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient who is hypersensitive to the ingredients of the test and control drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient with a hereditary disease such as galactose intolerance, Lapp lactose&#xD;
             deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman who is pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
