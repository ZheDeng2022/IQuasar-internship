      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers want to better understand the body s immune response to calorie restriction. To&#xD;
      do this, they are asking healthy volunteers to fast for 24 hours. Researchers will test&#xD;
      immune response before and after fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the benefits of calorie restriction on immune health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers ages 21 to 37 with a body mass index between 22 and 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit NIH after an overnight fast. Their baseline immune response will be&#xD;
      taken. They will give blood and urine samples. Then they will be given breakfast. This visit&#xD;
      will take about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for the next 24 hours. They&#xD;
      will return to NIH the next morning. Their immune response will be taken. They will give&#xD;
      blood and urine samples. Then they will be given breakfast. Their immune response will be&#xD;
      taken 3 hours later. They will give a blood sample. This visit will take about 4 hours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intermittent caloric restricted or fasting has numerous health effects including the&#xD;
      reduction in numerous cardiovascular and pulmonary disease risk factors. The cellular&#xD;
      programs activated by caloric restriction are similarly regulated in preclinical and clinical&#xD;
      studies in response to a 24-hour fast. We have found that a beneficial effect of a 24-hour&#xD;
      fasting blunts the activation of a component of the innate immune system, termed the NLRP3&#xD;
      inflammasome. This inflammasome, as a mediator of sterile inflammation, is associated with&#xD;
      the development of diabetes, asthma and atherosclerosis. At the same time, we found that&#xD;
      refeeding after the 24-hour fast significantly increased NLRP3 protein levels. As NLRP3 is&#xD;
      increased in obesity, the nutrient intervention (24 hour fast and then refeeding) we studied&#xD;
      may be useful to evaluate nutrient-overload effects on the immune system. Pertaining to this&#xD;
      it has recently been found in a preclinical study that NLRP3 can also orchestrate&#xD;
      differentiation of na(SqrRoot) ve T cells into T(H)2 cells. Interestingly both the NLRP3&#xD;
      inflammasome and T(H)2 cell activation contribute to asthma. In this context we hypothesize&#xD;
      that the assessment of the effect on refeeding on T(H)2 cell differentiation (polarity) may&#xD;
      allow us to dissect out the mechanisms underpinning nutrient overload induced T(H)2 cell&#xD;
      activation. To evaluate this blood samples to test T-cell biology will be collected in&#xD;
      subjects, at baseline, after a fixed caloric meal and in response to a 24-hour fast (water&#xD;
      intake will not be restricted). The objective of this pilot study is to identify if&#xD;
      nutrient-load regulates T-Cell differentiation capacity and to test whether this pathway&#xD;
      could be investigated as a therapeutic target to blunt/negate the inflammation associated&#xD;
      with nutrient-excess associated diseases including asthma.&#xD;
