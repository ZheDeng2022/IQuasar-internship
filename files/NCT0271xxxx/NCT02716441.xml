      This proposal's objective is to challenge and expand the current definition of rotator cuff&#xD;
      healing by investigating tendon retraction - broadly defined as medial translation of the&#xD;
      repaired tendon away from the bone with or without a defect - as a common and clinically&#xD;
      predictive structural outcome following rotator cuff repair. The investigators' central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that failure with continuity is a common yet unrecognized structural phenomenon&#xD;
      of rotator cuff healing that is significantly and meaningfully correlated with clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. The investigators' approach is to characterize tendon retraction using an array of&#xD;
      implanted radio-opaque markers, and investigate its relationship to pre-operative tissue&#xD;
      quality (MRI), post-operative repair structural integrity (MRI) and clinical outcomes in a&#xD;
      125-patient prospective cohort study. These patients will complete (1) validated&#xD;
      questionnaires and range of motion testing pre-operatively, (2) CT imaging at day of surgery,&#xD;
      3 weeks, and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-operatively, (3) MRI at 3 weeks and 3, 6, 12 and 24&#xD;
      months post-operatively and (4) questionnaires, range of motion and strength testing at 3, 6,&#xD;
      12 and 24 months post-operatively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, rotator cuff healing is defined as &quot;intact&quot;, &quot;attenuated&quot;, or &quot;failed&quot; based on&#xD;
      the observation (or not) of a recurrent defect (i.e., a &quot;gap&quot;) in the tendon using MRI or&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging. The investigators' previous work has identified a new outcome, in which&#xD;
      there is no detectable defect or &quot;gap&quot; in the repaired tendon, but the repaired tendon has&#xD;
      undergone significant retraction. The investigators call this outcome &quot;failure with&#xD;
      continuity&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current imaging methods are inadequate to determine the extent to which the repaired rotator&#xD;
      cuff tendon has &quot;failed with continuity&quot;. The investigators have developed an imaging&#xD;
      technique to detect this phenomenon. Specifically, radio-opaque markers are sutured onto the&#xD;
      repaired tendon. The distance between the tendon markers and the bone is measured from CT&#xD;
      scans taken within 2 weeks of surgery, and compared to the distance measured at 3, 6, 12 and&#xD;
      24 months. If the tendon retracts away from the bone during healing, this distance will&#xD;
      increase over time. Healing of the tendon will also be monitored in the traditional manner by&#xD;
      MRI scans at the same time points. The investigators will investigate the relationship&#xD;
      between tendon retraction, MR imaging and clinical outcomes including shoulder strength and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to show that tendon retraction is common, occurs early&#xD;
      post-operatively, with or without repair continuity as assessed by traditional imaging, and&#xD;
      significantly correlates with clinical outcomes. The immediate and highly significant&#xD;
      consequence of this finding would be a paradigm shift in the investigators' understanding of&#xD;
      tendon repair healing, now incorporating the magnitude, timing and location of tendon&#xD;
      retraction as well as the continuity of the repaired tissue. This information would yield a&#xD;
      more precise understanding of rotator cuff tendon healing, allowing for advances in treatment&#xD;
      strategies that improve surgical healing and clinical outcomes and result in more durable&#xD;
      rotator cuff repairs over time.&#xD;
