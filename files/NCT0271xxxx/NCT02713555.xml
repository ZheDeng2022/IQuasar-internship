      Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgery (RYGB) ameliorates type 2 diabetes within days after&#xD;
      surgery. Studies indicate that the gastric sleeve procedure has comparable effect on type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, but to what extent and how is not fully elucidated. This study investigates the&#xD;
      effect of the surgeries on incretin levels, glucose effectiveness and hepatic insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity.&#xD;

      Introduction This study comprises of a series of studies in morbidly obese subjects with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes before and after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgery (RYGB) and the gastric sleeve&#xD;
      procedure, investigating the effect of these surgeries on incretin levels and hepatic insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity. The method study (study 2) seeks to validate a better and physiological method&#xD;
      to investigate insulin sensitivity in morbidly obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RYGB is considered the most effective treatment for obesity. The procedure improves glycemic&#xD;
      control, and patients with type 2 diabetes may experience reductions in antidiabetic&#xD;
      medication within days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The improvement in glucose tolerance is associated with enhanced insulin action in muscle and&#xD;
      adipose tissues. Recent reports indicate that hepatic insulin resistance also is improved,&#xD;
      but the contribution of increased hepatic insulin action on glucose tolerance is&#xD;
      controversial and remains to be thoroughly investigated. Studies indicate that RYGB reduces&#xD;
      basal glucose production, and at 1 week following surgery hepatic insulin resistance is&#xD;
      improved and insulin clearance increased. In contrast, insulin sensitivity in extra-hepatic&#xD;
      tissues is not increased until 3 months after surgery. These observations imply that the&#xD;
      liver plays an important role for early improvements in carbohydrate metabolism after RYBG,&#xD;
      while increased insulin sensitivity in extra-hepatic tissues (muscle and adipose tissues) is&#xD;
      delayed and more closely related to weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects of hepatic insulin sensitivity on glucose tolerance in obese subjects has in previous&#xD;
      studies been addressed. However, dose response curves that determines time-dependent changes&#xD;
      in hepatic insulin action are important for understanding the pathophysiology of glucose&#xD;
      intolerance in obese subjects after RYGB, have not yet been conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of a valid easy procedure that estimates insulin sensitivity at the same time&#xD;
      the effect of the incretin hormones can be studied is of great value in especially RYGB&#xD;
      operated patients where the secretion of hormones has been altered by the procedure.&#xD;
      Understanding the impact of incretin hormones and hepatic insulin resistance on glucose&#xD;
      intolerance may have implications for the medical treatment of obese patients, and may&#xD;
      potentially predict which subset of patients are likely to experience the greatest benefits&#xD;
      of RYGB or gastric sleeve surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, a recent report indicates that the gastric sleeve procedure, where the stomach is&#xD;
      reduced in size, elicits the same incretin response as RYGB, although no gastro-entero or&#xD;
      entero-entero anastomosis are formed. Also the procedure is reported to have a profound&#xD;
      effect on glucose intolerance. The mechanisms behind this have not yet been clarified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elucidation of these mechanisms will provide knowledge about body weight regulation and the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, and could help to identify new drug targets, improved&#xD;
      study methods and surgical techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the proposed PhD experiments are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the contribution of hepatic insulin resistance to glucose intolerance in&#xD;
           morbidly obese subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine to what extent increased hepatic insulin sensitivity contributes to&#xD;
           normalization of glucose intolerance after RYGB and the gastric sleeve procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine metabolic markers of defects in carbohydrate metabolism that may help to&#xD;
           identify which patients are likely to benefit from RYGB or gastric sleeve. Indices will&#xD;
           be determined based on a modified minimal model analysis of oral glucose tolerance test&#xD;
           (OGTT) data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine whether the minimal model behind the dynamic estimates of the OGTT can be&#xD;
      further developed by simple addition of the two 2 tracer technique, when compared with data&#xD;
      from the IVGTT and two step euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1: The first of the proposed series of experiments attempts to determine how RYGB and&#xD;
      the gastric sleeve procedure improves hepatic insulin resistance and if so how this affects&#xD;
      glucose intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol is comprised of&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An insulin-modified oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or a standard oral glucose&#xD;
           tolerance test with double stable isotope tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An insulin-modified intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) with radioactive tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic glucose clamp with radioactive tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OGTT, IVGTT and the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp will be performed, prior&#xD;
      to RYGB/gastric sleeve (usual care) and at 1, and 12 months following surgery (after&#xD;
      intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver biopsy will be performed at surgery, to assess liver steatosis and the effect of the&#xD;
      obesity on liver insulin resistance and clearance. The effect over time of RYGB and gastric&#xD;
      sleeve surgery will be assessed through secondary markers of liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2: The method study will be conducted in order to compare the indices from the two&#xD;
      tracer OGTT to the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp and the insulin-modified&#xD;
      intravenous glucose tolerance test to assess the estimates of insulin sensitivity and insulin&#xD;
      clearance. The subjects will also serve as a normal metabolic reference group for study 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol is comprised of&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An insulin-modified oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with double stable isotope&#xD;
           tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An insulin-modified intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) with radioactive tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic glucose clamp with radioactive tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For study 1 and 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect calorimetry will be assessed to determine changes in non-oxidative glucose disposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans will be performed to assess changes in fat and&#xD;
      fat-free mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size calculation has been performed to determine the number of study subjects&#xD;
      required to obtain a statistical difference between groups. The calculation was performed&#xD;
      based on the mean and standard deviation of the area above baseline calculation of glucose&#xD;
      concentrations obtained during an OGTT in healthy subjects i.e. 290Â±217 mmol/L x min. The&#xD;
      calculation was performed based on the following assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A difference in glucose tolerance in healthy controls and obese study subjects during&#xD;
           the OGTT of 90% (unpaired analysis) and an improvement in glucose tolerance at 12 months&#xD;
           after surgery in obese subjects of 50% (paired analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Power of the analysis: 80%&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Level of significance: 5% Based on these assumptions the sample size calculations&#xD;
           require that 9 healthy subjects and 9 obese subjects undergoing RYGB or gastric sleeve&#xD;
           need to successfully complete the full study program. To correct for an anticipated&#xD;
           dropout rate during the studies a total of 12 obese for each surgical group and 12&#xD;
           healthy subjects will be recruited for the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Calculations&#xD;
&#xD;
      A biobank will be opened at V laboratory Aarhus University hospital in an appropriate&#xD;
      freezer. The material will be analyzed in small batches in order to avoid inter assay&#xD;
      differences. The liver biopsy will be examined for histology the same day. After the project&#xD;
      has come to an end any leftover material (blood or tissue) will be placed in a biobank for&#xD;
      further research, should this prove valid and the research subject accept. Urine samples will&#xD;
      be analyzed immediately and not preserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oral glucose and C-peptide minimal model analysis of the OGTT data will yield indices for&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function (dynamic and static component), glucose effectiveness&#xD;
      and hepatic insulin extraction. The disposition index i.e. the product of insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      and beta cell function will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracer determined rates of glucose production and uptake will be calculated using the&#xD;
      equations for non-steady state. The volume of distribution of glucose will be assumed to be&#xD;
      200 ml/kg and a pool correction factor of 0.65 will be used in the calculations. Glucose&#xD;
      specific activity will be calculated as the ratio between the tracer contraction and the&#xD;
      prevailing plasma glucose concentration. The Hot Ginf technique will be used to maintain&#xD;
      constant specific activities throughout the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effect and risks&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients and the metabolic controls subject will be exposed to radiation from the&#xD;
      examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study subjects will be exposed to some radiation which will enhances their risk for a&#xD;
      non-curable cancer from 25% to 25,005%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total amount of blood drawn 3-6 months prior to surgery is approximately 392 ml. Blood loss&#xD;
      during surgery amounts to no more than 10-20 ml in general. Should complications such as&#xD;
      infection or bleeding arise following surgery the patient will be excluded from the study. In&#xD;
      the case of a minor perioperative bleeding the patient will be treated and observed according&#xD;
      to surgical principles and the following study days 1 month later postponed if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 1 and 3 months after surgery 356 ml blood will be drawn. The patient will again be&#xD;
      examined 12 months after surgery and 383 ml blood is drawn including blood samples for the&#xD;
      endocrinology follow up-visit. All patients are substituted with iron and B12 vitamin from&#xD;
      inclusion in the study and will prior to studies be examined with a spot hemoglobin (HB).&#xD;
      Should the HB &lt; 6,5 mmol/ l the study will be postponed for 3-5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The liver biopsy during surgery leads to a minimal enhanced risk for bleeding and gall leak&#xD;
      perioperative, but does not enhance the risk of the surgery in general. After the operation&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes are observed in the anesthesia postoperative ward and when&#xD;
      ready (blood pressure, heart rate and pain under control) transferred to the surgical&#xD;
      department for the first 24 hours and will here also be observed for changes in vital&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation will be provided in accordance with the guidelines from the local ethics&#xD;
      committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      When appropriate a paired Student's t test will be used to test for statistical difference. A&#xD;
      non-parametric two sample analysis will be used for data not fulfilling the criteria for&#xD;
      normal distribution. P &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. ANOVA analysis&#xD;
      aiming to detect difference in metabolic response between groups will be performed when&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariate analysis will be performed to determine which indices are likely to be&#xD;
      associated with the most favorable outcome. The analysis will be performed to assess which&#xD;
      subset of obese subjects are most likely to benefit from the surgical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above study plan will shed new light on the livers impact on diabetes, obesity and the&#xD;
      significant effect of RYGB and gastric sleeve surgery on blood sugar control. The gastric&#xD;
      sleeve surgery entails less risk for complications during and after surgery, should the&#xD;
      procedure show comparable results with RYGB it can potentially benefit more patients planned&#xD;
      for bariatric surgery. We also aim to validate an easy conductible and physiological method&#xD;
      for obtaining reliable estimates of glucose kinetics. This can potentially lead to more&#xD;
      specific diagnosis of for instance pancreatic islet cell function or hepatic insulin&#xD;
      resistance, and thereby improve medical treatment of type 2 diabetes. The study also aims to&#xD;
      identify biomarkers that can help to predict, which patients will benefit the most RYGB and&#xD;
      gastric sleeve surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All result, positive, negative or inconclusive will be published. We expect, at minimum to&#xD;
      produce 4 articles, which will be accepted at international recognized magazines and 1 PhD&#xD;
      thesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is comprised of validated methods. Overall society, patients and future patient&#xD;
      will benefit from the new insights into liver physiology in the state of obesity and diabetes&#xD;
      before and after bariatric surgery. Future patients will also benefit from the new insights&#xD;
      into the effects of the gastric sleeve surgery that entails less risk for complications. This&#xD;
      can lead to improved treatments and more carefully selection of patient elective for surgery.&#xD;
      The overall benefits for patients, future patients and society outweigh the risk and side&#xD;
      effects the subjects endure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Danish data agency has approved the study and the regional ethics committee is processing&#xD;
      the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study completion&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed studies will be performed in collaboration between Hospital Unit Midt,&#xD;
      Department of General Surgery where RYGB and gastric sleeve is performed. The glucose clamp&#xD;
      studies will be performed at The Medical Research Lab, Departments of Medicine M and V,&#xD;
      Aarhus University Hospital. All studies will be performed or supervised by PhD student&#xD;
      Katrine Brodersen or Doctor of Medical Science Michael Festersen Nielsen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding&#xD;
&#xD;
      All costs not covered by ongoing external funding will be covered by Hospital Unit Midt.&#xD;
      Neither the PhD student nor the supervisor have any relations with the private foundations&#xD;
      and nothing to declare.&#xD;
