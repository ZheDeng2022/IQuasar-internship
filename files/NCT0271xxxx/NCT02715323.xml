      Ocular surface disease, especially dry eye and scleritis, commonly affects patients with&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases. Ocular surface immune cells are increased in autoimmune disease; however&#xD;
      the full subset of immune cells activated is unknown. Recent experimental studies show that&#xD;
      dendritic cells and T cells in the cornea are critically associated with corneal nerve&#xD;
      innervation. Corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) allows rapid non-invasive in vivo imaging of&#xD;
      dendritic cells and corneal nerves. The investigators propose to investigate how ocular&#xD;
      surface health, conjunctival immune cells and corneal nerve/dendritic cell morphology&#xD;
      interact in 3 rheumatological conditions: Sjogren's syndrome (SS), Rheumatoid arthritis (RA),&#xD;
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preliminary flow cytometric studies show that various immune cells (eg: T cells, B cells,&#xD;
      and dendritic cells) can be quantified using minimally invasive impression membranes&#xD;
      (Eyeprim). Clinically, the research team is experienced in measuring features of ocular&#xD;
      surface inflammation (conjunctival redness, tear breakup times) with Oculus keratograph5M.&#xD;
      The investigators also aim to harvest conjunctival immune cells using impression cytology and&#xD;
      quantify specific cell types with flow cytometry. Corneal nerve morphology and dendritic cell&#xD;
      density and distribution will be assessed using CCM; in collaboration with the group who have&#xD;
      pioneered this technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator anticipate that alterations in corneal nerve and dendritic cell parameters&#xD;
      will correlate with immune activation/inflammation, deterioration of tear function and&#xD;
      increased systemic severity of the rheumatological disease. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the lower the corneal nerve density, the higher the number of corneal&#xD;
      dendritic cells and conjunctival inflammatory cells. Studying these relationships may allow a&#xD;
      better mechanistic understanding of local corneal and systemic immune activation and the&#xD;
      development of a non-invasive ophthalmic surrogate marker of dendritic cell activation and&#xD;
      nerve fibre loss to aid earlier diagnosis, risk stratification and the development of new&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 General Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ocular surface disease, especially dry eye and scleritis, commonly affects patients with&#xD;
           autoimmune diseases. Ocular surface immune cells are increased in autoimmune disease;&#xD;
           however the full subset of immune cells activated is unknown. Recent experimental&#xD;
           studies show that dendritic cells and T cells in the cornea are critically associated&#xD;
           with corneal nerve innervation. Corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) allows rapid&#xD;
           non-invasive in vivo imaging of dendritic cells and corneal nerves. The investigators&#xD;
           propose to investigate how ocular surface health, conjunctival immune cells and corneal&#xD;
           nerve/dendritic cell morphology interact in 3 rheumatological conditions: Sjogren's&#xD;
           syndrome (SS), Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The preliminary flow cytometric studies show that various immune cells (eg: T cells, B&#xD;
           cells, and dendritic cells) can be quantified using minimally invasive impression&#xD;
           membranes (Eyeprim). Clinically, the research team is experienced in measuring features&#xD;
           of ocular surface inflammation (conjunctival redness, tear breakup times) with Oculus&#xD;
           keratograph5M. The investigators also aim to harvest conjunctival immune cells using&#xD;
           impression cytology and quantify specific cell types with flow cytometry. Corneal nerve&#xD;
           morphology and dendritic cell density and distribution will be assessed using CCM; in&#xD;
           collaboration with the group who have pioneered this technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Investigators anticipate that alterations in corneal nerve and dendritic cell parameters&#xD;
           will correlate with immune activation/inflammation, deterioration of tear function and&#xD;
           increased systemic severity of the rheumatological disease. In addition, the&#xD;
           investigator hypothesize that the lower the corneal nerve density, the higher the number&#xD;
           of corneal dendritic cells and conjunctival inflammatory cells. Studying these&#xD;
           relationships may allow a better mechanistic understanding of local corneal and systemic&#xD;
           immune activation and the development of a non-invasive ophthalmic surrogate marker of&#xD;
           dendritic cell activation and nerve fibre loss to aid earlier diagnosis, risk&#xD;
           stratification and the development of new therapies in our autoimmune patients with&#xD;
           severe dry eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Rational for the Study Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dry eye, a type of chronic ocular surface inflammation, is highly prevalent and&#xD;
           contributes to corneal blindness and imposes a severe health burden. Scleritis is ocular&#xD;
           surface inflammatory disorder associated with mild to severe inflammation of the sclera&#xD;
           with or without intraocular inflammation. Severe dry eye or scleritis is associated with&#xD;
           autoimmune diseases like SS, RA, SLE, and other conditions. Current treatment of dry eye&#xD;
           is often not effective enough (eg., cyclosporine) or causes adverse effects (eg.,&#xD;
           corticosteroid-induced glaucoma). In autoimmune dry eye, there is immune-mediated damage&#xD;
           to the ocular surface and the lacrimal gland. In various models of dry eye disease, it&#xD;
           has been shown that components of the immune system such as T cells, macrophages and&#xD;
           cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α are critical for&#xD;
           triggering and maintaining this disease. Likewise treatment of non-infective sclerits is&#xD;
           a very challenging situation to all uveitis specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ocular surface immune cells are increased when autoimmune disease is present, either the&#xD;
           proportion or number of a particular type of immune cell, eg. monocytes or CD4+ T cells&#xD;
           may be increased in the presence of more severe local inflammation and/or systemic&#xD;
           activity. A signature of immune cell infiltration may be present in a particular&#xD;
           rheumatological condition. If certain types of cells, (e.g., T cells or B cells) are&#xD;
           predominant in the systemic disease, it suggests that a T cell approach (e.g.,&#xD;
           tacrolimus) or B cell approach (e.g., rituxamab) may be used. Alternatively, if certain&#xD;
           cytokines play a major role in dry eye, an inhibitor of cytokine signalling such as a&#xD;
           JAK inhibitor may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recent studies have shown that dendritic cells and T cells in the cornea are critically&#xD;
           associated with corneal nerve innervation [1, 2]. This has been shown in both human and&#xD;
           animal studies [1-4]. At the same time, the technology for in vivo imaging of human&#xD;
           corneal nerves and dendritic cells and their quantification have greatly improved&#xD;
           recently. This has led to an explosion of interest in harnessing this technology as a&#xD;
           surrogate marker for peripheral neuropathies and to explore underlying mechanisms&#xD;
           [5-27]. The investigators have previously shown that first generation CCM can quantify&#xD;
           the presence and density of Langerhans cells (LCs) in Bowman's layer of the cornea in&#xD;
           patients with diabetes [28]. However the latest 3rd generation HRT III can be used to&#xD;
           classify and quantify Langerhans cells (LCs) into a mature phenotype (dendritic cell&#xD;
           bearing long processes) or an immature phenotype (non-dendritic cell lacking cell&#xD;
           dendrites) to provide insight into immune alterations in vivo [29]. A recent&#xD;
           experimental study in diabetic mice has used CCM to show that direct contact between DCs&#xD;
           and the corneal nerves may trigger nerve fiber damage [30].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Gap in scientific knowledge: Researchers have shown that proinflammatory cytokines are&#xD;
           elevated in tears of humans with dry eye; many of these may be secreted by immune cells.&#xD;
           They found in preliminary flow cytometric studies that CD4+ T cells, CD19+ B cells,&#xD;
           CD14+ monocytes, CD1c dendritic cells can be quantified using minimally invasive&#xD;
           impression membranes (Eyeprim)[31]. The full subset of immune cells activated in the&#xD;
           ocular surface in dry eye, and in various rheumatological conditions, is not known. The&#xD;
           proportions of these cells in different severity of dry eye and different systemic&#xD;
           activity of autoimmune disease have not been evaluated. Furthermore, it is uncertain&#xD;
           whether the integrity of cornea innervation is also a determinant of tear function in&#xD;
           patients with autoimmune systemic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The research group has undertaken many clinical trials and imaging studies of the human&#xD;
           ocular surface. This includes measurements with Oculus (non-invasive tear breakup&#xD;
           times), staining, etc., and the measurement of cytokines using the multiplex bead based&#xD;
           sandwich immunofluorescence assay[32-38]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Preliminary Studies The research group has also optimized Eyeprim collection of&#xD;
           conjunctival immune cells and method of analysis using a panel of immune markers with&#xD;
           Amnis [31], a relatively new type of flow cytometry (Figure 1) coupled with microscopy&#xD;
           (Figure 2). The advantage of the Amnis technique is the direct visualization of analyzed&#xD;
           cells to permit co-localisation of signals. They have published on the validity of the&#xD;
           cell morphological parameter analysis using the Amnis software, compared to a human&#xD;
           grader [31]. In addition, they have also used conventional flow cytometry (BD FACS) to&#xD;
           quantify CD3, CD4, CD8, CCR7, CXCR3, CD109 and CD63 staining (data not shown).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In collaboration with the ENA team, their team has been trained in image acquisition&#xD;
           using CCM to enable quantification of corneal nerves and dendritic cells [1, 2, 4, 9,&#xD;
           10, 13, 14, 16, 21, 27](Figure 3). Sub-basal corneal nerve fibre density, corneal nerve&#xD;
           branch density, corneal nerve fibre length and tortuosity (Figure 3, 4) will be&#xD;
           quantified using both manual (CCMetrics) and automated (ACCMetrics) image analysis&#xD;
           software, developed by the ENA team. Sub-basal mature and immature dendritic cell&#xD;
           density and distribution in relation to corneal nerves will be quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The collaborators, Prof Malik and Dr. Petropoulos are leading the Early neuropathy&#xD;
           assessment (ENA team-http://qatar-weill.cornell.edu/research/faculty/eng/index.html) and&#xD;
           have pioneered the use of in vivo CCM as a rapid, non-invasive ophthalmic instrument to&#xD;
           monitor diabetic and other peripheral neuropathies. They will actively engage in&#xD;
           training and overseeing optimal image capture and will provide the necessary software&#xD;
           and licensing privileges to enable detailed quantification and interpretation [9, 10,&#xD;
           12-14, 16, 17, 20, 21, 23-27].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES Overall long term objective: Discover safe and effective&#xD;
           treatment for ocular surface inflammation and define the ocular surface indications for&#xD;
           clinical usage of medications targeting the immune system in rheumatological disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical / Healthcare implications: There are many benefits in using CCM in autoimmune&#xD;
           disease. CCM allows rapid, non-invasive imaging of the corneal nerves and dendritic&#xD;
           cells to determine the level of inflammation and its consequence in autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
           This will allow earlier diagnosis, risk stratification and more timely intervention at&#xD;
           the rheumatology clinics, enhancing multidisciplinary care of autoimmune patients. The&#xD;
           investigator will build a normative database (either ethnic or local age specific data&#xD;
           from a reading centre) by using this study as a platform to recruit more patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Basic science implications: Advance understanding of relationship between corneal nerves&#xD;
           and tear function/immunology.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Short term objectives: researchers propose a nationwide study in collaboration with Tan&#xD;
           Tock Seng Hospital to study clinical features and conjunctival immune cells in patients&#xD;
           with ocular surface inflammatory disease with or without associated systemic autoimmune&#xD;
           or collagen vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Academic objectives: Aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Enhance multidisciplinary collaborations, between SERI and S Albani from STIIC&#xD;
                (cell analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Build new collaborations (TTSH ophthalmologist Dr R Agrawal)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Increase value/synergy from currently approved funding: SERI pilot grant&#xD;
                (recruitment of pilot participants and optimization of tools),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compete for future funding, NMRC STAR award, CS or CBIRG.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Expected findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Different systemic severities of the rheumatological diseases, symptoms of dry eye,&#xD;
                tear function, NIKBUT and corneal staining may correlate with corneal nerve and&#xD;
                dendritic/non-dendritic cell defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tear cytokines may correlate with corneal nerve and dendritic/non-dendritic cell&#xD;
                defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change in the density and subtypes of T cells or other cells such as dendritic in&#xD;
                the conjunctiva (impression cytology) may correlate with corneal nerve and&#xD;
                dendritic/non-dendritic cell defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits: 2.3.1 Potential Risks&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  It is possible that there may be some slight discomfort during the sampling of&#xD;
                conjunctival cells using the impression membrane&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Some slight discomfort or redness from tear fluid collection (Schirmer test)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Rarely a corneal epithelial defect may occur from in vivo confocal microscopy, but&#xD;
                this generally heals in 1-2 days. Corneal epithelial defect means that a layer of&#xD;
                the cornea is broken, liken to what happened during an abrasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stinging sensation as a result of local anaesthetic (Alcaine)&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3.2 Potential Benefits With greater understanding of the presence of various&#xD;
           inflammatory mediators, the investigators can gain further insight into the complex&#xD;
           process taking place in autoimmune diseases patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
