    <textblock>
      In recent years, Hong Kong has been undergoing rapid changes with macro social and economic&#xD;
      trends. The increasingly complex and diverse family structure contribute to concerns&#xD;
      regarding the well-being of families in Hong Kong, including their health, happiness and&#xD;
      harmony (FAMILY 3Hs). Family life and health education should be strengthened to meet the&#xD;
      increasing needs of promoting healthy active lifestyle among Hong Kong families. In this&#xD;
      connection, the FAMILY Project initiates the Fitter Families Project (FFP) with a focus on&#xD;
      &quot;FAMILY Holistic Health&quot;, will be conducted in order to increase the awareness of the&#xD;
      importance of FAMILY 3Hs. FFP is a community-based research project with 3 main components -&#xD;
      train-the-trainers programs, community-based family interventions and public education&#xD;
      events. It is expected that trainees from the train-the-trainers programs will acquire&#xD;
      adequate skills to organize community-based health education programs effectively.&#xD;
      Participants of the community-based family interventions will gain knowledge on family&#xD;
      holistic health and live a healthy active lifestyle. Attendees of the public education events&#xD;
      will become more aware of the importance of FAMILY 3Hs.&#xD;

      In 2011, United Nations (UN) addressed the prevention and control of four non-communicable&#xD;
      diseases (NCDs: cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus) worldwide. The UN, in its Political Declaration, recognized the critical importance&#xD;
      of reducing the exposure to the common modifiable risk factors for NCDs, namely, tobacco use,&#xD;
      unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and the harmful use of alcohol. In Hong Kong, NCDs are&#xD;
      responsible for more than 85% of all deaths and most of these are preventable. FAMILY Project&#xD;
      Cohort Study (2014) also found that 88.6% of Hong Kong people had inadequate vegetable and&#xD;
      fruit intake, 70.6% had inadequate physical exercise, 26.4% were overweight and 5.4% were&#xD;
      obese. Hong Kong, being the most westernized and developed city of China, can take a leading&#xD;
      role in promoting and implementing the UN Political Declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families worldwide have been undergoing rapid changes with macro, social and economic trends.&#xD;
      Demographic shifts, economic upheavals, changing societal norms and values, immigration&#xD;
      across national borders and migration within nations are creating new and altered structures,&#xD;
      processes and relationships within families. The increasingly complex and diverse family&#xD;
      structure contributes to concerns regarding the well-being of families in Hong Kong,&#xD;
      including their health, happiness and harmony (FAMILY 3Hs). Family life and health education&#xD;
      should be strengthened to meet the increasing needs of promoting healthy lifestyle among Hong&#xD;
      Kong families. The results from the baseline findings of FAMILY Project Cohort Study (2014)&#xD;
      revealed that only 27.9% of the participants considered themselves to be 'happy', while 15.6%&#xD;
      of the participants were classified as 'unhappy'. Nearly one-third (30.7%) of the&#xD;
      participants reported having experienced at least one stressful life event in the previous&#xD;
      year due to heavier workload (10.8%), serious health problems of a family member (6.8%),&#xD;
      worsening financial situation (6.2%), health problems of oneself (5.1%), or death of a family&#xD;
      member (4.7%). Furthermore, more than half of the participants (52.5%) reported having some&#xD;
      source of dyadic conflicts with family members. In response to these changes in the contexts&#xD;
      and nature of the family, the Fitter Families Project (FFP) with a focus on &quot;FAMILY Holistic&#xD;
      Health&quot;, will be conducted in order to increase the awareness of the importance of FAMILY&#xD;
      3Hs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several definitions of family health. On the functional level, the terms family&#xD;
      health, family functioning, and healthy family are often used interchangeably. Family health&#xD;
      has been described as complex system, interactions, relationships and processes with the&#xD;
      potential to enhance both well-being and the entire household's health, and routines in the&#xD;
      family may affect family health. Despite the different perspectives in the definitions,&#xD;
      family health should be holistically defined, encompass both wellness and illness variables&#xD;
      and focus on the interactive, developmental, functional, psychosocial, and health processes&#xD;
      of family experience. Therefore, family health may be described as a dynamic process that&#xD;
      maintains or changes the relative state of well-being, including elements of family systems,&#xD;
      such as biological, psychological, spiritual, and sociocultural aspects. Hence, the FFP&#xD;
      focuses on &quot;FAMILY Holistic Health&quot; which is to emphasize a more comprehensive and wide&#xD;
      reaching aim and includes physical, mental and social health and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past six years, the FAMILY project has been working on community-based projects to&#xD;
      promote FAMILY 3Hs. Since 2010, the Christian Family Service Centre (CFSC) in collaboration&#xD;
      with the School of Public Health of the University of the Hong Kong (HKU) implemented a&#xD;
      community-based Learning Families Project (LFP) to promote family health, happiness and&#xD;
      harmony (3Hs). As a component of the FAMILY Project, the LFP had built up an effective&#xD;
      practice model through collaboration among various project partners and showed good evidence&#xD;
      of effectiveness in developing a learning culture in the families, enhancing family&#xD;
      communication time and quality, increasing neighborhood cohesion and resilience and promoting&#xD;
      FAMILY 3Hs. Therefore, the FFP is developed based on the strong foundation of the LFP in the&#xD;
      previous years. In view of the health challenges locally and globally, the new phase of&#xD;
      FAMILY project will put more emphasis on health in the upcoming three years. Following the&#xD;
      theme on FAMILY 3Hs, the FFP focuses on family holistic health with emphasis on the&#xD;
      interaction and integration of both physical and psychosocial health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Hong Kong, most 'health projects' only focus on individual's physical health and usually&#xD;
      separate physical from mental or psychosocial health. This new project focuses not only on&#xD;
      individuals' health but on the whole family and holistic health. The investigators strive to&#xD;
      help family members influence each other to have better holistic health. The focus on family&#xD;
      is a new and unique concept which is an innovative, long-term and highly sustainable approach&#xD;
      at the community level. With the involvement of family members, Hong Kong families can&#xD;
      develop and change their lifestyles which impact on families' health. The investigators will&#xD;
      use a family-focused approach and adopt a holistic perspective to design a sustainable family&#xD;
      holistic health intervention model in the community to meet the global health challenges&#xD;
      identified by UN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The innovative family holistic health intervention model will emphasize on the interaction&#xD;
      and integration of physical health and psychosocial health, using physical exercise as the&#xD;
      platform to promote fitter families, which will ultimately enhance the FAMILY 3Hs. Thus, the&#xD;
      ultimate objective of this community-based project is &quot;FAMILY holistic health&quot; for FAMILY&#xD;
      3Hs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In practice, the investigators will use innovative integrated public health theories and&#xD;
      minimal methods to plan brief, simple and cost-effective interventions targeted at families,&#xD;
      with collaboration with experienced NGO partners and community stakeholders. Hence, a larger&#xD;
      number of people will be able to benefit from the program, leading to greater sustainability&#xD;
      and wider dissemination as the administration of project will be easier and the costs will be&#xD;
      lower. The &quot;FAMILY Holistic Health&quot; community-based project aims at promoting a higher level&#xD;
      of physical exercise for people of all ages which will enhance family interaction, pleasure&#xD;
      and well-being. The project can help families to build positive attitudes with stronger&#xD;
      motivation for family members to improve their holistic health by encouraging each other to&#xD;
      have healthy active lifestyle and enjoy the processes with quick and measurable benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluations conducted will be vigorous and evidence generating with quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative methods and follow-ups to assess behavioral changes and improvements in the key&#xD;
      components of family well-being. The data will be provided to the participants for developing&#xD;
      their own health action plan. In order to assess the effectiveness of the interventions on&#xD;
      improving individual and family well-being and for future program development, the data will&#xD;
      also be used for program evaluation. Thus, this proposal is to seek approval from IRB to&#xD;
      collect data from the participants, to use the data for in depth analyses, and to write up&#xD;
      scientific papers based on the findings.&#xD;
