  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is common in the United States; about 1 in 10 people have the disease.&#xD;
      Diabetes can cause devastating health events, such as hospitalizations, kidney failure,&#xD;
      blindness, amputation, heart attack, stroke, painful nerve damage (neuropathy), and death.&#xD;
      There are many barriers for patients with diabetes that get in the way of controlling risk&#xD;
      factors, following recommendations, and getting the care they need from the health system to&#xD;
      help prevent these complications; this is especially true for those with other health&#xD;
      problems too. Those living in poverty and racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to have&#xD;
      complications from diabetes, and less likely to get recommended care from health systems. In&#xD;
      order to improve care and outcomes for people with complex medical problems, several states&#xD;
      have started the Medicaid Health Home (HH) program, including New York State (NYS) in 2012.&#xD;
      This program is for people with two or more chronic health conditions, such as diabetes and&#xD;
      heart disease, people with HIV, and people with a serious mental health condition. HHs are&#xD;
      meant to manage and coordinate care, by helping health care providers, social service&#xD;
      agencies, community-based organizations, and health insurance plans work together. Similar&#xD;
      programs have been shown, on a smaller scale, to improve some results for patients with&#xD;
      diabetes, such as lab tests indicating level of diabetes control. Studies have not yet looked&#xD;
      at how a large program like HHs impacts the way healthcare is delivered and impacts the&#xD;
      health events that matter most to patients with diabetes. Also, few studies include&#xD;
      stakeholders on the research team, even though they stand to benefit the most from such&#xD;
      programs, and have the experience needed as patients, clinicians, advocates, and&#xD;
      administrators to guide efforts. The investigators have gathered a research team that&#xD;
      includes scientific investigators along with a diverse group of partners, including patients,&#xD;
      clinicians, and program administrators. The investigators plan to use two data sources that&#xD;
      show what happens to individual patients over time: 1) NYS Medicaid insurance data 2) the New&#xD;
      York City-Clinical Data Research Network (NYC-CDRN). The NYC-CDRN has identified a group of&#xD;
      patients with diabetes from 7 large health systems; it has also developed a system for&#xD;
      putting together the same set of information for each patient, and removing any identifying&#xD;
      information. The investigator will look at patients who have diabetes and are part of a HH&#xD;
      and study what happened to them over time. The investigator will also look at a comparison&#xD;
      group of patients who are very similar to the HH patients, but they did not join a HH, and&#xD;
      follow them over time. The investigator will then compare these two groups to each other. The&#xD;
      investigator will look at the quality of healthcare they received and their health outcomes.&#xD;
      The investigator will focus on health outcomes that are meaningful to patients. This study&#xD;
      can provide important knowledge about the effects of the HH program on patients with&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;

      The current PCORI-funded study is evaluating the impact of the NYS Medicaid HH program on the&#xD;
      process and outcomes of care for low-income NYC residents with diabetes, compared to&#xD;
      non-enrolled residents with similar conditions and utilization histories. The HH program&#xD;
      enrolls patients with 1) multiple chronic conditions, 2) serious mental illness, and/or 3)&#xD;
      HIV, and provides care management services. The study team now proposes to extend this work&#xD;
      to examine the impacts of the pandemic on this vulnerable population, a majority of which is&#xD;
      Black or Latinx. The study team hypothesizes that HH participation will reduce&#xD;
      pandemic-related disruptions in access to health care and social services and improve health&#xD;
      outcomes among patients with diabetes in NYC. Using a quasi-experimental&#xD;
      difference-in-differences design, the study team will contrast access and utilization of&#xD;
      health care and social services and health outcomes among HH enrollees and non-enrollees&#xD;
      during a baseline period prior to the pandemic (CY2019) with each month of the pandemic time&#xD;
      period (January- September 2020). In addition, the study team will examine the associations&#xD;
      of a range of social determinants and access to health care and social services during the&#xD;
      pandemic among low-income patients with clinical diabetes using survey data.&#xD;
