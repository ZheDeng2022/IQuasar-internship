  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I pilot trial studies the side effects of stereotactic radiosurgery and nivolumab&#xD;
      in treating patients with newly diagnosed melanoma that has spread to the brain or spine.&#xD;
      Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high&#xD;
      dose of radiation directly to the tumor to more precisely target the cancer. Monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as nivolumab may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Giving stereotactic radiosurgery together with nivolumab may be a better treatment&#xD;
      for melanoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety profile of stereotactic radiosurgery with nivolumab in combination to&#xD;
      treat patients with newly diagnosed melanoma brain or spinal metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate local control rate in brain and spine. II. To estimate systematic control&#xD;
      rate. III. To estimate progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore peripheral blood immune response during and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Patients then undergo&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgery on day 8 per standard of care. Courses with nivolumab repeats every&#xD;
      14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 10 weeks, and&#xD;
      then every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
