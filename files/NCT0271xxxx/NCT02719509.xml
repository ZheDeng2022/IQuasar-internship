    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study evaluating the diagnostic utility of cardiac&#xD;
      ultrasound in patients who present to the emergency department with undifferentiated chest&#xD;
      pain or shortness of breath. Emergency department providers will be interviewed before and&#xD;
      after the completion of a cardiac ultrasound to determine if the ultrasound resulted in any&#xD;
      changes in management. Other outcomes include determination of incidence of unexpected&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bedside cardiac ultrasound is performed regularly in the emergency department to assess&#xD;
      patients who present with undifferentiated chest pain or shortness of breath. Utility of&#xD;
      cardiac ultrasound in this setting is emerging as standard of care. Cardiac ultrasound can&#xD;
      rapidly provide essential information about the presence or absence of multiple&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary pathologies. Cardiac ultrasound is safe, immediately accessible, and gives&#xD;
      providers data regarding their patients in real-time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While cardiac ultrasound is common practice in emergency departments, the diagnostic utility&#xD;
      of this test has been difficult to study. There are few studies in the literature that&#xD;
      describe its utility in evaluating specific diagnoses. These studies have evaluated the use&#xD;
      of cardiac ultrasound in diagnosing acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, aortic&#xD;
      dilation/aneurysm, acute coronary syndrome, and acute heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of cardiac ultrasound in patients who&#xD;
      present to the emergency department with undifferentiated chest pain or shortness of breath.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate several parameters including how the cardiac ultrasound contributes&#xD;
      to provider's management plan and assessment of the patient's diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective observational study design. The investigators will prospectively enroll&#xD;
      eligible consecutive patients who present to the emergency department with undifferentiated&#xD;
      chest pain or shortness of breath. Patients will be included if a provider has ordered (or is&#xD;
      planning on ordering) a cardiac ultrasound as part of the patient's diagnostic workup.&#xD;
      Research associates will screen for these two chief complaints and will then approach the ED&#xD;
      provider and ask if they ordered or are planning to order a cardiac ultrasound. ED providers&#xD;
      may also contact research associates to enroll patients that meet the study criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-ultrasound assessment: After eligibility is determined, a research associate will&#xD;
      approach the provider directly involved in the patient's care (Resident or Staff). The&#xD;
      provider completing the data collection forms does not need to be the provider who ordered or&#xD;
      performed the ultrasound. The provider completing the forms will be an Emergency Medicine 2nd&#xD;
      year level resident or above. The provider filling out the data collection form will fill out&#xD;
      the pre-ultrasound assessment prior to reviewing the cardiac ultrasound images (either in&#xD;
      real-time or on the computer after the ultrasound is completed). The provider will fill out a&#xD;
      data collection form that asks about the most likely diagnosis, expected ultrasound findings,&#xD;
      and current management plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the ultrasound is completed the same provider will be asked about the most likely&#xD;
      diagnosis, observed ultrasound findings, and any new management changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other clinical data that will be collected will include demographic data, vital signs,&#xD;
      relevant co-morbidities, imaging results, and lab results from the emergency department&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
