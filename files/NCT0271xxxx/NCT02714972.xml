    <textblock>
      Objective: to gain experience in children and younger adolescents with in-home use of an&#xD;
      algorithm that will dose insulin to minimize projected hyperglycemia overnight in addition to&#xD;
      suspending the pump if hypoglycemia is projected overnight and to obtain feasibility, safety,&#xD;
      and initial efficacy data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: randomized controlled trial, with randomization on a night level within subject&#xD;
      Patient Population: Youth 6.0 - &lt;15 years old with type 1 diabetes treated with daily insulin&#xD;
      therapy for at least one year and an insulin infusion pump for at least 6 months who have&#xD;
      HbA1c &lt; 10.0%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 30 subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration and Visit Schedule: duration approximately 3 months, with preliminary run-in&#xD;
      activities followed by up to 90 days spent in clinical trial phase of study; clinic visits at&#xD;
      enrollment, following CGM and system assessment run-in phases, at start of clinical trial&#xD;
      phase, at 21-day point of clinical trial phase, and after 42 nights of successful system use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major Efficacy Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary: time in range (70-180 mg/dl, 3.9-10.0 mmol/L) overnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary: time spent in hypoglycemia (&lt;70 mg/dl, 3.9 mmol/L) and time spent in&#xD;
           hyperglycemia (&gt;180 mg/dl, 10.0 mmol/L) overnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major Safety Outcomes: CGM measures of hypo- and hyperglycemia, including morning blood&#xD;
      glucose and mean overnight sensor glucose; adverse events including severe hypoglycemia and&#xD;
      diabetic ketoacidosis&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who are eligible for the clinical trial initially will use a Veo insulin pump and&#xD;
      Enlite CGM sensor at home for a minimum of 6 days/week over a 2-week period to verify that&#xD;
      the subject is able to use the CGM and insert sensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 10 subjects enrolled will be 11 to &lt;15 years of age and will participate in an&#xD;
      Algorithm Assessment Phase of approximately 10 nights of system use each with PLGS and Hyper&#xD;
      Minimization active. Results of the approximate 100 nights will be reviewed with the study&#xD;
      DSMB to assess safety and determine whether any adjustments to the algorithm parameters are&#xD;
      needed. If adjustments are needed, the Algorithm Assessment Phase will be repeated with the&#xD;
      same age restriction, using the same 10 subjects if possible. If no adjustments are needed&#xD;
      and the DSMB judges it safe to continue the study, enrollment will continue across the full 6&#xD;
      to &lt;15 age range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who enroll in the study after the completion of the Algorithm Assessment Phase will&#xD;
      use the closed-loop system at home for 5 nights of system use each with PLGS and Hyper&#xD;
      Minimization active to demonstrate their ability to use the system and submit study data to&#xD;
      the Coordinating Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who successfully demonstrate their ability to use the system at home as described&#xD;
      above will be eligible for the randomized trial phase. This phase consists of use of the full&#xD;
      system in the home for approximately 42 nights:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each night the blood glucose level will be checked with the BG meter and used to perform&#xD;
           a calibration of the CGM. This calibration must occur no more than 90 minutes prior to&#xD;
           activation of the system. NOTE: Subjects will be instructed to calibrate the CGM per&#xD;
           manufacturer guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then the system will be activated, linking the CGM and insulin pump to the computer at&#xD;
           the bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A randomization schedule on the laptop will be used to determine whether the system will&#xD;
           run in PLGS+Hyper Minimization mode or PLGS-only.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects will be blinded as to whether the system is running in PLGS+Hyper&#xD;
                Minimization mode or PLGS-only.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  There will not be an alarm if the pump shuts off or if automated insulin dosing&#xD;
                occurs. The CGM alarm will be set to 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L). When a CGM alarm&#xD;
                occurs, the subject will be asked to measure the blood glucose with a BG meter, if&#xD;
                he/she is aware of the alarm.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The time period for outcome assessment each night will be from the time the system&#xD;
                is activated until it is turned off in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pump shut off, when it occurs, will be for up to 120 minutes in a 150-minute&#xD;
                period, and no more than 180 minutes for the entire night. Multiple instances of&#xD;
                pump suspension can occur if there are recurrent predictions of hypoglycemia during&#xD;
                the night.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small correction boluses of insulin will be delivered when the system predicts that&#xD;
           hyperglycemia above a pre-set threshold will occur, with insulin-on-board constraints&#xD;
           and cumulative delivery limits to minimize the likelihood of excessive insulin delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to check blood glucose with the study BG meter each morning prior&#xD;
           to breakfast and enter the results using the controller software interface. The subject&#xD;
           will be instructed to contact the study physician if the morning blood glucose value is&#xD;
           &lt;60 mg/dl (3.3 mmol/L) or &gt;300 mg/dl (16.7 mmol/L). Monitoring processes will ensure&#xD;
           that the subject can be contacted if these values are not reported as required or are&#xD;
           out of range.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to record all overnight carbohydrate intake using the controller&#xD;
           software interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to perform periodic CGM data uploads using the controller&#xD;
           software interface. Monitoring processes will ensure that the subject can be contacted&#xD;
           if these uploads do not occur as required, or if review of an upload reveals any&#xD;
           extreme, prolonged episodes of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, or elevated morning blood&#xD;
           glucose values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once approximately 200 nights of randomized clinical trial phase data are available, the&#xD;
      study DSMB will perform another data review to determine whether it is safe to continue the&#xD;
      study. Subjects already using the study system at home will continue to use it during the&#xD;
      DSMB review process, but no additional subjects will begin home use of the system until the&#xD;
      DSMB review is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the study, subjects as well as study clinicians will be asked to complete&#xD;
      a human factors usability questionnaire regarding use of the study system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a follow-up (optional) extension phase for subjects who exhibit safe and&#xD;
      competent use of the system at home. They may be given the option to continue home use of the&#xD;
      system for up to 56 days to assess whether data-driven, subject-level customization of&#xD;
      algorithm parameters improves glycemic outcomes compared with generic algorithm parameters&#xD;
      that are identical for each subject.&#xD;
