      To evaluate the use of an occlusion balloon (Bridge™ Occlusion Balloon, Spectranetics) within&#xD;
      the Superior Vena Cava in lead extraction patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of an occlusion balloon (Bridge™ Occlusion Balloon,&#xD;
      Spectranetics) within the Superior Vena Cava in lead extraction patients. This will be&#xD;
      performed in a non-emergent setting to allow for evaluation of how best to integrate this new&#xD;
      technology into the investigators clinical practice. The study will focus on the effect of&#xD;
      the Bridge balloon on the patient preparation clinical workflow, ease of&#xD;
      insertion/positioning/deployment, and the ability to recognize proper inflation and vein&#xD;
      sealing under fluoroscopy. Understanding these factors will help build a more robust clinical&#xD;
      workflow with the goal of better patient outcomes in the case of an Superior Vena Cava&#xD;
      injury. The images and data generated during this study can help in dissemination of the&#xD;
      practical use knowledge to fellow lead extractors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of the protocol registration, the timeframe 12 months was entered, this was&#xD;
      actually the anticipated length of the study at registration. The timeframe was corrected to&#xD;
      33 minutes (average time) at the time of results entry.&#xD;

    <time_frame>33 minutes (average time)</time_frame>
    <description>After Bridge Balloon deployment and inflation, the degree of blood vessel occlusion will be reported. Measurements will be calculated from fluoroscopic images (using x-ray machine) and venograms (images with injection of contrast agent). Successful balloon occlusion of the superior vena cava (SVC) is defined as &gt;90% occlusion of the SVC by visual estimate using conventional venography.</description>

          <title>Bridge Occlusion Balloon</title>
          <description>Bridge Balloon catheter is designed to be used for temporary vessel occlusion of the superior vena cava in applications including perioperative occlusion and emergency control of hemorrhage associated with vascular tears that may occur during lead extraction procedures.&#xD;
Bridge Balloon: The Bridge Balloon will be used in a non-emergent setting to allow for evaluation of how best to integrate this new technology into the investigators clinical practice. The study will focus on the effect of the Bridge balloon on the patient preparation clinical workflow, ease of insertion/positioning/deployment, and the ability to recognize proper inflation and vein sealing under fluoroscopy.</description>
