      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most widespread liver disorder in Western&#xD;
      society (prevalence 20-30%). It is strongly associated with overweight and obesity. The&#xD;
      majority of patients have simple steatosis. However, in about 15-30% of the subjects, a&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory state develops that is referred to as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis&#xD;
      (NASH), which leads to an overall increase in morbidity and mortality due to the progression&#xD;
      to fibrosis, cirrhosis and in some cases, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The term NAFLD&#xD;
      comprises both simple steatosis and NASH. Most patients with NAFLD have no or few, mainly&#xD;
      aspecific symptoms; and generally there is a silent progression of simple steatosis to NASH&#xD;
      and in the end, liver-related morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, liver biopsy is the most sensitive test for detecting and staging NAFLD, and is the&#xD;
      only reliable method for differentiating between NASH and simple steatosis. However, the&#xD;
      procedure of obtaining a liver biopsy is invasive and associated with patient discomfort,&#xD;
      significant complications and high costs. In addition, liver biopsy is prone to sampling&#xD;
      error and inter- and intra-observer variability, due to the small size of liver biopsy&#xD;
      samples. This method is therefore not suitable for screening large numbers of subjects at&#xD;
      risk, or for follow-up of patients with NASH over time. Hence, only subjects at high risk&#xD;
      (usually based upon elevated aminotransferase levels, which is not specific for the presence&#xD;
      of NASH) are biopsied, leading to an underestimation of NASH prevalence and undertreatment.&#xD;
      Further insight into disease mechanisms and risk factors for NAFLD and in particular NASH is&#xD;
      warranted, to enable early diagnosis, adequate therapy and preventive measures to improve&#xD;
      health status of these individuals. Accurate and less invasive methods to evaluate NASH, and&#xD;
      NAFLD, are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to establish non-invasive tools (e.g.&#xD;
      biomarkers and imaging) to accurately diagnose patients with NASH. The secondary objective is&#xD;
      to show an association between the levels of identified markers and disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be included via the outpatient clinics Zuyderland in Heerlen, the&#xD;
      Catharina hospital in Eindhoven and MUMC+ in Maastricht. A subset of eligible subjects has&#xD;
      undergone a liver biopsy for clinical reasons. It is estimated that about 85% of subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to undergo a biopsy for study purposes only. Liver biopsies for study purposes&#xD;
      will be performed during a surgical procedure, e.g. bariatric surgery or cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, faeces and exhaled air will be collected and a FibroScan (+CAP) will be performed&#xD;
      during a study visit. An MRI will be performed, to estimate the degree of steatosis.&#xD;
      Furthermore, anthropometric data (weight, height, abdominal and waist circumference and blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP)) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the group undergoing liver biopsy during bariatric surgery will be asked&#xD;
      permission to be approached for follow-up measurements 3 months post-surgery. As they will&#xD;
      lose weight, which is associated with improvement of hepatic steatosis, this enables&#xD;
      assessment of possible changes over time. A routine follow-up visit post-surgery will take&#xD;
      place after 3 months. The follow-up measurements will be combined with this visit, minimizing&#xD;
      the burden for the participant. The measurements will consist of blood, faeces and exhaled&#xD;
      air collection and a FibroScan (+CAP) will be performed during a study visit. Furthermore,&#xD;
      weight, height, BP and abdominal and waist circumference will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with proven NAFLD by histology or NAFLD proven by imaging, who are undergoing&#xD;
      surgery (i.e. bariatric surgery or cholecystectomy) will be asked to participate in this&#xD;
      study. Furthermore, all subjects have to be between 18 and 65 years old.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Non-invasive tool based on biomarkers and imaging to diagnose NASH.&#xD;
