      BACKGROUND - Approximately 1,700 transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) occur annually in NI with&#xD;
      TIA survivors often being left with considerable functional impairment. TIA and strokes share&#xD;
      common risk factors with cardiovascular disease. Cardiac rehabilitation post-myocardial&#xD;
      infarction has shown significant reductions in morbidity and mortality, with home-based&#xD;
      programmes producing better adherence and similar outcomes to hospital-and community-based&#xD;
      programmes. However, the value of rehabilitation programmes for stroke prevention following a&#xD;
      TIA or minor stroke is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS - to determine if a novel rehabilitation programme, 'The Healthy Brain Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Manual', for TIA/minor stroke patients can be developed, using MRC guidelines for developing&#xD;
      complex health service interventions, from an approved home-based cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      programme (the 'Heart Manual') and to undertake feasibility and pilot studies of the novel&#xD;
      programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS-All patients attending a TIA clinic in Belfast within 4 weeks of their first TIA/mild&#xD;
      stroke will be invited to participate. The novel home-based programme manual will be&#xD;
      developed following systematic reviews of the literature and qualitative exploration with the&#xD;
      target population, using focus groups. A feasibility study will initially be undertaken&#xD;
      lasting 6 weeks and then developed into a pilot trial of 12 weeks duration. The feasibility&#xD;
      will recruit to 3 different treatments: (1) standard care; (2) standard care plus the manual;&#xD;
      (3) standard care, manual plus a pedometer. Whilst for the pilot study there will also be 3&#xD;
      arms but this will include: 1) control group; 2) manual and pedometer supported by telephone&#xD;
      follow-up with a GP; 3) manual and pedometer supported by telephone follow-up with a stroke&#xD;
      nurse. Interviews and focus groups will be employed to assess the interventions'&#xD;
      acceptability. The intervention, 'The Healthy Brain Rehabilitation Manual' will be refined&#xD;
      and modified at all stages of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCLUSIONS - The findings will inform the development of a novel secondary prevention&#xD;
      programme, 'The Healthy Brain Rehabilitation Manual', for TIA/minor stroke patients and of a&#xD;
      trial to test its effectiveness and longer-term potential to improve outcomes for TIA/stroke&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      METHODS - The development of the novel home-based rehabilitation programme, adapted from the&#xD;
      &quot;Heart Manual&quot;, will follow the guidelines of the MRC for developing complex health service&#xD;
      interventions. The steps of the guidelines include: 1) exploring relevant theory; 2)&#xD;
      modelling the preliminary intervention by selecting the main components based on the&#xD;
      literature and qualitative research; 3) pilot-testing the preliminary intervention; 4)&#xD;
      developing the definitive randomised controlled trial; and, 5) implementing and evaluating&#xD;
      the randomised controlled trial over the long-term. This study focuses on the first three&#xD;
      steps of the MRC framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploration of relevant theory - Initially, literature relating to cardiac rehabilitation and&#xD;
      secondary prevention of TIAs and minor stroke will be reviewed following searches in&#xD;
      appropriate databases with input from a medical librarian. The research team (including the&#xD;
      applicant, supervisors, collaborators and steering group) will discuss key findings and&#xD;
      identify those deemed appropriate to the study setting, with identification of appropriate&#xD;
      behaviour change theory using behaviour change taxonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Participants will be recruited from one TIA/ 'minor' stroke assessment unit,&#xD;
      based in the Ulster Hospital for the feasibility study and from 4 sites for the pilot study&#xD;
      (Royal Victoria Hospital, Ulster Hospital, Antrim and Craigavon Area Hospitals). Patients are&#xD;
      typically seen within one week of suffering neurological symptoms suggestive of TIA. After&#xD;
      confirmation of diagnosis and initial management on the day of presentation, the attending&#xD;
      physician will offer patients a study information sheet and an invitation to participate. If&#xD;
      the patient agrees to being contacted, the researcher will telephone twenty-four hours later&#xD;
      to invite them to attend the Clinical Research Facility, QUB to participate in the study and&#xD;
      written, informed consent will be obtained. The numbers of those who decline to participate&#xD;
      in the study will be recorded to provide information about recruitment rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developing the intervention: From those who agree to participate, an initial purposeful&#xD;
      sample of patients will be invited to focus groups. Participants will be given the manual&#xD;
      approximately a week before the focus group and asked to read it before attending the focus&#xD;
      group. The topic guide for focus groups will be based on findings from the literature review&#xD;
      and will include the formatting and lay-out of the manual, manual content and potential&#xD;
      improvements to the manual. Health and social care staff involved in the clinical care of TIA&#xD;
      and stroke patients, members of voluntary organisations, relatives and carers will also be&#xD;
      invited to participate in a focus group: initial plans are that a sample of these individuals&#xD;
      would be invited to a single group. Participants' and professionals' experiences of and&#xD;
      attitudes towards key interventions identified from the literature will also be used in&#xD;
      modelling the pilot intervention. With each participant's consent, interviews and focus&#xD;
      groups will be audio-recorded and transcribed. Two researchers will then analyse the&#xD;
      transcripts independently by: familiarisation; identifying a thematic framework; indexing;&#xD;
      charting; and, mapping and interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility and then pilot study of the intervention - Baseline assessment: Following&#xD;
      analysis of the findings of the literature review and qualitative data, the home-based&#xD;
      vascular rehabilitation manual will be developed, adapting the &quot;Heart Manual&quot; (now referred&#xD;
      to as 'The Healthy Brain Rehabilitation Manual') accordingly. We plan to conduct both a&#xD;
      feasibility and pilot studies of our intervention. As described above, prospective trial&#xD;
      participants will be invited to attend the Clinical Research Facility within 4 weeks of their&#xD;
      initial TIA/'minor' stroke event, for initial assessment, at which their written consent to&#xD;
      participate will be sought. Baseline assessments (taking approximately 60 minutes) will be&#xD;
      completed prior to randomisation to ensure allocation concealment. All patients will&#xD;
      initially undertake a sub maximal exercise test under the supervision of a trained physician.&#xD;
      For the pilot study, all will be given, with appropriate instructions, an accelerometer to&#xD;
      wear for one week to provide a blinded baseline physical activity assessment and these will&#xD;
      be returned to the applicant after one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: Block randomisation will be used and patients will be stratified, based on&#xD;
      age, sex and diagnosis (TIA/'minor' stroke). Study group allocation will be revealed to&#xD;
      participants only at the end of the baseline assessment and following completion of all&#xD;
      initial measurements (except accelerometry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: The feasibility will recruit to 3 different treatments: (1) standard care; (2)&#xD;
      standard care plus the manual; (3) standard care, manual plus a pedometer. Whilst for the&#xD;
      pilot study there will also be 3 arms but this will include: 1) control group; 2) manual and&#xD;
      pedometer supported by telephone follow-up with a GP; 3) manual and pedometer supported by&#xD;
      telephone follow-up with a stroke nurse. The control group (Group 1) will follow standard&#xD;
      care guidelines as per treatment protocols and provided by their healthcare professionals at&#xD;
      the hospital clinic. 'The Healthy Brain Rehabilitation Manual' programme will be explained to&#xD;
      the appropriate participants by the applicant at the end of the baseline assessment. The use&#xD;
      of the pedometer, an approach to its use in goal setting and an accompanying diary will also&#xD;
      be explained to the relevant participants at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      'The Healthy Brain Rehabilitation Manual' will address each of the modifiable vascular risk&#xD;
      factors, managing one risk factor each week, whilst encouraging the patient to slowly&#xD;
      increase their activity over the (proposed) six week programme in the setting of their home&#xD;
      and addressing the issues of anxiety and depression following the diagnosis of TIA or 'minor'&#xD;
      stroke. The manual therefore involves education and motivation of the patient to address&#xD;
      these risk factors. The facilitator (the applicant (a General Practitioner) and/or a stroke&#xD;
      nurse) will also help them identify local support resources, for example smoking cessation&#xD;
      services, through telephone contact. 'The Healthy Brain Rehabilitation Manual' will utilise&#xD;
      the behaviour change techniques of goal setting, barrier identification, setting graded&#xD;
      tasks, self monitoring, feedback, relapse prevention and stress management. Self-set&#xD;
      pedometer targets will emerge during discussion with the facilitator who will use simple&#xD;
      motivational interviewing techniques and advise keeping a daily step-count diary. Telephone&#xD;
      follow-up review, with the applicant, will take place at one and four weeks as per usual&#xD;
      &quot;Heart Manual&quot; care for the feasibility study as well as at eight weeks for the pilot study,&#xD;
      unless the findings of initial qualitative work would suggest that an alternative design of a&#xD;
      follow-up plan would be appropriate. These reviews will include advice regarding addressing&#xD;
      the modifiable vascular risk factors and, if appropriate, issues with the home-based vascular&#xD;
      rehabilitation programme ('The Healthy Brain Manual') and pedometer targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review assessment: All participants will have a 6 week (feasibility study) and a 3 month&#xD;
      (pilot study) follow-up review appointment. This review should take approximately sixty&#xD;
      minutes to complete. For the pilot study, all participants will be asked to wear an&#xD;
      accelerometer again, for one week, to provide a post-intervention physical activity&#xD;
      assessment and to return this to the researcher following this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of study qualitative assessment: At the end of the pilot study, all participants will be&#xD;
      asked about their perceptions of the relevance, acceptability and value of the intervention,&#xD;
      using different qualitative techniques, including questionnaires, focus groups and/or semi&#xD;
      structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The manual will be developed at all stages of the research process as per the MRC guidelines.&#xD;
