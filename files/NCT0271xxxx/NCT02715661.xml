      This project will examine the association between (cardio)vascular disease, blood supply to&#xD;
      the brain, and cerebrovascular endothelial activation. Also, we will investigate the impact&#xD;
      of exercise rehabilitation on brain vascularization, cerebrovascular endothelial function and&#xD;
      blood flow control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control trial, with randomization nested within rationally-formed&#xD;
      groups. Three major groups will be assessed: 1) Coronary artery disease (CAD) patients, 2)&#xD;
      Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), and 3) healthy Control (CTL) participants. Allocation into the&#xD;
      Healthy CTL versus MeTS groups will be confirmed at the pre-study screening visit based on&#xD;
      medical questionnaires, blood sample outcomes, and ultrasound imaging (see below). All CTL&#xD;
      and MeTS participants will be allocated by random assignment to a six-month exercise training&#xD;
      group, or a 6-month &quot;wait-list&quot; training group followed by a 6-month exercise training&#xD;
      period. The exercise training will be in accordance with American College of Sports Medicine&#xD;
      and Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology guidelines supporting 3 days/week in the&#xD;
      laboratory with target heart rate-based aerobic activity (~30 minutes/day) and two days of&#xD;
      at-home activity. Based on target heart rate, levels of exercise intensity and/or duration&#xD;
      will be adjusted every two weeks to sustain the training stimulus. CAD patients are defined&#xD;
      here as those with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease having been hospitalized for a&#xD;
      cardiac event. Within the recruited CAD participants, Group 1 (CADcr) will volunteer to&#xD;
      receive a structured cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program. Group 2 (CADuc) will receive the&#xD;
      recommendation for cardiac rehabilitation and choose not to participate (due to various&#xD;
      reasons including distance to cardiac rehabilitation site), yet volunteer to the testing&#xD;
      procedures at baseline and following a six month period. While random assignment is&#xD;
      preferred, it is not feasible in CAD patients because, in our experience, geographical&#xD;
      constraints or other personal barriers restrict access to CR and because CR is often&#xD;
      considered the normal standard of care (they won't volunteer to avoid CR if they want CR).&#xD;
      Instead, a naturalistic control approach will be used whereby patients who do not participate&#xD;
      in CR may still participate by undergoing the testing before and following a six month period&#xD;
      of time. Use of recall surveys will establish activity patterns in the non-exercise training&#xD;
      groups or wait periods. Both groups will receive the same in-hospital education, referral to&#xD;
      a CR program, personal prescription (referral), encouragement and follow-up. All subjects&#xD;
      will complete a series of tests before and following the six-month interval of exercise or&#xD;
      time control. Exercise training and the majority of testing will occur in the Laboratory for&#xD;
      Brain and Heart Health (Labatt Health Sciences Building, Rm 402). Protocols:&#xD;
      Cardio-respiratory Fitness: Fitness will be determined using a self-paced six-minute walk&#xD;
      test (6MWT) that will be administered as per American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines&#xD;
      whereby a physician's presence is not required. Blood Sample: After resting quietly for up to&#xD;
      30 min, a fasting (&gt;3 hours) venous blood sample will be taken from the antecubital vein for&#xD;
      analysis of blood glucose, lipids, and insulin (LifeLabs), markers of astrocyte and vascular&#xD;
      damage (D. Fraser), endothelial function (e.g. endothelin, P-selectin) and inflammation (e.g.&#xD;
      hsCRP, TNFa, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10), neural function markers (e.g. epinephrine, norepinephrine),&#xD;
      and proliferative factors (e.g. NFK-B, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), VEGF) (K.&#xD;
      Summers). Additional samples of 10 mL whole blood will be taken to Robarts Research Institute&#xD;
      for analysis of genetic markers of vascular risk (e.g. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) or BDNF&#xD;
      polymorphisms (R. Hegele)) and for monocyte inflammatory profiles using flow-cytometry (G.&#xD;
      Dekaban). Up to 5 samples of plasma (~1 mL) will be sent to Victoria Hospital for cell&#xD;
      culture fluid-flow analysis of polymorphonuclear cell binding (G. Cepinskas). The total&#xD;
      volume of blood sample will not exceed 60 mL. Vascular Ultrasound: Ultrasound will be used to&#xD;
      measure artery diameters and blood flow in the Carotid Artery, Carotid Sinus, Brachial Artery&#xD;
      and Femoral Artery. Dilation of the brachial artery will also be measured following five&#xD;
      minutes of forearm ischemia (flow-mediated dilation) and for four minutes following a&#xD;
      sublingual single dose (0.4 mg) of sodium nitroglycerine (standard over-the-counter&#xD;
      self-treatment for angina). Sympathetic Nerve Activity: Peripheral sympathetic nerve activity&#xD;
      will be obtained from the peroneal nerve using microneurography. A 200 µm-diameter, 35 mm&#xD;
      long tungsten microelectrode tapered to an uninsulated 1- to 5-µm tip is inserted&#xD;
      transcutaneously into the peroneal nerve just posterior to the fibular head. A reference&#xD;
      electrode is positioned subcutaneously 1-3 cm from the recording site. A sympathetic nerve&#xD;
      site is confirmed by the characteristic pulse-synchronous burst pattern that does not produce&#xD;
      skin paraesthesias and that increases in frequency during a voluntary apnea and/or a Valsalva&#xD;
      manoeuvre but not during arousal to a loud noise. Transcranial Ultrasound: A small probe held&#xD;
      against each of the temporal windows (just behind the eyes) with a headband will measure flow&#xD;
      velocity within the middle and/or posterior cerebral arteries. Cerebrovascular Reactivity&#xD;
      (Hypercapnia): Subjects will breathe a hypercapnic gas mixture of 5% CO2/21% O2/Balance N2&#xD;
      through a 2-way non-rebreathing valve. This gas will be inspired for up to 5 minutes in each&#xD;
      of two repeated trials separated by at least 5 minutes of recovery. Sit-to-stand test: To&#xD;
      test dynamic rate of recovery in cerebral blood flow during transient changes in blood&#xD;
      pressure, brain blood flow by transcranial Doppler ultrasound, blood pressure, heart rate,&#xD;
      and end tidal CO2 (with a mask) will be measured during ~3 min of seated rest, two minutes of&#xD;
      standing, and then a period of seated rest. This protocol may be repeated up to three times.&#xD;
      A gas analyzer and face mask mechanism will enable measurement of expired oxygen and carbon&#xD;
      dioxide in each of the hypercapnia and sit-to-stand tests. Electrocardiogram: A standard&#xD;
      electrocardiogram will be collected via small surface electrodes on the chest to determine&#xD;
      heart rate. Ventilation Patterns: A respitrace strain gauge will be placed around the chest&#xD;
      to record breathing patterns. Blood pressure will be measured using a small cuff place on a&#xD;
      finger (Finometer), and confirmed with upper arm sphygmomanometry. Hemoglobin saturation will&#xD;
      be measured by a pulse oximeter on one of the digits. 1. 6-min walk test: Using a self-paced&#xD;
      format, participants will walk back and forth along a long hallway for six minutes while the&#xD;
      distance covered will be recorded. Participants may rest as needed throughout the test. 2.&#xD;
      Leg and arm muscle strength (isometric). Participants will push a single arm or leg against a&#xD;
      resistance machine while the force is measured. Three maximal-effort 3-sec repetitions will&#xD;
      be repeated separated by a minute or two of rest. Neuropsychology Tests: These tests will&#xD;
      study the key functional outcomes in vascular cognitive impairment and include measures&#xD;
      related to mood, memory and cognition. The tests are pen-and-paper, will be administered by&#xD;
      trained personnel, and, based on published standards (Hachinski et al., 2006) will include&#xD;
      the following: Overall Cognitive Function: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), Trail making&#xD;
      test, and The Stroop Word-Colour Test. The latter task takes advantage of our ability to read&#xD;
      words more quickly and automatically than we can name colors. Executive Function (Animal&#xD;
      Naming, Controlled Oral Word), Association (Trail Making Test); Language (Boston Naming Test&#xD;
      2nd Edition, short form); Visuospatial (Rey-Osterrieth Complex, Figure Copy, Complex Figure&#xD;
      Memory); Digit Span and Digit Symbol coding from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV&#xD;
      (WAIS-III; with Canadian norms) Memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test;&#xD;
      http://www.wpspublish.com/store/Search?Q=Rey%20Auditory%20Verbal%20Learning%20Test%E2%84%A2%2&#xD;
      0(RAVLT%E2%84%A2); NOTE: In an attempt to address the practice effect problem related to&#xD;
      repeated trials of the same test, alternate forms of some scales may be administered in a&#xD;
      counter-balanced manner when appropriate. (Reference: V. Hachinski et al. National Institute&#xD;
      of Neurological Disorders and Stroke - Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment&#xD;
      Harmonization Standards, Stroke, 2006, 37:2220-2241) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Two&#xD;
      separate MRI protocols will be performed by each participant. These will be completed on&#xD;
      either the 3 Tesla or 7 Tesla imaging systems at Robarts. The series of images acquired will&#xD;
      include: 1) T1 MPRAGE anatomical, 2) FLAIR for white matter hyperintensities, 3) MR&#xD;
      angiography for vascular architecture, 4) black-blood angiography of middle cerebral artery&#xD;
      at baseline and again after up to five minutes of hypercapnia. Sample Schedule of Testing:&#xD;
      These will be performed at each of the pre and post training periods. Visit 1 - Laboratory&#xD;
      Testing 1 (3 hours) Consent: 15 min Supine rest: 30 min Blood samples: 10 min (used partly&#xD;
      for group allocation in the pre test) Snack: 10 min Instrumentation (including transcranial&#xD;
      Doppler and carotid artery vascular ultrasound imaging): 60 min Cerebrovascular Reactivity to&#xD;
      hypercapnia and sit-to-stand tasks: 45 min Visit 2 - Laboratory Testing 2 (2h) Cognitive&#xD;
      tests: 45 min Vascular imaging: 30 min Six-min walk: 10 min Leg Muscle Strength: 10 min Visit&#xD;
      3 - MRI Testing (&lt;1.5 hours total time) Baseline blood pressure: 10 min MRI Preparation: 10&#xD;
      min Anatomical: 10 min White Matter Hyperintensities: 10 min Angiography: 20 min MR&#xD;
      angiography of middle cerebral artery with hypercapnia: 20 min The Interventions:&#xD;
      Rehabilitative Exercise: The cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs will provide the initial&#xD;
      exercise intervention for referred CAD patients (Dr. Suskin). The CR program uses&#xD;
      standardized, prescriptive and progressive exercise (primarily aerobic exercise) practices to&#xD;
      improve the functional capacity of patients following a clinical cardiac intervention. The CR&#xD;
      program in London lasts for 6 months. In general, aerobic exercise training is at an&#xD;
      intensity of 40%-70% heart rate reserve or, a rate of perceived exercise score of 11-14 (on&#xD;
      the 6-20 Borg scale), 3-7 d/wk, at 20-60 min/session (or multiple 10-min sessions).&#xD;
