    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of uninterrupted transdermal nitrate&#xD;
      therapy in 140 peri- or postmenopausal women who have frequent hot flashes. Women will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to uninterrupted use of transdermal nitrate therapy (participant directed&#xD;
      dose-escalation of 0.2 to 0.6 mg/hr) or identical-appearing placebo patches for 12 weeks.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women aged 40 to 62 years (consistent with the recent MSFlash hot flash network&#xD;
             trials, and likely to maximize enrollment of highly symptomatic women)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Postmenopausal or in the late menopausal transition. For this study, postmenopausal&#xD;
             status will be defined by: 1) self-reported history of bilateral oophorectomy, 2)&#xD;
             follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels &gt; 20 mU/mL for those with a self-reported&#xD;
             history of hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy, or 3) no self-reported history&#xD;
             of hysterectomy or oophorectomy, but absence of menses in the past 12 months. Late&#xD;
             menopausal transition will be defined by amenorrhea for at least 60 days in the past&#xD;
             12 months within the specified age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documentation of an average of 7 or more hot flashes per 24 hours as well as 4 or more&#xD;
             moderate-to-severe hot flashes per 24 hours as recorded on a validated 7-day screening&#xD;
             symptom diary&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to refrain from initiating other treatments that are known to affect the&#xD;
             frequency of severity hot flashes during the trial period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Report having a current primary health care provider (such as a general practitioner,&#xD;
             family medicine, internal medicine, or nurse practitioner providing primary care or&#xD;
             specializing in women's health)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or recent use of NTG or other nitrate-containing medications (i.e., use within&#xD;
             1 month of screening), or intention to use nitrate-containing medication during the&#xD;
             interventional period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or recent use of medications already known to reduce the frequency or severity&#xD;
             of hot flashes (e.g., vaginal or transdermal estrogens in the past 4 weeks; oral&#xD;
             estrogens or progestins in the past 8 weeks; intrauterine progestin therapy in the&#xD;
             past 8 weeks; progestin implants or estrogen alone injectable therapy in the past 3&#xD;
             months; estrogen pellet therapy or progestin injectable therapy in the past 6 months;&#xD;
             clonidine, methyldopa, gabapentin, pregabalin and selective serotonin or&#xD;
             norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs/SNRIs) in the past 1 month); or intention to&#xD;
             use these medications during the interventional period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or recent use of phosphodiesterase inhibitor medications (within 1 month of&#xD;
             screening), or intention to use these medications during the interventional period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or recent use of riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator medication,&#xD;
             within 1 month of screening, or intention to use riociguat during the interventional&#xD;
             period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-reported history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, aortic valve&#xD;
             stenosis, or mitral valve stenosis (since symptoms of these conditions may be&#xD;
             aggravated by NTG therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-reported history of coronary disease (since patients with coronary disease may&#xD;
             need NTG therapy for chest pain or may be at increased risk of new coronary events in&#xD;
             the setting of nitrate tolerance), or evidence of prior myocardial infarction on&#xD;
             screening electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-reported history of diabetes or 2 or more major risk factors for coronary disease&#xD;
             (i.e., smoking, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia with physician-recommended&#xD;
             pharmacologic treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of tachyarrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or flutter without adequate&#xD;
             rate control (&gt;110 beats/minute) on screening ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of second or third-degree atrioventricular block on screening ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypotension based on measured resting blood pressure &lt;90/60 at baseline; or normal&#xD;
             resting blood pressure but evidence of orthostatic hypotension with change from supine&#xD;
             to standing position)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension based on measured resting blood pressure &gt; 180/110 at&#xD;
             baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-reported headaches interfering with activities of daily activities more than&#xD;
             twice a month, or use of prescription medication to prevent or treat headache in the&#xD;
             past month (since these may be worsened by NTG therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to nitroglycerin or other nitrate-based medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known skin sensitivity to adhesives (which may generalize to the NTG patches)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to complete or tolerate a brief 3-day run-in period involving the lowest&#xD;
             available dose of NTG (0.1 mg/hr)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently pregnant, gave birth within the past 3 months, planning pregnancy during the&#xD;
             study period, or unwilling to use regular barrier contraception or abstain from sexual&#xD;
             activity to prevent pregnancy if not yet postmenopausal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently breastfeeding, breastfeeding within the past 3 months, or planning to&#xD;
             breastfeed during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-report heavy alcohol use (&gt;3 drinks in a given day or &gt;7 drinks per week) and&#xD;
             uncomfortable or unwilling to decrease their alcohol intake during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent, fill out questionnaires, or complete&#xD;
             study visits in English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Report other conditions that, in the judgment of the investigators, render potential&#xD;
             participants highly unlikely to follow the protocol, including plans to move,&#xD;
             substance abuse, significant psychiatric problems, or severe dementia.&#xD;
