    <textblock>
      Malalignment of the knee joint causes arthritis in later life. Currently there are three&#xD;
      surgical ways to treat knee arthritis: total knee replacement, partial knee replacement, and&#xD;
      high tibial osteotomy (HTO). The former two very much focus on treating the effect of&#xD;
      malalignment, i.e. removing the arthritic joint. However, HTO addresses the cause of the&#xD;
      arthritis, namely the joint malalignment. This preserves the patient's joint and it means&#xD;
      that a patient will start using the unaffected part of the knee joint more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HTO involves cutting a wedge out the tibia to correct the alignment of that bone with the&#xD;
      knee joint, to redistribute load from the affected medial part to lateral part. To keep the&#xD;
      tibia in the new position, a medical nail device is attached to keep it in place and allow&#xD;
      new bone to regenerate within the wedge. Currently, the market leader for HTO is the TomoFix&#xD;
      (by DePuySynthes company) plate and nail device. As the name suggests, TomoFix is fixed at&#xD;
      surgery and therefore the change in bone angle cannot be changed afterwards. It does mean&#xD;
      that patients can be weight-bearing on the affected leg soon after the HTO procedure. A new&#xD;
      CE-marked device is being tested in an interventional trial; it is produced by Ellipse&#xD;
      Technologies. This device is an extendable nail and inserted intramedullary; following&#xD;
      surgery the nail is tend slowly extended over a period of time until the bone correction is&#xD;
      satisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CISKO imaging study will assess whether there is a difference between the TomoFix and&#xD;
      Ellipse system in terms of bone regeneration in the tibial wedge by performing a CT-scan at 3&#xD;
      and 6 months post-operatively. This will be quantified by two independent radiological&#xD;
      reports. A secondary objective is to investigate patient satisfaction and also patient pain&#xD;
      levels at these time intervals. The degree of bone healing is usually the main factor holding&#xD;
      clinicians back when it comes to advising patients on what activities they can return to&#xD;
      post-operatively. A difference in bone healing between the two systems may impact on the&#xD;
      advice clinicians can give patients regarding recommencing more intense activities such as&#xD;
      recreational sports, which ultimately could positively impact patients' health and&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One treatment modality for medial osteoarthritis of the knee is open-wedge high tibial&#xD;
      osteotomy (HTO). The current most common way of performing HTO is to use fixation plates with&#xD;
      locking bolts implanted in the patient's tibia, to allow increased stability &amp; joint movement&#xD;
      and the ability to be weight bearing on the affected leg sooner . However, despite advances&#xD;
      in high tibial osteotomy technology, it can still take most patients about six months to&#xD;
      fully recover from the procedure. Sedentary activities are usually picked up about a month&#xD;
      after surgery, before physical work is introduced 3 to 4 months after surgery, followed by&#xD;
      sports which can be reintroduced approximately 6-12 months after surgery. One reservation for&#xD;
      allowing patients to be fully weight bearing early on is the perceived risk of loss of&#xD;
      correction of the angle, although in practice this effect appears to be a rare occurrence .&#xD;
      For example, in a series of patients Takeuchi and colleagues showed that full weight-bearing&#xD;
      is possible two weeks after surgery without implications for the correction made to the joint&#xD;
      angle .&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is imperative that the open wedge is healed and repopulated by new bone, to strengthen the&#xD;
      tibia and allow full recovery following HTO. Regeneration will take place naturally, although&#xD;
      some surgeons apply aids to promote bone healing, such as the ChronOS Î²-tricalcium phosphate&#xD;
      wedge. However, research into this aspect of filling the wedge has shown that there is no&#xD;
      advantage to using the filler - both in terms of stability and bone healing time of the wedge&#xD;
      . Although fixed systems like Tomofix facilitate early weight-bearing of the affected joint,&#xD;
      the complete closure and consolidation of the wedge takes considerably longer. In one study,&#xD;
      23 /27 (85%) osteotomies were fully healed twelve months after procedure . Histologically,&#xD;
      there is variability in the degree of healing and indeed maturation of bone regeneration&#xD;
      achieved in the tibial wedge. With current fixed plate devices, even two years&#xD;
      post-procedure, a minor subset of patients will not have significant signs of regeneration in&#xD;
      the surgical site. In the majority of patients, partial bone regeneration with&#xD;
      fibrocartilaginous tissue takes place and in some patients by new regenerated fibrocartilage&#xD;
      or hyaline-like cartilage will appear .&#xD;
&#xD;
      HTO could be improved upon to allow an earlier return to activities by patients and to&#xD;
      achieve better rates of healing - both in terms of time and maturity of the regenerated bone.&#xD;
      Ellipse Technologies have devised a new nail system for high tibial osteotomy that differs&#xD;
      from the established 'locked' plate and nail systems. Their system functions in a more&#xD;
      gradual fashion. The wedge is created in the tibia as per normal but then the Ellipse nail is&#xD;
      inserted and per day the nail is extended in small measures (appr 1.5 mm per day) until the&#xD;
      desired correction has been achieved. Currently the new Ellipse system is being trialed in&#xD;
      various countries in Europe, including the Netherlands and the UK. The main Ellipse trial is&#xD;
      seeking to establish whether the corrective power of this medical device is more accurate&#xD;
      than the plate/nail systems in use at present. The degree of bone regeneration in the open&#xD;
      wedge is reported on, but not in detail - e.g. by one reporting radiologist - and by using&#xD;
      standard X-ray imaging which is primarily used for angle measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This present study seeks to explore in more detail how the Tomofix and Ellipse high-tibial&#xD;
      osteotomy systems function in relation to bone regeneration in the open-wedge created as part&#xD;
      of the procedure by utilising CT imaging techniques rather than standard clinical X-ray&#xD;
      imaging. The primary aim of osteotomy is realignment of the joint and thereby preserves the&#xD;
      joint so that the patient can continue to enjoy the active life style, sports and&#xD;
      recreational activities. After an osteotomy procedure, whenever a patient asks for advice to&#xD;
      the clinician when they can start participating in unrestricted sports activities, clinicians&#xD;
      often find it very difficult to answer this question. This is primarily because it is often&#xD;
      very difficult to quantify the bone healing process precisely on radiographs. By quantifying&#xD;
      the amount of bone healing on CT scan which is more clear and accurate, the clinician can&#xD;
      confidently advise the patient regarding the participation in various sports activities&#xD;
      without ambiguity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, by comparing the bone healing process between Tomofix plate and Ellipse nail,&#xD;
      investigators can make more informed judgement regarding their performance. This research&#xD;
      will also enhance the choice of implant selection in osteotomy patients based on the duration&#xD;
      of bone healing.&#xD;
