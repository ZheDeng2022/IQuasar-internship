      The objectives of the study are to determine the impact of interferon-free treatment for the&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) on peripheral blood immune cell phenotype and soluble immune-related&#xD;
      proteins in blood, while controlling for genetic polymorphisms known to impact HCV-related&#xD;
      immune responses, and to determine the impact of the therapy on the emergence of&#xD;
      drug-resistant HCV. The study design is informed by the researchers recent investigations of&#xD;
      patients receiving HCV treatment. About 4% of patients who had not undergone liver&#xD;
      transplantation experienced hepatic decompensating or another serious event. There were&#xD;
      several cases of bacterial infection and two cases with elevated markers of autoimmune&#xD;
      processes. These events suggest that treatment altered immune responses. About 25% of&#xD;
      patients who had undergone liver transplantation experienced hepatic decompensating or&#xD;
      another serious adverse event. The long term goal is to understand the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      these complications and determine whether HCV treatment can cause an immune reconstitution&#xD;
      syndrome in susceptible patients, while improving antimicrobial defenses in others&#xD;

      drug-resistant HCV. The study design is informed by the researchers' recent investigations of&#xD;

      transplantation experienced hepatic decompensation or another serious event. There were&#xD;
      several cases of bacterial infection and two cases with elevated markers of autoimmune&#xD;

      these complications and determine whether HCV treatment can cause an immune reconstitution&#xD;
      syndrome in susceptible patients, while improving antimicrobial defenses in others The main&#xD;
      questions/objectives to be addressed are (1) to determine the effect of HCV treatment on the&#xD;
      profile of immune cells in blood as assessed by cytometry time of flight (CyTOF)&#xD;
      multiparameter analysis, while controlling for genetic polymorphisms known to be associated&#xD;
      with HCV-related immune responses and, (2) to determine the effect of treatment on&#xD;
      factors/proteins in blood that may be related to immunity and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: New treatments for HCV are significantly more effective than past treatments.&#xD;
      They utilize direct acting antiviral drugs (DAA) and many do not include interferon. The goal&#xD;
      of treatment is to achieve a sustained virological response (SVR). An SVR is indicated by the&#xD;
      absence of detectable HCV RNA in blood 12 weeks after the end of treatment (EOT); this is&#xD;
      called SVR12. The researchers recently investigated outcomes of 514 non-liver transplant (LT)&#xD;
      patients and 43 LT patients who initiated treatment between Dec 2013 and June 2014. Several&#xD;
      patients developed increased levels of markers of autoimmune processes and/or experienced a&#xD;
      bacterial infection. Investigators at other institutions recently reported evidence that DAA&#xD;
      treatment enhances immune cell activation. The combination of the investigators' observations&#xD;
      and the observations of others indicates that a detailed investigation is needed to&#xD;
      understand the events leading to increased immune cell activity and to determine the factors&#xD;
      that may increase the risk of serious adverse events.&#xD;
