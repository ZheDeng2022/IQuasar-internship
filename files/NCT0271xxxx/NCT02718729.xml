    <textblock>
      Anastomotic leak (AL) is a breakdown of a suture line in a surgical anastomosis with a&#xD;
      subsequent leakage of the luminal content. Anastomotic leakage occurs commonly in rectal and&#xD;
      esophageal anastomosis than the other parts of the alimentary tract due to technical&#xD;
      difficulties in accessing these areas and their easily compromised blood supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anastomotic leakage is the most feared complication following rectal resection and&#xD;
      anastomosis. The incidence of anastomotic leakage ranges from 2.8% to more than 15%, with&#xD;
      mortality rate more than 30%. Subclinical anastomotic failure may occur in up to 51% of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anastomotic leakage leads to increase the rate of secondary interventions, re-operations,&#xD;
      longer postoperative hospital stay, increased cost, and major impact on the patient's quality&#xD;
      of life. In the medium to long term, patient may be unfit for post-operative adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      with decreased the disease survival. Furthermore anastomotic leakage itself may increase the&#xD;
      local recurrence, a reduction in overall survival, and a large proportion of patients are&#xD;
      left with a permanent stoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study populations: all patients will sign an informed consent prior to the surgery to be&#xD;
      included in the study, after explanation of the nature of the disease, possible treatment,&#xD;
      and the possibility of stoma formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data recording: basic demographic data are recorded including age and sex of the patient as&#xD;
      well as detailed information on history, risk factors, preoperative diagnostics, surgical&#xD;
      procedure, intraoperative findings, histopathological work-up, and postoperative course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables analysis: the variables are divided into patient-related, tumor-related,&#xD;
      therapy-related, and techniques-related variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative workup: all patients will have detailed clinical history and physical&#xD;
      examination including DRE. Routine laboratory investigations also are included e.g. CBC,&#xD;
      blood glucose level, liver, and kidney function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular workup for rectal cancer are included; full colonoscopy with biopsy,&#xD;
      gastrografin/barium enema, TRUS evaluate degree of invasion of the rectal wall and regional&#xD;
      lymph nodes, abdominal and pelvic CT scan, Chest x-ray or CT scan, CEA level, and EORTC&#xD;
      Quality of life Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level of the tumor: is measured from the lower border of the tumor to the anal verge by the&#xD;
      rigid sigmoidoscope; considering it low &lt; 6 cm, middle 6-12 cm, and upper &gt; 12 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative preparation: all patients will have preoperative mechanical bowel preparation&#xD;
      and adequate thromboembolic prophylaxis. Prophylactic antibiotics will be given 30 - 60&#xD;
      minutes before surgery. A surgeon or stoma therapist will mark the site of the stoma before&#xD;
      the operation in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level of the anastomosis: is measured from the anastomosis to the anal verge by the rigid&#xD;
      sigmoidoscope intraoperative; considering it low &lt; 10 cm, middle 10-15 cm, and upper &gt; 15 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rectal anastomosis is tested intraoperative with: trans-anal air insufflation with the&#xD;
      pelvis immersed with saline to detect bubbles, trans-anal introduction of dye, or competence&#xD;
      of donuts in stapled anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access the postoperative condition locally and systemically by bedsides clinical parameters,&#xD;
      and usual blood tests like leucocyte count and CRP level at the 3rd and the 7th day&#xD;
      postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological follow up by Gastrografin enema around the 10th day or before dismissal from the&#xD;
      hospital. Abdominal and pelvic CT scan is ordered in patients with clinical deterioration,&#xD;
      abnormal abdominal findings, and turbid drainage secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peritoneal samples are collected from the abdominal drains at the first, third, and fifth&#xD;
      days postoperatively for peritoneal microbiological study and cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, and&#xD;
      TNF) level measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC 30, 38) preoperatively, 30 days&#xD;
      postoperative, and 30 days after stoma closure in case of diversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up of patients continue till discharge, and 30 days postoperative. In cases with&#xD;
      diversion follow up will continue till closure of stoma and 30 days after closure. Stoma&#xD;
      closure in an uneventful course will be scheduled 8-10 weeks after the primary operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of leakage:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fecal secretion via indwelling abdominal drainage, surgical wound or vagina.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Radiological via fluid collection adjacent to anastomosis associated with extraluminal&#xD;
           contrast extravasation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classification of leakage: patients classified according to leakage into:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Non leakage group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Leakage group, radiological is asymptomatic and detected on imaging, localized is&#xD;
           diagnosed on radiological findings of a pelvic collection and clinically do not require&#xD;
           a laparotomy or laparoscopy, and generalized is confirmed at laparotomy or laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidences of anastomotic leakage following laparoscopic resection for rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 day's postoperative morbidity and mortality. secondary outcomes: The role of diversion on&#xD;
      prevention of anastomotic leakage, are patients with diversion have low incidences of&#xD;
      leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of anastomotic leakage. Effect of anastomotic leakage on oncological outcome,&#xD;
      assessment of local recurrence after 24 months follow-up.&#xD;
