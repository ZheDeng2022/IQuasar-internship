  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about a medicine called TAK-788, also known as mobocertinib, given to adults&#xD;
      with non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of this study are to check if there are any side effects from TAK-788, to learn&#xD;
      how TAK-788 is processed by the body, and to determine the best dose of TAK-788 to treat this&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take TAK-788 capsules with chemotherapy. Participants will continue to take&#xD;
      TAK-788 unless they or their doctor decide they should stop this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take TAK-788 capsules with or without chemotherapy under antidiarrhea&#xD;
      prevention to determine the safety of TAK-788 treatment.&#xD;

      This phase 1/2 study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of&#xD;
      oral EGFR/HER2 Inhibitor TAK-788 in participants with NSCLC and anti-tumor activity of&#xD;
      TAK-788 in participants with solid tumors other than NSCLC with EGFR or HER2 mutations. The&#xD;
      trial will be conducted in three parts: a dose escalation (Part 1), including Part 1A (dose&#xD;
      escalation combination component of TAK-788 in combination with Pemetrexed/Carboplatin) and&#xD;
      Part 1B (TAK-788 monotherapy and TAK-788 in combination with pemetrexed/carboplatin with&#xD;
      primary antidiarrhea prevention with loperamide.) and expansion phase (Part 2), followed by&#xD;
      an extension phase (Part 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the dose escalation phase (Part 1),dose escalation combination phase (Part&#xD;
      1A, only for selected sites in the United States) and Antidiarrhea Prophylaxis Cohorts ( part&#xD;
      1B, only for selected sites in the United States) are to determine the safety profile of&#xD;
      orally administered TAK-788 and TAK-788 in combination with Pemetrexed/Carboplatin, including&#xD;
      the MTD, DLTs, RP2D,pharmacokinetic profile and with loperamide as primary antidiarrhea&#xD;
      prevention incidence and severity of TAK-788-associated diarrhea and anti-tumor activity of&#xD;
      TAK-788 (Part 1B) . The primary goal of the expansion component of the trial is to evaluate&#xD;
      the anti-tumor activity of TAK-788 in seven histologically and molecularly defined cohorts at&#xD;
      the RP2D (determined based on dose escalation phase of the trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The seven expansion cohorts will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. NSCLC participants with EGFR exon 20 activating insertions, who have either not received&#xD;
           or not shown an objective response to an EGFR TKI, and who have no active, measurable&#xD;
           CNS metastases;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. NSCLC participants with HER2 exon 20 activating insertions or point mutations and no&#xD;
           active, measurable CNS metastases;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. NSCLC participants with EGFR exon 20 activating insertions or HER2 exon 20 activating&#xD;
           insertions or point mutations and active, measurable CNS metastases;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. NSCLC participants with other targets against which TAK-788 is active (examples include&#xD;
           EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 substitutions [with or without T790M mutations] and&#xD;
           other uncommon EGFR activating mutations), without active CNS metastases;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. NSCLC participants with EGFR exon 20 activating insertions, who have previously shown an&#xD;
           objective response to an EGFR TKI and subsequently progressed, without active CNS&#xD;
           metastases;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. NSCLC participants with EGFR exon 20 activating insertions, who have not received prior&#xD;
           systemic anticancer treatment for locally advanced or metastatic disease, without active&#xD;
           CNS metastases; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Participants with solid tumors other than NSCLC with EGFR/HER2 mutations against which&#xD;
           TAK-788 is active, without active CNS metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extension phase will evaluate efficacy of TAK-788 in participants with locally advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors harbor EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and who have been&#xD;
      previously treated. The study will enroll approximately 395 participants.&#xD;
