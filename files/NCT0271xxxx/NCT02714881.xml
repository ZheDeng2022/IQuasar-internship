  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to elucidate the relationship between inflammation and&#xD;
      lipoprotein atherogenicity, and to determine the relative contribution of inflammation and&#xD;
      lipids to CV risk in RA. The central hypothesis of this study is that inflammation and&#xD;
      lipoprotein atherogenicity is tightly linked such that both factors are important to assess&#xD;
      CV risk in RA. Further, the investigators hypothesize that this relationship is obscured by a&#xD;
      consideration of routine lipids alone.&#xD;
