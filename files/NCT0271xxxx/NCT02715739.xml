      Research question Is there a difference in the mortality prediction performance of two ICISS&#xD;
      approaches for trauma patients admitted to hospitals in urban India?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The investigators will conduct a retrospective registry based study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting The data that will be used is from a prospective cohort study named towards improved&#xD;
      trauma care outcomes in India (TITCO). It was collected from four public university hospitals&#xD;
      in India between October 2013 and January 2015. The hospitals are in Mumbai, Delhi and&#xD;
      Kolkata. The two centers in Mumbai were King Edward Memorial Hospital and Lokmanya Tilak&#xD;
      Municipal General Hospital. The one in Delhi was Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center and&#xD;
      the one in Kolkata was the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research and Seth&#xD;
      Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data was collected by one trained project officer at each hospital, working eight-hour&#xD;
      shifts with a rotating schedule between day, evening and night shifts. Data from patients&#xD;
      admitted outside of the shift hours was collected retrospectively within days of arrival to&#xD;
      hospital. The patients were followed until discharge, death or to a maximum of 30 days. If&#xD;
      discharged, the patients were considered to be alive at 30 days. There was no follow-up after&#xD;
      patient discharge or after the 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source and method of participant selection Project officers included consecutive patients&#xD;
      that presented to participating hospitals. Patients were included either by direct&#xD;
      observation during the project officers' shifts or by retrospective data extraction from&#xD;
      patient records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources/ measurement Patient mortality data was extracted from patient records, as was&#xD;
      data on all covariates. If covariate data was missing in records an attempt was made to&#xD;
      retrieve this data from the patient or patient relatives. The injury data was extracted from&#xD;
      patient records, including imaging reports and intraoperative findings. Protocols from&#xD;
      post-mortem examinations were not available. Injuries will be coded using ICD-10. The SRR for&#xD;
      an ICD-code will be calculated by dividing the number of fatal outcomes for each ICD-code by&#xD;
      the total number of patients with that ICD-code. This results in a number from 0 to 1 that is&#xD;
      interpreted as the patient survival ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, if 65 out of 100 patients with a given ICD-code survived the SRR for that code&#xD;
      would be 0,65. That would mean 65% of the patients with that ICD code survived. In this&#xD;
      study, the SRRs used for ICISS calculations were taken from a publicly available SRR-set&#xD;
      calculated from the TITCO dataset (TO BE RELEASED). The ICISS for each patient will then be&#xD;
      calculated using two different approaches. The cICISS will be calculated as the product of&#xD;
      all of the patient's SRRs. The swiICISS will be equal to the patient's lowest SRR. Both ICISS&#xD;
      methods result in a number that ranges from 0 to 1 that should be interpreted as the patient&#xD;
      specific probability of survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias The project officers were trained by project management. They were not involved in&#xD;
      patient care and only acquired data by observing hospital staff, using patient records or&#xD;
      from patient relatives. All project officers had at least a health science master's degree&#xD;
      and were continuously supervised by project management. Injury coders will be blinded to&#xD;
      patient demographics and mortality data during the conversion from free-text injuries to&#xD;
      ICD-codes and will be trained prior to the ICD-10 coding using the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO) ICD-10 online training module. They will gain access to the injury dataset first after&#xD;
      reaching 80% agreement in several samples of 50 injuries compared to an external coder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study size The sample size calculation is based on published recommendations on effective&#xD;
      sample sizes needed to validate prediction models. These recommendations are based on&#xD;
      simulations of the sample sizes needed to detect statistically significant differences in&#xD;
      predictive performance measures between two scores setting the power to 80% and the&#xD;
      significance level to 5%. Hence, the required sample size was calculated to include the most&#xD;
      recent 200 consecutive events, i.e. patients who died within 24 hours, and all non-events&#xD;
      enrolled during the same time period. Mortality within 24 hours for was used for the sample&#xD;
      size calculation as the investigators wanted the study to be powered for secondary outcomes&#xD;
      also.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative variables All quantitative variables will be analyzed as continuous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods and analyses The investigators will use R for all statistical analyses.&#xD;
      Predictive performance will be assessed in terms of discrimination and calibration.&#xD;
      Discrimination will be assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristics curve (AUROCC) and calibration will be assessed by comparing observed and&#xD;
      predicted outcomes visually in a calibration plot and statistically by calculating the&#xD;
      calibration slope. Confidence intervals for predictive performance measures will be estimated&#xD;
      using a bootstrap approach (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overlapping confidence intervals will be interpreted as evidence of lack of a statistically&#xD;
      significant difference. Parametric and non-parametric exact tests will be used as&#xD;
      appropriate, with 95% confidence intervals and a 5% significance level. The main analysis&#xD;
      will be a complete case analysis, in which observations with missing values in any of the&#xD;
      following variables will be excluded: time of arrival, age, sex, mechanism of injury,&#xD;
      transfer status, and outcome variables. Observations with no injuries reported will be&#xD;
      assigned ICISS scores of 1 and for each observation the final ICISS scores will be calculated&#xD;
      based only on SRRs for ICD-codes that occur at least ten times in the published SRR-set used&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The published SRR-set includes SRRs based on both mortality within 30 days, henceforth&#xD;
      referred to as SRR-30D, and SRRs based on mortality within 24 hours, henceforth referred to&#xD;
      as SRR-24H. The investigators will use these SRRs to calculate cICISS and swiICISS for each&#xD;
      patient, henceforth referred to as cICISS-30D, cICISS-24H, swiICISS-30D and swiICISS-24H.&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators will assess and compare the performance of cICISS-30D and&#xD;
      swiICISS-30D in predicting mortality within 30 days and within 24 hours, and repeat this&#xD;
      analysis for cICISS-24H and swiICISS-24H.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses Four sensitivity analyses will be conducted. In the first sensitivity&#xD;
      analysis the investigators will only include observations with complete outcome data, however&#xD;
      missing values in covariates were allowed. In the second sensitivity analysis the&#xD;
      investigators will exclude observations without any reported injury. In the third sensitivity&#xD;
      analysis the investigators calculated cICISS and swiICISS based on all available SRRs,&#xD;
      regardless of how frequently the corresponding ICD-10 codes occurred in the dataset. Finally,&#xD;
      the investigators calculated the two ICISS scores for each patient based only on unique&#xD;
      ICD-10 codes. In other words, each ICD-10 code was only allowed to contribute with one SRR to&#xD;
      the ICISS scores even if it occurred more than once in the same patient.&#xD;
