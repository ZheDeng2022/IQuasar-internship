      Phase II prospective multicenter study for stage I/II Follicular Lymphoma treated with&#xD;
      involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT) at doses of 24 Gy) with or without Ofatumumab for 8 weekly&#xD;
      doses on molecular basis. Patients with positive basal Bcl-2 will be followed every 3 months&#xD;
      and with Bcl-2 detection every 6 months for 3 years. Patient with negative basal Bcl-2 will&#xD;
      be followed every 3 months without further Bcl-2 detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ofatumumab treatment will be administered to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with positive basal PCR for Bcl-2-IgH rearrangement in BM and/or PB, resulting&#xD;
           still positive after IFRT;&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stage I/IIA follicular lymphoma (FL) is considered a localized disease that can be adequately&#xD;
      treated with radiotherapy alone. This strategy is recommended by the guidelines of the&#xD;
      &quot;Società Italiana di Ematologia&quot; (SIE) and of the &quot;European Society for Medical Oncology&quot;&#xD;
      (ESMO) The accurate definition of the truly localised forms represents a crucial issue in&#xD;
      order to ensure an appropriate treatment design for such patients. The characteristic&#xD;
      t(14;18) translocation, which leads to the over-expression of the Bcl-2 gene, is found in&#xD;
      approximately 85% of FL; cells bearing this translocation can be detected in the peripheral&#xD;
      blood (PB) or bone marrow (BM) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCR for the t(14;18) translocation provides a sensitive device to identify the presence of&#xD;
      minimal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cell contamination. Previous experiences have demonstrated&#xD;
      that despite the limited stage, Bcl-2/IgH+ cells can be found at diagnosis in PB and/or BM of&#xD;
      the majority of the patients. After treatment with local radiotherapy confined to the&#xD;
      involved lymph node(s) only, disappearance of circulating Bcl-2/IgH+ cells in PB and/or BM&#xD;
      was demonstrated in approximately 60% of positive patients. Quantitative PCR demonstrated the&#xD;
      feasibility of clearing PB and BM Bcl-2+ cells after local irradiation of the primary site of&#xD;
      the disease only when the basal number of lymphoma cells was &lt;1:100 000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment has clearly demonstrated, both alone and in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, a high therapeutic potential in FL. A&#xD;
      significant impact of treatment with the anti CD20 monoclonal antibody in reducing the&#xD;
      minimal residual disease in FL has been demonstrated in several studies when used as&#xD;
      consolidation or during the maintenance phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No data are currently available concerning the ability of anti-CD20 antibody treatment in&#xD;
      reducing the proportion of Bcl-2 positive residual cells after radiotherapy in localized FL.&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to take advantage of the therapeutic potential of anti-CD20&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody to reduce or eliminate minimal residual disease in patients with FL in&#xD;
      localized stage (I/II) after conventional treatment with local radiotherapy of the involved&#xD;
      site(s). The effectiveness of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment will be determined by&#xD;
      the proportion of negativization of residual Bcl-2 positive cells after radiotherapy,&#xD;
      evaluated by qualitative and quantitative PCR detection of viable Bcl-2/IgH rearranged cells&#xD;
      in PB and/or BM.&#xD;
