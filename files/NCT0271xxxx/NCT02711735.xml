    <criteria>

        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, a subject must meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with pulmonary MDR-TB, and therefore managed with second line TB drugs;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Admitted in a TB unit / hospital routinely diagnosed with pulmonary MDR-TB with&#xD;
             clinical status ≥ 6 with Bandim TB score combined with chest radiography; and&#xD;
             microbiological criteria according to the medical history), using rapid genetic&#xD;
             testing (GeneXpert TB test) and MGIT to confirm or Line Probe Assay; or classical&#xD;
             diagnostic tools including sputum microscopy and culture followed by phenotypic drug&#xD;
             susceptibility testing. All of this medical information will be in the medical&#xD;
             history;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females and males aged ≥ 18; females of non-childbearing potential: at least 2 years&#xD;
             post-menopausal or surgically sterile (e.g. tubal ligation); females of childbearing&#xD;
             potential (including females less than 2 years post-menopausal) must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test at enrolment and must agree to use highly effective methods of birth&#xD;
             control (i.e. diaphragm plus spermicide or male condom plus spermicide, oral&#xD;
             contraceptive in combination with a second method, contraceptive implant, injectable&#xD;
             contraceptive, indwelling intrauterine device, sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized&#xD;
             partner) while participating in the study and for 30 days after end of the study for&#xD;
             each group; males must agree to use a double barrier method of contraception (condom&#xD;
             plus spermicide or diaphragm plus spermicide) while participating in the study and for&#xD;
             30 days after end of the study for the respective group; or the male patient or his&#xD;
             female partner must be surgically sterile (e.g. vasectomy, tubal ligation) or the&#xD;
             female partner must be post-menopausal;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must provide written informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be willing and able to attend all study visits and comply with all&#xD;
             study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having successfully completed 16, 8 or 4 weeks (depending on the cohort) of MDR-TB&#xD;
             treatment, fully supervised, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  With beneficial initial response to therapy, evidenced by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinical response criteria: patients admitted in a TB unit / hospital routinely diagnosed&#xD;
        with pulmonary MDR-TB (according to clinical status ≤ 5 with Bandim TB score) (33).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Transient deterioration of chest radiographic abnormalities might be explained by a&#xD;
        paradoxical inflammatory response, and this may therefore not necessarily be interpreted as&#xD;
        treatment failure; such decision depends on consensus with the DSMB; evidence of&#xD;
        improvement on chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Microbiological response criteria: It has to be reported a reduction of the bacillary&#xD;
        load in the sputum by means of the reduction of bacillary counts in GeneXpert TB test and&#xD;
        liquid culture (MGIT) to confirm (diagnosis week 0 collected in the medical history) at&#xD;
        week 4 in CohortsC, week 8 in both Cohorts (A-B) and week 12 and 16 in Cohort A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        A potential subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from&#xD;
        participation in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to provide written informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women reported, or detected, or willing to be pregnant during the trial period;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severity of illness precluding full evaluation: expected early death, evidenced by&#xD;
             respiratory failure, low blood pressure, WHO performance score 3-4; Central Nervous&#xD;
             System involvement of TB (TB meningitis, intra-cranial tuberculomas) as there is too&#xD;
             little evidence for effective drug penetration for second-line TB drugs;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major co-morbid conditions precluding full evaluation, i.e., active lung cancer, acute&#xD;
             coronary syndrome, heart failure exceeding NYHA class 2; a diagnosis of metastasized&#xD;
             malignancy; renal failure in excess of creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min calculated by&#xD;
             the Cockcroft-Gault formula, which would severely complicate administration of&#xD;
             aminoglycosides and capreomycin, considered as the major second-line TB drugs; obesity&#xD;
             (BMI&gt;30 kg/m2); chronic liver disease - Child-Pugh class C;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any of the following laboratory parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;

        normal (ULN) Total bilirubine &gt; 2 x ULN Neutrophil count ≤ 500 neutrophils / mm3 Platelet&#xD;
        count &lt; 50,000 cells / mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving or anticipated to receive a daily dose of ≥ 10 mg of systemic prednisone or&#xD;
             equivalent within the period starting 14 days prior to enrolment. Note: patients are&#xD;
             allowed to receive an acute, short course of methylprednisolone or prednisone or&#xD;
             equivalent for management of an acute exacerbation of COPD or reactive airway disease&#xD;
             in asthmatics;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the previous 3 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV co-infection, if CD4 count &lt; 250 cells/mm3 at the diagnosis of HIV; those with &gt;&#xD;
             250 copies/mL are expected to be able to mount a sufficient cellular immune response&#xD;
             and will therefore be eligible;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood transfusion in the last three weeks prior to the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented allergy to TB vaccines, notably, to the RUTI® vaccine.&#xD;
