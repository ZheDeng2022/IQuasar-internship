      Patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPCA) with osseous metastatic disease&#xD;
      planning to undergo Ra-223 therapy may be eligible for this study. Positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET/CT) imaging will use the investigational radiotracer [11C]acetate. Imaging&#xD;
      will occur prior to Ra-223 therapy and after 2 cycles, in addition to standard of care&#xD;
      99mTcMDP bone scan at baseline and a research 99mTc-MDP bone scan post-therapy&#xD;

             their treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide&#xD;
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior&#xD;

             deprivation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic radioisotope therapy within 24 weeks prior to study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eminent or established cord compression as assessed by medical record review&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hemibody external radiotherapy as assessed by medical record review&#xD;

             physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious or unstable medical or psychological comorbidities that, in the opinion of the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Documented visceral metastases or current lymphadenopathy &gt; 3 cm by standard imaging&#xD;
             (e.g. MRI, CT, ultrasound, FDG PET/CT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only individuals (aged 18 or over) who can understand and give informed consent will&#xD;
             be eligible to participate in this study. Individuals who are considered to be&#xD;

             capacity. Economically disadvantaged persons will not be vulnerable to undue&#xD;
             influence, as this study offers no compensation. All individuals will be told that&#xD;
             their choice regarding study participation will in no way change their access to&#xD;
             clinical care. This should negate any undue influence or coercion. Women, children,&#xD;
             fetuses, neonates, or prisoners are not included in this research study.&#xD;
