      A Phase 1b/2 Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of HBI-8000 in Combination with&#xD;
      Nivolumab in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors Including Melanoma, Renal Cell Carcinoma&#xD;
      (RCC), and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate the safety and tolerability of HBI-8000 when combined with a standard dose and&#xD;
      regimen of nivolumab, and to evaluate frequency and severity of toxicities of this&#xD;
      combination treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the efficacy of study treatment as measured by Objective Response Rate (ORR),&#xD;
           Disease Control Rate (DCR), Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Duration of Response (DoR),&#xD;
           Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in all subjects treated at RP2D&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain pharmacokinetics of twice weekly HBI-8000 when administered in combination&#xD;
           with nivolumab administered once every two weeks (Phase 1b all sites)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain pharmacokinetics of twice weekly HBI-8000 when administered in combination&#xD;
           with nivolumab administered per package insert dose and administration (Phase 2 selected&#xD;
           sites)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the effect of HBI-8000 on the electrocardiogram QT corrected (QTc)&#xD;
           interval (Phase 1b only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the kinetics and extent of histone acetylation in peripheral blood&#xD;
           mononuclear cells (PBMC) at the RP2D of HBI-8000 (Phase 2 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore potential biomarkers for disease response through sequential sampling of&#xD;
           blood and/or tumor tissue in subjects consenting to correlative sub-studies at&#xD;
           participating sites (Phase 2 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation (Phase 1b) will include up to 18 subjects, followed by Cohort Expansion&#xD;
      (Phase 2) including up to 100 subjects (melanoma up to 60 subjects and NSCLC up to 40&#xD;
      subjects at MTD and/or RP2D.&#xD;
