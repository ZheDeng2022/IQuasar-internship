  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to surveys, 13% to 20% of the Service Médical d'Urgence (SAMU) centre 15 (French&#xD;
      911) calls concern elderly patients above 75 years of age. For these patients, the clinical&#xD;
      pathway should be decided on the basis of the symptomatology described during the call, but&#xD;
      also with the gathering of specific data such as medical social and psychological evaluation.&#xD;
      These items allow the regulating doctor to assess comorbidity, on-going treatment,&#xD;
      psycho-cognitive status, previous hospitalisations, social situation, and patient&#xD;
      expectations and needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, data collected in order to assess the situation on the phone and take the&#xD;
      orientation decision are mainly limited to the severity of clinical symptoms. Medical,&#xD;
      psychological and social aspects are rarely gathered, for several reasons :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phone call shortness : emergency calls should be treated quickly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regulating doctors are not trained to take in account the specificities or geriatric&#xD;
           patients in their decision making. Besides, they are not informed about alternatives to&#xD;
           the hospital emergency department, such as &quot;geriatric channel&quot; system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An observational study was performed in 2012 on 692 calls about elderly patients referred to&#xD;
      the SAMU centre 15 during 7 days : 63% of these patients were transferred to an emergency&#xD;
      department. Regardless of severe cases &quot;hospital regulation&quot;, 55% of the least serious cases&#xD;
      (&quot;liberal regulation&quot;) were transferred to an emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulation is inadequate to elderly patients for whom 1) the situation assessment and the&#xD;
      appropriate decision making require specific items that are not known by regulating doctors,&#xD;
      2) the medical care and the clinical pathway could be improved by the knowledge of on-field&#xD;
      &quot;geriatric channel&quot;, 3) the emergency department care is particularly long, 4) and could be&#xD;
      pernicious to younger patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1920 patients will be recruited between January 2016 and August 2017, including a 6 months&#xD;
      wash-out in order to train regulating doctors. This training will include geriatric patient's&#xD;
      specificities, and geriatric channels. A 12% difference between the 2 groups (before and&#xD;
      after the training) is expected, considering a 80% statistical power. The design is a time&#xD;
      series experiment.&#xD;
