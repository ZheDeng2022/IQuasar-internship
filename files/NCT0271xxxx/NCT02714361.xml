  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron is one of the most vital elements in humans as it plays a role in physiological&#xD;
      functions such as transferring and storing oxygen, transporting electrons and catalysing&#xD;
      numerous reactions, from oxidative metabolism to cellular proliferation. Iron deficiency can&#xD;
      be attributed to poor absorption that leads to insufficient iron to meet body requirements.&#xD;
      Oral iron supplements have been extensively used to treat iron deficiency and iron deficiency&#xD;
      anaemia. However, the use of iron compounds in fortifying foods is one of the best practical&#xD;
      approach to combat iron deficiency, while improving diet and food pattern involves long-term&#xD;
      goal which can be challenging. Vitamin D has recently been shown to affect hepcidin levels,&#xD;
      which in turn has effects on iron status but there are a limited number of studies&#xD;
      investigating the hepcidin profile in humans following iron supplementation, and few data are&#xD;
      available, especially in humans, despite its role as a primary iron absorption and&#xD;
      homeostasis regulator. Although several studies have been carried out using iron fortified&#xD;
      products, there is limited data on the potential effect of vitamin D on iron metabolism&#xD;
      amongst iron deficient women in particular. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation (1500 IU) consumed with iron fortified breakfast&#xD;
      cereals on haematological indicators and hepcidin response in iron deficient women.&#xD;

      Recruitment And Sampling Strategy :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited within the University of Chester, UK only. Emails and&#xD;
      posters/leaflets will be used as a medium of advertisement to the target group (staff and&#xD;
      students). A total of 62 pre-menopausal women aged between 19 to 40 years old will be&#xD;
      included in the study based on criteria described below. Eligibility will be based upon serum&#xD;
      ferritin and also vitamin D concentrations at screening before the start of the study.&#xD;
      Participants will be required to complete a screening questionnaire which will provide&#xD;
      information about participant's health status, drugs/medication/supplement usage, and recent&#xD;
      occurrences of illness/trauma/injury. A 6 ml venous blood will be drawn to assess&#xD;
      concentrations of plasma ferritin vitamin D, haemoglobin and full blood counts, Participants&#xD;
      with plasma ferritin concentrations below 20.0 µg/L and vitamin D concentration below 250&#xD;
      nmol/l will be included in the study. If the levels of haemoglobin are found to be in severe&#xD;
      stage of anaemia, the potential participant will be notified and advised to consult their&#xD;
      General Practitioner (GP) (haemoglobin levels &lt; 8.0 g/dL). All eligible participants will be&#xD;
      briefed on the study protocol before the beginning of the study, and the eligible&#xD;
      participants will be given a Participant Information Sheet (PIS) and asked to provide written&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An 8 week, double blind, randomised controlled trial will be carried out in Chester, United&#xD;
      Kingdom (UK). The 8 week intervention period was selected since more than 1 month is&#xD;
      appropriate to generally enlarge the erythropoietic marrow and observe changes in red blood&#xD;
      cell indices, especially in non-anaemic groups. Most vitamin D studies have used a supplement&#xD;
      concentration of 1000 IU and reported no adverse effects in the participants. Some studies&#xD;
      have used higher doses of 1600 or 4000 IU with no reported adverse outcomes in the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fe group (iron fortified breakfast cereals and placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vitamin D group (iron fortified breakfast cereals and vitamin D3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will consume 60 grams of iron fortified breakfast cereals containing a total&#xD;
      of 9 mg of iron daily for 8 weeks with either vitamin D3 placebo or vitamin D3 (1500 IU)&#xD;
      according to their assigned group. The participants will consume the iron fortified breakfast&#xD;
      cereals in the morning, with 200 ml of semi-skimmed milk daily for a period of 8 weeks. The&#xD;
      participants will consume the vitamin D or placebo in the evening with 200 ml of water.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to maintain their dietary habits and physical activity during the&#xD;
      course of study. Participants will also be asked not to donate blood during the course of the&#xD;
      study. The remaining supplements will be returned at the final clinic (week 8), and&#xD;
      compliance will be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to attend 3 clinics in total over a period of 8 weeks, and they&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline (Day 0), interim (Week 4) and post intervention (Week 8).&#xD;
      Participants will be requested to fast overnight for approximately 8 hours before all&#xD;
      clinics. At each clinic, a 30 ml blood sample will be taken and both height (cm) and weight&#xD;
      (kg) will be measured. Before the start and the end of the study, participants will be&#xD;
      required to keep a 3-day food diary which includes 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day to represent&#xD;
      the habitual dietary intake of the participant. Blood samples will be batch analysed at the&#xD;
      end of the intervention to assess all biomarkers of iron status and vitamin D metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and justification :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was estimated using iron supplementation data from a study carried out by&#xD;
      Scholz-Ahrens et al. (2004) in which a serum ferritin concentration post intervention at 8&#xD;
      weeks (mean ± S.D) of 17.7 ± 11.8 ug/l (Fe fortified milk group) and 10.6 ± 8.1 ug/l (non&#xD;
      fortified milk group) was reported. With an effect size of 0.7015447, the total sample size&#xD;
      required for each group in the proposed study is 26. Taking into account a 20% drop out rate,&#xD;
      the total sample size required is 31 (Power = 0.80). Therefore, the total sample size needed&#xD;
      for the whole study is 62. Sample size was estimated using of G Power Software Version 3.1.7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses will be conducted with International Business Machines (IBM)&#xD;
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Statistic Data Editor Software (Version&#xD;
      21). Assuming that the data is normally distributed after performing a Shapiro Wilks&#xD;
      normality test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures will be conducted&#xD;
      to compare the mean differences for all measured parameters within each group at baseline,&#xD;
      interim and post intervention. The changes in the measured parameters between the periods of&#xD;
      the study will be analysed using paired t-test. Pearson's correlation test will be performed&#xD;
      to investigate the relationship between hepcidin profile and iron status biomarkers. A&#xD;
      non-parametric approach will be adopted if the data is not normally distributed for all&#xD;
      analyses. Differences will be considered significant with a p value ≤ 0.05.&#xD;
