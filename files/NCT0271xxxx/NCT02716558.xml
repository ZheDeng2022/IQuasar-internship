      It is a clinical trial which employs a split mouth design to assess the retention of a&#xD;
      moisture tolerant resin based sealant and the ART(Atraumatic restorative treatment) sealants&#xD;
      on a representative sample of 7- 12 year old school children of a district in Belgaum,&#xD;
      Karnataka, India.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dental caries is a diet dependent, transmissible, micro biologically mediated disease, which&#xD;
      follows both an infectious and chronic disease model that progresses slowly with periods of&#xD;
      quiescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the literature available, it is understood that although dental caries is on the decline&#xD;
      in many of the developed countries, it still remains unchanged with regards to pits and&#xD;
      fissure caries of occlusal surfaces of the teeth. This increase in susceptibility is due to&#xD;
      its inherent morphological structure which makes a person unable to maintain cleanliness&#xD;
      devoid of food lodgement.. Although pits and fissures of occlusal surfaces form only 12.5% of&#xD;
      all tooth surfaces yet, they constitute more than 2/3rd of total caries experience among&#xD;
      young permanent teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevention of dental caries not only includes measures to prevent the occurrence of&#xD;
      disease, such as risk factor reduction, but also to arrest the progress of disease and reduce&#xD;
      the consequences of disease once it is established Creativity in this effort against fissure&#xD;
      caries continues, with newer materials and technology tested each year. The traditional&#xD;
      preventive methods, such as diet control and fluoride therapy effectively prevent dental&#xD;
      caries on smooth tooth surfaces, but they have not been satisfactory methods to control&#xD;
      caries in pit and fissures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time that acid etch bonding was first described by Buonocore in 1955 , bonding was a&#xD;
      new technology, and a logical step in its use was the prevention of pit and fissure decay.&#xD;
      The focus of Buonocore's work was the development of a sealant to prevent occlusal caries on&#xD;
      posterior teeth.Thus, resin sealants were born. Acid treatment of enamel or dentin, whether a&#xD;
      priory or concomitant bonding step, has been integrated into methods to retain materials and&#xD;
      significantly reduce micro leakage at material tooth interfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pit and fissure sealant is a &quot;cement or resin material which is introduced into unprepared&#xD;
      occlusal pit and fissure of caries susceptible teeth, forming a mechanical and physical&#xD;
      protective layer against the action of acid producing bacteria and their substrate&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pit and fissure sealants introduced by Cueto and Buonocore in 1967 have been accepted as an&#xD;
      efficient caries preventive method. For most of the period since the introduction of the&#xD;
      sealants, the focus has been on Bis-GMA resin based materials. Resin based sealants have been&#xD;
      tested on many occasions and have generally been shown to be an effective method of caries&#xD;
      prevention for children and young adults,. The efficacy of these resin sealants in preventing&#xD;
      caries has been associated with the duration and degree of sealant retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the application of resin based sealants demands total moisture control as they are&#xD;
      hydrophobic in nature and is often only possible to a limited extent particularly in children&#xD;
      with low compliance. Ideally, a material combining the attributes of resin based sealants,&#xD;
      such as good retention and good physical properties with moisture tolerance would be&#xD;
      desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a unique moisture tolerant resin based sealant called the embrace wet bond sealant&#xD;
      has been introduced. Embrace incorporates di-tri and multi-functional acrylate monomers into&#xD;
      an advanced acid integrating chemistry that is activated by moisture. The advantages are wet&#xD;
      bonding, tooth integrating, better retention, superior marginal seal, less technique&#xD;
      sensitive and increased fluoride release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another class of sealants that have been developed are the glass inomer based sealants and&#xD;
      these are primarily indicated for subjects, where in total moisture control is not&#xD;
      achievable. These sealants, although being hydrophilic have a major drawback which is the low&#xD;
      retentivity. In order to overcome this drawback, high viscosity glass inomer cements using&#xD;
      the ART approach have been introduced as sealant materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A notable point which has been to be given further consideration is the fact that although&#xD;
      the embrace wet bond sealant (resin based sealant) and the ART sealant (GIC based sealant)&#xD;
      belong to different classes of sealants, they can be indicated in conditions where total&#xD;
      moisture control is impossible to achieve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an absolute lack of information regarding the relative performance of the moisture&#xD;
      tolerant resin based sealant (embrace wet bond sealant) against the ART sealants and&#xD;
      therefore this clinical trial will evaluate the retention and the caries preventive aspect of&#xD;
      the above said materials among a representative sample of 7- 10 year old caries prone&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
