  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single-blinded, randomized trial comparing AXIOS FCSEMS (Fully&#xD;
      Covered Self Expanding Metal Stent) and plastic stents for EUS (Endoscopic Ultrasound)-guided&#xD;
      management of infected and/or symptomatic WON (Walled Off Necrosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to either FCSEMS or plastic stents for EUS-guided drainage of WON&#xD;
      in a 1:1 manner. Following EUS-guided drainage patients in both groups will be assessed pre-&#xD;
      procedure, pre -discharge, weeks 1, 6 and months 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Information will&#xD;
      also be collected from any subsequent hospital admissions related to their walled-off&#xD;
      necrosis.&#xD;

      Consenting eligible patients will sign an IRB (Institutional Review Board)-approved, written&#xD;
      informed consent to verify their willingness to participate in this study. Informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained on the day of their scheduled endoscopic drainage procedure and will occur&#xD;
      at the time of consent to undergo the endoscopic drainage procedure (standard of care).&#xD;
      Consent for the study will be obtained by one of the participating endoscopists and/or a&#xD;
      research assistant. Subjects will receive a copy of the signed and dated informed consent&#xD;
      document. Original informed consent documents will be maintained on-file at each&#xD;
      participating center and will be made available for review upon request by coordinating&#xD;
      center team or IRB, and/or any additional oversight organizations. A note may be made in the&#xD;
      subject's hospital chart regarding participation in the research study. Once consented and&#xD;
      enrolled into the trial, subjects will be issued a unique code to be used on data collection&#xD;
      forms and other research records throughout the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation, Imaging and Endoscopic Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on anti-platelet therapy or anticoagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Warfarin is to be stopped prior to the procedure per institutional guidelines..&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients on heparin:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is held for 12 hours and restarted&#xD;
                the day after the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Intravenous heparin drip is stopped per institutional guideline prior to the&#xD;
                procedure and restarted 12 hours after the drainage procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Aspirin can be continued until the day of the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clopidogrel and other anti-platelet agents are to be stopped per institutional&#xD;
           guidelines prior to the procedure and restarted the day after the procedure. In patients&#xD;
           with placement of drug-eluting stents within one year, the risk of cessation of&#xD;
           clopidogrel will have to be weighed against the risk of bleeding during the drainage&#xD;
           procedure. In that case, cardiology may be consulted so that the best course of action&#xD;
           can be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging prior to EUS-guided drainage&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) / MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography)&#xD;
           with gadolinium will be performed in all patients to assess the WON. In patients with&#xD;
           contraindications to MRI, a CECT ( Contrast Enhanced, Computed Tomography)&#xD;
           abdomen/pelvis will be obtained instead. In patients with contraindication to both&#xD;
           MRI/MRCP and intravenous iodinated contrast (such as history of anaphylactic reaction to&#xD;
           iodinated contrast agents or renal impairment with eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2), a&#xD;
           non-contrast enhanced CT will be performed. All imaging will be interpreted by the&#xD;
           designated GI/abdominal radiologist at each participating center and also by an&#xD;
           appointed multidisciplinary panel to determine suitability for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In addition to MRI/CT, EUS will be utilized at the time of the drainage procedure in the&#xD;
           final determination of the percentage of pancreatic necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) will not be mandatory prior to&#xD;
           EUS-guided drainage as the incidence of disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome (DPDS) is&#xD;
           high and the placement of a pancreatic duct stent is unlikely to be helpful in this&#xD;
           case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic Drainage&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intravenous antibiotic (e.g. ciprofloxacin, levofloxaen or augmentin) is administered on&#xD;
           the day of the procedure. Oral antibiotics will be continued for ten days following&#xD;
           drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All procedures are performed under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. One drainage site is created in all WON, regardless of size or stent type.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Percutaneous drainage is not undertaken prior to EUS-guided drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Insertion of plastic stents:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. WON is first identified using EUS, and punctured using a 19G needle. 20cc of the&#xD;
                pancreatic fluid is aspirated and sent for CEA, amylase, cell count, gram stain and&#xD;
                culture with sensitivities. A 0.025 or 0.035 inch guidewire is inserted into the&#xD;
                WON through the FNA (Fine Needle Aspirate) needle. A transmural tract is created&#xD;
                using an ERCP catheter (with the use of a needle knife catheter Â± cautery if&#xD;
                needed), and then dilated using a 12-13.5-15mm CRE balloon to a maximum size of&#xD;
                15mm if technically possible. Three 7Fr OR two 10Fr plastic stents are inserted&#xD;
                through the transmural tract into the WON cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. A nasocystic catheter is placed into the WON through the plastic stent and&#xD;
                irrigated every six hours using 250 cc of normal saline for 48 hours. The patient&#xD;
                will remain in-patient for irrigation of the nasocystic catheter. If an attempt at&#xD;
                nasocystic catheter fails the endoscopist will attempt to lavage the cystic cavity&#xD;
                with 2L of saline at that time with 2L of sterile water.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. If placement of the nasocystic catheter and lavage fails and/or is not deemed to be&#xD;
                safe, this will be documented and no further action is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Insertion of AXIOS FCSEMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. WON is first identified using EUS and punctured using a 19G needle. Enough fluid is&#xD;
                aspirated to send for CEA, amylase, cell count, gram stain and culture with&#xD;
                sensitivities.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. A 0.025 or 0.035 inch guidewire is inserted into the WON through the FNA needle. A&#xD;
                transmural tract is created using ERCP dilation catheters or electrocautery devices&#xD;
                ( needle knife catheter or Hot Axios cautery if needed) as described below. The&#xD;
                catheter-based stent delivery system with a 15mm AXIOS stent mounted onto it is&#xD;
                inserted into the endoscope, and introduced into the WON cavity either: 1) after&#xD;
                dilation with endoscopic dilators (4-5-7 French/5-7-10 French push dilators, 4mm,&#xD;
                or 6mm balloons) or 2) using electrocautery mounted on the stent system (&quot;Hot&#xD;
                Axios&quot;). The stent should be positioned so that it lies within both the WON and&#xD;
                enteric lumen. The stent is then deployed so that one flange of the stent is&#xD;
                located within the WON cavity and the other flange is located within the enteric&#xD;
                lumen. The Axios stent is then dilated to at least 13.5-15mm following deployment&#xD;
                using a 12-15mm balloon.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. An attempt at irrigation/lavage of the WON cavity in the endoscopy unit immediately&#xD;
                following stent deployment using 2L of normal saline should be performed. This can&#xD;
                be done using a forward viewing gastroscope or endoscopic accessories (push&#xD;
                dilation catheters, balloon catheters etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Direct endoscopic necrosectomy will not be performed in the same session as the initial&#xD;
           stent placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The following information is collected at the time of initial endoscopic procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Location and size of collection by EUS measurements (two perpendicular&#xD;
                measurements)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Intraprocedure complications (such as bleeding, pneumoperitoneum, perforation,&#xD;
                hemodynamic instability)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Procedure duration&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Initial procedure (start time: advancement of the endoscope into the patient; end&#xD;
           time: withdrawal of the echoendoscope, gastroscope or duodenoscope from the patient at&#xD;
           the end of the procedure)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-procedure management:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Oral antibiotics will be administered for a total of ten days pending the results of&#xD;
           fluid gram stain and culture. Antimicrobial therapy will thereafter be altered based on&#xD;
           fluid culture results as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All patients will be admitted for no less than 48 hours for observation after the index&#xD;
           endoscopic procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Enteral nutrition will be commenced within 48 hours of the procedure via nasogastric&#xD;
           tube, PEG-J (Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube with a jejunal extension),&#xD;
           nasojejunal tube or surgical/endoscopic jejunostomy or through the prompt transition to&#xD;
           oral diet unless contraindicated. Route of enteral nutrition support will be determined&#xD;
           by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In the plastic stent group, the WON is irrigated using 250cc of normal saline every six&#xD;
           hours for total duration of 48 hours. The nasocystic catheter is removed after 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 48-96 hours post-procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MRI/CECT (if contraindication to MRI) is obtained if any of the following criteria are&#xD;
           met:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Persistent symptoms of abdominal pain, gastric outlet obstruction and/or failure to&#xD;
           advance diet b. Ongoing SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) /Sepsis c.&#xD;
           Persistent organ failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the above repeat MRI/CECT fail to show resolution of WON (defined as â¥50% decrease in&#xD;
           volume), a repeat intervention is performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The type of repeat intervention performed is to be determined by the treating physician&#xD;
           and can include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Direct endoscopic necrosectomy (DEN) in unilocular collection with significant&#xD;
                solid component&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Creation of a second drainage site and/or DEN in multi-loculated/large collection&#xD;
                without a significant solid component&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Placement of interventional radiology-guided percutaneous drain in collections not&#xD;
                accessible via the stomach/duodenum&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Repeat interventions are performed at a frequency determined by the treating physician&#xD;
           until the volume of WON has decreased â¥ 50% with clinical improvement, up to maximum of&#xD;
           three sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If there is still inadequate response to treatment (as defined above) after three&#xD;
           endoscopic transmural drainage procedures using the designated stent type (i.e.&#xD;
           procedure #1=stent insertion, procedure #2-3= insertion of more stents into a second&#xD;
           drainage site Â± direct endoscopic necrosectomy Â± percutaneous drain insertion), the&#xD;
           patient is defined as &quot;endoscopic treatment failure&quot;. These patients will be referred&#xD;
           for minimally invasive surgical debridement of WON.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Procedures #2 and 3 will also be undertaken as described above for patients returning to&#xD;
           the hospital in the period following discharge after index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-discharge:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following information is obtained prior to discharge:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Symptoms:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Pain b. Nausea/vomiting c. Malaise d. Oral intake (liquid diet, solid diet, duration&#xD;
           of tolerance to po intake)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Need for repeat endoscopic procedures: percutaneous drain placement, surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. VAS pain score&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 1: (+ or- 2 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone calls are made to all patients to collect the following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. VAS pain score&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. SF-36&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 6: (+ or -7 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Repeat MRI/MRCP with gadolinium (or CECT if MRI contraindicated) is performed to&#xD;
           reassess the size of WON and to look for disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome (DPDS):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. If DPDS is present on MRI/CT, no ERCP is done&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If DPDS if not present on MRI/CT, ERCP is performed the following day to confirm&#xD;
                patency of the pancreatic duct. If a partial pancreatic duct leak is present on&#xD;
                ERCP, a transpapillary stent is placed during the same endoscopic session. Repeat&#xD;
                ERCP with stent exchange is to be performed at the discretion of the endoscopist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the WON is &lt; 10% of its original size (defined as treatment success),:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. All transmural stents are removed if the main pancreatic duct (MPD) is intact.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. If the MPD is disconnected, all but one plastic stent is removed. A single double&#xD;
           pigtail plastic stent will be left in place indefinitely. In patients with FCSEMS and&#xD;
           DPDS, the metal stent is removed and a single 7Fr double pigtail plastic stent is placed&#xD;
           instead and left in place indefinitely. FCSEMS is replaced with double pigtail plastic&#xD;
           stents in this group as thus far the long-term sequelae of inserted AXIOS stents are not&#xD;
           known, including the risk of stent migration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If at or during the first 6 weeks after the initial drainage procedure, there no&#xD;
           resolution of WON and/or persistent symptoms repeat interventions are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The type of repeat intervention performed is to be determined by the treating physician&#xD;
           with suggestions listed below. These can include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Direct endoscopic necrosectomy (DEN) in unilocular collection with significant&#xD;
                solid component&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Creation of a second drainage site and/or DEN in multi-loculated/large collection&#xD;
                without a significant solid component&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Placement of interventional radiology-guided percutaneous drain in collections not&#xD;
                accessible via the stomach/duodenum&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Referral for minimally invasive surgical debridement of WON. Surgical intervention&#xD;
                should be considered in patients with significant, ongoing debilitating symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. MRI/MRCP is then again repeated 6 weeks following the second round of drainage&#xD;
           procedures to check for WON resolution&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If there is no resolution of WON following the second endoscopic drainage, repeat&#xD;
           intervention(s) as outlined in 4) is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. MRI/MRCP is then again repeated 6 weeks following the third drainage to check until WON&#xD;
           resolution&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. If there is no resolution of WON following the third endoscopic drainage, the patient&#xD;
           must be referred for minimally invasive surgical necrosectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Documentation of symptoms or adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Admissions&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. VAS score&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. SF-36 questionnaire Any subsequent admissions (related to the Walled Off- Necrosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be collected in patients hospitalized with recurrent symptoms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. VAS pain score or admission recorded pain score if at any outside hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Need for subsequent endoscopic, percutaneous or surgical procedures for WON&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Duration of Hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Month 3, 6, 12, 24: (+ or - 14 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone calls are made to all patients to gather information on the outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Documentation of symptoms or adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Admissions&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. VAS score&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) SF-36 questionnaire ( Months 6, 12 and 24 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      5) MRI/MRCP or CT scan at 6 months in patients with initial treatment success to determine&#xD;
      rate of WON recurrence&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. WON diagnosed on contrast-enhanced dual phase CT abdomen/pelvis (CECT) or MRI with&#xD;
             gadolinium (seen as a fluid collection in the setting of documented pancreatic&#xD;
             necrosis that contains necrotic material and encased within a well-defined tissue&#xD;
             layer)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. All WON centered within the pancreatic/peri-pancreatic space not requiring&#xD;
             percutaneous drainage, â¥ 6cm, located within 2cm of the enteric wall, not extending&#xD;
             into the flanks or pelvis&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. WON with single loculation, with no extension into the flanks, pelvis or into the root&#xD;
             of the small bowel mesentery. Collections should have an estimated solid component of&#xD;
             = or &gt;25% based on cross sectional imaging and/or endosonographic evaluation of the&#xD;
             collection at the time of study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Suspected/confirmed infected WON (defined as temp â¥ 100.5Â°F, serum WBC â¥ 15x199/L,&#xD;
             positive blood cultures or positive Gram stain/culture of aspirated necrotic material)&#xD;
             and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Symptomatic WON (defined as abdominal pain, gastric/intestinal/biliary outlet&#xD;
             obstruction resulting in nausea, vomiting, early satiety, jaundice, or persistent&#xD;
             malaise) at a time interval of â¥ 4 weeks from attack of acute pancreatitis complicated&#xD;
             by pancreatic necrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Documented history of acute or chronic pancreatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
             a) Acute pancreatitis is diagnosed if 2 of the following 3 criteria are met: i)&#xD;
             Abdominal pain characteristic of acute pancreatitis ii) Serum lipase/amylase â¥ x3&#xD;
             upper limit of normal iii) Characteristic radiological findings of acute pancreatitis&#xD;
             on CECT/MRI/US abdomen, such as homogeneous enhancement of pancreatic parenchyma,&#xD;
             standing of peripancreatic fat (1) b) Chronic pancreatitis is diagnosed if&#xD;
             characteristic radiological changes are seen on CT/MRI with MRCP (such as pancreatic&#xD;
             atrophy, dilated pancreatic duct, pancreatic calcification) (11) or EUS (â¥5/9 of&#xD;
             Rosement criteria) (12)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Able to undergo general anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age &lt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Unable to obtain consent for the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Use of anticoagulants that cannot be discontinued for the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Unable to tolerate general anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. WON with â¥ 3 loculations&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. WON that is not accessible for EUS-guided drainage&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Percutaneous drainage of WON is required or performed prior to EUS-guided drainage&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Prior endoscopic, percutaneous or surgical drainage procedure(s) for&#xD;
             pancreatic/peri-pancreatic fluid collections.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Contraindication to endoscopic drainage: Gastrectomy with Billroth II, gastric&#xD;
