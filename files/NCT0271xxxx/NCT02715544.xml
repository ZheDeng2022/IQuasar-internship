  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research suggests a majority of Hong Kong's toddlers (aged 2 to 4) are much less&#xD;
      active than is recommended and are increasingly engaged in sedentary behaviour, which places&#xD;
      them at risk of becoming overweight or obese. The proposed project will test whether&#xD;
      connecting families to nature positively influences physical activity (that is, active&#xD;
      playtime) and healthy eating routines in children aged 2 to 4. The investigators have&#xD;
      recently conducted a pilot study Play &amp; Grow (P&amp;G), a programme based on the most successful&#xD;
      international preschool interventions described in the literature. In addition to adopting&#xD;
      healthy eating and physical activity intervention elements, the programme was enhanced by&#xD;
      including a novel third element: connectedness to nature (CN). To test the effectiveness of&#xD;
      this enhanced intervention, the plan is to run a family-based randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT). The intervention will include 240 families with children aged 2 to 4, will take the&#xD;
      form of one-hour activity sessions for parents and children held once a week for 10 weeks.&#xD;
      The investigators will assess lifestyle-related habits before, immediately after the&#xD;
      completion the intervention, at 6 months and one year after the intervention. Created for&#xD;
      this purpose, a novel measuring tool for connectedness to nature, Nature Relatedness Scale&#xD;
      (NRS), will be validated and tested for reliability prior to the RTC. The results of RCT are&#xD;
      intended to be used to understand which components of the intervention were most effective.&#xD;
      The objectives of this project will be achieved over a 36-month period, and it is expected to&#xD;
      contribute to a close examination of key components of successful healthy lifestyle promotion&#xD;
      programme during early childhood. The investigators predict that is that the new element CN&#xD;
      will significantly improve the intervention. Finally, the overall aim is that connecting&#xD;
      families to nature will result in sustainable lifestyle changes that remain with them for a&#xD;
      lifetime.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proper nutrition and physical activity are essential for a healthy life. Time spent in nature&#xD;
      has also been proven beneficial. Systematic reviews have shown that nature-related activities&#xD;
      enhance general well-being as reflected in increased physical activity, a healthier diet,&#xD;
      reduced stress and better sleep. However, existing programmes promoting healthy lifestyles in&#xD;
      children focus almost exclusively on diet and physical activity. None, to the inestigators's&#xD;
      awareness, taken into consideration interactions, or connectedness with nature. Connectedness&#xD;
      to nature/nature relatedness is a relatively new concept that, to date, has been investigated&#xD;
      primarily in adults.The concept suggests, for example, that engaging in activities in a&#xD;
      natural environment can induce a feeling of connectedness to nature. Exposing preschool&#xD;
      children to nature and to thinking about nature in different ways could stimulate nature&#xD;
      relatedness as a measurable construct. When children are placed in a natural setting, they&#xD;
      are more likely to be physically active. Natuxral products such as fruits and vegetables are&#xD;
      widely acknowledged to improve health. As noted above, parents are children's role models,&#xD;
      and the investigators therefore believe that connecting parents with nature will have&#xD;
      benefits for their children. Many habits and attitudes are developed early in life, and those&#xD;
      related to the natural world are no exception. In fact, children are inherently interested in&#xD;
      their environment and in nature in general. The hypothesis is that both indoor and outdoor&#xD;
      nature-related activities may induce connectedness and bring about positive changes in both&#xD;
      eating and activity habits (short-term outcomes) in preschool children, in turn leading to a&#xD;
      healthier lifestyle (long-term outcomes).The aim of P&amp;G is to encourage healthy eating habits&#xD;
      and active play in children from an early age, and to bring about healthy behavioural changes&#xD;
      in families. The programme also includes a CN element designed to equip parents with&#xD;
      environmental knowledge and skills. The generated re- and post-test comparison data indicated&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the programme (not presented here). A detailed manual and full resource&#xD;
      kit were created, and each session consisted of: (i) a 15-minute theoretical education&#xD;
      component (food, activity, CN), and (ii) a 30-minute component on indoor and outdoor&#xD;
      nature-related activities, such as playing with nature objects and searching for natural&#xD;
      treasures. Some nature activities were food-related (e.g. growing plants, creating miniature&#xD;
      indoor gardens, and healthy cooking). The control group received an information folder&#xD;
      containing government-recommended physical activity and dietary guidelines for children. To&#xD;
      enhance participation, the sessions were scheduled for weekends. The outcome data was&#xD;
      collected using a number of scales and questionnaires addressed eating, active play and&#xD;
      nature-related habits before and after the program, and focus group discussions were held at&#xD;
      the beginning and end of the programme. The programme proved popular amongst participants and&#xD;
      the results demonstrated significant positive changes on number of health-related outcomes,&#xD;
      such as food habits and caregiver physical activity levels.&#xD;
