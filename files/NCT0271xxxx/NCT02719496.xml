      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of STW5 Iberogast, over a 28-day&#xD;
      period, for the treatment of constipation in parkinsonian patients suffering from&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal disorders are the most common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD). They affect the entire intestinal tract and include excess saliva stasis (70% of&#xD;
      patients), dysphagia (52%), gastroparesis (34-45%), and constipation. Gastroparesis&#xD;
      participates in dyspepsia and abdominal pain. Constipation, as defined by the international&#xD;
      standards criteria of Rome III, is present in 59% of PD patients and leads to functional&#xD;
      impairment in 70% of patients. The mechanism underlying constipation is multifactorial and&#xD;
      may include slow transit and defecation disorders secondary to anorectal dysfunction. Bowel&#xD;
      disorders are present in the early stage of the disease and usually precede the onset of&#xD;
      motor symptoms. They may result from lesions of the enteric nervous system, of the autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system, and from probable alterations in gastrointestinal motility controlled by the&#xD;
      central nervous system. The STW5 (Iberogast, Steigerwald, Germany) is a herbal agent composed&#xD;
      of nine plant extracts, with prokinetic, antispasmodic, prosecretory, anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      anti-oxidant properties. These properties have been demonstrated in animals and in human&#xD;
      pathology, in the treatment of dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. It is the only&#xD;
      phytotherapeutic agent which efficacy was demonstrated by randomized double-blind trials in&#xD;
      these indications. In PD, the STW5 could improve constipation due to its prokinetic effects&#xD;
      of the prosecretory enteric neurons. It could also improve dyspepsia and abdominal pain by&#xD;
      its antispasmodic properties. We propose to study the efficacy and the safety of STW5 on&#xD;
      bowel dysfunction in parkinsonian patients, especially on constipation.&#xD;
