      This study aims to profile the ocular surface inflammation of chronic Graft-Versus-Host&#xD;
      Disease patients by investigating conjunctival cells, and clinical imaging for conjunctival&#xD;
      redness and tear stability. Hence, the investigators expect to find an increased in&#xD;
      inflammatory cell population in GVHD conjunctival samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye is a multi-factorial disease that is frequently encountered in ophthalmological&#xD;
      practice. Common dry eye symptoms include eye irritation, heaviness of the eyelids, blurred&#xD;
      vision and light sensitivity (1). The worldwide prevalence of dry eye is generally high&#xD;
      (2-4). In Asia, dry eye may affect up to 22% of adults above 40 years in China (5) and Japan&#xD;
      (3). In Asian patients older than 65 years, prevalence rates of dry eye can be as high as 80%&#xD;
      if diagnosis is based on abnormal tear stability, or as high as 60% on meibomian gland&#xD;
      dysfunction (MGD), a major cause of tear instability (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most dry eye patients can be successfully managed with lubricants, punctal occlusion, steroid&#xD;
      and/or cyclosporine eye drops. However, some patients with severe dry eye and likely&#xD;
      underlying diseases for example Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), who have exhausted&#xD;
      conventional treatments may amount to 10-20 cases a year and are difficult to manage. These&#xD;
      patients and their physicians are helpless when faced with these scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) has been established as a potential curative&#xD;
      therapy for hematologic malignancies (9). The number of SCT recipients has increased&#xD;
      exponentially worldwide over the past 2 decades. GVHD is the major cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in patients undergoing allogeneic SCT (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dry eye associated with chronic GVHD is one of the major late complications after allogeneic&#xD;
      SCT; it has a significant impact on patients' quality of life (11-13) and can lead to&#xD;
      blindness (14). The immunological process of dry eye associated with chronic GVHD remains&#xD;
      largely unknown but is believed to be traditional alloreactivity to recipient tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to collaborate with Singapore General Hospital, Department of&#xD;
      Haematology to focus on the clinical characteristics and immunological profile of the ocular&#xD;
      surface inflammation in more severe chronic GVHD patients. Dry eye severity is more severe in&#xD;
      chronic GVHD patients at SNEC, compared to idiopathic cases of dry eye. This may be due to&#xD;
      referral bias, or may be related to the systemic disease. As such, the investigators intend&#xD;
      to do a pilot study to define some ocular characteristics of non-referred haematology&#xD;
      patients with GVHD. The investigators propose to screen and recruit 30 suitable participants&#xD;
      who have chronic GVHD. Tests to be performed will include ocular imaging (Oculus K5M), ocular&#xD;
      immunological profile (conjunctiva immune cells) and ocular surface inflammation (MMP-9 tear&#xD;
      marker).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study thus aims to profile the ocular surface inflammation of chronic GVHD patients by&#xD;
      investigating conjunctival cells, and clinical imaging for conjunctival redness and tear&#xD;
      stability. Hence, the investigators expect to find an increased in inflammatory cell&#xD;
      population in GVHD conjunctival samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the ocular immunological profile (conjunctival immune cells) of patients&#xD;
           with GVHD and correlate to systemic status (treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if objective measures of tear dysfunction/ ocular surface inflammation are&#xD;
           abnormal in GVHD patients, and correlate to systemic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dry eye symptoms (SPEED Questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tear production&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conjunctival immune cells profile (Proportion of T lymphocytes and other immune cells)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical parameters for ocular surface (conjunctival redness, non-invasive tear break-up&#xD;
           time, corneal fluorescein staining)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish criteria for screening cGVH patients for referral to ophthalmic&#xD;
           specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine longitudinal outcomes of cGVH dry eye cases, and effects of systemic&#xD;
           prophylactic treatment, as well as other ocular treatment such as plasmapheresis eye&#xD;
           drops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.1 Potential Risks The investigators will anticipate minimal risk and discomfort involve&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is possible that there may be some slight discomfort during the sampling of&#xD;
           conjunctival cells using the impression membrane&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some slight discomfort from tear Strip Meniscometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may feel slight irritation when the InflammaDry test kit is administered,&#xD;
           as it requires placing a soft pad made of absorbent material on the participant's lower&#xD;
           lid to collect tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stinging sensation as a result of local anaesthetic (Alcaine)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.2 Potential Benefits With greater understanding of the presence of various inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators, the investigators can gain further insight into the complex process taking place&#xD;
      in chronic GVHD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 STUDY POPULATION 3.1 List The Number and Nature of Subjects to be Enrolled. Thirty eligible&#xD;
      GVHD patients will be screened and recruited from Transplant Centre located at Block 7, Level&#xD;
      1, Singapore General Hospital- Department of Haematology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Criteria for Recruitment and Recruitment Process&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects meet all the inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clear of exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permission would be sought from the attending doctors from SGH, Department of Haematology&#xD;
      before subjects are being recruited. Eligible subjects will be counselled on the study. If&#xD;
      subject is interested, informed written consent will be obtained from all participants. After&#xD;
      which, SERI research optometrist will proceed with ocular examination at SGH Transplant&#xD;
      Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.1 Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examinations will be done by SERI study team members. The list of required examinations&#xD;
      is shown:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dry Eye Symptoms (SPEED Questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Non-invasive Tear Break-up Time (NIKBUT)- Oculus K5M&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Conjunctival Redness- Oculus K5M&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Tear Strip Meniscometry (SMTube), Schirmers test&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Tear MMP-9 result (Inflammadry)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Impression Cytology- using EyePrim conjunctival membranes&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Corneal Fluorescein Staining- Oculus K5M&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dry Eye Questionnaire Participants will be asked to score dry eye questionnaire to&#xD;
           assess the symptomatic severity of dry eyes and the extent of its disruption to daily&#xD;
           activities for the past two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ SPEED Questionnaire Consist of 2 questions on frequency and severity graded on a scale&#xD;
           of 0-3 on frequency and grade 0-4 on severity. The questionnaire allows patient to rate&#xD;
           from 0 which is never and 3 which is all the time in frequency and 0 as no problem and 4&#xD;
           as intolerable in severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Non Invasive Tear Break-up Time (NIBUT) The Oculus keratographer 5M (Oculus, Wetzlar,&#xD;
           Germany) will be used to perform the non-invasive tear break up time. Patient will sit&#xD;
           comfortably in front of the instrument and blink freely while fixing on a target&#xD;
           directly ahead. Once the patient is ready, patient will be instructed to blink twice and&#xD;
           refrain from blinking. Keratograph 5M is fully automated and it will capture any break&#xD;
           or distortion in the image and the time of the break will be noted. Three readings will&#xD;
           be taken for each eye to get the average value. It is possible that the tear film of&#xD;
           participants is more stable, i.e. increased tear break up time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Imaging of conjunctival redness with Oculus Keratography 5M&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Tear Strip Meniscometry (SMTube) Remove SMTube from the sterile pouch. Hold the centre&#xD;
           of SMTube. Do not touch the dye area. Immerse the tip of the SMTube to the lateral lower&#xD;
           lid tear meniscus of an eye for 5 seconds. Take extra precaution to prevent the tip from&#xD;
           touching the patients' conjunctiva. After 5 seconds, remove the SMTube from the lower&#xD;
           lid tear meniscus. Measure the length of the column stained blue in colour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Tear MMP-9 result (Inflammadry) The InflammaDry test will be administered after tear&#xD;
           meniscometry is performed, as it assesses the MMP-9 levels (an inflammatory marker) in&#xD;
           tears and hence is not affected by reflex tearing (15). The fleece of the test strip is&#xD;
           dab along the inside lining of the lower eyelid in multiple locations, the patient is&#xD;
           asked to blink, and the strip is then rest along the inferior nasal palpebral&#xD;
           conjunctival for another 5 seconds. Assemble the sampling fleece into the sample&#xD;
           transfer window of the test cassette body. After which the absorbent tip is immersed in&#xD;
           the buffer solution for 20 seconds. Remove the absorbent tip from the buffer vial,&#xD;
           replace the protective cap, and lay the test flat on the horizontal surface for 10&#xD;
           minutes. A single blue line indicates a negative result, while the appearance of 2 lines&#xD;
           (red and blue) indicates a positive result.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Impression Cytology (using EyePrim membranes)&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) Preparation of RPMI solution In a sterile biosafety hood, prepare 2 vials of 2ml&#xD;
           Eppendorf tubes. One tube for right eye and left eyes respectively. Fill the 2 tubes&#xD;
           with 1.5ml of RPMI solution. Thereafter, transfer tubes in ice-box containing ice and&#xD;
           transfer to the Transplant Centre located at SGH where impression will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii) Anaesthesia Step 1: Inform the participant that he/she may experience a transient&#xD;
           stinging sensation. Request for the participant to direct their gaze upwards. Depress&#xD;
           the lower eyelid and place one drop of LA in the inferior palpebral fornix. Do this for&#xD;
           both eyes. Request for the patient to blink gently for at least 3 times. Step 2: Once&#xD;
           the stinging subsides, request for the participant to direct their gaze downwards.&#xD;
           Elevate the patient's upper eyelid and place a drop of LA on the bulbar conjunctiva on&#xD;
           the most superior point possible. Do this for both eyes. Request for the patient to&#xD;
           blink gently for at least 3 times. Step 3: Repeat step 2 once more. The participant&#xD;
           should not be able to feel any stinging sensations of the eye at this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii) Conjunctival sampling Step 1: Request the participant to direct his/her gaze in the&#xD;
           infero-temporal direction. This exposes the superior nasal bulbar conjunctiva for&#xD;
           impression. Step 2: Apply the EyePRIM membrane to the area. Step 3: Ensure good&#xD;
           apposition of the membrane with the conjunctiva. Do this by rocking the EyePRIM membrane&#xD;
           to the left and right. Step 4: Remove the membrane from the conjunctiva with a&#xD;
           peeling-like movement. Step 5: Exert greater force on the EyePRIM spring mechanism.&#xD;
           After a &quot;click&quot; sound, the membrane will be ejected from the gadget. Place the membrane&#xD;
           from the right eye into the &quot;right&quot; eppendorf tube. Step 6: Repeat for the superior&#xD;
           temporal bulbar conjunctiva, this time directing the participant's gaze infero-nasally.&#xD;
           Place this membrane into the &quot;right&quot; eppendorf tube. There should be 2 membranes in this&#xD;
           eppendorf tube. Step 7: Place this tube in the box of ice. Step 8: Repeat steps 1-7 for&#xD;
           the other eye, but place the membranes into the &quot;left&quot; eppendorf tube. Step 9: At this&#xD;
           point should have both &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; eppendorf tubes, each with 2 membranes within&#xD;
           them immersed in 1.5ml of RPMI medium. Place them in the ice box.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iv) Detachment of cells from membranes Using a 10ul micropipette tip, scrape the cells&#xD;
           off the membrane. Ensure to scrape the correct side of the membrane (this can be done by&#xD;
           referring to the direction of the hooks of the membrane). This is most easily done by&#xD;
           pinning down the membrane against the wall of the vial tube and scraping it off with a&#xD;
           grinding-like motion (the wall of the vial tube is the mortar and the micropipette tip&#xD;
           is like a pestle). Repeat for the other membrane in the same vial tube. Also, repeat the&#xD;
           same steps for the other eye. Once scraping of cells is completed, placed the 2&#xD;
           eppendorf tubes onto the ice and hand over to the Aihua or Tanima (Academia Level 12)&#xD;
           for FACs analysis on the same day.&#xD;
