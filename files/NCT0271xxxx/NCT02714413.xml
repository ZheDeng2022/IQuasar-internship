  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals in the United States now consume a substantial proportion of their total energy&#xD;
      as added sugars. The consumption of caloric sweeteners has been steadily increasing over the&#xD;
      last four decades. The potential health consequences of this practice have been subject to&#xD;
      considerable debate. In addition to weight gain, higher consumption of sugar-sweetened&#xD;
      beverages is associated with development of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. These&#xD;
      findings support the current dietary guidelines that encourage consumers to limit their&#xD;
      intake of added sugars. There is a need for a sugar substitute that is safe, palatable and&#xD;
      has favorable effects on energy metabolism and overall glucose homeostasis. One such sugar is&#xD;
      possibly D-allulose also referred to in the literature as D-psicose. The present proposal is&#xD;
      to address the efficacy of D-allulose in reducing postprandial blood glucose level in a&#xD;
      random sample of Caucasian and African American population. Specifically the effect of&#xD;
      D-allulose ingestion on the glucose and insulin response to a standardized oral glucose load&#xD;
      will be studied.&#xD;

      Individuals in the United States now consume a substantial proportion of their total energy&#xD;
      as added sugars. The consumption of caloric sweeteners has been steadily increasing over the&#xD;
      last four decades. The potential health consequences of this practice have been subject to&#xD;
      considerable debate. In a prospective follow-up study of 43,960 African American women who&#xD;
      gave complete dietary and weight information and were free from diabetes at baseline, the&#xD;
      incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was higher with higher intake of both sugar-sweetened&#xD;
      soft drinks and fruit drinks. Similar conclusions were drawn in a meta- analysis of 11&#xD;
      studies of consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in relation to risk of metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      and type 2 diabetes. Thus, in addition to weight gain, higher consumption of sugar-sweetened&#xD;
      beverages is associated with development of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. These&#xD;
      findings support the current dietary guidelines that encourage consumers to limit their&#xD;
      intake of added sugars. There is a need for a sugar substitute that is safe, palatable and&#xD;
      has favorable effects on energy metabolism and overall glucose homeostasis. One such sugar is&#xD;
      possibly D-allulose also referred to in the literature as D-psicose. D-allulose is a&#xD;
      non-calorie monosaccharide which has approximately 70% sweetness of sucrose. Early clinical&#xD;
      trials of D-allulose demonstrating its anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects have been&#xD;
      carried out in Kagawa (Japan). As of to date, there are still insufficient data to confirm&#xD;
      the efficacy of pure D-allulose in Caucasian or African American populations. The present&#xD;
      proposal is to address the efficacy of D-allulose in reducing postprandial blood glucose&#xD;
      level in a random sample of Caucasian and African American population. This is a single&#xD;
      center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study evaluating&#xD;
      the efficacy of pure D-allulose in Caucasian and African American populations. Subjects will&#xD;
      be their own controls as they will be studied sequentially for the effects of varying amounts&#xD;
      of D-allulose given in a random order on glycemic and insulin excursions associated with&#xD;
      standardized oral sucrose load of 50 gms.&#xD;
