  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 2, two arm, biomarker-driven study is to determine if treatment of&#xD;
      O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) unmethylated glioblastoma with VAL-083&#xD;
      improves overall survival (OS), compared to historical control, in the adjuvant or recurrent&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent GBM is characterized by a dismal prognosis, with a median overall survival of 6.9&#xD;
      months. While a standard of care is established for the initial treatment of GBM - radiation&#xD;
      with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy - management of recurrent disease&#xD;
      (NCCN, 2014) remains suboptimal. Treatment options include repeat surgery, re-irradiation, or&#xD;
      chemotherapy (including experimental targeted therapies, biologic agents, and&#xD;
      immunotherapies). Only a minority of patients has response to these treatments, and the&#xD;
      resultant benefits in progression-free and overall survival are in the order of weeks to&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognosis and response to therapy are known to be better in patients with a methylated MGMT&#xD;
      promoter gene. Epigenetic silencing of MGMT by promoter methylation is an important factor in&#xD;
      predicting outcome for patients with GBM treated with temozolomide. Approximately 66% of GBM&#xD;
      tumors are MGMT unmethylated (high expression of MGMT), which through a MGMT repair&#xD;
      mechanism, confers resistance to temozolomide, the standard chemotherapy treatment of GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAL-083, Dianhydrogalactitol (DAG), unlike temozolomide, is demonstrated to be active&#xD;
      independent of MGMT resistance mechanisms, in vitro. Thus, it may provide a treatment option&#xD;
      for those patients that are considered likely to be poor responders to temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-comparative, two arm, biomarker-driven study with VAL-083 in GBM patients with&#xD;
      either recurrent disease (Group 1) or newly diagnosed GBM patients requiring maintenance&#xD;
      therapy after chemoradiation with temozolomide (Group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: A total of up to 83 patients with recurrent/progressive GBM will be enrolled. This&#xD;
      will include 35 patients treated at 40 mg/m2 and up to 48 patients treated at 30 mg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Up to an additional 36 newly diagnosed GBM patients who have completed&#xD;
      chemoradiation treatment with temozolomide and received no subsequent maintenance&#xD;
      temozolomide will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive VAL-083 IV on days 1, 2, and 3, for up to 12, 21-day treatment&#xD;
      cycles or until they fulfill one of the criteria for study discontinuation (disease&#xD;
      progression, death, intolerable toxicities, investigator's judgment, or withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent). Disease status will be evaluated with clinical and MRI evaluation every other&#xD;
      21-day cycle, while the patient is receiving VAL-083 treatment, and then approximately every&#xD;
      42 ± 7 days while remaining on study. Symptom burden will be evaluated using the MD Anderson&#xD;
      Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) completed by patients at baseline and at the time of&#xD;
      each imaging evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interval medical histories, targeted physical exams, neurologic evaluations, complete blood&#xD;
      counts, and other laboratory and safety assessments will be performed approximately every&#xD;
      21-days. Blood samples will be taken at Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose, 15 ± 5 min, 30 ± 5 min, 60 ±&#xD;
      10 min, 120 ± 10 min, 240 ± 15 min, and 360 ± 15 min after the end of the of iv infusion with&#xD;
      VAL-083 to determine the PK profile and dose-exposure relationship of VAL-083.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be evaluated and documented using the NCI CTCAE version 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take approximately 36 months to enroll.&#xD;
