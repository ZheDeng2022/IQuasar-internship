      The significance of this project is the first longitudinal study to investigate the changes&#xD;
      of neurocognitive functions of children and adolescents with ASD and to identify the&#xD;
      potential neuroimaging endophenotype (biomarkers) for ASD in Asian with advanced imaging&#xD;
      technique (Tract-based automatic analysis, TBAA; multi-echo resting-state fMRI in addition to&#xD;
      single-echo resting-state fMRI). The success of this project will fill the gap of our&#xD;
      understanding of longitudinal changes of brain function by neuropsychological and imaging&#xD;
      approaches of ASD in Han Chinese in Taiwan, and is anticipated to facilitate the progress of&#xD;
      translational research in ASD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common severe, clinically and genetically heterogeneous&#xD;
      childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder. Due to its high prevalence, typical autistic&#xD;
      symptoms, and severe lifelong impairment without effective prevention and treatment, the&#xD;
      developmental change of brain functions in individuals with this study has been recognized as&#xD;
      one of the key topics of ASD. The goal of this project is to prospectively investigate the&#xD;
      stability and changes of brain functions assessed by neuropsychological tests and neuroimages&#xD;
      in a cohort of children and adolescents with ASD who had the first assessment 3-5 years ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: To investigate the stability and changes of neuropsychological and structural&#xD;
      and functional connectivity among children and adolescents with ASD as compared to age- and&#xD;
      sex-matched typically developing (TD) controls; and to identify predictors for these&#xD;
      neurocognitive changes across a 3-5 follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will prospectively follow up 70 ASDs and 70 TDs for reassessments of&#xD;
      clinical symptoms, neuropsychological functions, and structural and functional brain&#xD;
      connectivity. The assessments include ASD symptoms (ASD only: Autism Diagnostic&#xD;
      Interview-Revised, Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale; all: Social Responsiveness Scale&#xD;
      (SRS), Social Communication Questionnaires (SCQ), Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)), other&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders (The Chinese version of the Kiddie Schedule of Schizophrenia and&#xD;
      Affective Disorder Scale-Epidemiologic version, K-SADS-E), neuropsychological functions&#xD;
      (Conner's Continuous Performance Test) and MRI assessments (T1 and T2 templates, Diffusion&#xD;
      Spectrum Imaging, resting-state fMRI).&#xD;
