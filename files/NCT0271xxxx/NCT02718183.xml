      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this clinical randomized, double-blind clinical study was to assess&#xD;
      the markers levels of RANKL IL-1B and OPGL, involved in the external cervical resorption as a&#xD;
      primary outcome, and change color effectiveness in patients undergoing intracoronary&#xD;
      bleaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: 46 volunteers (50 teeth) participated with discoloration on non-vital teeth, with the&#xD;
      endodontic treatment in good condition. Patients were randomly located into two study groups&#xD;
      according to product G1 = 35% hydrogen peroxide (n = 25) and G2 = 37% carbamide peroxide (n =&#xD;
      25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intracameral bleaching was performed with a walking bleaching technique of 4 sessions&#xD;
      Gingivocrevicular transudate samples were taken to determine levels of Il1b, RANKL, and OPGL&#xD;
      with absorbent paper (Periopaper®), they are obtained from six sites per tooth bleaching: 3&#xD;
      vestibular and three palatine (mesial, middle and distal), in 6 opportunities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline, after 4-sessions of intracameral bleaching and a one week after treatment. Total&#xD;
      proteins are quantified by Bradford ® system and from the eluted sample of RANKL, IL 1b and&#xD;
      OPGL levels measured by ELISA (Quantikine®; R&amp;D Systems Inc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The color was evaluated in each session with Vita EasyShade spectrophotometer is used with&#xD;
      the CIEL*a*b system to measure the total variation in color (ΔE), between the baseline and&#xD;
      the different evaluation times.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The trial was randomized and double-blind (patient and operator). Advertising was held to&#xD;
      invite participation in dental school and through social networks like Facebook or Twitter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the size of the sample GPower 3.1 software was used, considering a significance&#xD;
      level of 5% statistical power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 74 patients were examined to assess whether they met the criteria for inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion. Patients: over 18 years, with one or more non-vital teeth, the restoration&#xD;
      does not cover the vestibular face, endodontic treatment is in good condition, without apical&#xD;
      lesion, with no previous experience of tooth whitening and tooth shade A2 or greater&#xD;
      according to the Vita Classical scale. Patients were excluded pregnant or lactating, patients&#xD;
      with enamel hypoplasia, with teeth stained by tetracycline or fluorosis, in orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment with fixed appliances, patients with cancer or periodontal diseases. In addition to&#xD;
      those volunteers to be examined clinically and radiographically present caries, periapical&#xD;
      lesions, external or internal dental resorption and / or periodontal disease, as may be&#xD;
      informed and referred to specialists for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      46 patients, of whom 44 completed treatment and attended all controls were selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Were formed at randomization two study groups as the bleaching agent used, each with teeth n&#xD;
      = 25, G1 = teeth bleached with Hydrogen Peroxide 35% (Opalescence Endo - Ultradent, USA). G2&#xD;
      = bleached teeth with carbamide peroxide 37% (Whiteness Superendo, FGM, Brazil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleaching procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of the bleaching agents was performed according to manufacturers instructions&#xD;
      in four sessions with an outpatient technique (Walking Bleaching), with one week apart from&#xD;
      each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session Preparation: Preparing root canal with absolute isolation, were removed from 3mm seal&#xD;
      the endodontic cement-enamel limit reference. The final sealing was made with 2mm with glass&#xD;
      ionomer resin composite modificao and curing by (Riva Light Cure, SDI, Australia) and&#xD;
      light-cured for 40 seconds (Cal Radii, SDI, Australia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unblocking a radiographic control and sealing the root canal, and radiographs, post seal was&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 sessions of Whitening: The Application of the bleaching agent was according to&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions. An amount of gel bleaching agent was left intracamerally with&#xD;
      moisture (Walking Bleaching). Subsequently he sealed with a temporary cement to the next&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Closing session: the access cavity was washed with water and a temporary sealing leave for 7&#xD;
      days prior to the completion of the final seal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were advised not to eat or drink foods that can stain, such as coffee, tea, red&#xD;
      wine, etc. during the study period. They were given written instructions and contact&#xD;
      information for any questions or problems arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Color Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two calibrated evaluators, with 80% agreement (Kappa test), recorded the color of teeth at&#xD;
      baseline (baseline), immediately after each bleaching session, one week and one month&#xD;
      post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Color evaluation was measured in the middle third of the labial surface of tooth bleaching.&#xD;
      Patients were examined in the same room with the same lighting, for both examiners&#xD;
      independently. using the Vita Bleachguide scale (Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckingen, Germany)&#xD;
      .For every &quot;value&quot; color is assigned a numerical value in order to calculate the change in&#xD;
      units scale (SGU Δ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of markers RANKL-OPG-Interleukin in crevicular gingival fluid (FGC) Obtaining and&#xD;
      handling of samples FGC&#xD;
&#xD;
      FGC samples were obtained from six sites periodontal 3 vestibular and 3 palatal / lingual&#xD;
      (average mesial - distal) undergoing teeth whitening. Samples were taken before the whitening&#xD;
      (baseline) and after each whitening session, a week and a month post-whitening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this were used Periopaper® absorbent paper strips (OraFlow Inc., New York, NY, USA). The&#xD;
      teeth were isolated from a relative fashion using cotton rolls, once isolated with a Gracey&#xD;
      3/4 the supra-gingival plaque be removed and gently the surface of the triple air dry&#xD;
      syringe. The paper strip was introduced into the selected tooth gingival sulcus until mild&#xD;
      resistance tissue and held for 30 seconds. Then they were placed in properly labeled&#xD;
      Eppendorf tubes and transported immediately to be stored at -80 ° C until the centrifugal&#xD;
      elution process. The paper strips contaminated with saliva or blood were discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The paper strips were subjected to centrifugal elution to obtain total proteins present in&#xD;
      the FGC. To do this, incubated for 30 minutes in 100 .mu.l of elution buffer containing 0.05%&#xD;
      Tween in Tris-HCl pH 7.4 (Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Buchs, Switzerland) and then&#xD;
      centrifugarnn 10,000 xg for 5 minutes at 4 ° C. The process of centrifugal circumvention&#xD;
      repetio 3 times to a final volume of 300 ul, which was stored at -80 ° C until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of markers RANKL-OPG-Interleukin in crevicular gingival fluid (FGC) Total proteins&#xD;
      were quantified by the Bradford ® system (R &amp; D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) and from&#xD;
      50 ul of sample eluted from medieronn levels of RANKL, OPG and interleukin by ELISA&#xD;
      (Quantikine®; R &amp; D Systems Inc. ) following the manufacturer's protocol. The average&#xD;
      absorbance at 492 nm with correction at 630 nm using an automated plate reader (Universal&#xD;
      ELx800 Microplate Reader, Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). The concentration of&#xD;
      the markers in each sample was calculated using an equation of the line of 4th grade.&#xD;
