    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to investigate the incremental costs and health benefits of adding&#xD;
      HIVST to the remit of existing cadres of community volunteers in the general population in&#xD;
      Malawi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Validate the use of the OraQuick HIVST product in rural settings, establish preferences&#xD;
           and social harms reporting systems, and conduct baseline surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Carry out a pragmatic cluster-randomised trial with ART clinics and their catchment&#xD;
           populations, including CBDAs, as the unit of randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the impact of adding HIVST into the remit of VMMC mobilisers on demand for VMMC&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Establish the expected costs and benefits of introducing HIVST to Malawi through&#xD;
           economic and mathematical modelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Conduct interviews with policy-makers to prepare for national scale-up of HIVST and&#xD;
           support the market introduction of quality-assured HIVST products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRCT METHODOLOGY/STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      First stage randomization: HIVST v. SOC. The main study will be a cluster-randomised trial in&#xD;
      up to 5 high HIV prevalence districts (provisionally Blantyre, Machinga, Mwanza, Neno and&#xD;
      Thyolo) that already have community-based reproductive health services provided by PSI under&#xD;
      funding provided by the German Technical Cooperation Agency (GTZ). This programme supports&#xD;
      volunteers to socially-market reproductive and child health products in villages, with&#xD;
      products stored and managed by collaborating primary care clinics. The unit of randomisation&#xD;
      is the Primary Care + ART Clinic and surrounding catchment area villages to clinic. CBDAs in&#xD;
      the HIVST Arm villages will be trained to provide HIVST services as well as reproductive&#xD;
      health services. CBDAs in the SOC Arm villages will remain with reproductive health services&#xD;
      only. Two separate units of evaluation will be pre-defined before randomisation: one or two&#xD;
      evaluation villages that will have baseline-final household surveys, and a wider catchment&#xD;
      area including all villages with CBDA activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second stage randomization: HIVST with and without home assessment. Villages in the HIVST&#xD;
      intervention area will be randomised to either HIVST only, or to HIVST plus offer of home&#xD;
      assessment and HIV care initiation (first assessment and first 14 days of HIV care&#xD;
      medications) with this additional intervention aimed at facilitating linkage into care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRCT SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial has one primary and one secondary outcome, with a number of other analyses to be&#xD;
      specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan. The sample size considerations here relate to the&#xD;
      main Primary Outcome (comparison between arms of recent HIV testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A survey sample of 250 to 500 adults per cluster will provide sufficient power for a two&#xD;
      sample comparison of unmatched proportions for HTC coverage was performed across the&#xD;
      intervention and control arms to determine the number of clusters per arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cluster size is based on the typical size of a rural village (250-500 people) from&#xD;
      previous experience in Malawi. Using 2010 DHS data, baseline rates for individuals tested in&#xD;
      the last 12 months is estimated at 25% to 40%, with a 45% to 60% predicted effect size in the&#xD;
      intervention arm compared to the control arm. Baseline coverage for individuals who have ever&#xD;
      tested is estimated at 42% to 60% with predicted effect size 30%-45%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figures 10 and 11 in the full protocol contain a table of scenarios for each of the outlined&#xD;
      assumptions. To detect a 50% increase in rate of people testing in the past 12 months and a&#xD;
      45% increase in the percentage of people who have ever tested in the intervention villages,&#xD;
      there should be approximately 8 clusters per arm and approximately 4,000 participants total.&#xD;
      This study will aim to reach 10 clusters per arm and 5,000 participants to provide&#xD;
      contingency for a lower than anticipated effect size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FORMATIVE RESEARCH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formative research will be conducted before the beginning of the cRCT, including (1)&#xD;
      cognitive interviews to assess the suitability existing IFUs in this population and modify&#xD;
      IFUs as needed; (2) key informant interviews to help identify needs of stakeholders working&#xD;
      in this area; (3) community mapping to identify local services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive interviewing to validate IFUS. Convenience sampling will be used to recruit clients&#xD;
      from VCT clinics for the cognitive interviews. Eligibility criteria include clients who are&#xD;
      16 years or older, and willing to provide written informed consent for participation in the&#xD;
      study. A witnessed thumbprint will be sufficient for those who are unable to read or write.&#xD;
      Participants will be purposively selected to ensure a range in location and literacy level.&#xD;
      Four to 12 participants will be recruited for each iteration of the cognitive interviews,&#xD;
      with a maximum of 12 iterations of adaptation and trial of the intended IFUs (n = 144).&#xD;
      Cognitive interviewing and iterative adaptation will continue until saturation occurs and no&#xD;
      further modifications to user materials are made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key informant interviews. We will conduct key informant interviews to inform our&#xD;
      understanding of needs through key informant interviews with stakeholders working in HIV&#xD;
      policy, product regulation and HIV implementation. Approximately 45 participants will be&#xD;
      selected purposively through snowball sampling for the KIIs. MLW-LSHTM, using their&#xD;
      professional networks and PSI country staff, will identify appropriate stakeholders.&#xD;
      Interviews will be with written informed consent, will use semi-structured questionnaires and&#xD;
      will be audiotaped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community mapping. Primary care clinics and evaluation villagers will be selected in&#xD;
      consultation with the program lead for PSI's CBDA programme, and in consultation with the&#xD;
      relevant District Health Offices, Primary care clinics and the CBDAs themselves.Once villages&#xD;
      have been selected, preliminary mapping exercises will be initiated including demarcation of&#xD;
      the village boundaries and location of dwellings with geographical position system (GPS) and&#xD;
      a brief household-level questionnaire (name of household head, demographics of household&#xD;
      members).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PILOT STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two villages not included in the main study will be selected from rural Blantyre or Thyolo&#xD;
      for pilot studies of accuracy and acceptability. From these villages, 200 to 250 participants&#xD;
      in total will be recruited from either randomly selected households (n = 150-200) or&#xD;
      community peer groups (n = 48) for the accuracy and acceptability studies .Participants who&#xD;
      opt to self-test as well as undergo standard HTC will be given a HIVST kit and a test results&#xD;
      forms to record their own reading of the results. They will then be provided with a&#xD;
      demonstration and instructions before carrying out the self-test procedure in a private room&#xD;
      and completing the test results forms. Participants who themselves recognise that they have&#xD;
      made a user error or find that their first result is uninterpretable will be given a second&#xD;
      test kit to repeat the procedure if they wish to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following self-testing, trained HTC counsellors will record their own reading of the test kit&#xD;
      before completing the standard HTC process (parallel Unigold and Determine finger prick&#xD;
      blood) and entering the results of blood-based testing. All patients testing HIV+ve will be&#xD;
      referred to HIV care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PILOT STUDY SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the pilot study, 150 to 200 adults will be recruited from a random selection of 60 to 80&#xD;
      households (with an estimated 2-5 adults per household) using randomly selected GPS&#xD;
      waypoints. All household members aged 16 years or older will be asked for written consent to&#xD;
      answer a brief questionnaire (socio demographics, past HIV testing experience, chronic care&#xD;
      including ART) and will be offered HIVST followed immediately by confirmatory HTC. Parental&#xD;
      consent will be taken for 16 and 17-year-olds and witnessed thumbprint for individuals unable&#xD;
      to read or write.&#xD;
