    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is becoming more common. One of the main features of this disease is&#xD;
      weight loss and malnutrition with symptoms such as tummy aches and bloating. These problems&#xD;
      have a strong negative effect on the patients' quality of life but the causes of these&#xD;
      problems are not well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enteroendocrine cells are nutrient sensors in the bowel that secrete special chemicals&#xD;
      (called hormones) that control appetite and the movements all the gut. The investigators&#xD;
      think that this control mechanism goes wrong in Crohn's patients and they have set off to do&#xD;
      more research on this. Looking at the inside work of the gut has always been difficult and at&#xD;
      times unpleasant for patients, however recent developments in magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) are allowing the investigators to study the workings of the gut in greater detail and&#xD;
      without discomfort for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before studying the Crohn's patients it is necessary to run a set of pilot experiments in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers using a test meal and subsequent MRI imaging to look at the motion of the&#xD;
      gut. This validation stage of the methodology is essential before embarking in more detailed&#xD;
      studies in the patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Poor nutrition in Crohn's disease (CD) is common but poorly understood. Apart&#xD;
      from disease burden and repeated surgery, reduction in appetite might be an aetiological&#xD;
      factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enteroendocrine cells (EC) are intraluminal nutrient sensors. They play a pivotal role in&#xD;
      orchestrating physiological functions in the gastrointestinal tract. Sensing the nutrient&#xD;
      content of the lumen, they secrete multiple peptides and amines that control gut secretory&#xD;
      and motor functions. CD patients with small bowel inflammation show increased expression in&#xD;
      EC peptides with exaggerated postprandial responses in anorectic EC hormones. This is&#xD;
      associated with symptoms of nausea and anorexia, with EC-peptide expression decreasing to&#xD;
      normality in remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been a longstanding interest on the effect of CD on gastric emptying and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal motility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent technological advances have allowed us to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to&#xD;
      measure both disease activity, intestinal motility and whole gut transit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced intestinal motility has been recently shown in CD patients with active terminal ileal&#xD;
      disease. A significant negative correlation is observed between terminal ileal motility and&#xD;
      histological, biochemical and radiological measures of disease activity. Intestinal&#xD;
      hypomotility may be observed in proximal unaffected segments of small bowel as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increase in EC activity could potentially lead to altered appetite and symptoms of nausea&#xD;
      through delayed gastric emptying and most importantly delayed small bowel transit. This&#xD;
      mechanistic link has not been described and present findings have not been correlated to&#xD;
      patient symptoms. This work can potentially open a new therapeutic pathway in CD therapy.&#xD;
      Optimisation studies in healthy volunteers (HV) are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims &amp; Hypothesis: In intestinal inflammation due to CD, the observed up-regulation of&#xD;
      fasting and postprandial EC peptides may correlate with a delayed whole gut transit&#xD;
      specifically small bowel transit and gastric emptying. This optimization study in HV aims to&#xD;
      validate a test meal and optimize themethodology in assessing gastric emptying, small bowel&#xD;
      transit and whole gut transit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol and methods: 15 healthy volunteers will be recruited. Standard MRI&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will apply. Volunteers should not have a history of inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease, history of smoking, a history of bowel resections or any gastric surgery, history of&#xD;
      pancreatic insufficiency, thyroid disease, diabetes, protein-pump inhibitor usage or any&#xD;
      medication that affects gastric emptying or small bowel transit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have an open-label design. Subjects will be asked to swallow five MRI marker&#xD;
      capsules (20 x 7 mm) at 09:00 am, 24 h before undergoing an MRI scan. The subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to fast from 2000 h. They will be asked to fill in a questionnaire to ensure adherence&#xD;
      to the study day restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the scan, they will only be allowed a small glass of water on waking. They will&#xD;
      undergo a baseline fasting scan at 0900 hours (defined at t = -45 min time point), together&#xD;
      with a fasting baseline blood sample. At 0925 hours, they will be asked to eat their test&#xD;
      meal within a maximum time of 20 min so that at 0945 hours the subjects will undergo a first&#xD;
      immediate postprandial scan (defined as t = 0 min). This will be followed with data&#xD;
      collection (MRI, questionnaire data and blood samples) time points every 15 min for the first&#xD;
      60 min and every 30 min up to 270 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each time point, the positioning of the subject, setup and data collection will take&#xD;
      ~15min. After the first 60 min, at completion of data collection at each time-point, the&#xD;
      volunteers will be kept sitting upright in a quiet lounge next to the scanner. At each time&#xD;
      point, volunteers will fill a 100mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) symptoms questionnaire&#xD;
      scoring their feeling of fullness, bloating, distension, abdominal pain/discomfort and&#xD;
      nausea. The VAS anchors were from 'not' to 'extremely'. Participants will be given a meal at&#xD;
      the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scanning will be carried out supine on either a 1.5T or 3.0 T Philips Achieva MRI scanner&#xD;
      (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) depending on availability. Fasting and&#xD;
      post-prandial plasma tests: On the morning of the test, a 10 ml fasting blood sample will be&#xD;
      drawn in aprotonin/EDTA tubes (BD-361017, BD Diagnostics, Oxford). Samples will be measured&#xD;
      every 45 min to 270 min. Samples will be centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min and stored on ice.&#xD;
      Measurement of plasma peptides: All EC peptides (GLP-1, PYY) will be analysed through ELISA&#xD;
      techniques (Millipore, UK). Serum CCK will be measured by RIA (Euro Diagnostic Products,&#xD;
      Sweden). Total EC plasma peptide response will be presented as per individual time points and&#xD;
      compositely as area under the curve (AUC).&#xD;
