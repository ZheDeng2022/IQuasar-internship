  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maculopathy induced by retinal toxicity of synthetic antimalarials is to be screened at the&#xD;
      sub-clinical stage. Indeed, when the first visual symptoms appear, macular damage is already&#xD;
      irreversible and the clinical picture may even continue to deteriorate for several years&#xD;
      after the end of synthetic antimalarial use. In opposition, the early termination of&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine in patients showing recent alterations on the multifocal electroretinogram&#xD;
      (nfERG) allowed he reversibility of toxic damage over a six month period. It is therefore&#xD;
      critical to detect early retinal anatomic changes during retinotoxicity screening before the&#xD;
      occurrence of irreversible anatomical and functional consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual patient monitoring consists of an annual eye examination, detecting subjective&#xD;
      functional abnormalities (visual acuity, color vision, central visual field testing) or&#xD;
      macular lesions (eye fundus). These abnormalities show a constituted infringement and do not&#xD;
      contribute to the early diagnosis of synthetic antimalarial maculopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mfERG is an objective examination, able to detect retinal damage whilst still reversible.&#xD;
      It is recommended during the annual monitoring and is, today, the gold standard for the&#xD;
      screening and diagnosis of synthetic antimalarial maculopathy. However, its realization is&#xD;
      time consuming, requires a good patient cooperation and is difficult to access due to the few&#xD;
      ophthalmology centers offering it. In practice, it is rarely done as a systematic annual&#xD;
      screening for patients on long-term synthetic antimalarial treatment. It is often limited to&#xD;
      second-line studies (for patients already showing functional or anatomical abnormalities)&#xD;
      whereas its interest lies in the detection of early lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Optical Coherence Tomography Spectral Domain (OCT-SD) is a non-invasive eye examination,&#xD;
      commonly used since nearly 10 years. A special image analysis provides a panoramic viewing of&#xD;
      the state of the photoreceptor layer, and a non-invasive detection of any anatomical changes,&#xD;
      even subtle, within this layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concordance between the &quot;en face&quot; OCT and the mfERG in the screening of synthetic&#xD;
      antimalarial maculopathy is considered in this study.&#xD;
