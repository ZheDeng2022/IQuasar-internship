    <textblock>
      This is an open, single-centre trial investigating the impact of haemolysis after capillary&#xD;
      blood collection to the measured potassium concentration in Plasma healthy subjects. Each&#xD;
      subject will have four capillary blood collections on different fingers. Two on the right and&#xD;
      two on the left hand. Additionally as a reference a venous blood collection will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;

      K@Home_1 a working package of the FFG project &quot;K@Home - potassium home monitoring for&#xD;
      patients with heart- and kidney insufficiency&quot;. In the project K@Home a potassium measuring&#xD;
      system serveable by the patients even of the home monitoring should be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim from K@Home is to allow an everyday home monitoring of the potassium value by the&#xD;
      development of potassium-test stripe, like with the diabetes patients who supervise their&#xD;
      blood sugar level by measurements with glucose-test stripe from a drop of capillary blood&#xD;
      from the finger berry and with it the emergencies and hospital admissions to reduce or to&#xD;
      prevent. It is fact that haemolysis has a strong influence on the measured potassium&#xD;
      concentration. It is likely that by using capillary blood a haemolysis appears and therefore&#xD;
      distorted potassium concentrations are measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study K@Home_1 it is a matter of evaluating, how high the degree of the haemolysis in&#xD;
      capillary blood is, and in this fact to what extent leads to wrong potassium values. The&#xD;
      results from this study will be a basic component for the sensor development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After clarification the approval the Informed Consent is signed and the inclusion as well as&#xD;
      exclusion criteria (incl. demography, concomitant medication and medical history) or vital&#xD;
      parameters (blood pressure, pulse, size, weight), are raised. An urine-pregnancy test is also&#xD;
      carried out for the exclusion of a pregnancy in women capable of bearing children. It is not&#xD;
      necessary that the subjects seem sober on the study day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With 22 healthy subjects capillary and venous blood is taken within the scope of one single&#xD;
      study round. Blood is taken from the test persons by trained specialist staff of two&#xD;
      fingertips of each hand (a total of four fingertips). The capillary blood sampling occurs in&#xD;
      200 Âµ l Lithium-Heparin Sarsted Microvettes and in each case the first drop of blood is&#xD;
      rejected. To guarantee a light blood decrease without strong mechanical pressure, the hands&#xD;
      are warmed up before the capillary sampling required with the help of an electric blanket or&#xD;
      by warm water roughly on room temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition 15 ml blood from the vein of a forearm is taken.&#xD;
