  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between TAK-831 dose, plasma&#xD;
      exposure, extent and duration of brain D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) enzyme occupancy following&#xD;
      single oral dosing of TAK-831 in healthy participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-831. TAK-831 is a highly selective and&#xD;
      potent inhibitor of DAO, a peroxisomal enzyme active towards neutral D-amino acids which&#xD;
      potentially effects cerebellar dysfunction. This study will look at the relationship between&#xD;
      TAK-831 plasma exposure and the extent and duration of brain DAO enzyme occupancy after&#xD;
      single oral dosing of TAK-831 in healthy male participants using [18F]PGM299 radioactive&#xD;
      tracer injection and PET imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll up to 22 participants in two different sets. Up to 16 participants will&#xD;
      be enrolled in Set A. Within that total, up to 5 dose levels of TAK-831 may be evaluated,&#xD;
      with up to 6 participants per dose level, although typically, there will be 2 to 3&#xD;
      participants per dose level. All participants in Set A will also receive up to 3 doses of&#xD;
      [18F]PGM299. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled in Set B. All participants in Set B will&#xD;
      be assigned to single treatment group to receive 2 doses of [18F]PGM299.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in Set A will be asked to take single oral dose of TAK-831 suspension on Day&#xD;
      1. In Set A, each of the participant will receive a maximum of 3 PET scans with [18F]PGM299;&#xD;
      1 at baseline 2 following a single oral dose of TAK-831 on Days 1 and 2. In Set B, each of&#xD;
      the participant will receive 2 PET scans with [18F]PGM299 on Days 1 and 10. Set B will be&#xD;
      conducted after the confirmation of blockade of [18F]PGM299 binding by TAK-831 in 2 to 4&#xD;
      participants of Set A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to&#xD;
      participate in this study is 62 days. Participants in Set A will make 4 visits to the clinic,&#xD;
      and participants in Set B will make 3 visits to the clinic and all will be contacted by&#xD;
      telephone on Day 15 (Set A) and Day 12 (Set B) of treatment period for a follow-up&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>Participants took part in the study at 2 investigative sites in the United Kingdom from 21-Mar-2016 to 30-Aug-2016.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Healthy participants in Set A received up to 100 megabecquerel (MBq) of [18F]PGM299 for 3 PET scans at baseline, 2, and 26 hours post TAK-831. Set A participants also received a single dose of TAK-831 (100 milligram [mg], 200 mg, 250 mg, or 500 mg). Healthy participants in Set B received up 100 MBq of [18F]PGM299 for 2 PET scans on Day 1 and 10.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>EC50 was obtained from global VT model. The affinity constant relating plasma concentration of TAK-831 to DAO occupancy (EC50) was estimated by fitting the PET and plasma concentration data (VT, Cp). It was calculated as VT= VsBase (EC50/EC50+Cp) + VND, where Vs Base was the group-level (global) volume of distribution of the specific binding in the target region (cerebellar GM) and VND was the volume of distribution of the non-displaceable component (non-specific bound and free radiotracer) of the target region.</description>
