  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics of REMD-477 in subjects who have Type 1 diabetes and are currently&#xD;
      receiving insulin treatment. This proof of concept study will determine whether glucagon&#xD;
      receptor blockade using a single dose REMD-477 can improve short-term glucose homeostasis in&#xD;
      people with Type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at two sites in the United States, and approximately 20 subjects&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes will be enrolled. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical&#xD;
      research unit, to carefully monitor blood glucose; and establish the baseline insulin&#xD;
      requirement for maintaining targeted normoglycemia (postabsorptive: 90-120 mg/dL; and&#xD;
      postprandial: &lt;180 mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will then be subjected to a hyperglycemic period (250-300 mg/dL) by a stepwise&#xD;
      reduction in insulin infusion. After receiving a single SC dose of REMD-477 or matching&#xD;
      placebo in a double-blinded fashion, all subjects will be assessed for the post-treatment&#xD;
      24-hour insulin requirement needed to maintain targeted normoglycemia (postabsorptive: 90-120&#xD;
      mg/dL; and postprandial: &lt;180 mg/dL); and to be monitored closely for safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and targeted glycemic control, for a 48-hr period. After the in-patient residency period,&#xD;
      subjects will return to the clinic for weekly out-patient safety follow-up visits for 8&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
