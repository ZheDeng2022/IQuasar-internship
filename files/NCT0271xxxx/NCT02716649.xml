      In this project, we derive survival risk ratios (SRR) based on International Classification&#xD;
      of Disease version 10 (ICD-10) injury codes to validate the ICD Injury Severity Score (ICISS)&#xD;
      in data from four public university hospitals in India.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2013 trauma was estimated to cause 4,8 million deaths, which is more than HIV/AIDS,&#xD;
      tuberculosis, malaria and maternal conditions combined (1). Ninety per cent of these deaths&#xD;
      occur in lower-middle income countries (LMIC) and an estimated two million lives could be&#xD;
      saved annually by improved quality of care (2,3). India is considered a lower-middle income&#xD;
      country with over 1 million annual trauma deaths (1). In 2020 trauma is estimated to be the&#xD;
      third leading cause of death in the country (4). Hence, efforts to strengthen trauma care in&#xD;
      India are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trauma patients constitute a heterogeneous population, making trauma research and outcome&#xD;
      comparison over time and between contexts difficult but important (5). Accounting for factors&#xD;
      such as selection bias, difference in care and case mix is crucial for correct conclusions&#xD;
      (6,7).To enable this several tools or scores have been developed including the Injury&#xD;
      Severity Score (ISS) and the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) (8,9). The use of these&#xD;
      scores as part of quality improvement programmes has been associated with improved trauma&#xD;
      care (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ISS and TRISS the severity assigned to each injury is based on expert consensus. In&#xD;
      contrast, the international classification of disease (ICD) injury severity score (ICISS) was&#xD;
      developed using a more data driven approach (9,11). This score is based on survival risk&#xD;
      ratios assigned to ICD injury codes to estimate an individual patient's probability of&#xD;
      survival. According to a recent systematic review ICISS outperforms ISS derived methods (12),&#xD;
      but so far almost all research on ICISS is from high income countries. Therefore, our&#xD;
      research question is, does an Indian version of ICISS predict mortality in four public&#xD;
      hospitals in urban India?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a retrospective registry based study to derive and temporally validate a new&#xD;
      version of ICISS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use data from an ongoing prospective cohort study called Towards Improved Trauma Care&#xD;
      Outcomes (TITCO) in India that started in four public university hospitals across urban&#xD;
      India. The four centres are Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital in Mumbai, King Edward&#xD;
      Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center in Delhi, and the&#xD;
      Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research and Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial&#xD;
      Hospital in Kolkata. The data used in this study was collected between October 2013 and&#xD;
      January 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trained project officers conducted all data collection. The project officers had a health&#xD;
      master's degree or higher education. They worked eight hours a day and rotated between day,&#xD;
      evening and night shifts. There was one project officer for each hospital. The project&#xD;
      officers where continuously supervised and trained by project management. Patients were&#xD;
      followed up until discharge, death or 30 days, whichever came first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source and method of participant selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project officers included all consecutive patients that fitted the eligibility criteria. Data&#xD;
      for patients admitted during the project officers' shifts were collected using a combination&#xD;
      of direct observation and extraction from patient records. Data for patients admitted outside&#xD;
      of their shifts was collected retrospectively from patient records within days of patient&#xD;
      arrival. All patients discharged before 30 days where considered alive at 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources/measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on covariates were extracted from patient records or from the patients or their&#xD;
      accompanying relatives. Injuries were also extracted from patient records, including imaging&#xD;
      reports and operation notes and were then coded using ICD-10. We will calculate the SRR for&#xD;
      to each unique ICD-10 code using SRR=A/(A+B), where A denotes the number of surviving&#xD;
      patients with a specific ICD-code and B is the number of non-surviving patients with the same&#xD;
      specific ICD-code. The calculated SRR gets a value between zero and one. One represents 100%&#xD;
      survival and zero represents 0% survival. We will calculate the final ICISS score for each&#xD;
      patient as the product of all individual SRRs. Hence, ICISS also ranges from 0 to 1 and&#xD;
      should be interpreted as the patient's probability of survival. This method is commonly&#xD;
      referred to as the conventional ICISS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias&#xD;
&#xD;
      The personal collecting the data were observers and did not take part in the actual care.&#xD;
      During the conversion from injuries in free text to ICD-10 codes the coders will be blinded&#xD;
      to patient demographics and outcomes. ICD-10 coding will be done after completing World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) ICD-10 online training module and after achieving over 80%&#xD;
      agreement in several samples of 50 injuries compared to an external coder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study size&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use all available data from TITCO and create a temporal split sample, using the&#xD;
      earlier data for derivation and the most recent data for validation. These two samples are&#xD;
      henceforth referred to as the derivation sample and validation sample respectively. We will&#xD;
      first estimate the required sample size of the validation sample to include the most recent&#xD;
      200 consecutive events, i.e. patients who died within 24 hours, and all non-events enrolled&#xD;
      during the same time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We use mortality within 24 hours for our sample size calculation as we want the study to be&#xD;
      powered for secondary outcomes also. This effective sample size will allow us to detect a&#xD;
      significant difference in discrimination and calibration of ICISS between derivation and&#xD;
      calibration samples at 80% power and a 5% significance level. We will include all remaining&#xD;
      patients in the derivation sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will analyse all quantitative variables as continuous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods and analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The derivation and validation of ICISS will be conducted as two separate steps, described&#xD;
      below. We will use R for all statistical analyses. We will assess predictive performance in&#xD;
      terms of discrimination and calibration. Discrimination will be assessed by calculating the&#xD;
      area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROCC) and calibration will be&#xD;
      assessed by comparing observed and predicted outcomes visually in a calibration plot and&#xD;
      statistically by calculating the calibration slope. Confidence intervals for predictive&#xD;
      performance measures will be estimated using a bootstrap approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We interpret overlapping confidence intervals as evidence of lack of a significant&#xD;
      difference. Parametric and non-parametric exact tests will be used as appropriate, with 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals and a 5% significance level. Our main analysis will be a complete case&#xD;
      analysis, in which we exclude observations with missing values in any of the following&#xD;
      variables: age, sex, mechanism of injury, transfer status, and outcome. Observations with no&#xD;
      injuries reported will be assigned an ICISS of 1 and for each observation the final ICISS&#xD;
      will be calculated based only on SRR for ICD-codes that occurred in at least 10 observations&#xD;
      in the derivation sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Derivation&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will derive SRR in the derivation sample for each of the outcomes and used them to&#xD;
      calculate ICISS for each patient. In other words, we will calculate one set of SRR for&#xD;
      mortality within 30 days, henceforth referred to as SRR-30D, and one set of SRR for mortality&#xD;
      within 24 hours, henceforth referred to as SRR-24H. We will then calculate two ICISS for each&#xD;
      patient. We will use similar denotation to refer to these ICISS, i.e. ICISS-30D and&#xD;
      ICISS-24H. Finally, we will assess the performance of ICISS-30D in predicting mortality&#xD;
      within 30 days and within 24 hours, and repeated this analysis for ICISS-24H.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the SRR-30D and SRR-24H that we derive in the derivation sample to calculate&#xD;
      ICISS-30D and ICISS-24H in the validation sample. We will then assess the performance of&#xD;
      ICISS-30D in predicting mortality within 30 days and within 24 hours, and the performance of&#xD;
      ICISS-24H in predicting mortality within 30 days and within 24 hours. Finally, the&#xD;
      performance of each model in the validation sample will be compared with the same model's&#xD;
      performance in the derivation sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct four sensitivity analyses. In the first sensitivity analysis we will include&#xD;
      observations with missing values in covariates but with complete outcome data. In the second&#xD;
      sensitivity analysis we exclude observations without any reported injury. In the third&#xD;
      sensitivity analysis we will calculate ICISS based on all available SRR, regardless of how&#xD;
      frequently the corresponding ICD-10 codes occurr in the dataset. Finally, we will calculate&#xD;
      ICISS for each patient based only on unique ICD-10 codes, in other words, each ICD-10 code&#xD;
      will only be allowed to contribute one SRR to ICISS even if it occurrs more than once in the&#xD;
      same patient.&#xD;
