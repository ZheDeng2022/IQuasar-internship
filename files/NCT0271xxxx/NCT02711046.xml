  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long standing oral submucous fibrosis(OSMF) is associated with involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
      of the oral submucosa and the muscles of mastication leading to difficulty in mouth&#xD;
&#xD;
      opening. Various surgical modalities are mentioned for release but each has its own&#xD;
      limitations.The aim of the study was to evaluate the change in mouth opening in patients of&#xD;
      OSMF after excision of fibrous bands followed by coronoidotomy and surgical defect coverage&#xD;
      by single stage nasolabial flap.&#xD;

      The world of medical science is replete with a plethora of conditions both physiological and&#xD;
      pathological which exhibit manifold symptoms, some of which man has conquered while against&#xD;
      others, he is still waging a relentless battle. In this fast changing world of stress and cut&#xD;
      throat competition, we humans often resort ourselves to tension relieving habits like&#xD;
      alcoholism, smoking, tobacco or betel nut chewing. Apart from the very severe systemic&#xD;
      consequences of these habits, oral cavity is also very adversely affected. Of all the unique&#xD;
      oral afflictions that these habits have on oral cavity of betel quid chewers, Oral Submucous&#xD;
      Fibrosis (OSMF) holds a pivotal position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSMF is a distressing condition in which due to limited opening of the oral cavity, the&#xD;
      patient is neither able to consume a normal diet nor maintain proper oral hygiene. OSMF&#xD;
      mostly occurs in Asian countries, including India ,China, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh,&#xD;
      where chewing betel quid (areca nut , tobacco, slaked lime, or other species) is very popular&#xD;
      &amp; accepted as form of tradition in most part of these countries. It is observed that&#xD;
      irritants like betel nuts, tobacco etc. if kept for longer period around the cheek and&#xD;
      swallowed gradually may play a major part in the causation of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In India, the first mention of this disease in literature dates back to time of 'Sushruta' as&#xD;
      'Vidari'. However in modern literature 'Schwartz' in 1952 first described it as &quot;Atrophica&#xD;
      idiopathica mucosa oris&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral submucous fibrosis is &quot;an insidious, chronic disease affecting any part of the oral&#xD;
      cavity and sometimes the pharynx. Although occasionally preceded by and/or associated with&#xD;
      vesicle formation, it is always associated with a juxta-epithelial inflammatory reaction&#xD;
      followed by a fibroelastic change of the lamina propria, with epithelial atrophy leading to&#xD;
      stiffness of the oral mucosa causing trismus and inability to eat&quot; Usually in this disease&#xD;
      patient has no disabling symptoms in the early phase, but as it progress it causes burning&#xD;
      sensation, difficulty in eating and opening of mouth, that forces patients to report a&#xD;
      clinician with these distressing symptoms. Sharp (1956) has described submucous fibrosis&#xD;
      along with epithelial hyperplasia and mucosal atrophy as a characteristic feature of&#xD;
      abnormal-precancerous oral epithelium and of tissue adjacent to frank oral cancer. OSMF can&#xD;
      transform into oral cancer, and particularly squamous-cell carcinoma, at a rate in the range&#xD;
      of 7% to 13%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSMF can occur in any decade of life but is commonly seen in 2nd -4th decade of life. Various&#xD;
      studies have suggested multifactorial origin of the disease with high incidence associated&#xD;
      with consumption of areca nut. Reduction or preferably stoppage of the habit forms an&#xD;
      essential component of the total treatment plan. The mainstay in the treatment of OSMF is&#xD;
      therefore concentrated upon improving mouth opening and relieving the symptoms either by&#xD;
      medicinal or surgical means. The medicinal treatment for mild cases of OSMF includes&#xD;
      steroids, cardiovascular drugs, antioxidants, vitamins and iron supplements. Topical&#xD;
      application of steroids, hyaluronidase, collagenase, and placental extract has yielded&#xD;
      positive results in mild cases but in advanced cases, surgery followed by aggressive&#xD;
      physiotherapy is the only viable treatment which produces satisfactory results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excision of the fibrous bands and propping the mouth open to allow secondary&#xD;
      epithelialisation causes rebound fibrosis during healing. Release of fibrous bands and split&#xD;
      thickness skin grafting has a high recurrence from contracture. The survival of full&#xD;
      thickness skin grafts is questionable. The use of island palatal flaps based on the greater&#xD;
      palatine artery as recommended by Khanna et al. has limitations including involvement of the&#xD;
      donor site by fibrosis, limited donor tissue with limited reach of the flap, and the need for&#xD;
      extraction of maxillary second molars to cover the defect with the flap under no tension. The&#xD;
      bilateral tongue flaps cause severe dysphasia, disarticulation, and carry the risk of&#xD;
      postoperative aspiration. They also provide a limited amount of donor tissue as their reach&#xD;
      is inadequate. The stability of a tongue flap and dehiscence are the common postoperative&#xD;
      complications of uncontrolled tongue movements. Apart from this the reported involvement of&#xD;
      the tongue is 38%, which precludes its use for reconstruction. Buccal fat pads may also be&#xD;
      used to cover the defects after excision of the fibrous bands. The harvesting of the buccal&#xD;
      fat pad is simple because access is easy. However, severe atrophy of buccal fat pads is seen&#xD;
      in patients with chronic disease. In addition, the anterior reach of the buccal fat pad is&#xD;
      often inadequate, and the region anterior to the cuspid is required to be left raw. This raw&#xD;
      area heals by secondary intention and subsequently fibrosis, leading to gradual relapse.&#xD;
      Bilateral radial forearm free flaps are hairy, 40% of patients require secondary debulking&#xD;
      procedures, and the facilities for free tissue transfer are not universally available.&#xD;
      Canniff and Harvey recommended temporal myotomy or coronoidectomy to release severe trismus&#xD;
      caused by the atrophic changes in the tendon of temporalis muscle secondary to the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the nasolabial flap in reconstruction of head and neck defects has proved to be&#xD;
      efficacious and reliable. The versatility of this flap has been attributed to the fact that&#xD;
      there is often abundant non - hair bearing skin in this well vascularized region. Also the&#xD;
      proximity to the defect and achievement of good cosmetic result with preservation of function&#xD;
      and least distortion of anatomy makes it the flap of choice. Therefore, these advantages of&#xD;
      'extended single stage nasolabial flap' in the treatment of OSMF led us to carry out this&#xD;
      study for &quot;Evaluation of change in mouth opening in centimeters in oral submucous fibrosis&#xD;
      patients after surgical excision of fibrous bands along with bilateral coronoidotomy &amp;&#xD;
      surgical defect coverage by single stage nasolabial flap&quot;. Mouth opening in centimeters was&#xD;
      recorded pre operatively(base line),to 1 week,2 week,3 week,4 week, 2nd month,3rd month and 6&#xD;
      month post operatively and the change was recorded.&#xD;

    <description>The versatility of this flap has been attributed to the fact that there is often abundant non-hair-bearing skin in this well-vascularized region. The facial and infraorbital arteries are frequently cited in anatomic descriptions of the nasolabial flap. The venous drainage is believed to be via the angular and facial veins.</description>
