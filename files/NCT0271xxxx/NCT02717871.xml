      To assess the safety and efficacy of PACK-CXL (photoactivated chromophore for infectious&#xD;
      keratitis cross-linking) as a firstline treatment for infectious corneal infiltrates and&#xD;
      early corneal ulcers, and compare it to the current standard of care, antimicrobial therapy.&#xD;

      Research relevant to this study In 2008, a new concept was taken from transfusion medicine&#xD;
      and transferred to ophthalmology: the reduction of pathogen load in platelet concentrates is&#xD;
      achieved by treatment of concentrates with riboflavin (Vit B2 as a chromophore and UV-A&#xD;
      light). In analogy, a research group in Zurich, Switzerland, showed that this application&#xD;
      could be also applied in human corneal infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proof-of-principle study included 5 corneas that were therapy-resistant to any&#xD;
      conventional type of treatment. In all five cases, the corneal infection calmed down within&#xD;
      days to weeks and all eyes could be saved. In the same year, the effect of riboflavin/UV-A&#xD;
      irradiation was shown on several bacteria and fungi in vitro, with a killing rate of almost&#xD;
      98% within 30 minutes for the most common strains responsible for bacterial keratitis like&#xD;
      Methicillin resistant Staph aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A case series and a clinical&#xD;
      phase 1 study performed by Makdoumi et al showed the beneficial effect of PACK-CXL&#xD;
      (photoactivated chromophore for the treatment of infectious keratitis-corneal collagen&#xD;
      crosslinking) in 15 eyes of 15 patients with early onset corneal ulcers. Here, PACK-CXL was&#xD;
      even used as the primary therapy, whereas controls received maximal conventional therapy&#xD;
      (medication). Again, PACKCXL alone was beneficial in the outcome in all eyes investigated.&#xD;
      Between 2010 and 2013, a randomized prospective clinical trial was performed examining the&#xD;
      effect of adjuvant PACK-CXL therapy in advanced corneal ulcers with associated melting. Even&#xD;
      in these far advanced cases with impending perforation, the additional effect of PACK-CXL was&#xD;
      significant, with a drop in the ulcer-related complication rate from 23% (controls) to 0%. A&#xD;
      number of smaller reports and case series have shown the effect of PACK-CXL on other&#xD;
      bacterial, and also fungal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study's overall goal The overall goal of this study is to demonstrate that PACK-CXL is not&#xD;
      just a valuable adjuvant therapy, but rather a primary treatment modality used in the&#xD;
      beginnings of a corneal ulcer, at the stage of an infiltrate or beginning ulcer. Current&#xD;
      standard of care would then rather play a secondary, supporting role than a primary one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of the study on global eye health. The economic and socioeconomic costs related to&#xD;
      corneal ulcers and their medical treatment are immense. For example, treatment of a fungal&#xD;
      ulcer might cost several thousands of US Dollars. PACK-CXL, in contrast, does not require&#xD;
      (expensive) medication, but rather Vitamin B2 solution and a light source. Also, in vitro and&#xD;
      in vivo data show that PACK-CXL is highly efficient in antibiotic-resistant infection with&#xD;
      MRSA. Furthermore, PACK-CXL is based on CXL, a well-established technique used in other&#xD;
      corneal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale A Riboflavin solution is administered to the cornea in the form of eye drops to the&#xD;
      patient. After an administration of 25 minutes (one drop every 2 minutes), the cornea is then&#xD;
      irradiated with UV-A light at a wavelength of 365nm and a total energy of 5.4 J/cm2 (use 30&#xD;
      min @ 3 mW/cm2, 10 min @ 9 mw/cm2, or 5 min @ 18mW/cm2). These settings are identical with&#xD;
      the standard CXL settings routinely used in clinical practice worldwide. The safety of these&#xD;
      settings has been verified in multiple experimental and clinical studies over the past 15&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis PACK-CXL might be highly beneficial in the treatment of corneal infection for&#xD;
      patients, as an adjuvant therapy in advanced cases, and also a primary mode of treatment in&#xD;
      early cases. In this study, the patients are to be examined after treatment with closer&#xD;
      control range than is customary at this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is in clinical use and has a strong theoretical support. Patients will not run&#xD;
      an increased risk of injury compared with conventional treatments, as the checks are more&#xD;
      frequent than normal and thus, the slightest sign of progress can be detected early. The&#xD;
      investigators do not expect any increased suffering from the treatment or inferior healing&#xD;
      compared to the usual treatment for patients. The study offers the possibility of a new tool&#xD;
      to treat a difficult condition, where the need of culturing decreases and reduces use of&#xD;
      antibiotics.&#xD;
