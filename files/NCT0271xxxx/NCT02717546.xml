    <textblock>
      The objective of this observational prospective study is to systematically document the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes of Zimmer MotionLoc Screws for Periarticular Locking Plate System applied&#xD;
      to distal tibia fracture treatment and confirm safety and performance of the screws.&#xD;

      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiographic &amp; clinical fracture healing at 3 months post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiologic &amp; clinical fracture healing at 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Callus size &amp; distribution at 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiologic fracture healing is defined as bridging of three of the four cortices as seen on&#xD;
      x-ray/CT. Clinical healing will be assessed using the Function Index for Trauma (FIX-IT). The&#xD;
      FIX-IT instrument quantifies clinical healing by assessing weight-bearing and fracture site&#xD;
      pain on an ordinal scale. It has been initially validated in patients with tibia and femur&#xD;
      fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Callus size of the anterior, posterior, and medial aspect will be assessed for each time&#xD;
      point using a validated and published computational method.&#xD;

        <population>Thirty-two subjects were enrolled globally. After 6 weeks follow-up, 28 subjects completed their visit and contributed to study data collection, thus 28 subjects were analyzed for this 6 week secondary endpoint. However, the participation flow reports 20 subjects completed, which is reporting the number of subjects that were available for data collection at the 12 month follow-up.</population>
