    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and best dose of radiation therapy and to see&#xD;
      how well it works in treating patients with cancer that has spread to other places in the&#xD;
      body (metastatic) or has increased in size after being treated with immunotherapy. Giving&#xD;
      radiation therapy may help to control the cancer after the disease has gotten worse after&#xD;
      receiving immunotherapy in patients with cancer that has spread to the other places in the&#xD;
      body.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify immunotherapy-based treatments where salvage radiation produces systemic&#xD;
      disease control after initial progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To identify immunotherapy-based treatments where salvage radiation produces a high rate&#xD;
      of treatment-related toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the frequency of systemic disease control (objective response or stable&#xD;
      disease) after salvage radiation following progression on immunotherapy among all patients&#xD;
      and within each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the frequency of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) with salvage radiation after&#xD;
      progression on treatment with an immunotherapy agent among all patients and within each&#xD;
      treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the rate of systemic objective response among all patients and within each&#xD;
      treatment group among all patients and within each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the duration of response in patients who achieve disease control among all&#xD;
      patients and within each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the overall survival after salvage radiation among all patients and within&#xD;
      each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the systemic progression free survival after salvage radiation among all&#xD;
      patients and within each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo either 4, 5, or 10 fractions of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT),&#xD;
      or 5-15 fractions of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to any site of metastatic disease&#xD;
      daily for any time between 4 days and 3 weeks as determined by the treating radiation&#xD;
      oncologist. Patients with at least stable disease (SD) after the second imaging evaluation&#xD;
      may undergo additional SBRT in 4 fractions or EBRT in 3 fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 12 weeks&#xD;
      for up to 1 year.&#xD;

    <description>To be evaluable for efficacy patients must receive at least one set of systemic imaging &gt;= 4 weeks after completion of radiation. For all control cohorts, efficacy will be evaluated based off of retrospective review of control patients. Corollary investigation will be conducted utilizing immune-related response criteria (ir-RC). Significance testing will assess differences in the frequency of disease control rate via Fisher Exact (if n =&lt; 20) or Chi-squared (if n &gt; 20) test.</description>

    <description>Assessed with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. To be evaluable for toxicity, patients must be on the trial for at least 8 weeks.

In addition the toxicity must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
The toxicity must be immune-related.&#xD;
The toxicity must be attributable to radiation. Exploratory analyses will compare specific treatment groups with the corresponding control group when available.
