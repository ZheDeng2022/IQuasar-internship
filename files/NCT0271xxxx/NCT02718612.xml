  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uraemic sarcopenia is complex, and progressive . As older persons are particularly&#xD;
      susceptible to renal failure and this accelerates the physiological muscle wasting in this&#xD;
      patient group. Hence sarcopenia is an important factor of functional impairment in elderly&#xD;
      patients suffering from chronic kidney disease. On the other hand, overweight has become&#xD;
      increasing common in dialysis patients, and is paradoxically reported to be associated with&#xD;
      better survival. It remains unclear if adipose tissue in overweight in elderly dialysis&#xD;
      patients is a source of proinflammatory mediators, which could contribute to protein-energy&#xD;
      wasting (PEW), cardiovascular disease, and increased mortality. This study attempts to&#xD;
      explore the prevalence of Sarcopenic Obesity (SO) in a cohort of hemodialysis patients with a&#xD;
      more well defined criteria. In addition, this study aims to examine the association between&#xD;
      sarcopenia and SO with metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors in these patients.&#xD;

      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a cross-sectional analysis of all patients on hemodialysis patients treated at&#xD;
      Tungs' Taichung Metroharbor hospital(500 patients). Patients ≥20 years of age and been on&#xD;
      maintenance hemodialysis for at least 3 month before the study. The dialysis sessions were&#xD;
      3.5 to 4.5 h three times per week, with a blood flow greater than 300 mL/min, a dialysate&#xD;
      flow of 600 mL/min, and a bicarbonate buffer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessments and data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators collect baseline clinical data [such as age, sex, height, bodyweight,&#xD;
      clinical etiology of Chronic Kidney Disease if possible, comorbidities, blood pressure,&#xD;
      laboratory measures [such as serum creatinine, albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), total&#xD;
      cholesterol, complete blood counts, total carbon dioxide, anthropometric information and&#xD;
      various potential indicators of PEW [such as body mass index, waist/hip ratio, mid-arm&#xD;
      circumference (MAC), triceps skinfold thickness (TSF), mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC),&#xD;
      mid-arm muscle area (MAMA), SGA, BIA analyses, and hand grip Strength (HGS). For the&#xD;
      laboratory tests, fasting blood samples are obtained from each patient and are performed in&#xD;
      the Department of Clinical Pathology of the investigators hospital by means of routine&#xD;
      methods. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-α(TNF-α )levels are measured via&#xD;
      immunometric enzyme immunoassay. Insulin is analyzed using human ELISA kits . Sensitivity is&#xD;
      2.88 pmol/L, and the upper limits of intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were&#xD;
      3.3 and 7.6, respectively. Homeostatic Model Assessment Insulin Resistance(HOMA-IR) was&#xD;
      calculated as fasting insulin (U/l) × fasting glucose (mg/dl)/405, as described by Matthews&#xD;
      et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received echocardiograms studies performed within 3 months after enrollment,&#xD;
      which were used to estimate Congestive Heart Failure (defined as an ejection fraction of&#xD;
      &lt;40%) or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH, defined as left ventricle mass index 125 g/m2 in&#xD;
      men and 100 g/m2 in women). Cardiovascular disease is defined as a previous history of&#xD;
      Congestive Heart Failure, LVH, ischemic heart disease(including prior history of angina,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous cardiac catheter&#xD;
      intervention) or cerebrovascular disease (including prior history of transient ischemic&#xD;
      attack and stroke).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      The actual bodyweight and height on the day of assessment was used. Anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements include TSF used skinfold calipers MAC measured by a stretchable measuring tape,&#xD;
      MAMC equals MAC(centimeter) -3.14 x TSF (millimeter)/10 and MAMA equals (MAMC2/4π).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) device :(Tanita BC-418) Body composition was&#xD;
           measured using an 8-contact electrode bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) device&#xD;
           (Tanita BC-418, Tanita, Tokyo, Japan), as well as BIS (FMC) and followed the standard&#xD;
           procedure and the manufacturer's instructions.This BIA device was used to measure the&#xD;
           whole body and segmental impedance (± 1Ω) at a frequency of 50 kilohertz (kHz), and it&#xD;
           provided valid muscle mass estimates (kg) of each of the four extremities. Appendicular&#xD;
           muscle mass (ASM) was calculated as the sum of the estimated muscle mass for the arms&#xD;
           and legs. A relative skeletal muscle mass index (ASM/ht2) normalized for height was&#xD;
           defined as the ratio of ASM (kg) and the height squared(m2). For this analysis, the&#xD;
           investigators defined muscle mass cut-off points according to the distribution of&#xD;
           ASM/ht2 of a young population comprising 998 healthy adults (aged 20-40 years) or the&#xD;
           study population. A participant was considered to have low muscle mass if his or her&#xD;
           ASM/ht2 was below -2 standard deviations of the reference young adult values defined in&#xD;
           previous studies (6.76 kg/m2 for men and 5.28 kg/m2 for women).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Bioelectric impedance spectroscopy (BIS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIS measurement was performed in each of the participants enrolled in the study by a specific&#xD;
      member of staff who had completed a training course in the BIS technique, using a portable&#xD;
      whole body bioimpedance spectroscopy device, the body composition monitor (BCM: Fresenius&#xD;
      Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany). The BCM measures the impedance spectroscopy at 50&#xD;
      different frequencies between 5 kHz and 1 megahertz (MHz). Measurements were taken on the&#xD;
      midweek dialysis session before the start of the hemodialysis treatment with the patient&#xD;
      calm, supine, and relaxed in the dialysis bed for 10 minutes. Specific exclusion criteria&#xD;
      were dictated by the device and included history of a pacemaker, defibrillator, metallic&#xD;
      sutures, or stent implantation and amputation of a major limb. The device expresses the body&#xD;
      weight in terms of lean tissue mass (LTM - mainly muscle), adipose tissue mass (ATM - mainly&#xD;
      fat) and overhydration(OH). Each of these compartments has a specific composition and&#xD;
      contains a known quantity of water per mass of tissue. Overhydration(OH) is almost 100%&#xD;
      extracellular water, whereas the water of LTM and ATM consist of differing proportion of&#xD;
      extracellular and intracellular water in addition to solid components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait speed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were observed taking a walk over a short distance at their usual pace, starting&#xD;
      from a standing position, and an examiner timed the task by using a handheld stopwatch that&#xD;
      measured to the nearest hundredth of a second. The walking distance ranged from 3 to 5 m&#xD;
      according to different study sites. The gait speed was calculated as the walking distance (m)&#xD;
      divided by time (s). The investigators examined the distribution of the gait speed stratified&#xD;
      according to the sex-specific median height. Participants with a gait speed in the lowest 20%&#xD;
      of the sex- and height-specific distributions were considered to have low gait speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handgrip strength&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handgrip strength is measured on the non-fistula side before a dialysis session using&#xD;
      mechanical dynamometers with a precision of less than 0.5 kg. Subjects are instructed to&#xD;
      self-adjust the dynamometer so that it fit comfortably to their hand size to obtain the best&#xD;
      performance. Before data collection, a warm up section is conducted so that the subjects&#xD;
      could become acquainted with the instrument and procedures and choose the best adjustment.&#xD;
      Subjects are instructed to grip the dynamometer with maximum strength in response to a voice&#xD;
      command. The subjects stand with both arms extended sideways from the body with the&#xD;
      dynamometer facing away from the body. Three trials are performed with a rest period of at&#xD;
      least 1 min between trials and the highest HGS value is used in the analyses. Participants&#xD;
      with a handgrip strength in the lowest 20% of the sex- and BMI-specific distributions are&#xD;
      considered to have low handgrip strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of nutritional status and potential indicators of PEW&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective Global Assessment (SGA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SGA is recommended by National Kidney Foundation Kidney / Disease Outcomes Quality&#xD;
      Initiative(K/DOQI) as an instrument for assessing the nutritional status of dialysis patients&#xD;
      . It is a semiquantitative scoring system based on history and physical examination. The&#xD;
      history consists of five components: weight loss during the preceding 6 months,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms, food intake, functional capacity, and comorbidities. Each of these&#xD;
      features is scored separately as A, B, or C, reflecting well-nourished to severely&#xD;
      malnourished categories. The physical examination consists of 2 components: loss of&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat and muscle wasting. These two components are classified in terms of the&#xD;
      three major SGA scores: A, well nourished; B, mild to moderate malnutrition; and C, severe&#xD;
      malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malnutrition-Inflammation Score (MIS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      MIS scoring sheet consists of four sections (patient's related medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, body mass index (BMI), and laboratory parameters) and 10 components. Patient's&#xD;
      medical history consists of five components: dry weight changes, dietary intake,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms, functional capacity, and co-morbidity, including number of years&#xD;
      on dialysis. Major comorbid conditions (MCC) include congestive heart failure class III or&#xD;
      IV, , severe coronary artery disease, moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD), major neurological sequelae, and metastatic malignancies or status post&#xD;
      recent chemotherapy. Physical examination consists of two components, which aims to detect&#xD;
      decreased fat store or loss of subcutaneous fat and signs of muscle wasting. Laboratory&#xD;
      parameters are serum albumin and serum total iron binding capacity (TIBC). Each of 10 MIS&#xD;
      components is classified among four levels of severity, from 0 (normal) to 3 (severely&#xD;
      abnormal). The sum of all 10 MIS components ranges from 0 (normal) to 30 (severely&#xD;
      malnourished); a higher score reflects a more severe degree of malnutrition and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions of sarcopenia, obesity, and sarcopenic obesity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators determine the presence of sarcopenia according to the European Working&#xD;
      Group on Sarcopenia in Older People(EWGSOP) consensus definition. A diagnosis of sarcopenia&#xD;
      requires the presence of low muscle mass in addition to a low handgrip strength or a slow&#xD;
      gait speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were considered to have severe sarcopenia if all three of these criteria were&#xD;
      present, whereas those with low muscle mass, but without a low handgrip strength or a slow&#xD;
      gait speed, were considered to be in the pre-sarcopenia stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity was defined in 3 ways&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Base on waist circumference:&#xD;
&#xD;
           waist circumference was measured at the mid-level between the iliac crest and the lower&#xD;
           border of the twelfth rib while the subject stood with feet 25-30 cm apart. A normal WC&#xD;
           level in men and women was defined as &lt;90 and &lt;80 cm, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Based on the reference values by Baumgartner et al. The cut-off point of obesity was a&#xD;
           body fat percentage that is greater than the 60th percentile of the study sample by sex&#xD;
           (27.82% in men and 37.61% in women).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Based on BMI: The investigators calculate the BMI as the bodyweight in kg divided by the&#xD;
           square of the height in m2, and categorized it according to the definition of the&#xD;
           Department of Health in Taiwan (BMI 24-26.9 kg/m2 for overweight and BMI ≥27 kg/m2 for&#xD;
           obesity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenic obesity is characterized by high body fat combined with low skeletal muscle mass.&#xD;
      Class II sarcopenia was indicated by definition in participants whose height- or&#xD;
      weight-adjusted ASM was below 2 Standard Deviation(SD). SO was considered as the combination&#xD;
      of class II sarcopenia and obesity according to each definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covariates&#xD;
&#xD;
      The covariates were the participant's age, sex, smoking status (smoker or non-smoker), and&#xD;
      comorbidities. Participants who reported smoking cigarettes at the time of the interview were&#xD;
      defined as smokers. Comorbidities were assessed by referring to the self-reported physician's&#xD;
      diagnosis, and included hypertension, cancer, advanced liver disease, diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      stroke, heart failure, arthritis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
