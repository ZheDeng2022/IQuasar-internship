  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background International guidelines underline the importance of strengthening the&#xD;
      coordination and continuity of cancer care. The different roles of general practitioners and&#xD;
      oncologists with regard to treatment, follow-up and rehabilitation during and after cancer&#xD;
      treatment are often obscure to cancer patients. Parallel courses of healthcare are often&#xD;
      taking place instead of coordinated care characterized by continuity and partnership between&#xD;
      care providers. Patients may feel uncertain about the health professionals' skills and area&#xD;
      of responsibility. Healthcare seeking and support during and after cancer treatment may,&#xD;
      therefore, be inappropriate, leaving patients feeling insecure and lost between care&#xD;
      providers.The study aims to design and evaluate a new way of communication and shared&#xD;
      decision-making that brings the patient, the oncologist and general practitioner together in&#xD;
      a shared video-consultation in the early phase of chemotherapeutic treatment. The effect of&#xD;
      the intervention in addition to usual care will be tested in a randomized controlled trial at&#xD;
      Vejle Hospital in the Region of Southern Denmark. Based on sample size calculation,&#xD;
      investigators intent to include 300 patients at the Department of Oncology and their general&#xD;
      practitioners. Results and process outcomes will be evaluated qualitatively and&#xD;
      quantitatively, questionnaires to patients, general practitioners and oncologists, and data&#xD;
      from registers.&#xD;
