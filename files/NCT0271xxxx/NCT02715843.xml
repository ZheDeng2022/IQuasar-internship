  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an active treatment, extended access study open solely to those subjects who have&#xD;
      successfully completed the Core and Repeat Dosing portions of the MT-3724_NHL_001_US clinical&#xD;
      study and who, in the investigator's judgment, (i) have not had progressive disease while on&#xD;
      MT-3724 treatment (i.e.; have shown a complete or partial response or stable disease), (ii)&#xD;
      have experienced no clinical or laboratory toxicities that would contraindicate further&#xD;
      MT-3724 dosing and (iii) have no acceptable and better alternative treatment available to&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each treatment cycle will consist of 6 doses of MT-3724 to be administered over 12 days&#xD;
      followed by at least 9 days of observation but longer intervals between dosing cycles will be&#xD;
      allowed at the investigator's discretion (e.g., 6 doses of MT-3724 over 12 days followed by&#xD;
      16 days observation). Subjects in this extension study may continue to receive up to 6&#xD;
      additional cycles in the absence of clear disease progression or toxicity. If a subject&#xD;
      achieves complete remission, two additional cycles will be attempted, after which dosing may&#xD;
      be suspended prior to completion of the maximum 6 cycles.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible subjects must be adequately informed of all study procedures and fully&#xD;
             consent to participation as demonstrated by signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible subjects must require treatment for their NHL and have:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  tolerated MT-3724 throughout the MT-3724_NHL_001_US Phase I/Ib study (Core and&#xD;
                  Repeat Dosing),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  successfully completed the Core and Repeat Dosing portions of MT-3724_NHL_001_US&#xD;
                  Phase I/Ib study as defined by that protocol,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  received no other treatment for their NHL since enrollment in the&#xD;
                  MT-3724_NHL_001_US Phase I/Ib study,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  maintained stable disease or better throughout that study and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  been assessed by the investigator to have no other acceptable and better&#xD;
                  treatment options available to them. The investigator must document in the&#xD;
                  potential subject's medical record that there are no other approved treatment&#xD;
                  options available and/or appropriate for the potential subject or that the&#xD;
                  potential subject has declined any other approved treatment options that me be&#xD;
                  available to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential subjects must continue to meet the diagnostic criteria for B-Cell NHL that&#xD;

          -  Potential subjects must have received all approved therapies known to provide clinical&#xD;
             benefit for their disease subtype and for which they are eligible or must have refused&#xD;
             these treatment options prior to consideration for continued compassionate use&#xD;
             treatment with MT-3724 through enrollment in this protocol. In the case of subjects&#xD;
             who have lymphomas for which high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell&#xD;
             transplantation (HD-ASCT) is considered a standard curative therapy, eligibility for&#xD;
             MT-3724 compassionate use requires that the subject's disease relapsed after HD-ASCT,&#xD;
             that the subject is not eligible for HD ASCT, or that the subject has refused HD-ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;

             I/Ib study and which can be followed during extended treatment for possible new&#xD;
             disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential subjects must be at least 9 days past their last course of MT-3724 treatment&#xD;
             and have recovered from any side effects attributed to MT-3724 to at least Common&#xD;

             initiating additional cycles of MT-3724 through this compassionate use protocol.&#xD;

                  thrombocytopenia must be secondary to bone marrow infiltration by tumor and not&#xD;
                  secondary to increased platelet consumption or the effect of previous marrow&#xD;
