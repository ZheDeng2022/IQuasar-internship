  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with histologically proven melanoma who will be treated with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      will undergo FDG PET/CT scan as an early evaluation of response to therapy. Changes in FDG&#xD;
      uptake will be correlated with lab and pathology results.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients, at least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of histologically confirmed melanoma as assessed per medical record review.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible for the trial UPCC #01615, &quot;A Phase Ib Tissue Collection Study of&#xD;
             Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Subjects with Resectable Advanced Melanoma.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide&#xD;
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior&#xD;
             to study-specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females who are pregnant or breast-feeding at the time of screening will not be&#xD;
             eligible for this study. Female participants of child-bearing potential will have a&#xD;
             urine or serum pregnancy test at the time of the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to tolerate imaging procedures in the opinion of the investigator or&#xD;
             treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious or unstable medical or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator would compromise the subject's safety or successful participation in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ineligible for the trial UPCC #01615, &quot;A Phase Ib Tissue Collection Study of&#xD;
             Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Subjects with Resectable Advanced Melanoma.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only individuals (aged 18 or over) who can understand and give informed consent will&#xD;
             be eligible to participate in this study. Individuals who are considered to be&#xD;
             mentally disabled will not be recruited for this study. All subjects must be able to&#xD;
             give informed consent. We will not be using specific methods to assess decisional&#xD;
             capacity. Economically disadvantaged persons will not be vulnerable to undue&#xD;
             influence, as this study offers no compensation. All individuals will be told that&#xD;
             their choice regarding study participation will in no way change their access to&#xD;
             clinical care. This should negate any undue influence or coercion. Children, fetuses,&#xD;
             neonates, or prisoners are not included in this research study.&#xD;
