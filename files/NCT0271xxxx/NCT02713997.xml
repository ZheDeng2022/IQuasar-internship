    <textblock>
      Patients with severe chronic pancreatitis may be candidates to have their pancreas removed&#xD;
      and their islets transplanted into the liver to reduce the risk of diabetes mellitus, a&#xD;
      procedure called total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplant (TPIAT). However, over half&#xD;
      of patients who have a TPIAT will need to remain on some supplemental insulin life-long after&#xD;
      the procedure. We will study therapies that may reduce damage to transplanted islets, and&#xD;
      thereby improve long-term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two promising anti-inflammatory therapies are available to protect islets from damage at the&#xD;
      time of transplant: (1) the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor etanercept and (2)&#xD;
      the serine protease inhibitor alpha-1 antitrypsin. Both agents are commercially available for&#xD;
      clinical trials. Proof-of-principle for etanercept has been demonstrated in type 1 diabetic&#xD;
      allotransplant recipients, in whom a 10 day course of etanercept early post-transplant&#xD;
      significantly improved long-term insulin independence, due to better survival of the&#xD;
      transplanted beta cell mass in the engraftment period. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) reduces&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines, protects against cytokine-induced beta cell apoptosis, and prolongs&#xD;
      islet graft survival in mice and intraportal IAT non-human primates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initial 3-arm drug-treatment clinical trial will investigate the use of Etanercept and&#xD;
      A1AT to improve IAT function at 90 days and 1 and 2 years post-TPIAT compared to standard&#xD;
      care. Forty-five patients undergoing TPIAT will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either: 1)&#xD;
      etanercept (50 mg on day 0; 25 mg on days 3, 7, 10, 14, and 21), 2) alpha-1 antitrypsin (90&#xD;
      mg/kg IV days -1, +3, 7, 14, 21, 28) or 3) standard care. Patients will have mechanistic&#xD;
      assessments drawn in the early post-operative period including inflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
      chemokines and measures of beta cell loss. Metabolic testing will occur at 90, 365, and 730&#xD;
      days post-TPIAT, including mixed meal tolerance testing, IV glucose tolerance testing, and&#xD;
      glucose-potentiated arginine-induced insulin secretion (GPAIS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients with severe pancreatitis refractory to medical and endoscopic therapy, total&#xD;
      pancreatectomy (TP) with islet autotransplantation (IAT) may be considered. While 90% of&#xD;
      TPIAT recipients have some function of the transplanted islet graft, only about 1/3rd come&#xD;
      completely off insulin. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop new&#xD;
      therapies that will increase the number of patients who are non-diabetic following islet&#xD;
      autotransplant. Such therapies may also benefit recipients of islet allotransplant for type 1&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following islet transplantation, the islets must acutely survive the stress of the procedure,&#xD;
      and then they must engraft in the liver and establish a vascular supply. The greater the&#xD;
      functional islet mass engrafted, the lower the risk of post-operative diabetes. It has been&#xD;
      estimated that more than half of the islet mass may be lost in the early post-transplant&#xD;
      period in islet transplant recipients. Beta cell apoptosis is common during the first month&#xD;
      post-transplant and is upregulated in the presence of inflammatory cytokines such as&#xD;
      TNF-alpha. Thus, a major contributor to islet loss is the inflammatory damage sustained by&#xD;
      the transplanted islets in the early post-transplant period; we propose to directly target&#xD;
      this destructive process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two promising anti-inflammatory therapies are available to address this problem: (1) the&#xD;
      TNF-alpha inhibitor etanercept and (2) the serine protease inhibitor alpha-1 antitrypsin.&#xD;
      Both agents are commercially available for clinical trials. Proof-of-principle for etanercept&#xD;
      has been demonstrated in type 1 diabetic allotransplant recipients, in whom a 10 day course&#xD;
      of etanercept early post-transplant significantly improved long-term insulin independence,&#xD;
      due to better survival of the transplanted beta cell mass in the engraftment period. Alpha-1&#xD;
      antitrypsin (A1AT) reduces inflammatory cytokines, protects against cytokine-induced beta&#xD;
      cell apoptosis, and prolongs islet graft survival in mice and intraportal IAT non-human&#xD;
      primates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initial 3-arm drug-treatment clinical trial will investigate the use of Etanercept and&#xD;
      A1AT to improve IAT function at 90 days and 1 and 2 years post-TPIAT compared to standard&#xD;
      care. Forty-five patients undergoing TPIAT will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either: 1)&#xD;
      etanercept (50 mg on day 0; 25 mg on days 3, 7, 10, 14, and 21), 2) alpha-1 antitrypsin (90&#xD;
      mg/kg IV days -1, +3, 7, 14, 21, 28) or 3) standard care. Patients will have mechanistic&#xD;
      assessments drawn in the early post-operative period including inflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
      chemokines and measures of beta cell loss. Metabolic testing will occur at 90, 365, and 730&#xD;
      days post-TPIAT, including mixed meal tolerance testing, IV glucose tolerance testing, and&#xD;
      glucose-potentiated arginine-induced insulin secretion (GPAIS). The latter measures the&#xD;
      maximally stimulated acute C-peptide response (ACRmax) as the best estimate of islet mass and&#xD;
      the primary endpoint (at day 90) for this study. Results will be used to select the most&#xD;
      promising agent for future study in a randomized, blinded multi-center clinical trial.&#xD;
