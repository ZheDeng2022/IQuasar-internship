      The gastric cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause&#xD;
      of cancer death in China.80%-90% patients were detected at middle and later stage.The&#xD;
      five-year survival rate for advanced gastric cancer patients is less than 10% due to the&#xD;
      shortage of effective treatment method.The five-year survival rate for early gastric cancer&#xD;
      patients is beyond 90%.The reason for poor diagnosis and treatment is that current methods do&#xD;
      not achieve the diagnosis of early gastric cancer.Endoscopy with biopsy is still the main&#xD;
      method for confirming gastric cancer.But it is limited to identify early gastric cancer and&#xD;
      it leads to the low diagnostic rate of early gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infrared endoscopic imaging is a new great potential method of diagnosis of early gastric&#xD;
      cancer, since the first report in the 1990s, people have been exploring in this field.&#xD;
      Through intravenous injection of exogenous contrast medium, such as the indocyanine green, it&#xD;
      makes mucosal lesions highlight,and avoids the interference of background light.If specific&#xD;
      target molecular is linked to the contrast medium,the specific imaging of the lesion can be&#xD;
      presented. What is more,due to the strong penetration power of infrared light,its imaging&#xD;
      depth also increases significantly.Indocyanine green had also been demonstrated safe in&#xD;
      clinical studies and widely used. On this basis,we apply for the research about near-infrared&#xD;
      endoscopy to diagnose early gastric cancer,and discuss its feasibility of the infrared&#xD;
      endoscopy to diagnose early gastric cancer and clinical value.&#xD;

      The gastric cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause&#xD;
      of cancer death in China.80%-90% patients were detected at middle and later stage.The&#xD;
      five-year survival rate for advanced gastric cancer patients is less than 10% due to the&#xD;
      shortage of effective treatment method.The five-year survival rate for early gastric cancer&#xD;
      patients is beyond 90%.The reason for poor diagnosis and treatment is that current methods do&#xD;
      not achieve the diagnosis of early gastric cancer.Endoscopy with biopsy is still the main&#xD;
      method for confirming gastric cancer.But it is limited to identify early gastric cancer and&#xD;
      it leads to the low diagnostic rate of early gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate diagnosis for early gastric cancer and the pretherapeutic estimation of the invasion&#xD;
      depth is desired to determine suitable treatment.Presently,endoscopic submucosal dissection&#xD;
      is the new effective minimally invasive treatment for early gastric cancer,which preserve the&#xD;
      entire stomach and improve the patient's postoperative quality of life.But the estimation of&#xD;
      invasion depth of gastric cancers should be confirmed before operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently,some research suggest that narrow banding imaging and endoscopy ultrasonography are&#xD;
      considered established means of diagnosis for early gastric cancer and depth.No formal&#xD;
      quantitative review of the available evidence has been published that narrow banding imaging&#xD;
      or endoscopy ultrasonography could accurately diagnose early gastric cancer and evaluate the&#xD;
      invasive depth.This means still has great limitations.The sensitivity of narrow banding&#xD;
      imaging diagnosis is only 60% which its high false positive rate,shorter wavelength and&#xD;
      lighter penetration,and the result is influenced by histologic variety of early gastric&#xD;
      cancer and inflammatory changes in the background mucosa;Although endoscopy ultrasonography&#xD;
      achieves a diagnostic accuracy of over 80%,and its tomographic views facilitate objective&#xD;
      assessments,it is occasionally difficult to obtain images with adequate quality, and its&#xD;
      evaluation is highly dependent on operators' proficiency levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infrared endoscopic imaging is a new great potential method of diagnosis of early gastric&#xD;
      cancer, since the first report in the 1990 s, people have been exploring in this field.&#xD;
      Through intravenous injection of exogenous contrast medium, such as the indocyanine green, it&#xD;
      makes mucosal lesions highlight,and avoids the interference of background light.If specific&#xD;
      target molecular is linked to the contrast medium,the specific imaging of the lesion can be&#xD;
      presented. What is more,due to the strong penetration power of infrared light,its imaging&#xD;
      depth also increases significantly.Indocyanine green had also been demonstrated safe in&#xD;
      clinical studies and widely used, such assessment of liver function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present,the research in this aspect is very few, a few clinical research results show that&#xD;
      infrared endoscopic imaging has a larger value for differentiating between early gastric&#xD;
      cancer and gastric adenoma, and the difference between early gastric cancer and gastric&#xD;
      lesions is significantly correlated with the depth of cancer invasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is not a system research about the infrared imaging characteristics of gastric&#xD;
      cancer and different precancerous status,and there is no infrared endoscopic imaging&#xD;
      assessment criteria for diagnosis of gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the investigators have completed the experiments on animals about infrared imaging,&#xD;
      the results prove that it has good specificity to identify tumor lesion. On this basis,the&#xD;
      investigators apply for the research about near-infrared endoscopy to diagnose early gastric&#xD;
      cancer,and discuss its feasibility of the infrared endoscopy to diagnose early gastric cancer&#xD;
      and clinical value.&#xD;
