  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this experiment, the investigators will study the effect of a mass media family planning&#xD;
      campaign on contraception related behavior. The study takes place in Burkina Faso, a country&#xD;
      with an average of six children born to each woman, and a modern contraceptive prevalence&#xD;
      rate (mCPR) estimated at 15% in 2010 at the national level, as per the Demographic Health&#xD;
      Survey (DHS) 2010 report on Burkina Faso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to provide robust evidence on the efficiency and cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of an intense three-year mass media campaign focused on family planning. The campaign will&#xD;
      diffuse messages about the financial and health benefits of family planning, and information&#xD;
      on the different types, sources, advantages, and disadvantages of different contraceptive&#xD;
      methods. The study will target women at the age of reproduction in rural areas of Burkina&#xD;
      Faso to measure the effect of the intervention on total and modern contraceptive prevalence&#xD;
      rates, perceptions of family planning, contraception-related behavior, and general gender&#xD;
      norms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burkina Faso is an ideal place to evaluate the impact of a radio campaign because a high&#xD;
      percentage of the rural population listens to local radio which is in the local language.&#xD;
      Radio station areas are distinct because they target very local languages and their reach is&#xD;
      limited by government decree, which allows for the implementation of a randomized control&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Development Media International (DMI), a non-governmental organization (NGO) that runs media&#xD;
      campaigns to induce behavioral change in developing countries, will implement the mass media&#xD;
      campaign in conjunction with community radio stations in rural areas of Burkina Faso. The&#xD;
      study takes place in the coverage areas of 16 radio stations, all selected in a way to&#xD;
      prevent overlap between coverage areas, and to have different local languages through which&#xD;
      the campaign will be diffused. This strategy limits possible &quot;leakages&quot; between the treatment&#xD;
      and the control groups. Out of the 16 clusters of radio stations, 8 will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive the media campaign, and the other 8 will be left as control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each radio station cluster, only small and rural villages with no access to&#xD;
      electricity will be sampled in order to limit access to television. The radio stations being&#xD;
      in urban to semi-urban areas, villages that are more than 5 km away from a radio station will&#xD;
      be excluded. Villages within radio station clusters will be randomly selected to participate&#xD;
      in the study. A household listing survey will be conducted in all selected villages to get an&#xD;
      exhaustive list of households and the basic information on women within each household. In&#xD;
      addition, a village survey will be conducted with village chiefs to get a better sense of the&#xD;
      demographics and the key figures in each village.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the information provided by the listing on women at the age of reproduction,&#xD;
      eligible women will be randomly selected to participate in the study. These women will be&#xD;
      invited to take the baseline survey, and 3 years later, the endline survey, therefore forming&#xD;
      a panel structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the listing, village, and women surveys, a clinics survey will take place to&#xD;
      monitor the demand and supply of contraceptive methods in different areas. The clinics&#xD;
      questionnaire will ask about contraception related behavior, including perception of family&#xD;
      planning, usage of contraception, number of pregnancies and abortions, among other things.&#xD;
      The investigators are also seeking administrative data from clinics within radio stations&#xD;
      areas to examine whether distribution of contraceptive products is higher in treatment areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the media campaign will be analyzed based on information provided by women on&#xD;
      how they and their partners perceive and use traditional and modern contraceptive methods,&#xD;
      and cross-verified with information provided on demand for contraception and family planning&#xD;
      by the clinics survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative research will take place prior to the launch of the campaign in order to better&#xD;
      formulate messages that could reach the target audience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Data collection, reporting, and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection will be conducted by Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), and NGO&#xD;
      specialized in conducting randomized control trials (RCTs) with presence and experience in&#xD;
      Burkina Faso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected through questionnaires using Personal Digital Assistance (PDA). For&#xD;
      the qualitative research questionnaires, answers might be recorded using paper. The surveyors&#xD;
      might audio-record some parts of some interviews with women and health facilities using the&#xD;
      PDAs to monitor surveying quality and performance of enumerators. The resulting datasets will&#xD;
      be coded and clearly labeled in accordance with the information provided on the&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected by enumerators trained by IPA on the importance of confidentiality of&#xD;
      the data, transparency, and accuracy of reported information. Backchecks will also be&#xD;
      conducted to make sure that the data provided is consistent and correct. Protocols have been&#xD;
      developed to address adverse events during data collection where enumerators go back to their&#xD;
      supervisors and to the IPA office to address any complications. In addition, high frequency&#xD;
      checks will be conducted whenever new data comes in to monitor the quality of data&#xD;
      collection, and how values of different variables and missing values vary by enumerators and&#xD;
      locations. Logic checks will be conducted to make sure that the value of variables fall&#xD;
      within logical ranges. This allows for quick detection and correction of major outliers and&#xD;
      high rates of attrition. Finally, all adverse events will be reported to the Massachusetts&#xD;
      Institute of Technology's internal review board (the Committee on the Use of Humans as&#xD;
      Experimental Subjects) as quickly as possible in accordance with the human subjects&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Sample size and minimum detectable effect:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total sample size is approximately 8,000 women across more than 250 villages in 16 radio&#xD;
      clusters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To calculate this sample size, power calculations were conducted using simulations in Stata.&#xD;
      Having two levels of clustering (region and village levels), two intracluster correlation&#xD;
      (ICC) levels were used for power calculations, both based on the 2010 DHS data for women in&#xD;
      Burkina Faso. The DHS data revealed a modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) of 9% among&#xD;
      women of reproductive age (both in union and single) in rural areas and regions where the&#xD;
      study takes place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these calculations, a baseline level of mCPR of 12% was assumed, therefore allowing for&#xD;
      some increase in usage over time. Based on these numbers and calculations, the study is&#xD;
      powered to detect a minimum of 6 percentage points increase in the mCPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the assumed baseline level of mCPR is close to the actual one, power is expected to&#xD;
      increase further as the investigators will (1) use a matched stratification on baseline&#xD;
      levels of contraception prevalence rate at the radio station level (the level of treatment&#xD;
      assignment), in addition to stratifying village selection on distance to health clinics, and&#xD;
      individual selection of women on several characteristics such as education and access to a&#xD;
      radio (2) control for baseline levels of explanatory variables and the baseline level of the&#xD;
      outcome, and (3) use a panel structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible, however, that the total and modern contraceptive prevalence rates are higher&#xD;
      in the actual sample than the value assumed based on the 2010 DHS data, which could reduce&#xD;
      power.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion in our study of radio station clusters on which treatment will be randomized is&#xD;
        based on the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The cluster has at least one local radio station with adequate Frequency Modulation&#xD;
             (FM) rays to cover the zone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Different radio stations' coverage areas do not overlap with each other&#xD;

             except in a couple of radio station clusters where villages sampled had up to 4,200&#xD;
             inhabitants due to the low number of small villages in them.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The radio stations through which the campaign will be diffused, being in semi-urban or&#xD;
             urban locations, we only include villages that are more than 5 km away from these&#xD;

&#xD;
        Individual level criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We only survey women at the age of reproduction, i.e. between 15 and 49 years of age&#xD;
             as measured by the listing&#xD;
