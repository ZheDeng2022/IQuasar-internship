  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise testing has become clinically important in the management and ongoing evaluation of&#xD;
      patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) with higher rates of exercise tolerance and participation&#xD;
      previously linked to lower mortality risk (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower exercise capacity generally correlates with more severe lung disease (2,3) and landmark&#xD;
      studies suggest that low exercise capacity as measured by peak oxygen capacity (VO2peak) and&#xD;
      rate of decline in lung function (FEV1) are strong predictors of mortality (1,4). However not&#xD;
      all studies have found pulmonary function tests (PFTs) to be reliable predictors of maximal&#xD;
      exercise capacity (5), especially in relatively well preserved lung function (6,7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wide distribution in physical capacity between fit individuals and end stage disease adds&#xD;
      to complexity of assessment. Independent factors of age, genetics, habitual exercise,&#xD;
      nutritional status and musculoskeletal conditions are all known to influence physical&#xD;
      capacity in patients with CF (8,9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal exercise testing places additional stress on cardiovascular, respiratory and&#xD;
      peripheral systems providing more information around multiple influences on disease&#xD;
      progression including degree of limitation in these major systems (10,11) and is useful for&#xD;
      assessment of exercise desaturation, more common (but not always present) in advanced lung&#xD;
      disease (5,12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With prediction of exercise performance and functional capacity from PFTs unreliable and the&#xD;
      understanding that health status correlates better with exercise tolerance there has been an&#xD;
      increase in maximal exercise testing for patient management (13). Many international centers&#xD;
      now regard exercise testing as highly important with many assessing maximal exercise capacity&#xD;
      annually to monitor disease progression, identify physical status and drive changes in&#xD;
      medical, physiotherapy or nutritional management (14,15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main vision is to develop a standardized incremental step test protocol suitable for&#xD;
      adults with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), all ages, levels of fitness and disease state that is in&#xD;
      line with current exercise testing recommendations (15). To develop a more useful field test&#xD;
      to assess exercise tolerance and a more &quot;user friendly&quot; test than the currently available&#xD;
      laboratory exercise test to allow for early detection of decline in physical function in the&#xD;
      day-to-day clinical setting. To date no studies have been published in adults with CF where&#xD;
      an incremental exercise step test has been investigated to assess exercise tolerance or&#xD;
      determine maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Many international centers now regard exercise testing as highly important with many&#xD;
      measuring maximal exercise capacity annually to monitor disease progression, identify&#xD;
      physical status and to drive changes in medical, physiotherapy or nutritional management&#xD;
      (14,15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current best practice for assessing VO2max in adults with CF is a CPET using the Godfrey&#xD;
      Protocol, a progressive and incremental maximal test performed on a cycle ergometer&#xD;
      (13,14,15). Exercise testing should aim to achieve a maximal response within a time frame of&#xD;
      8-12 min and incremental protocols with stage duration of 1 minute are considered more&#xD;
      efficient in eliciting the desired response within this time frame (14). During CPET, VO2max&#xD;
      is determined while breath-by-breath gas analysis allows for a comprehensive assessment of&#xD;
      exercise ventilation and circulation. This information can identify reasons for low exercise&#xD;
      capacity and whether exercise limitation is due to deconditioning, or primarily within the&#xD;
      respiratory, cardiovascular or peripheral systems. CPET is performed using a specialist&#xD;
      ergometer, and requires specialist clinical expertise, monitoring and reporting equipment for&#xD;
      interpretation of the test. The cost, space and expertise to carry out CPET in CF units&#xD;
      around the world may limit its use for the regular assessment of exercise capacity in adults&#xD;
      with CF (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Field Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Field tests generally cannot determine absolute maximal exercise capacity, but do provide&#xD;
      valuable information about the patient's functional abilities and limitations and compared to&#xD;
      laboratory tests are inexpensive and easy to administer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Field tests that use a single step for assessment of exercise tolerance in patients with&#xD;
      chronic lung disease include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-Minute Step Test (3MST):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3MST is a feasible and acceptable measure of sub-maximal exercise performance in children&#xD;
      and adults and a useful tool in the assessment of oxygen desaturation (17,18). The test is&#xD;
      short in duration, simple to carry out, and has low cost and minimal space and equipment&#xD;
      requirements however the sub-maximal nature and ceiling effect of the 3MST limits its&#xD;
      usefulness clinically across the age spectrum (18,19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chester Step Test (CST):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CST is a 10-minute sub-maximal standardized multistage test and like the 3MST has minimal&#xD;
      space and equipment requirements. The CST was originally designed for workplace screening and&#xD;
      is now widely used for exercise prescription in the UK cardiac population (20). In healthy&#xD;
      individuals one study reported a ceiling effect and a positive relationship between predicted&#xD;
      VO2max using the CST and measured VO2max (21) however a subsequent study questioned this&#xD;
      prediction validity (22). The CST has been found to be highly reproducible in patients with&#xD;
      chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and reliable in patients with Bronchiectasis, but too&#xD;
      challenging for both groups (23,24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Modified Incremental Step Test (MIST):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MIST was designed to be more suitable for COPD patients and modeled from the CST(25). A&#xD;
      reduction in work rate was not found to result in a difference in cardiopulmonary stress and&#xD;
      exertion effort at peak exercise but did result in a higher exercise tolerance in patients&#xD;
      with COPD. The MIST is reliable and better tolerated than the CST in patients with&#xD;
      Bronchiectasis (23,24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CST and CF:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One study (published in abstract form) has shown the CST to be a useful field test when&#xD;
      compared to the 3MST and 6MWT for those with mild to moderate CF. The authors commented this&#xD;
      was likely due to the progressive nature being more representative of adult physical activity&#xD;
      (26).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main vision is to develop a standardized incremental step test protocol suitable for&#xD;
      adults with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), all ages, levels of fitness and disease state that is in&#xD;
      line with current exercise testing recommendations (15). The test should be a more useful&#xD;
      than the already available field tests and more &quot;user friendly&quot; test than the currently&#xD;
      available laboratory exercise test to assess exercise tolerance and allow for early detection&#xD;
      of decline in physical function in the day-to-day clinical setting. To date no studies have&#xD;
      been published in adults with CF where an incremental exercise step test has been&#xD;
      investigated to assess exercise tolerance or determine VO2max.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To design a standardized externally paced incremental step test that is portable, easy&#xD;
           to administer, simple to perform, time, cost and space efficient (A-STEP).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study A:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess feasibility and reliability of the A-STEP to objectively assess exercise&#xD;
           tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if the A-STEP is a more useful tool than the 3-Minute Step Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study B:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To develop an alternative tool to determine maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) to the &quot;gold&#xD;
           standard&quot; CPET that is feasible across the whole spectrum of lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine if the A-STEPmax is a valid tool when compared to the VO2max achieved from&#xD;
           a CPET performed on a cycle ergometer using the Godfrey Protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principle investigator hypothesizes that the A-STEP will be a feasible tool to assess&#xD;
      exercise capacity; and the A-STEP max will be a valid tool for the assessment of VO2max&#xD;
      across the age range and disease spectrum in adults with CF.&#xD;
