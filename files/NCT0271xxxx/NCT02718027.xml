      Alport syndrome (AS) is a progressive hereditary glomerular disease with the prevalence 1 in&#xD;
      50,000. AS is caused by pathogenic variants in the COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 genes encoding&#xD;
      type IV collagen α3, α4, and α5 chains, respectively. There are three modes of inheritance:&#xD;
      X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS), autosomal recessive AS (ARAS), and autosomal dominant AS&#xD;
      (ADAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alport Syndrome causes progressive kidney damage. The glomeruli and other normal kidney&#xD;
      structures such as tubules are gradually replaced by scar tissue, leading to kidney failure.&#xD;
      Boys with Alport Syndrome, regardless of the genetic type, eventually develop kidney failure.&#xD;
      These boys often need dialysis or transplantation during their teenage or young adult years,&#xD;
      but kidney failure can occur as late as 40-50 years of age in some men with Alport Syndrome.&#xD;
      Most girls with the X-linked type of Alport Syndrome do not develop kidney failure. However,&#xD;
      as women with Alport Syndrome get older the risk of kidney failure increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, diagnosis of Alport Syndrome relies on careful evaluation of the patient's signs&#xD;
      and symptoms, along with the family history. Hearing and vision should also be tested. The&#xD;
      evaluation can also include a blood test, urine tests, and a kidney biopsy to determine&#xD;
      Alport Syndrome. A genetic test is crucial to confirm the diagnosis and determine the genetic&#xD;
      type of Alport Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no cure for Alport syndrome; however, symptomatic treatment can help relieve&#xD;
      symptoms. Kidney transplantation is usually very successful in people with Alport Syndrome&#xD;
      and is considered the best treatment when end-stage kidney failure is approaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study to identify biomarker/s for Alport Syndrome and to explore their&#xD;
      clinical robustness, specificity, and long-term variability, in the attempt to offer access&#xD;
      to earlier diagnosis and treatment monitoring.&#xD;
