      International, multicenter, observational, longitudinal study to identify biomarker/s for the&#xD;
      development of a new MS-based biomarker for the early and sensitive diagnosis of&#xD;
      Transthyretin-Related Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy from blood and number of correctly&#xD;
      identified patients with Transthyretin-Related Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy&#xD;

      Diseases of diverse etiology can be correlated to the term &quot;polyneuropathy&quot;(PNP). The&#xD;
      pathogenesis may be of inflammatory, autoimmune, metabolic, toxic or hereditary nature.&#xD;
      Careful clinical and electrodiagnostic assessment, with attention to the pattern of&#xD;
      involvement and the types of nerve fibers most affected, narrows the differential diagnosis&#xD;
      and helps to focus the laboratory evaluation. Beside the frequent genetic etiologies in PNP&#xD;
      (pmp22, MFN2) one cause of a polyneuropathy may be a hereditary amyloidosis. This term&#xD;
      describes the accumulation of misfolded protein in the interstitial space. The abnormal&#xD;
      accumulation of β-fibrils can be detected histologically by Congo pink staining. Aside from&#xD;
      acquired amyloidotic neuropathies (e.g. PNP caused by AL-amyloidosis [AL= amyloidosis with&#xD;
      light chain immunoglobins]) there are also hereditary amyloidotic neuropathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These have been described as endemic in Sweden, Portugal or Japan. More recent studies&#xD;
      provided evidence for the presence of hereditary amyloidotic neuropathies amongst the German&#xD;
      population and that they are currently underdiagnosed. The most common form of the hereditary&#xD;
      familial amyloidotic neuropathy (FAP) is the Transthyretin-related FAP, however two other&#xD;
      amyloidogenic proteins have been described: Apolipoprotein A-I and Gelsolin (Ando et al.,&#xD;
      2005; Adams et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TTR-FAP is an autosomal dominant disease, the exact prevalence of which is unknown but&#xD;
      estimated to be around 1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000 in the normal population. By limiting the&#xD;
      study population to patients with PNP of unknown etiology it should be possible to gain&#xD;
      evidence for the prevalence of the disease in Germany by investigating fewer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the diagnosis of the amyloidotic neuropathy can be conducted histologically, a&#xD;
      molecular genetic approach is necessary to diagnose TTR-FAP. Even though more than 100 point&#xD;
      mutations are known to cause the disease, the most common amino acid change is V30M.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mutation in the TTR gene causes the destabilization of the physiologically tetrameric&#xD;
      protein. Usually transthyretin consists of four identical monomeric subunits and binds the&#xD;
      thyroxin circulating in the blood plasma. The monomeric subunits exhibit a pronounced β-&#xD;
      sheet structure which leads to the accumulation of unsoluble β-fibrils when they are&#xD;
      destabilised as in TTR-FAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This accumulation of misfolded TTR can lead to three phenotypes known as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cardiac TTR amyloidosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  leptomeningeal TTR amyloidosis and the&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TTR-FAP&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TTR-FAP has a very heterogeneous phenotype which can manifest starting at the age of 18&#xD;
      and may lead to death within 10 years. The symptoms can be categorized in three groups (Ando&#xD;
      et al. 2005):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysfunction of peripheral nerves:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dissociated anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle paresis and atrophy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dysaesthesia and paraesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced skin temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coldness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hoarseness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autonomic dysfunction:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dysuria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diarrhea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Constipation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Orthostatic dysregulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Erectile dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nausea&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constitutional conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Edema&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acroparaesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      The currently available therapeutic approaches are either liver transplantation (as the liver&#xD;
      mainly produces transthyretin this is a feasible approach) or as of more recently also a TTR-&#xD;
      tetramer stabilizing agent (Tafamidis). Tafamidis (Vyndaqel®) gained the European approval&#xD;
      under &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;in November 2011 for treating FAP in adults with a&#xD;
      symptomatic polyneuropathy. In light of the potential therapy of this very rare disease, this&#xD;
      study aims to determine the prevalence of TTR-FAP in a selected, clinical subpopulation. New&#xD;
      methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic&#xD;
      alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future&#xD;
      the disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it is the goal of the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from&#xD;
      the plasma of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose&#xD;
      and thereby with an earlier treatment.&#xD;

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectometry, maximal&#xD;
      7,5 blood will be taken from the patient via a dry blood spot filter card. To proof the&#xD;
      correct diagnosis in those patients where up to the enrolment in the study no genetic testing&#xD;
      has been done, sequencing will be done. The analyses will be done at the Centogene AG Am&#xD;
