  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pivotal, 12-month, randomized, sham controlled, parallel group, multicenter, double&#xD;
      blind study with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The study population is children between the&#xD;
      ages 6 to 17 years, with mild to moderate persistent asthma. The purpose of the study is to&#xD;
      determine whether the CREON2000A, an environmental control device, will decrease asthma&#xD;
      severity, as measured by the Composite Asthma Severity Index (CASI), in children with mild to&#xD;
      moderate persistent allergic asthma over a twelve month period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pilot study (Protocol #PA-01-052; Health Effects of CREON2000 in Asthmatic Children. IB&#xD;
      ID# GI 1001) offered preliminary evidence that the CREON2000A system may be beneficial in&#xD;
      asthma. This study is a follow-up, using children, aged 6 to 17 with mild to moderate&#xD;
      persistent asthma, as the subjects of the study. Children are usually treated with fewer&#xD;
      controller medications and have fewer confounding co-morbidities making it more likely to&#xD;
      detect a therapeutic benefit from an environmental intervention. The study will involve 4&#xD;
      study site visits, 2 home visits, and 7 phone calls. Adjustment of asthma therapy by the site&#xD;
      clinician will occur at baseline (Visit 1) and at each follow-up office visit after Visit 1&#xD;
      using a modified algorithm based on the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program&#xD;
      Expert Panel Report 3 (NAEPP EPR3) guidelines. Enrollment will be over 18 months. The study&#xD;
      duration for each subject will be 12 months.&#xD;
