    <textblock>
      Intracranial Pressure ( ICP ) monitoring is an essential component of traumatic brain injured&#xD;
      ( TBI ) patients management. The clinical signs of raised ICP may be unreliable and may&#xD;
      reflect relatively late cerebral decompensation. ICP may be monitored by invasive or non&#xD;
      invasive techniques. While invasive techniques show the real time values of ICP, they are&#xD;
      associated with many complications like, intracranial bleeding and infection, occlusion of&#xD;
      the catheter tip by blood, debris and difficult to locate ventricle in presence of cerebral&#xD;
      oedema. All these drawbacks of invasive methods can be averted by employing non invasive&#xD;
      techniques of ICP monitoring. Although they do not show a real time value but are excellent&#xD;
      tools to detect presence or absence of raised ICP. Elevated ICP can be detected by&#xD;
      Computarised tomographic scan (CT) or Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but , these techniques&#xD;
      are time consuming and require transportation of a patients who may be unstable .The quick&#xD;
      and non invasive nature of ultrasonography is fast becoming popular for rapid detection of&#xD;
      elevated ICP at bedside in emergency and ICU by monitoring the optic nerve sheath diameter (&#xD;
      ONSD ). Its limitations notwithstanding, ultrasonographic ONSD monitoring is likely to be&#xD;
      more reliable than clinical assessment in the diagnosis of intracranial hypertension&#xD;
      especially, when patient is under sedation which precludes proper clinical examination.&#xD;
      Therefore, in recent years ,among non invasive methods, bedside ocular ultrasonography to&#xD;
      monitor ICP has gained popularity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbon dioxide being a potent modulator of cerebral vascular tone, alters the ICP by changing&#xD;
      the size of cerebral vasculature and thereby, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and this action&#xD;
      occurs very rapidly, over e period of few minutes. In a range of PaCO2 20mmHg to 80 mmHg the&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow changes in a linear manner. End tidal carbon dioxide concentration(EtCO2)&#xD;
      is a surrogate measure of PaCO2 (especially in a haemodyanimically stable patient with&#xD;
      healthy lungs ) and is routinely monitored continuously in patients subjected to general&#xD;
      anaesthesia. To date there is very little literature on the effects changing EtCO2 on ONSD .&#xD;
      This prompted us to conduct this study to find out the effects of different levels of EtCO2&#xD;
      on ONSD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study we monitored the effect of three different EtCO2 levels ( 40mmHg,30mmHg and&#xD;
      50mmHg ). In these healthy patients we observed rapid response in ONSD with changes in EtCO2.&#xD;
      This again highlights the fact that optic nerve being in direct communication with the brain&#xD;
      ,the pressure changes in the latter are reflected in the ONSD. The alteration in ONSD was&#xD;
      immediate in response to EtCO2 changes, and moreover,changes in ONSD were parallel to the&#xD;
      EtCO2 changes. Since CBF and cerebral blood volume change in response to changes in PaCO2,&#xD;
      the ONSD also changes accordingly. Over the years ,advancements in monitoring of ICP has&#xD;
      enabled the diagnosis of elevated ICP reliably by non-invasive techniques.Optic nerve sheath&#xD;
      diameter measurement using bedside ultrasound has been shown to correlate with clinical and&#xD;
      radiologic signs and symptoms of raised ICP. Despite the association between ONSD and PaCO2 ,&#xD;
      there is scanty literature on ONSD responsiveness to a more dynamic surrogate of PaCO2, that&#xD;
      is EtCO2. The pertinent advantages of EtCO2 over PaCO2 measurement is that the former is&#xD;
      continuously monitored under anesthesia and avoids time consuming process of arterial blood&#xD;
      gas sampling. Moreover, the sensitivity of ICP to even small fluctuations in EtCO2 has been&#xD;
      reported in literature. Animal studies have estimated that the rate of this increase in ONSD&#xD;
      by 0.0034mm/mmHg increase in ICP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ONSD was smallest (0.29cm) at EtCO2 30mmHg, and biggest (0.40cm ) at EtCO2 50mmHg while&#xD;
      it was intermediate ( 0.34cm) at EtCO2 40 mmHg. These changes in ONSD are direct&#xD;
      representation of changes in ICP brought about by changes in CBF due to PaCO2 changes. Based&#xD;
      on results of Bland Altman plots, the calculated 95% confidence interval (CI) for the&#xD;
      difference of two measures( EtCO2 40mmHg and 30mmHg ) on ONSD was 0. 009 to 0.102 and the&#xD;
      calculated CI for the difference of other two measures ( EtCO2 40mmHg and 50mmHg ) on ONSD&#xD;
      was 0.152 to 0. 29 and thus were observed to be statistically insignificant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently Kim et al studied ONSD responsiveness to two levels of EtCO2 ,40 and 50mmHg, each&#xD;
      measured at 1 and 5min and they observed significant changes in the diameter of ONSD. Thus&#xD;
      their results are at variance with our study. Various possibly reasons for differences in&#xD;
      findings are Kim et al studied a small number of patients as opposed to a relatively larger&#xD;
      sample size in our study. Also they used total intravenous anesthesia combining propofol and&#xD;
      remifentanil infusion. This combination is more likely to predispose patients to systemic&#xD;
      hypotension which in turn would increase ICP by causing cerebral vasodilation. Other&#xD;
      possibility for different results may be that sonographic measurements of ONSD may vary by&#xD;
      the observer's skills or even type of ultrasound device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to available literature, the upper limit of ONSD used to define ICP more than&#xD;
      20mmHg (raised ICP ) ranges from 0.48 to 0.57 cm. In our study ,the upper limit of ONSD at&#xD;
      EtCO2 level 50mmHg was average of 0.40cm which implies that even at EtCO2 50mmHg,&#xD;
      intracranial hypertension is a remote possibility in healthy non-neurosurgical patients with&#xD;
      normal brain compliance. We kept constant the factors such as position of patients, time of&#xD;
      measurement after achieving target EtCO2, measuring ONSD in a single plain ( transverse) and&#xD;
      involving same experienced operator,,thereby, avoiding any confounding factors.&#xD;
