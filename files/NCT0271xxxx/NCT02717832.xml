  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to identify factors that &quot;protect&quot; some obese adults from&#xD;
      becoming insulin resistant. Identifying mechanisms that help protect some obese adults from&#xD;
      developing insulin resistance could lead to novel, targeted therapeutic and/or preventative&#xD;
      strategies for obese adults who are insulin resistant.&#xD;

      SCREENING PROCEDURES Participants will undergo a battery of initial screening tests&#xD;
      including: a detailed health history and physical examination, a physical activity&#xD;
      questionnaire, and a body composition assessment. All women will undergo a urine pregnancy&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GENERAL STUDY DESIGN To avoid potential confounding hormonal effects, all women will be&#xD;
      studied in the early follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. Subjects will be advised of&#xD;
      what they should be eating in the 3 days leading up to their hospital visit to maintain their&#xD;
      weight. Subjects will also complete a three day food journal before their hospital visit. The&#xD;
      day prior to the study trial admission, subjects will need to eat pre-prepared standardized&#xD;
      meals for breakfast, lunch, dinner and an evening snack that the study team has given them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the Michigan Clinical Research Unit (MCRU) in the morning after&#xD;
      a 12-hour, overnight fast. After arrival, subjects will rest quietly in their room for about&#xD;
      30 minutes. The study team will then measure subjects resting metabolic rate for about 20&#xD;
      minutes. After this test, an intravenous (IV) catheter will be placed for infusions and a&#xD;
      second IV will be placed in vein of the opposite arm for blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the IV placement, the study team will begin a tracer-labeled glucose, or &quot;sugar,&quot;&#xD;
      infusion. The study team will then remove a small sample of muscle from the subjects thigh.&#xD;
      This muscle biopsy procedure involves numbing a nickel-sized portion of the skin of the thigh&#xD;
      with a local anesthetic, making a small incision (1/4 inch), and removing a small piece of&#xD;
      muscle (approximately the size of 2-3 grains of rice). The incision will then be closed with&#xD;
      a piece of sterile tape. The study team will also obtain a small sample of fat tissue from&#xD;
      the area just underneath the skin near the belly button. This procedure involves numbing a&#xD;
      small region of skin near the belly button with a local anesthetic, using a needle a small&#xD;
      amount of fat tissue is removed from underneath the skin. During the procedure subjects will&#xD;
      feel some pinching and pulling, but it should not be very painful. The injury resulting from&#xD;
      the muscle and fat tissue biopsies is rather minor. Subjects will likely have some bruising&#xD;
      and mild soreness, but it should not prevent them from performing their general daily&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 2.5 hours after admission, the study team will begin the tracer-labeled fat&#xD;
      infusion. The tracer-labeled fats the study team are infusing occur naturally in the body. By&#xD;
      injecting a slightly greater amount of this substance than what is already in the body the&#xD;
      study team will be able to measure the rate of fat breakdown and fat burning. After about 50&#xD;
      minutes of the infusion, three blood samples will be obtained in 5 min intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After, the study team will begin a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure (a procedure&#xD;
      to measure the body's sensitivity to insulin). During this procedure the study team will&#xD;
      infuse insulin and glucose through the IV and will collect blood samples every 5 minutes for&#xD;
      the duration of the procedure to monitor the subjects blood glucose and blood insulin&#xD;
      concentrations. This procedure is designed to last 2 hours. The study team will change the&#xD;
      infusion rate of glucose accordingly to ensure that the subjects blood sugar is maintained at&#xD;
      a healthy/normal level. The study team will also infuse a small amount of potassium to make&#xD;
      sure potassium concentrations remain at healthy/normal levels. About 30 minutes after&#xD;
      starting this procedure to measure the body's sensitivity to insulin, the study team will&#xD;
      collect another sample of muscle from the thigh and fat tissue from the area just underneath&#xD;
      the skin near the belly button. After completing the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp&#xD;
      procedure, subjects will be provided a meal, and the study team will continue to monitor the&#xD;
      subjects blood glucose concentration until stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the subjects vital signs are stable, the study team will also measure percent body fat&#xD;
      using a Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) and intra-abdominal fat by Magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI). When the DEXA scan and MRI tests have been completed, subjects will be&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital. Depending on scheduling, however, the DEXA scan and MRI tests&#xD;
      may be performed on a separate occasion from the study trial admission.&#xD;
