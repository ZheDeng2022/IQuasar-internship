  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interest in patient therapeutic education (PTE) is increasing: in France PTE was included&#xD;
      within the 2009 &quot;Hospital, Patient, Health and Territory&quot; law as an essential component of&#xD;
      the patient healthcare pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTE is a complex intervention: its delivery is variable and may vary according to its&#xD;
      content, functioning, providers, targeted patients, environment and even its objectives.&#xD;
      These differences impact the expected results and make difficult the evaluation of PTE&#xD;
      interventions. To overcome this difficulty, it is essential to describe precisely the&#xD;
      intervention, the processes and the implementation of PTE that are usually not known. PTE&#xD;
      interventions need today a global understanding of their mechanisms constituting their&#xD;
      complexity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCErTo study aims at developing a classification of the different elements composing a PTE&#xD;
      intervention that can impact their results and can ensure their continued existence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms implemented during PTE interventions will be analyzed by a qualitative research.&#xD;
      The investigators wish to identify organizational, pedagogical, psychosocial, medical or&#xD;
      contextual elements that can impact the results, the patients' participation and the&#xD;
      continuity of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perspective of this research is to improve the understanding of PTE by providing thorough&#xD;
      description of the interventions. This work will help stakeholders to better interpret the&#xD;
      results of their interventions, to improve the transferability, the implementation and&#xD;
      finally to determine which are the elements able to improve patients' health status.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is an observational study with no intervention. It uses qualitative methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of the classification consists in 3 phases: a preliminary phase of literature&#xD;
      review, an investigation phase and a phase of elaboration of the classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary phase To deepen the questioning of the research, a literature review will be&#xD;
      realized on concepts and models as well as on tools and methods used in the published PTE&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigation phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      This step uses qualitative methods with 3 types of data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Semi structured interviews: individual interview will be realized with health care&#xD;
           professionals and Therapeutic Patient Education stakeholders (trainers, professional&#xD;
           network, decisions makers..). Focus groups will be organized with patients after&#xD;
           completion of a therapeutic patient education program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In situ observations of the sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of the documents surrounding the implementation of the interventions: reports,&#xD;
           grey literature, applications; the objective is to capture the environment supervising&#xD;
           the programs&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to include up to 15 programs. However, this number will be adjusted&#xD;
      according to the principle of data saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Programs will be selected to ensure variability: the investigators will include hospital&#xD;
      based or community based programs, programs led by general practitioners or specialists, with&#xD;
      or without patients' implication, recent or experimented programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each program, at least 3 health care professionals and one focus group with patients will&#xD;
      be conducted. It will be completed by observation of education sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other actors (patients' proxies, associations playing a role in the conception or animation&#xD;
      of the programs, designers, coordinators, general practitioners, experts of French&#xD;
      territorial organization, trainers..;) will complete the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this step is not only to describe the practices but also to interview the experts&#xD;
      on the elements they think can impact the results of PTE interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase of elaboration of the classification Thematic and content data analyses are scheduled.&#xD;
      Concept mapping method will be used to develop the classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The classification will be reviewed by experts having not participated to the previous steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation of the classification :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applicability and relevance of the classification will be tested with 15 programs in various&#xD;
      medical domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The classification will then be used in a cohort of patients before and after PTE&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this classification (or list), recommendations to describe PTE programs will be&#xD;
      published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eventually, the aim of the recommendations, is to improve the understanding of PTE by&#xD;
      providing thorough description of the interventions. This work will help stakeholders to&#xD;
      better interpret the results of their interventions, to improve the transferability, the&#xD;
      implementation and finally to determine which are the elements able to improve patients'&#xD;
      health status.&#xD;
