  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerated dose of rAd.CD40L&#xD;
      (also called ISF35) when given with pembrolizumab to patients with melanoma. Researchers also&#xD;
      want to learn if the highest tolerated dose of ISF35 and pembrolizumab can help to control&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of this drug combination will be also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be assigned to 1&#xD;
      of 2 dose levels of ISF35 based on when they join this study. Up to 6 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the first group and up to 24 participants will be enrolled in the second group.&#xD;
      The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. If no intolerable side&#xD;
      effects are seen, all other participants enrolled in the study will receive the highest dose.&#xD;
      If participant is assigned to the first group, they will not be able to move up to the second&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will also receive the same dose of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive ISF35 as an injection directly into 1-3 tumors every 3 weeks. The&#xD;
      injections will be done in the clinic or at the interventional radiology suite. The study&#xD;
      staff may use image guidance such as ultrasound, CT, and/or MRI to help inject the drug into&#xD;
      the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 0 (the first week participants receive treatment):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check participant's&#xD;
           immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a tumor biopsy to check how the disease is responding to the study&#xD;
           drug. To collect a biopsy, the area of skin is numbed with anesthetic and a small cut is&#xD;
           made to remove all or part of the affected tissue. This biopsy will be performed within&#xD;
           24 hours of the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tumors will be photographed and measured. For the photographs, participant's private&#xD;
           areas will be covered (as much as possible), and a picture of their face will not be&#xD;
           taken unless there are tumors on their face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Weeks 1 and 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Weeks 3, 6, and 9 (± 3 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check participant's&#xD;
           immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Week 6 only, participant will have a biopsy of 1 of the tumors that has been&#xD;
           injected with the study drug and 1 of the tumors that they did not have an injection in&#xD;
           to learn if the tumors have responded to the study drug. Researchers also want to learn&#xD;
           if participant has any genetic mutations (changes) that may change how they respond to&#xD;
           the study drug. The tumors will also be photographed and measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant may receive the study drugs for up to 9 weeks. Participant will be taken off&#xD;
      study if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to&#xD;
      follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's participation on the study will be over after about 2 years of follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 3 weeks after participant's last dose of study drug (Week 12) or as soon as they stop&#xD;
      taking the study drug (if they stop taking the study drug before Week 9):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check participant's immune&#xD;
           system, and to learn if the study drug has had any effect on the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have an MRI, CT, or positron emission computed tomography (PET)/CT scan&#xD;
           and the tumors will be photographed and measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 2 weeks after participant's last dose of study drugs and then every 8-12 weeks after&#xD;
      that for up to 2 years:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check participant's immune&#xD;
           system, and to learn if the study drug has had any effect on the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have MRI, CT, and/or PET/CT scans to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
           The tumors will also be measured and photographed. Participant's doctor will decide what&#xD;
           type of scans they will have.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At participant's first follow-up visit after they stop taking the study drug, they will&#xD;
           have a tumor biopsy to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant chooses to receive care at another hospital, the study staff will call them&#xD;
      every 3 months for up to 2 years after their last dose of study drugs to learn how they are&#xD;
      doing. The calls should last about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. ISF35 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is&#xD;
      currently being used for research purposes. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available for the treatment of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study&#xD;
      doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 36 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;
