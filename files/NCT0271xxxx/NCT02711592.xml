      The objective of this study is to see how pain management and its outcomes are effected when&#xD;
      pharmacogenomic testing is used to determine patient specific pain medication and dosing. Our&#xD;
      goal is to determine if through the use of analgesic genetic testing, TKA post-operative&#xD;
      patients will see a decrease in narcotic consumption, postsurgical opioid- related adverse&#xD;
      reactions, and length of stay, overall NRS pain scores and while maintaining or improving&#xD;
      their satisfaction scores.&#xD;

      This is a pilot study that will look at how pain management will be effected when&#xD;
      pharmacogenomic testing is utilized to select and dose narcotic pain medications prescribed&#xD;
      for breakthrough pain in post-operative total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. Patients will&#xD;
      receive individualized analgesics and doses for pain mitigation based on genetic testing&#xD;
      results. Post op pain scores, narcotic consumption, adverse reactions, length of stay and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction with pain management will be collected and analyzed to determine the&#xD;
      significance of the pharmacogenomic analgesic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the lack of literature and evidence surrounding pharmacogenomics and its use in&#xD;
      selecting analgesics to control post-operative pain a pilot study is being conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate effect size (statistical variability) in an attempt to predict an appropriate sample&#xD;
      size for a larger scale randomized control trial. The subjects enrolled and data collected&#xD;
      for this internal pilot will be used in the larger scale parent study as well.&#xD;
