    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the chances of becoming pregnant are better&#xD;
      when day the single best day 5 embryo (blastocyst) resulting from an in vitro fertilization&#xD;
      (IVF) cycle is transferred into the uterus immediately, or after freezing the embryo and&#xD;
      transferring it into the uterus in a subsequent cycle, separate from the ovarian stimulation&#xD;
      used in the IVF cycle. The investigators hypothesize that in good-prognosis patients,&#xD;
      vitrified-warmed elective single embryo transfer will result in higher implantation, clinical&#xD;
      and on-going pregnancy and live birth rates than fresh elective single embryo transfer at the&#xD;
      blastocyst stage.&#xD;

      This will be a randomized controlled trial involving good prognosis infertility patients&#xD;
      undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) +/- intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Good&#xD;
      prognosis is defined as: age &lt;35 years, 1st IVF or IVF/ICSI cycle, normal ovarian reserve&#xD;
      parameters (antral follicle count (AFC) &gt;12, antimullerian hormone (AMH) &gt; 15 pmol/L, cycle&#xD;
      day 3 follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &lt; 10 IU), primarily tubal factor/male factor with&#xD;
      ejaculated sperm or unexplained infertility, who achieve 3 or more high quality blastocysts&#xD;
      (adequate quality for either fresh embryo transfer or cryopreservation by 5 days&#xD;
      post-oocyte-retrieval).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be undergoing an IVF/ICSI cycle utilizing either long gonadotropin&#xD;
      releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or GnRH antagonist protocols. In the long GnRH agonist&#xD;
      cycles, participants will take a combined oral contraceptive pill (OCP) for 21-42 days. The&#xD;
      GnRH agonist buserelin acetate (0.2 mg subcutaneously daily) will be started 5 days before&#xD;
      the last OCP is taken, for a 5-day overlap, and continued until the day of hCG trigger. In&#xD;
      the GnRH antagonist cycles, women will either be down-regulated with an oral combined&#xD;
      contraceptive pill (OCP) for 14-21 days, starting on cycle day 3 of the pre-stimulation&#xD;
      cycle, or with estrogen 4 mg orally daily starting approximately 7 days post-ovulation in the&#xD;
      pre-stimulation cycle. Participants continue the OCP or estrogen until the designated stop&#xD;
      day as determined by the clinic schedule. In both agonist and antagonist cycles, FSH will be&#xD;
      given to each patient in either recombinant or human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) forms, at&#xD;
      doses ranging from 150 IU (international units) to 300 IU daily, as per investigator&#xD;
      judgment. FSH will start on either a natural day 3 following OCP or estrogen withdrawal, or&#xD;
      on an 'assigned' day 3, based on scheduling requirements. The FSH dose will be maintained for&#xD;
      4 days, after which dose titration can occur according to results of follicular development&#xD;
      seen on transvaginal ultrasonography and serum estradiol levels, which first occurs on cycle&#xD;
      day 7. Continued ultrasonographic and serum level monitoring will occur every 1-2 days until&#xD;
      time of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) trigger. In the GnRH antagonist cycles, a GnRH&#xD;
      agonist will be started at a dose of 250 mcg daily when any of the following first occurs:&#xD;
      cycle day 9, estradiol level &gt; 2000 pmol/L, lead follicle &gt; 14 mm in diameter, and will be&#xD;
      continued until time of hCG trigger. Timing of hCG (5000-10,000 IU) administration will occur&#xD;
      once at least three lead follicles have diameters &gt; 17 mm. Oocyte retrieval will be performed&#xD;
      36 hours after hCG administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fertilization will utilize either routine IVF or ICSI, depending upon the etiology of&#xD;
      infertility and the quality of sperm. With ICSI, only mature oocytes will be inseminated.&#xD;
      Embryo evaluation will occur per the clinic's standard protocols. Embryo assessment on day 5&#xD;
      post-fertilization will dictate final eligibility for study enrollment. Consenting&#xD;
      participants with 3 or more cryopreservation-quality blastocysts (2BB or higher, graded&#xD;
      according to Gardner's criteria) will then be randomized to either fresh single embryo&#xD;
      transfer (SET) (and cryopreservation of all good quality supernumerary blastocysts) or a&#xD;
      single frozen embryo transfer (FET) delayed to the subsequent menstrual cycle following&#xD;
      cryopreservation of all of the good quality blastocysts. All FET cycles will be performed&#xD;
      under a standard endometrial preparation protocol involving vaginal estradiol administration&#xD;
      for approximately 14 days. Luteal support in either fresh or FET cycles will be with vaginal&#xD;
      micronized progesterone, 200 mg vaginally 2-3 times daily, starting the day following fresh&#xD;
      ET, and 6 days prior to FET, once documented endometrial thickness of 8 mm or more is&#xD;
      achieved. The best quality blastocyst will be transferred first. Should the best blastocyst&#xD;
      not survive warming in the FET group, the second-best blastocyst will be used. All&#xD;
      cryopreservation will be performed by vitrification. Luteal phase progesterone will continue&#xD;
      until either 10 weeks gestation (in an ongoing pregnancy) or until a documented negative&#xD;
      serum hCG level drawn 14 days after the date of embryo transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a documented positive hCG serum level, the participant will undergo a transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound at 7 weeks gestation to document number of gestational sacs (implantation) and&#xD;
      clinical pregnancy rate (positive fetal heart beat). Confirmation of ongoing pregnancy&#xD;
      (beyond 12 weeks gestation) will be obtained by review of hospital records for ultrasounds&#xD;
      performed for nuchal translucency measurements or anatomic assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization at the blastocyst stage is chosen to avoid cycle cancellation if randomized&#xD;
      earlier. All participants will be randomized by an intention to treat approach. All other&#xD;
      components of the IVF/ICSI cycle including stimulation medications, monitoring protocols,&#xD;
      etc. will be at the discretion of the participant's primary IVF physician; while this&#xD;
      information will be documented it will not constitute criteria for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each successive enrolled participant to be randomized will choose a sequentially numbered,&#xD;
      opaque, sealed envelope and be assigned to either the freeze-all or fresh transfer groups,&#xD;
      based upon the envelope contents derived using computer generated block randomization,&#xD;
      utilizing random block sizes of 4 and 6 participants, with a 1:1 allocation. The envelop&#xD;
      contents will be provided by an independent individual not involved in study recruitment or&#xD;
      clinical care of the participants.&#xD;
