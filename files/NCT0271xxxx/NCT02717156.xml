  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      work in treating patients with urothelial (bladder) cancer that has spread from the primary&#xD;
      site to other places in the body or has come back and does not respond to certain&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs. Combinations of biological substances in recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion&#xD;
      protein may be able to carry tumor-killing substances directly to urothelial cancer cells.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread. Giving recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein and pembrolizumab together&#xD;
      may be a better treatment for patients with urothelial cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility of using pembrolizumab-recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein&#xD;
      (sEphB4-HSA) combination in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure the overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure the progression-free survival (PFS). II. To measure the objective response rate&#xD;
      (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1),&#xD;
      programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD-L2) and EPH receptor B4 (EphB4) expression by tumor&#xD;
      cells (TC) as well as immune cells (IC)- macrophages and T cells- in tumor tissue and&#xD;
      correlate them with ORR, PFS and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine the tumor tissue T cell frequency (counts), tumor tissue T cell clonality&#xD;
      using T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, and peripheral blood T cell clonality, pre-treatment&#xD;
      and post-treatment and correlate these with ORR, PFS and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure the phenotype of lymphocytes and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), in&#xD;
      pre and post-treatment blood samples and correlate these with ORR, PFS and OS; an extra blood&#xD;
      sample for future studies will also be collected and banked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To examine peripheral blood circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for enumeration and molecular&#xD;
      analysis in pre and post-treatment blood samples, and correlate these with ORR, PFS and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To collect and bank tumor tissue. VI. To examine the role of adding positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) to a contrast computed tomography (CT) for evaluation of response to&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1, 8, and 15 and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6-12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
