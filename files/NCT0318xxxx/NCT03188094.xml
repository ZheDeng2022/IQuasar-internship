    <textblock>
      The proposed study will inform efforts to prevent diabetes and promote weight loss in a&#xD;
      high-risk population and generate a reproducible, scalable, and sustainable model for use&#xD;
      with other insurer groups and clinical settings that work in immigrant populations with a&#xD;
      high burden of chronic disease.&#xD;

      The study &quot;Integrated Community-Clinical Linkage Model to Promote Weight Loss among South&#xD;
      Asians with Pre-Diabetes&quot; aims to test the effectiveness and assess the implementation&#xD;
      process of an integrated intervention to support weight loss for South Asian patients at-risk&#xD;
      for type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in primary care settings. The integrated intervention&#xD;
      involves:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An electronic health record (EHR) intervention for primary care providers (PCPs)&#xD;
           utilizing embedded alerts to increase screening and identification of South Asian&#xD;
           patients at-risk for T2DM with BMI &gt;23 kg/m2 and registries to track outcomes: and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Registry-driven community health worker (CHW)-led health coaching for patients. Using a&#xD;
           stepped-wedge design, we will implement the study in 25 New York City PCP sites&#xD;
           enrolling 2,840 South Asian patients at- risk for T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Provider Surveys (n=40) to capture data on satisfaction with workflow before and after&#xD;
           intervention, information sources for EHR-CHW initiatives before and after intervention,&#xD;
           acceptability of and satisfaction with the integrated EHR-CHW intervention, and barriers&#xD;
           and facilitators of point-of-care use of the tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Key Informant Interviews (n=35) with physician champions at each site and/or&#xD;
           administrator of each site, Health first representatives, and CHWs. At baseline, the&#xD;
           interviews will be incorporated into the workflow analysis to assess current&#xD;
           satisfaction and usage of EHR and health coaching. At follow-up, the interviews will&#xD;
           assess barriers and facilitators to the implementation and adoption process of the&#xD;
           integrated EHR-CHW intervention, fidelity to the interventions, and to solicit&#xD;
           recommendations for the replication and scalability of the intervention to other sites&#xD;
           and insurer organizations.&#xD;
