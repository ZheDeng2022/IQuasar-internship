    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multi-centre study evaluating the long term safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of PBI-4050 in subjects with Alström Syndrome who have completed the&#xD;
      end-of-treatment (EoT) visit in a preceding ProMetic-sponsored Alström Syndrome study with&#xD;
      PBI-4050. This study will also evaluate the efficacy and pharmacological effects of PBI 4050&#xD;
      in this multi faceted disorder. Approximately 20 to 30 subjects will be enrolled to receive&#xD;
      800 mg PBI-4050 once daily for 96 weeks or until product licensing or study termination by&#xD;
      the Sponsor, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject completed a preceding ProMetic-sponsored Alström syndrome study with PBI-4050.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a documented diagnosis of Alström syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject receiving antidiabetic medications is able and willing to self-monitor blood&#xD;
             glucose levels&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must be willing to forego other forms of experimental drug treatment during&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening and agree to use adequate birth control from screening throughout the study&#xD;
             and for 30 days after the last Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a male subject has not been vasectomized at least 6 months before screening and&#xD;
             partners with a woman of childbearing potential, he must be willing to use an&#xD;
             acceptable contraceptive method throughout the study and for 30 days after the last&#xD;
             IMP administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject discontinued PBI-4050 for safety reasons from any preceding ProMetic-sponsored&#xD;
             Alström syndrome study with PBI-4050&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has had a documented episode of severe hypoglycaemia within 12 months before&#xD;
             screening and investigator judges that the subject is unable to adequately monitor&#xD;
             their glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has uncontrolled hypertension with BP &gt; 170/100 mmHg as determined at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Woman who is pregnant, breast-feeding, or planning a pregnancy during the course of&#xD;
             the study as determined at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, is likely to interfere&#xD;
             with study conduct and compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history of an allergic reaction to PBI-4050 or any of its excipients.&#xD;
