    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory experiment, aims to explore the effective and safety of thalidomide in&#xD;
      the treatment of TI to improve the hemoglobin level, improve the quality of life, reduce&#xD;
      blood transfusion, so as to avoid the adverse reactions caused by transfusion,60~100 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The project is a single arm research of thalidomide in TI,patients volunteered to participate&#xD;
      in this trial and met the following inclusion criteria will be enrolled: age from 18~65,&#xD;
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 2 or less. Subjects&#xD;
      should take thalidomide 50mg per day. During this time, hepatic and renal function,&#xD;
      hematologic function, electrocardiogram and the adverse reactions were closely observed.&#xD;
      According to the protocol, the blood routine, peripheral blood reticulocyte count, nucleated&#xD;
      red blood cell count, hemoglobin electrophoresis and other indicators were evaluated in&#xD;
      screening-period visit,1-month visit, 3-months visit , 6-months visit ,9-months visit,&#xD;
      12-months visit and 15-months visit.&#xD;
