      Study Design: Part A Randomized, open-label study in treatment naïve cirrhotic adults with&#xD;
      chronic genotype 4 HCV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment-naïve is defined as having never received treatment for HCV with any interferon&#xD;
      (IFN), Ribavirin, or other approved or experimental HCV specific direct acting antivirals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned that 28 subjects will be enrolled in the study such that an approximate even&#xD;
      number of treatment naïve subjects will be enrolled across the 2 treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 Single daily dose (2 Tablets) of Dactavira Plus each tablet contains (EPGCG 200 mg ,&#xD;
      Sofosbuvir 200mg, Daclatasvir 30 mg, Ribavirin 400 mg) for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 Daily dose including Sofosbuvir 400 mg , Daclatasvir 60 mg &amp; Ribavirin 800 mg for 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment assignments will be stratified according to the presence or absence of cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria: HCV RNA &gt; 104 IU/mL or HCV RNA &gt; LLOQ and did not&#xD;
      achieve SVR 12 after completing prior treatment in this study with chronic genotype 4 HCV&#xD;
      infection. Treatment-naïve adults, male and non pregnant/non-lactating female subjects, ages&#xD;
      18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures/&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency: Study visits for all subjects will occur at screening, Baseline/Day 1.&#xD;
      On-treatment visits will occur as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A, Arm 1 and 2 - at the end of Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects will complete a 4-Week Post-treatment visit regardless of treatment&#xD;
           duration. Subjects with HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ will continue to 12 Week Post treatment visits&#xD;
           unless confirmed viral relapse occurs at which time subjects will be early terminated&#xD;
           from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening assessments include safety laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, coagulation,&#xD;
      and urinalysis), 12 lead ECG, HCV RNA, hemoglobin A1c, urine drug screen, liver imaging,&#xD;
      serum B-hCG (for all female subjects of child-bearing potential), physical examination (with&#xD;
      height and bodyweight), vital signs, medical history, concomitant medications, and adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On-treatment assessments include safety laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, and&#xD;
      coagulation), HCV RNA, urine pregnancy tests (for all female subjects of child-bearing&#xD;
      potential), physical examination, vital signs, concomitant medications, and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment assessments include HCV RNA, urine pregnancy tests (for all female subjects of&#xD;
      child-bearing potential), vital signs, concomitant medications, and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Adverse events will be collected from baseline through the 4 Week Post-Treatment&#xD;
      Visit and AEs related to study procedures, will be collected from when subjects sign the&#xD;
      consent form. Clinical laboratory tests will be performed during treatment through the 12&#xD;
      Week Post-Treatment Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy: Efficacy will be evaluated using scheduled assessments of HCV RNA performed using&#xD;
      Gene Xpert HCV Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods: The primary efficacy endpoint is SVR12 (ie, HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ 12 weeks&#xD;
      post-treatment) in all subjects who are randomized and treated. No statistical hypothesis&#xD;
      testing will be performed. For each of the two treatment groups, a 2-sided 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval using the exact binomial distribution will be constructed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All continuous endpoints will be summarized using an 8 number summary (n, mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, median, Q1, Q3, minimum, maximum) by treatment duration. All categorical endpoints&#xD;
      will be summarized by number and percentage of subjects who meet the endpoint definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints will be analyzed by the number and percent of subjects with events or&#xD;
      abnormalities for categorical values or using an 8 number summary (n, mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, median, Q1, Q3, minimum, maximum) for continuous data by treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines of Good Clinical Practices&#xD;
      (GCPs) including archiving of essential documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Part B&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, open-label study in treatment naïve not cirrhotic adults with chronic genotype 4&#xD;
      HCV infection.&#xD;

      (IFN), Ribavirin, or other approved or experimental HCV specific direct acting antivirals.&#xD;
