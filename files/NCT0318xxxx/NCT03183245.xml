  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the Human Acellular Vessel (HAV) with&#xD;
      arteriovenous fistula (AVF) when used for hemodialysis access&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized, two-arm, comparative&#xD;
      study. Subjects who sign informed consent will undergo study-specific screening assessments&#xD;
      within 45 days from the day of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible study subjects will be randomized to receive either an HAV or AVF. The randomization&#xD;
      will be stratified by upper arm or forearm placement based on the investigator's&#xD;
      determination of where the study access (SA) should be located. Subjects will be followed to&#xD;
      24 months post SA creation at routine study visits regardless of patency status. After 24&#xD;
      months, AVF subjects with a patent SA will be followed (while the SA remains patent) for up&#xD;
      to 5 years (60 months) post SA creation at routine study visits. After 24 months, HAV&#xD;
      subjects will be followed (regardless of SA patency) for 5 years (60 months) post SA creation&#xD;
      at routine study visits.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months post SA creation</time_frame>
    <description>Co-primary endpoint #1: Proportion of subjects with functional patency at 6 months post study access (SA) creation&#xD;
The definition of &quot;functional patency&quot; is: Dialysis with &quot;2 needles for ≥75% of dialysis sessions over a continuous 4-week period and either: (1) 4 consecutive sessions during the 4-week period in which 2 needles are used and the mean dialysis machine blood pump speed is ≥300 mL/min, or (2) a measured spKt/Vurea is ≥ 1.4 or urea reduction ratio &gt;70% during any session in which 2 needles are used within the 4-week period. SpKt/Vurea is calculated from pre and post-treatment serum urea nitrogen concentrations, body weight, and dialysis session duration.&quot;&#xD;
The functional patency ascertainment period will take place between the 1st day of Week 21 (Day 140) and the last day of Week 26 (Day 181) after AVF creation or HAV placement. The endpoint is met when the functional patency criteria are satisfied within any consecutive 4 week period within this ascertainment period.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of subjects with secondary patency of SA at 12 months post SA creation.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post SA creation</time_frame>
    <description>Co-primary endpoint #2: Proportion of subjects with secondary patency of SA at 12 months post SA creation.&#xD;
The SA maintains secondary patency until it is abandoned, irrespective of interventions to maintain or restore patency.&#xD;
Abandonment is defined as AVF or HAV that can no longer be used for 2-needle, prescribed dialysis as it may be unable to provide adequate flows and/or is deemed unsafe for the subject, and the associated problem cannot be corrected by any intervention, including medical, surgical, or radiological interventions or rest.</description>
