  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced Parkinson's Disease is a debilitating, costly, and understudied condition. Improving&#xD;
      access to comprehensive, specialized, in-home patient care and caregiver support offers the&#xD;
      potential to minimize the downward spiral of morbidity and preventable healthcare&#xD;
      utilization. The aim of this study is to test whether and to what degree an interdisciplinary&#xD;
      home visit program, with and without peer mentoring for caregivers, will improve patient- and&#xD;
      caregiver-reported outcomes and reduce healthcare costs when compared with usual care in&#xD;
      advanced Parkinson's Disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This interdisciplinary home visit program consists of 4 visits to patients' homes over the&#xD;
      course of one year from a team of a movement disorders doctor, a nurse, a research&#xD;
      coordinator, and a social worker. The team will come to a patient's home and assess the needs&#xD;
      of both the patient and caregiver, and connect the patient with any needed services. These&#xD;
      visits can replace or be in addition to seeing another movement disorders doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this study, not only would the patient receive home visits, but his/her caregiver&#xD;
      would be paired with another caregiver from the community with lots of experience caring for&#xD;
      someone with PD whose loved one may have passed away, but who volunteers to serve as a&#xD;
      mentor. Current caregivers who enroll in the study will be asked to speak to their mentor&#xD;
      once a week over a course of 4 months. These meetings can take place in person, by phone, or&#xD;
      through video chat on an iPad that will be provided by our study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information collected from the study participants will be compared to data available in&#xD;
      the National Parkinson's Foundation's Parkinson's Outcome Project. The data will be matched&#xD;
      according to age, gender, and disease severity.&#xD;

    <description>Caregivers enrolling in the study will be asked to participate in the four home visits, which will involve in-home clinical assessments and completion of some questionnaires. After the first home visit, caregivers will be matched with a peer mentor, an individual who was a prior caregiver to someone with PD who is interested in sharing their knowledge, experience, and time to help improve the lives of current caregivers. Once a week, for a period of 4 months between home visits 2 and 3, caregivers will be asked to meet with their peer mentor, who will be trained to serve as a resource and listening ear, in addition to the medical team.&#xD;

Peer mentors will be asked to speak with their mentee once a week for 16 weeks. After a 16 week break, peer mentors will be paired with a second mentee and will repeat the process for another 16-week-long mentoring session.&#xD;

             race, and any ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (inclusive of&#xD;
             Parkinson's Disease Dementia) by a neurologist.&#xD;

             movement disorders clinic at Rush University Medical Center&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be rated as HY stage 3-5 at the time of screening via chart review of&#xD;
             the most recent clinical visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must reside within a 60-minute public transit or driving distance of Rush&#xD;
             University.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must live at home (as defined by an independent dwelling such as an&#xD;
             apartment, condominium, or house owned or rented by, or provided to/shared with the&#xD;
             subject).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be home-bound according to the Medicare definition: &quot;Leaving your home&#xD;
             isn't recommended because of your condition; your condition keeps you from leaving&#xD;
             home without help (such as using a wheelchair or walker, needing special&#xD;
             transportation, or getting help from another person); leaving home takes a&#xD;
             considerable and taxing effort.&quot; (http://www.medicare.gov/pubs/pdf/10969.pdf)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects have one or more of the following criteria, as determined by the referring&#xD;
             neurologist: motor or cognitive fluctuations, multi-morbidity, medication&#xD;
             mismanagement, cognitive impairment, symptoms of depression and/or anxiety, high risk&#xD;
             for hospitalization or hospital readmission, high risk for nursing facility admission,&#xD;
             suspected elder abuse, recent history of increased falls in home, caregiver burnout&#xD;

             in the preceding 12 months&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must either: 1) demonstrate capacity to consent, or 2) pending caregiver&#xD;
             capacity assessment and caregiver consent, give assent or not dissent. Excluding&#xD;
             individuals with cognitive impairment, dementia, depression, or psychosis would limit&#xD;
             the generalizability of this study given the prevalence of each in advanced PD.&#xD;
