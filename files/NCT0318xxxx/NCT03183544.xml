  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. Early detection of primary diseases and&#xD;
      recurrence is crucial for patient counseling and management. Conventional imaging modalities&#xD;
      (CT-MRI) are limited to detect recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choline-based PET/CT is currently widely used as primary staging tool in prostate cancer and&#xD;
      in patients with suspicious recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to choline-based tracers, 68Ga-PSMA ligands have been shown to have a higher&#xD;
      diagnostic efficacy and to increase the detection of metastases even at low PSA levels. The&#xD;
      most widely used prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligand is PSMA-11. A supplier,&#xD;
      ANMI, has developed a kit formulation of PSMA-11 which will be test in this clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer represents the most common cancer in men and accounts for the third most&#xD;
      common cancer death in men. Up to 50% of all patients undergoing radical prostatectomy or&#xD;
      radiotherapy for primary treatment of prostate cancer develop biochemical recurrence. Early&#xD;
      detection of primary diseases and recurrence is crucial for patient counseling and&#xD;
      management. Conventional imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) are limited because they focus on morphologic information such as&#xD;
      lymph node size and tissue structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is a hybrid imaging technique&#xD;
      combining functional and morphological information. Choline-based PET/CT is currently widely&#xD;
      used as primary staging tool in prostate cancer and in patients with suspicious recurrent&#xD;
      disease. Compared to choline-based tracers, 68Ga-PSMA ligands have been shown to have a&#xD;
      higher diagnostic efficacy and to increase the detection of metastases even at low PSA&#xD;
      levels. The most widely used prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligand is PSMA-11. A&#xD;
      supplier, ANMI, has developed a kit formulation of PSMA-11 which can be labeled at room&#xD;
      temperature by direct incubation of the kit with the gallium-68 eluted from a 68Ge/68Ga&#xD;
      generator.&#xD;
