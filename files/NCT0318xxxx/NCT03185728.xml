  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This five-year study aims to improve childcare provider (CCP) reporting of suspected child&#xD;
      abuse by means of an online learning module, iLook Out for Child Abuse. Using an interactive,&#xD;
      video-based story-line (along with follow-up activities), iLookOut engages CCPs emotionally&#xD;
      and intellectually to take the first step in addressing the epidemic of child abuse -which in&#xD;
      the U.S. claims &gt;680,000 confirmed victims annually. The consequences of child abuse can be&#xD;
      devastating and long-lasting. The purpose of this study is to establish an evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention that can help those who care for young children recognize and report suspected&#xD;
      child abuse before irreparable harm occurs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This 5-year study will evaluate the efficacy of an innovative educational intervention, iLook&#xD;
      Out for Child Abuse (iLookOut) for increasing rates of accurate child abuse reporting.&#xD;
      Grounded in an Experiential Learning conceptual model, iLookOut is a multi-media, online&#xD;
      intervention that engages learners emotionally and intellectually through an interactive,&#xD;
      video-based story-line that provides education, challenges learners with decision-points, and&#xD;
      gives critical feedback. iLookOut uses &quot;gamification&quot; strategies to promote experiential&#xD;
      learning through simulation, problem-solving, and practice opportunities to apply new&#xD;
      information and understanding. It also will include follow-up activities that promote&#xD;
      retention and integration of new knowledge, as well as help CCPs to remain aware and engaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies have demonstrated that iLookOut significantly improves CCP knowledge and&#xD;
      attitudes about reporting suspected child abuse, and is very well received by CCPs. To&#xD;
      evaluate its impact on actual reporting behavior, the proposed research will randomize CCP&#xD;
      sites in southern Maine (total = ~1,300) to receive iLookOut, Standard training, or Control&#xD;
      (no intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal is to increase the number of CCP reports for which either child abuse is&#xD;
      confirmed or social services (e.g., therapeutic services, nutritional assistance) are&#xD;
      recommended -as these are the kinds of reports that are likely to actually benefit a child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary goal is to decrease the proportion of reports that don't offer such benefit,&#xD;
      and in particular to decrease costs to the state associated with intake and investigation of&#xD;
      non-beneficial reports.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Childcare sites will be randomized to one of 3 study arms, and we will use a stepped wedge design to recruit patients to complete one of two interventions. During the first year of implementation, 1/3 of participants will not be contacted (Control arm). In the other 2 arms, participants will be recruited to complete either the iLookOut intervention or the Standard online mandated reporter training. The next year, participants in the Standard arm will then be asked to complete the iLookOut intervention, and participants in the Control arm will, again, not be incentivized to complete any training. In the final year, participants in the Control arm will be recruited to complete the iLookOut intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Percentage of childcare provider reports (of suspected abuse) to the state of Maine that result in either i) child abuse being confirmed, or ii) social services being recommended for the child/family who was reported.&#xD;
We will use Maine's Office of Child and Family Services' criteria for determining what counts as &quot;confirmed child abuse&quot; as well as what counts as a &quot;recommended social service.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Percentage of reports of suspected child abuse submitted to the State of Maine by childcare providers that are &quot;Low Quality&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>48 months</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Low Quality&quot; reports of suspected abuse are reports to the state of Maine that do not result in either findings of child abuse or recommended social services.&#xD;
We will use Maine's Office of Child and Family Services' criteria for determining what counts as &quot;confirmed child abuse&quot; as well as what counts as a &quot;recommended social service.&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>48 months</time_frame>
    <description>Financial costs (in U.S. dollars) expended by the State of Maine on &quot;Low Quality&quot; reports (submitted by childcare providers during the study period) will be calculated by summing the following:&#xD;
i) The average cost to the State of Maine associated with an &quot;Intake call,&quot; multiplied by the number of reports of suspected abuse submitted by childcare providers that are screened out (i.e., determined by Intake workers to NOT warrant investigation); and&#xD;
ii) The average cost to the State of Maine associated with investigating a report of suspected abuse, multiplied by the number of reports of suspected abuse submitted by childcare providers that are investigated, but NO abuse was confirmed AND no social services were recommended to the child/family that had been reported</description>
