      BACKGROUND: To diagnose caries in clinical practice today, a combination of clinical&#xD;
      examination with mirror and probe, and in sometimes x-ray images are used. For surfaces in&#xD;
      contact with other teeth X-rays (preferably bitewing) are often required. Even though the&#xD;
      radiation doses in bitewings are small, it is important to weigh risks against the benefit to&#xD;
      avoid unnecessary radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are other methods for diagnosing caries based on different forms of laser light. One&#xD;
      such technique is based on the translucency of the teeth. The light is within the near&#xD;
      infrared light (NIR) area. A product named DAIGNOcam (diagnostic camera) is using this&#xD;
      technology. The light is led in a hand piece held against the tooth. The tooth is illuminated&#xD;
      and the caries lesions can be seen like dark spots on a computer monitor screen. The&#xD;
      technique is mainly used in adult patients and permanent teeth. However, there is no complete&#xD;
      evaluation of how well the technology diagnoses caries in milk teeth. From a radiation&#xD;
      hygiene point of view, it is particularly important to reduce the amount of X-rays to young&#xD;
      individuals. X-rays are often experienced as difficult by younger children, which leads to&#xD;
      poorer diagnostics. It is important to identify early caries in milk teeth as these teeth&#xD;
      have thinner enamel and a more &quot;porous&quot; dentin. This may lead to that caries progress much&#xD;
      faster thus more difficult to fix. This in turn leads to a risk of toothache and that the&#xD;
      damage becomes so extensive that the tooth must be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To investigate diagnostic accuracy / precision in caries diagnosis between teeth&#xD;
      using DIAGNOcam in milk teeth comparable to caries diagnostics using bitewing x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is DIAGNOcam a reliable diagnostic method for diagnosing caries in between teeth&#xD;
           (approximal caries) in milk teeth?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How does child experience caries diagnosing performed with DIAGNOcam compared to X-rays?&#xD;
           INVESTIGATION VARIABLES: Caries data are recorded according to the accepted diagnostic&#xD;
           method at the surface level. Each examined tooth surface is assessed as either 1)&#xD;
           intact; 2) caries only in enamel; 3) caries i dentin; or 4) the surface can not be&#xD;
           judged. The same classification is used for X-rays and DIAGNOcam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children will also be able to rate their experience of the X-ray examination and the&#xD;
      DIAGNOcam survey using a Faces pain scale to see if there is any difference in experience&#xD;
      between the different methods of investigation.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Caries is a multifactorial and infectious disease. To diagnose caries in clinical&#xD;
      practice, a combination of clinical examination with mirror and probe (visual-tactile&#xD;
      examination) is used today, as well as in some cases standardized x-rays called bitewing&#xD;
      x-ray (bw). Visual-tactile examination is enough to diagnose caries on buccal and&#xD;
      lingual/palate surfaces. However, for approximal surfaces, X-rays are often required to&#xD;
      ensure diagnosis and to assess the spread of a caries lesion in the tooth. Bitewing X-rays&#xD;
      are the single best diagnostic tools for diagnosing caries in approximal surfaces. An X-ray&#xD;
      examination should always be performed on individual indications. At bw the radiation doses&#xD;
      are small. Nevertheless, it is important to weigh risks against the benefit to avoid&#xD;
      unnecessary radiation. Reducing the number of dental radiographs is also important from the&#xD;
      perspective of safe dental care where one strives to make use of and not harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are other methods for diagnosing caries based on different forms of laser light that&#xD;
      can detect caries. Previously, these techniques have only been used for occlusal surfaces and&#xD;
      buccal/lingual/palate tooth surfaces, not for diagnostics between teeth. For some time now,&#xD;
      the translucency of the teeth is used in a technique. The light is within the so-called NIR&#xD;
      area - near infrared light (non-wavelength wavelength). On the market, a product (DAIGNOcam)&#xD;
      uses this technology. The light is led in a hand piece (like a little bigger pen) held&#xD;
      against the tooth, one tooth at a time. The tooth is illuminated and a digital video camera&#xD;
      on the hand piece projects a computer monitor image. In the picture, the caries lesions are&#xD;
      seen like dark spots. These correspond to a qualitative defect in the enamel or dentin, i.e.&#xD;
      an area where various minerals were lost / dissolved due to caries (demineralized area). The&#xD;
      image can be saved in the patient's dental record in the same way as regular photos or&#xD;
      X-rays. DIAGNOcam provides a qualitative response - one looks primarily if it is caries or&#xD;
      not. It will then be a supplement to the usual survey with mirror and probe. The technique is&#xD;
      mainly used in adult patients and permanent teeth. DIAGNOcam is currently available in&#xD;
      clinical practice since a number of years. However, there is no complete evaluation of how&#xD;
      well the technology diagnoses caries in primary teeth. This is unfortunate for mainly two&#xD;
      reasons: from a radiation hygiene point of view, it is especially important to reduce the&#xD;
      amount of X-rays to young individuals; Intra-oral X-rays are often experienced as difficult&#xD;
      to manage by younger children, which leads to poorer diagnostics. It is important to identify&#xD;
      early caries lesions in primary teeth as these teeth have a thinner enamel and a less&#xD;
      mineralized dentin, which causes a caries lesion to progress much faster. This may lead to&#xD;
      difficulties in restoring the teeth as well as pain from pulpal involvement. If the carious&#xD;
      lesion is extensive, this may lead to tooth extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To investigate diagnostic accuracy / precision in caries diagnostics using&#xD;
      DIAGNOcam in primary teeth comparable to caries diagnostics using bitewing x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Is DIAGNOcam a reliable diagnostic method for diagnosing approximal caries in primary&#xD;
      teeth?&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY RESEARCH QUESTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • How does children experience caries diagnosing performed with DIAGNOcam compared to X-rays?&#xD;
      INVESTIGATION VARIABLES: Caries data are recorded according to the standardized diagnostic&#xD;
      method at surface level (dental sites with approximal contacts). Each examined tooth surface&#xD;
      is assessed as either 1) intact; 2) caries only in enamel; 3) caries i dentin; or 4) the&#xD;
      surface cannot be judged. The same classification is used for X-rays and DIAGNOcam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children will also be able to rate their experience of the X-ray examination and the&#xD;
      DIAGNOcam survey using a Faces pain scale to see if there is any difference in experience&#xD;
      between the different methods of investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KNOWLEDGE GAINS: New methods should always be evaluated before implementation to ensure good&#xD;
      care. There are no evaluated diagnostic methods that do not use ionised radiation (X-ray) for&#xD;
      caries diagnosing of approximal surfaces in contact with another tooth. If DIAGNOcam in&#xD;
      evaluation shows the same diagnostic accuracy as X-ray, this may reduce the use of dental&#xD;
      x-ray for children. If DIAGNOcam is found to have poorer diagnostic accuracy, the method&#xD;
      should be avoided as a caries diagnostic method in primary teeth. The latter is based on the&#xD;
      fact that children should not be exposed to unnecessary examinations or interventions that do&#xD;
      not result in health benefits.&#xD;

        50 patients who meet the inclusion criteria are recruited consecutively at the dep of&#xD;
        pediatric dentistry, Faculty of Odontology in Malmö. In order to obtain a spread in caries,&#xD;
        there are no restraints regarding dental health in the children. It is important to include&#xD;
        both children with a lot of caries and children with little or even no caries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No power calculation can be performed as there is no basis for obtaining the size of the&#xD;
        study population. However, there are similar studies on other diagnostic methods in which&#xD;
        diagnostic reliability was investigated with a study material of 50 patients. Therefore,&#xD;
        the study intends to include 50 patients resulting in at least 400 surfaces.&#xD;
