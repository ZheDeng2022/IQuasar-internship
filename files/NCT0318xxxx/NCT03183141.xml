    <textblock>
      Cohort 1: Subjects who had a Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) recurrence in study&#xD;
      SERES-012 within 8 weeks of receipt of study drug will be eligible. The purpose of this&#xD;
      cohort is to assess safety and efficacy of SER-109 in reducing recurrence of CDI in adults&#xD;
      who had a CDI recurrence within 8 weeks after receipt of SER-109 or Placebo in study&#xD;
      SERES-012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: Cohort 2 is an open-label program for subjects who were not part of SERES-012. The&#xD;
      purpose of this cohort is to describe safety and tolerability of SER-109 in subjects 18 years&#xD;
      of age or older with at least a first recurrence of CDI.&#xD;

      Cohort 1 is an open-label extension of study SERES-012. Subjects who had a CDI recurrence in&#xD;
      study SERES-012 within 8 weeks of receipt of study drug, have responded to a course of&#xD;
      standard of care (SOC) antibiotic treatment, will receive an oral dose of SER-109. A&#xD;
      treatment regimen of SER-109 is defined as an oral dose of SER-109 (4 capsules once daily)&#xD;
      for 3 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 30 eligible subjects with recurrent CDI disease from study SERES-012 are&#xD;
      expected to enroll. Screening for this study will begin at the Recurrence Visit of Study&#xD;
      SERES-012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 is an open-label program for subjects who were not part of SERES-012. Subjects 18&#xD;
      years of age or older who had one or more CDI recurrence and have responded to a course of&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment will receive an oral dose of SER-109. The CDI recurrence must be&#xD;
      confirmed by a positive C. difficile stool toxin or PCR assay to confirm eligibility. A&#xD;
      treatment regimen of SER-109 is defined as an oral dose of SER-109 (4 capsules once daily)&#xD;
      for 3 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 200 eligible subjects with recurrent CDI disease are expected to enroll.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Previously enrolled in Study SERES-012, had CDI recurrence within 8 weeks after&#xD;
             receipt of a treatment regimen of SER-109 or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Signed informed consent prior to initiation of any study-specific procedure or&#xD;
