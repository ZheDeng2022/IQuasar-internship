    <textblock>
      This wellness initiative is aimed to assess the activity level, sleep habits and nutrition&#xD;
      status of resident physicians. The investigators will monitor for improvement in these areas&#xD;
      with initiation of an exercise program suited to the lifestyle needs of resident physicians.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The health and mental health benefits of physical activity, quality sleep and optimal&#xD;
      nutritional habits are innumerable and widely reported. Unfortunately, resident physicians&#xD;
      report participation in physical activity at reduced rates compared with the general&#xD;
      population. Reasons for limited physical activity include fatigue and lack of free time to&#xD;
      dedicate to exercise. The lack of exercise is combined with variable sleep patterns due to&#xD;
      call schedules, as well as deterioration of nutritional habits, leads to weight gain and&#xD;
      overall decline in the health of the resident physician population. Another neurosurgery&#xD;
      department has implemented a similar program for their resident physicians and found&#xD;
      improvements in weight, biometric markers and increased cardiovascular tolerance of physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The activity goals are derived from the 2013 the American Heart Association/American College&#xD;
      of Cardiology Guidelines on lifestyle management to reduce cardiovascular risk, with&#xD;
      considerations made for different levels of ability among the participants, as well as&#xD;
      limitations time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fitness Protocol: The investigators will view any activity as better than no activity. The&#xD;
      program will begin with activities geared toward the least fit/active resident to encourage&#xD;
      participation from all levels of ability. The investigators will need options to increase&#xD;
      intensity or difficulty for more advanced participants. Prior to introduction of the fitness&#xD;
      regimen, the investigators would discuss appropriate progression of activity with a fitness&#xD;
      expert. The proposed progression through various fitness goals is noted by type and timeline&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step Goal: Each participant will be asked to wear a fitness tracker to quantify steps walked&#xD;
      per day, among other health parameters. Goals will be set for number of steps per day and per&#xD;
      week, with incremental increase through the course of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac Activity: Goals will be suggested for participants to complete cardiac activity&#xD;
      through the course of their week. This may be running, which would overlap with the step&#xD;
      goals, biking, or another cardiac exercise of the participants' preference. The goal will&#xD;
      increase gradually over the course of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily Challenge: A physical challenge will be extended to each participant to be completed&#xD;
      every day, increasing in difficulty or repetitions through the month. This will be a simple&#xD;
      task that could be performed without any equipment, such as (but not limited to) a plank&#xD;
      hold, pushups or jumping jacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly Workout: Workouts will be created by colleagues from appropriate departments&#xD;
      (Kinesiology, Sports Performance) to be completed in a single ~30 minute setting or small&#xD;
      5-10 minute increments in order to be integrated into the physician lifestyle. These workouts&#xD;
      will be completed on an individual basis and will be simple enough for completion in a small&#xD;
      space, such as the call rooms, with access to hand weights, resistance bands and the&#xD;
      stairwell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Activities: Group activities will be planned once per month, with a focus on team&#xD;
      building and physical activity. These group activities will be made available to non-study&#xD;
      participants to encourage family attendance and participation in physical fitness. Some&#xD;
      examples of proposed activities include soccer, sand volleyball, basketball.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Education: Colleagues from nutrition, neuropsychology and kinesiology will be invited for&#xD;
      guest lectures on a monthly basis to improve resident education on topics such as making&#xD;
      nutritionally smart choices and appropriate meal preparation, improving sleep hygiene, and&#xD;
      how to incorporate activity into our currently lifestyles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Timeline Pre-Program - distribution of surveys; biometric data obtained Month 1 - goal&#xD;
      for steps. Group activity: movement safety. Month 2 - goal for steps + cardiac activity.&#xD;
      Group activity. Month 3 - goal for steps + cardiac activity + daily challenge + improve sleep&#xD;
      hygiene. Group activity. Repeat health surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 4 - increase goal for steps + cardiac activity + daily challenge + weekly workout.&#xD;
      Group activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 5 - goal for steps + cardiac activity + daily challenge + weekly workout + improve&#xD;
      sleep habits. Group activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 6 - continuation of above goals + setting individual goals. Group activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Program - distribution of surveys; biometric follow up data obtained.&#xD;
