  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since august 2016, the researchers at a highly specialized neurorehabilitation hospital in a&#xD;
      Danish region with 1.2 inhabitants have in cooperation with health professionals from a&#xD;
      specialized neurorehabilitation in a Danish municipality with 336,000 inhabitants, worked&#xD;
      through and is still working with an iterative process in the development of a novel&#xD;
      self-management support intervention for elderly stroke individuals.The intervention is going&#xD;
      to be implemented into the second phase- a randomized clinical controlled trial (RCT) in the&#xD;
      project named 'Stroke - 65 plus. Continued active life'.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Elderly adults represent the majority of stroke cases worldwide. Sequelae after a&#xD;
      stroke causes the stroke individuals to live a more isolated life 5 years after the stroke.&#xD;
      This makes the stroke individuals an especially vulnerable group of elderly people regarding&#xD;
      social reintegration. Reintegration into the community post-stroke depends highly on support&#xD;
      from the family. However, the stroke individual's closest relatives are at risk of developing&#xD;
      anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a novel self-management intervention&#xD;
      supporting older adults after stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design: Randomized controlled observer-blind trial. More than sixty stroke survivors&#xD;
      over 65 years will two weeks before leaving a rehabilitation hospital be randomized to either&#xD;
      a group receiving conventional rehabilitation (control) or a novel self-management&#xD;
      intervention addition to standard rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a period of 6 months the patients will be offered additional 6-8 sessions of&#xD;
      self-management intervention of 45-60 minutes duration by a physiotherapist or an&#xD;
      occupational therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcome measurements: Stroke Self-efficacy questionnaire, Stroke Specific Quality of&#xD;
      Life Scale and Impact on participation and Autonomy and activity by accelerometers will be&#xD;
      evaluated at baseline, three and nine months post hospital treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient, informal caregiver and therapist satisfaction will be with examined with&#xD;
      questionnaires and interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Self-management interventions are promising tools for rehabilitation of&#xD;
      self-efficacy, quality of life as well as participation and autonomy. The introduction of&#xD;
      novel self management intervention in combination with traditional physical and occupational&#xD;
      therapy may enhance recovery after stroke, quality of life and burden on relatives. Stroke&#xD;
      65+ trial will provide further evidence of self management strategies to clinicians, patients&#xD;
      and health economists.&#xD;
