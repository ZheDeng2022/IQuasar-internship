      Trial Design This is an open label, single-arm, phase IB/II trial to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and anti-tumor efficacy of epacadostat (INCB024360) in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475) plus azacitidine in patients with chemo-refractory MSS mCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 1B portion of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and RP2D of&#xD;
      epacadostat (INCB024360) in combination with pembrolizumab plus azacitidine in subjects with&#xD;
      chemo-refractory MSS mCRC without any further standard treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 2 portion of the study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of epacadostat&#xD;
      (INCB024360) in combination with pembrolizumab plus azacitidine in subjects with&#xD;
      chemo-refractory MSS mCRC without any further standard treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both phase IB and phase 2 portions, patients will receive the combination of azacitidine,&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and epacadostat (INCB024360) for the first 18 cycles (Cycles 1-18). Beginning&#xD;
      with Cycle 19 through Cycle 35, patients will receive the combination of pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      epacadostat (INCB024360).&#xD;

      Phase lB Portion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The phase 1 portion of this study will be a standard &quot;3+3&quot; design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab will be administered at 200 mg intravenously (IV) on day 1 of each cycle,&#xD;
           every 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Azacitidine will be administered at 100 mg subcutaneous injection (SQ) daily on days 1-5&#xD;
           of each cycle, every 21 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three dose levels of epacadostat (INCB024360) will be explored: dose levels -1, 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The dose level 1 will be the starting dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the dose level 2 is tolerable without dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), the dose level&#xD;
           2 will be considered the RP2D, and the phase II part will be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DLT will be monitored during the first 21 days (cycles 1) and will be used for purposes&#xD;
           of dose escalation and determination of RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Definition of DLT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematologic Toxicities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia lasting &gt; 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with severe bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonhematologic Toxicities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      o Any Grade 4 toxicity EXCLUDING: Grade 4 abnormal laboratory values with a clear alternative&#xD;
      explanation or transient (≤ 72 hours), or without associated clinically significant signs or&#xD;
      symptoms based on investigator determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any Grade 3 or 4 AST, ALT, or total bilirubin elevation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other Grade 3 toxicity EXCLUDING:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nausea/vomiting controlled by medical intervention within 72 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 3 rash in the absence of desquamation, no mucosal involvement, does not&#xD;
                require systemic steroids, and resolves to Grade 1 within 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 3 abnormal laboratory values with a clear alternative explanation or&#xD;
                transient (≤ 72 hours), or without associated clinically significant signs or&#xD;
                symptoms based on investigator determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase ll portion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 2 portion of this study is a non-randomized, open-label, single-arm phase II study.&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate objective response rate (ORR) using&#xD;
      RECIST1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One cycle of therapy is defined as 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects may continue treatment up to 35 cycles of the study therapy (the combination of&#xD;
           azacitidine, pembrolizumab and epacadostat [INCB024360] for the first 18 cycles [Cycle 1&#xD;
           to Cycle 18], and the combination of pembrolizumab and epacadostat (INCB024360) for the&#xD;
           remaining 17 cycles [Cycle 19 to Cycle 35]) until evidence of progression of disease&#xD;
           (PD) or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be assessed during the first 21 days (cycle 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor response will be determined by radiologic measurements by CT and by using RECIST.&#xD;
           Assessment of tumor response will be performed every 3 cycles (approximately 9 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will be evaluated and graded for adverse events according to the NCI Common&#xD;
           Terminology for Adverse Events, version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered intravenously over 30 minutes on days 1 of&#xD;
           each cycle every 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Azacitidine 100 mg will be administered as subcutaneous injection on days 1-5 of each&#xD;
           cycle every 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epacadostat (INCB024360) will be administered orally twice a day continuously on days&#xD;
           1-21 of each cycle every 21 days. Two dose levels of epacadostat (INCB024360) will be&#xD;
           explored: 100 mg BID and 300 mg BID.&#xD;
