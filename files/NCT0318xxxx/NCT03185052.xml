  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past years, arterial closure systems have tended to replace manual compression to&#xD;
      ensure hemostasis at femoral artery puncture points. Arterial closure systems reduce&#xD;
      hemostasis and patient immobilization times, thus enabling early resumption of walking. These&#xD;
      devices have contributed extensively to the development of outpatient stays for cardiology,&#xD;
      vascular and neuro-radiology procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to certain studies however, it would appear that arterial closure devices do not&#xD;
      present any greater benefits than manual compression in terms of hemostasis and&#xD;
      complications. Moreover, the use of increasingly small diameter instruments would tend to&#xD;
      render manual compression sufficient. Finally, the use of these devices generates additional&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our prospective study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of same-day&#xD;
      discharge after manual compression in patients treated for peripheral artery disease by&#xD;
      endovascular technique with 5F sheath.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The reference management strategies for patients treated for peripheral arterial disease by&#xD;
      endovascular technique are conventional hospitalization with manual compression and discharge&#xD;
      after at least one over-night observation and outpatient hospitalization with the use of an&#xD;
      arterial closure device. There are currently no official guidelines for guiding the patient&#xD;
      towards one or other of these types of care. Indeed, outpatient management of artery disease&#xD;
      is implemented in only a few centers in France. Several studies have shown that outpatient&#xD;
      care is perfectly safe for patients. Our experiment at the Nantes University Hospital&#xD;
      demonstrates also the reliability and safety of this care through the use of closure systems&#xD;
      as shown by Albert. Now, it seems judicious to develop and improve this care since the use of&#xD;
      smaller diameter devices would tend to render manual compression sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method used is based on our previous protocols, routine practice and evaluation. First of&#xD;
      all, patients eligible for same-day discharge are first selected according to SFAR (Société&#xD;
      Française d'Anesthésie Réanimation - French Society for Anesthesia and Resuscitation)&#xD;
      criteria for outpatients. Patients failing to meet these criteria are directed towards&#xD;
      conventional hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For outpatients, the patients are hospitalized in a specific unit hosting outpatients of&#xD;
      different medico-surgical specialties. The paramedical team checks the prerequisites and the&#xD;
      preoperative assessment. The use of a common femoral approach with 5F sheath is required.&#xD;
      According to patients' needs, femoral anterograde or retrograde puncture are performed under&#xD;
      duplex scan guidance. Aortoiliac and infrainguinal occlusive lesions are indifferently&#xD;
      treated but the endovascular treatment must be compatible with the use of a stent or a drug&#xD;
      coating balloon 5F sheath and 0.035 compatible..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure should be finished 5h prior the outpatients unit closing to allow 5h follow-up.&#xD;
      The intervention proceeded after an intravenous bolus of heparin. Anesthesia, antiplatelet&#xD;
      regimen were let at the discretion of the interventionnalist. End-of-procedure hemostasis&#xD;
      shall be implemented by the operator by manual compression for at least 10 minutes,&#xD;
      potentially extended until complete hemostasis is achieved. A pressure pad shall be applied&#xD;
      just after the end of manual compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's general and local condition shall be monitored in the recovery room. If there&#xD;
      are no local or general complications, the patient shall return to the ambulatory unit. In&#xD;
      the unit, at H4, the compressive dressing is removed, patient is place in half-sitting&#xD;
      position and without any complications, the ability to be discharged will be evaluated. The&#xD;
      day after the operation, the patient is contacted by the ambulatory unit according with HAS&#xD;
      and SFAR recommandations for a medical checkpoint. All of this will be conducted under&#xD;
      medical and paramedical supervision. In the event of femoral puncture site active bleeding at&#xD;
      any stage during care, the patient's surgeon will be notified and an additional manual&#xD;
      compression will be applied if necessary. There are no specific guidelines concerning&#xD;
      treatment with platelet aggregation inhibitors, whose choice will be left to the operator's&#xD;
      discretion. In all cases, the treatments will be recorded.&#xD;
