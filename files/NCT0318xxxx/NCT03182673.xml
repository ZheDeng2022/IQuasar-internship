      The study consists of the two parts, the first one is SHR7390 combined with SHR-1210, the&#xD;
      second one is SHR7390 combined with SHR-1210 and SHR3162. Two parts of the study are&#xD;
      separately to assess the safety and tolerability, to define dose limiting toxicity（DLT) and&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD),to evaluate the pharmacokinetics ,to assess the antitumor&#xD;
      activity in patients with advanced solid tumors preliminarily and to recommend reasonable&#xD;
      dosage regimen of SHR7390 for the follow-up clinical trial.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label,two parts,dose escalation/expansion clinical study.The&#xD;
      safety,tolerance,PK and preliminary efficacy of two-drug combination and three-drug&#xD;
      combination were evaluated respectively in the patients with advanced solid tumors that have&#xD;
      no any targeted agents as the standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first study part, subjects receiving a single dose of SHR7390 (Run-in) are observed in&#xD;
      7-10 days, then accepted two drug combination therapy, SHR7390 is administered once daily&#xD;
      orally for 28 days for a treatment cycle. At the same time, SHR-1210 was given intravenously&#xD;
      per 2 weeks at the fixed dose of 200mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second study part, subjects accepted three drug combination therapy, SHR7390 is&#xD;
      administered orally for 21 days and discontinued for 7 days in a 28-day treatment&#xD;
      cycle,SHR3162 was administered orally twice a day for 28 days at a fixed dose of 100 mg. At&#xD;
      the same time, SHR-1210 was given intravenously per 2 weeks at the fixed dose of 200mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) in the first study part will be assessed during the Run-in and&#xD;
      first cycle of treatment. the dose escalation is designed by Accelerated Titration Designs&#xD;
      during initial accelerated phase. when the significant toxicity or DLT is observed in the&#xD;
      Run-in and first cycle of treatment,the accelerated titration trial terminates and subsequent&#xD;
      dose escalations are become a conventional design of 3+3 patients. If one adverse event （AE）&#xD;
      meets dose limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria at a given dose, 3 additional patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this dose cohort. If 2 DLTs are determined at a given dose level, the previous&#xD;
      dose will be designated as the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on preliminary determination of RP2D and sufficient safety data in the first part of&#xD;
      the study, the second part of three-drug combination will be carried out. the preset dose of&#xD;
      SHR7390 includes RP2D initially determined in the first part of the study and its previous&#xD;
      low dose level (for example, RP2D is 0.5 mg/d, while the former low dose is 0.25 mg/d). Dose&#xD;
      escalation is a conventional design of 3+3 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional patients will be enrolled for pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluations at different dose&#xD;
      levels based on preliminary safety and tolerability.Each dose level can expand at least 12&#xD;
      subjects , of which 9-12 subjects are PK subjects. Multiple blood samples at designated time&#xD;
      points will be collected for PK evaluations (more than 12 subjects are determined by SMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety, tolerability and AEs will be closely monitored throughout the study duration. The&#xD;
      preliminary effectiveness and clinical benefits of two-drug combination and three-drug&#xD;
      combination will be evaluated.&#xD;
