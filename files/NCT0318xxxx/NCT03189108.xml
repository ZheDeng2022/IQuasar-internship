      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers want to study fluids and blood of people with cancer. The fluids are from the&#xD;
      abdomen and around the lungs. Studying these might help researchers learn about the biology&#xD;
      of cancer. This may lead to better ways to treat cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the biology of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18 and older with malignant solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, blood tests, and confirmation of&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have samples taken at regularly scheduled procedures. Fluids from the&#xD;
      abdomen and/or lungs will be taken as part of the procedures. Blood will be taken separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked to give more samples at future procedures.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Malignant ascites or pleural effusions are often seen in patients with solid tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Malignant ascites is proinflammatory with many cytokines present and acts to promote&#xD;
&#xD;
      tumor cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The cellular composition of malignant ascites consists of lymphocytes, macrophages and&#xD;
&#xD;
      monocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Serum monocytes and lymphocytes play a role in the native host anti-tumor immune&#xD;
&#xD;
      mediated mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -A paracentesis or thoracentesis is often done for symptomatic relief from the malignant&#xD;
&#xD;
      fluid collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To obtain blood samples and ascites and pleural effusion samples from patients with solid&#xD;
&#xD;
      tumor malignancies, with the intent of performing translational studies related to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of malignant solid tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be able and willing to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -We will collect approximately 200cc-5L ascites from patients that are undergoing a&#xD;
&#xD;
      therapeutic paracentesis or thoracentesis. No thoracentesis or paracentesis will be&#xD;
&#xD;
      performed solely for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The fluid will be collected during the medical procedure and may be collected at more&#xD;
&#xD;
      than one time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -We will also collect 30ml of peripheral blood. This will be from patients who are being&#xD;
&#xD;
      seen in follow up, consultation, or presenting for enrollment on a clinical trial.&#xD;
