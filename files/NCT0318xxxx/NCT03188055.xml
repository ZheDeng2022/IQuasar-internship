  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effect of the &quot;Best Case/Worse Case&quot; (BC/WC)&#xD;
      communication tool on the quality of communication with older patients admitted to two trauma&#xD;
      units. The intervention was developed and tested with acute care surgical patients at the&#xD;
      University of Wisconsin (UW) and we are now testing whether the intervention will work in a&#xD;
      different setting. We will test the intervention with severely injured older adults at Oregon&#xD;
      Health Sciences University (OHSU) and Parkland Memorial Hospital (PMH) at the University of&#xD;
      Texas Southwestern (UTS). In the first year, UTS/PMH and OHSU will recruit and enroll 50&#xD;
      patients in the control arm (total, for both sites) and train trauma surgeons to use the best&#xD;
      case/worst case tool. In the second year, UTS/PMH and OHSU will recruit and enroll 50&#xD;
      patients in the intervention arm (total, for both sites). UW will compare survey-reported and&#xD;
      chart-derived measures before and after clinicians learn to use the best case/worst case&#xD;
      tool.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effect of the &quot;best case/worse case&quot; communication&#xD;
      tool on the quality of communication with older patients admitted to two trauma units and to&#xD;
      collect feedback on the tool to help adapt it to the trauma setting. The intervention was&#xD;
      developed and tested with acute care surgical patients at the University of Wisconsin (UW)&#xD;
      and the present study seeks to test whether the intervention will work in a different&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To adapt the tool to trauma settings, we will conduct focus groups at UW Health Oregon Health&#xD;
      Sciences University (OHSU) and Parkland Memorial Hospital (PMH) at the University of&#xD;
      Texas-Southwestern (UT-S). Because trauma care is delivered by a multidisciplinary team, we&#xD;
      will include attending trauma surgeons, surgical residents, ICU nurses, nurse practitioners,&#xD;
      consulting physicians (e.g. orthopedic surgeons) and others on the trauma care team. Up to 60&#xD;
      trauma car providers will participate in focus groups across the three sites. We will test&#xD;
      the intervention with severely injured older adults at OHSU and UT-S/PMH. In the first year,&#xD;
      UT-S/PMH and OHSU will recruit and enroll 50 patients total in the control arm and train&#xD;
      trauma surgeons to use the best case/worst case tool. In the second year, UT-S/PMH and OHSU&#xD;
      will recruit and enroll 50 patients total in the intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UT-S/PMH and OHSU research team members will survey family members of trauma patients to&#xD;
      compare the quality of communication for severely injured geriatric trauma patients cared for&#xD;
      by trauma teams. When possible, UT-S/PMH and OHSU will survey patients on their quality of&#xD;
      life. UT-S/PMH and OHSU will survey the patient's primary nurse on the quality of&#xD;
      communication patients and will survey patient's families about their thoughts on the quality&#xD;
      of communication as well. UT-S/PMH and OHSU will survey trauma unit staff before and after&#xD;
      clinicians learn to use the best case/worst case tool, to assess whether the communication&#xD;
      intervention improves feelings of moral distress. UT-S/PMH and OHSU will use chart review to&#xD;
      collect downstream clinical outcomes including intensity of treatment and receipt of&#xD;
      palliative care. UT-S/PMH and OHSU will archive de-identified graphic aids used by trauma&#xD;
      surgeons with intervention patients to explore how the intervention was enacted.&#xD;

    <measure>Family-reported Goal Concordant Care</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days after trauma unit admission</time_frame>
    <description>Family-reported goal concordant care will be assessed by 2 survey questions taken from the SUPPORT study (Question 1: If you had to make a choice at this time, would you prefer a course of treatment for your loved one that focuses on extending life as much as possible, even if it means having more pain and discomfort, or would you want a plan of care that focuses on relieving pain and discomfort as much as possible, even if that means not living as long? Question 2: Would you say that your loved one's current medical care is more focused on extending life as much as possible, even if it means having more pain and discomfort, or on relieving pain and discomfort as much as possible, even if that means not living as long? If participant gave the same answer to both questions, this was considered to be concordant. If the answers to the 2 questions were different, this was considered discordant</description>

          <title>Best Case/Worst Case Communication Tool</title>
          <description>The patient's enrolled surgeon completed training on the Best Case/Worst Case communication tool and was encouraged to use it with the patient.&#xD;
Best Case/Worst Case communication tool: The communication tool promotes dialogue and patient deliberation, and supports shared decision making in the context of life-limiting illness. Building on a conceptual model of shared decision-making proposed and the practice of scenario planning our intervention is designed to lead to a discussion of patient preferences and consideration of outcomes.&#xD;
The surgeon verbally describes the &quot;best case,&quot; &quot;worst case,&quot; and &quot;most likely&quot; outcomes for each treatment option-incorporating rich narrative from clinical experience and translation of probabilistic information-while drawing a diagram of those options. The surgeon also writes details about each option on the diagram. The narrative and graphic help family and patients formulate and express preferences.</description>

            <description>Usual care typically includes informed consent and a surgeon-directed deliberative phase in which surgeons present their own evaluation of the trade-offs and goals of the proposed intervention. Usual care also consists of daily updates with patient and family, describing each new problem as it arises and what will be done to treat it, regardless of how this fits into the patient's overall prognosis or health trajectory.</description>

          <title>Best Case/Worst Case Communication Tool</title>
          <description>The patient's enrolled surgeon completed training on the Best Case/Worst Case communication tool and was encouraged to use it with the patient.&#xD;
Best Case/Worst Case communication tool: The communication tool promotes dialogue and patient deliberation, and supports shared decision making in the context of life-limiting illness. Building on a conceptual model of shared decision-making proposed and the practice of scenario planning our intervention is designed to lead to a discussion of patient preferences and consideration of outcomes.&#xD;
The surgeon verbally describes the &quot;best case,&quot; &quot;worst case,&quot; and &quot;most likely&quot; outcomes for each treatment option-incorporating rich narrative from clinical experience and translation of probabilistic information-while drawing a diagram of those options. The surgeon also writes details about each option on the diagram. The narrative and graphic help family and patients formulate and express preferences.</description>

          <title>Usual Care</title>
          <description>Usual care typically includes informed consent and a surgeon-directed deliberative phase in which surgeons present their own evaluation of the trade-offs and goals of the proposed intervention. Usual care also consists of daily updates with patient and family, describing each new problem as it arises and what will be done to treat it, regardless of how this fits into the patient's overall prognosis or health trajectory.</description>
