    <textblock>
      Supraclavicular block of brachial plexus is a type of regional anesthesia sometimes employed&#xD;
      as an alternative to general anesthesia for surgery of the forearm. Many approaches have been&#xD;
      described for ultrasound-guided supraclavicular block of the brachial plexus , Double-&#xD;
      injection technique , single-injection and intra- cluster-injection technique. In intra-&#xD;
      cluster-injection technique.The comparison between the 3 techniques may allow detecting the&#xD;
      most beneficial one. the investigators hypothesized that intra-cluster-injection technique&#xD;
      will be associated with more rapid onset, longer duration and the least complications.&#xD;
      (because the trunks and divisions of the brachial plexus are relatively close as they travel&#xD;
      over the first rib, the onset and quality of anesthesia will be faster and complete) Methods&#xD;
      : This study will be conducted at kasr al ainy Hospital Cairo university After obtaining&#xD;
      ethics committee approval and written informed consent 36 patients (who will undergo surgery&#xD;
      for forearm)included in the study classified into three groups Gs single injection technique&#xD;
      ,Gic intra- cluster injection technique, Gd double injection technique After block will be&#xD;
      done, a second investigator will examine the patient for sensory and motor block (every 10&#xD;
      minutes for 30 minutes) and for occurrence of complications. The patient will be ready for&#xD;
      surgery when the score ≥14 point. At this point the onset will be determined and so the&#xD;
      patient can be transferred to the operating room .&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient experienced anxiety, propofol infusion (80-250 ug/kg/min) can be started. If&#xD;
      the patient experienced pain during surgery the block considered failed and induction of&#xD;
      general anesthesia should be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After end of the surgery the second investigator will continue to assess the patient for post&#xD;
      operative pain every one hour for 24 hours to determine duration of the block.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to compare between three techniques( single- injection,&#xD;
      intra-cluster -injection and double-injection) ultrasound-guided supraclavicular block of&#xD;
      brachial plexus for surgery of forearm regarding onset of the block , duration, time of&#xD;
      performance and possible complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population &amp; Sample size : 36 patients undergoing elective forearm surgeries in Kasr AL&#xD;
      Aini Hospital will be included in the study , patients will be allocated in three groups 12&#xD;
      patient each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design : randomized comparative study , randomization will be done through closed&#xD;
      opaque envelope&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods :This study will be conducted at kasr al ainy Hospital Cairo university After&#xD;
      obtaining ethics committee approval and written informed consent 36 patients (who will&#xD;
      undergo surgery for forearm)included in the study classified into three groups Gs single&#xD;
      injection technique ,Gic intra- cluster injection technique, Gd double injection technique&#xD;
      For the 3 techniques , the investigator will prepare 20 gauge 10cm block needle and portable&#xD;
      ultrasound machine (Siemens ACUSON X300 Ultrasound System with linear probe 8-14 MHZ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the preparation room, Standard monitors will be connected ,IV peripheral cannula will be&#xD;
      inserted in upper limb contra lateral to surgical site and sedative e.g. midazolam 0.02mg/kg&#xD;
      will be given. Patient will be positioned semi-sitting, the transducer is positioned in the&#xD;
      transverse plane immediately superior to the clavicle at approximately its midpoint. Using a&#xD;
      3-cm, 27-gauge needle, 2 mL of local anesthetic is injected into the skin 1 cm lateral. In&#xD;
      single-injection technique using in plane method and lateral to medial direction, local&#xD;
      anesthetic (30 ml bupivacaine) is injected at the point where the subclavian artery meets the&#xD;
      first rib. In intra- cluster-injection technique using in plane method and lateral to medial&#xD;
      direction , the local anesthetic(30 ml bupivacaine) is injected inside main and satellite&#xD;
      neural cluster.( Circumferential administration of local anesthetic rather than creating a&#xD;
      single point injection ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In double-injection technique using in plane method and lateral to medial direction half the&#xD;
      volume of local anesthetic(15 ml bupivacaine) is injected at intersection of first rib and&#xD;
      subclavian artery and another half(15 ml bupivacaine) is injected supero- lateral to&#xD;
      subclavian artery to assure spread of the local anesthetic solution in all planes containing&#xD;
      brachial plexus. the performance time will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After block will be done, second investigator will examine the patient for sensory and motor&#xD;
      block (every 10 minutes for 30 minutes) and for occurrence of complications. The patient will&#xD;
      be ready for surgery when the score ≥14 point. At this point the onset will be determined and&#xD;
      so the patient can be transferred to the operating room .&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient experienced anxiety, propofol infusion (80-250 ug/kg/min) can be started. If&#xD;
      the patient experienced pain during surgery the block considered failed and induction of&#xD;
      general anesthesia should be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After end of the surgery the second investigator will continue to assess the patient for post&#xD;
      operative pain every one hour for 24 hours to determine duration of the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible Risks to study population : 1. Intravascular injection of local anaesthetic (if tip&#xD;
      of needle is seen under ultrasound screen and the investigator is injecting local anaesthetic&#xD;
      but nothing seen under ultrasound screen(tellet sign)) 2. Pneumothorax (asses pleura of the&#xD;
      same side by chest x-ray after 6 hours) 3. Intraneural injection (keep an image or video of&#xD;
      technique and seek for another opnion) Various studies demonstrated that if intraneural&#xD;
      puncture occured the needle usually took a path away from the fascicles (intraneural&#xD;
      perifascicular), while intraneural transfascicular puncture seemed relatively rare and&#xD;
      intraneural intrafascicular placement of the needle even more uncommon. As long as the needle&#xD;
      is placed intraneurally but in an extrafascicular fashion a safe injection and the absence of&#xD;
      neurologic damage can be assumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Horner's syndrome (ptosis ,miosis ,anhydrosis may be due to involvement of cervical&#xD;
      sympathetic plexus)&#xD;
