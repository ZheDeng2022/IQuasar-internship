      This will be a Phase 1b/2a multicenter 2-stage study. Phase 1 will be conducted as a&#xD;
      dose-finding, open-label study of oral RX-3117 administered in combination with Abraxane® to&#xD;
      subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule&#xD;
      of RX-3117, in combination with Abraxane®, will be determined based on the safety profile,&#xD;
      dose modification, and pharmacokinetics (PK). Phase 1 will be conducted using a combination&#xD;
      of the single agent maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for RX-3117 and the Abraxane dose as per the&#xD;
      package insert for patients with pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the Phase 1 portion, a Phase 2a study will be conducted using a 2 stage,&#xD;
      open-label design, of RX 3117 and Abraxane® in combination to treat subjects with metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer as first line therapy. Approximately 10 subjects will participate in the&#xD;
      Stage 1 at the dose identified in Phase 1 (RP2D). Subjects will be treated for up to 8 cycles&#xD;
      of combined therapy. An interim analysis will be conducted after 10 evaluable subjects have&#xD;
      been treated at the RP2D, have completed a minimum of 4 cycles of therapy, or have&#xD;
      discontinued therapy due to progressive disease before completing 4 cycles. If an adequate&#xD;
      number of Responders are observed out of the initial 10 evaluable subjects, then 40&#xD;
      additional subjects will be enrolled to participate in Stage 2. Subjects will be treated for&#xD;
      up to 8 cycles of combined therapy.&#xD;
