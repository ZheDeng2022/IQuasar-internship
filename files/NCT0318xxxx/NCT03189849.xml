  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an observational study of children who attend summer camp at the Heartland&#xD;
      Farm Sanctuary (HFS). The investigators are exploring whether time-limited exposure to a&#xD;
      traditional farming environment will improve children's overall health and general&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching hypothesis for this study is that urban children exposed on a time-limited&#xD;
      basis to a traditional farming environment will show increased beneficial bacteria in the gut&#xD;
      microbiome and enhanced emotional well-being. Secondary hypotheses are that 1) increased&#xD;
      presence of farm-derived immunoregulatory micro-organisms in the nose (indicating exposure)&#xD;
      will be associated with measures of emotional well-being and prosocial behavior. To test&#xD;
      these hypotheses, 40 urban children ages 7-13 years will be studied prior to and following a&#xD;
      1, 2, or 3-week camp experience at the Heartland Farm Sanctuary summer camp program in&#xD;
      Verona, WI. Assessments for behavior (via questionnaires), gut microbiota composition and&#xD;
      function (via stool) and presence in the body of farm-derived immunoregulatory&#xD;
      micro-organisms (via nasal swab) will be assessed at baseline (2 weeks before the start of&#xD;
      camp and the weekend before camp starts), immediately following the child's 1, 2, or 3-week&#xD;
      camp experience and at 1 month following completion of the camp experience. Importantly, this&#xD;
      assessment schedule will allow the investigators to assess the longevity of any observed&#xD;
      physical or behavioral changes induced by exposure to the farming environment.&#xD;

        This study will enroll up to 40 children ages 7-13 who attend either 1, 2, or 3 weeks of&#xD;
        camp at Heartland Farm Sanctuary. In addition, parents whose children participate in the&#xD;
        study will be asked to answer questionnaires about their child.&#xD;
