      Chronic inflammatory rheumatism and inflammation can increase the risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      problems. Indeed, these diseases can increase the risk of myocardial infarction. The&#xD;
      objective of this project is a better understanding and preventing the risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      problems in chronic inflammatory rheumatism through the study on the long-term flexibility of&#xD;
      the arteries, blood markers of cardiovascular risk and muscle mass.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All patients over 18 years, with rheumatoid arthritis treated for the first time with&#xD;
      conventional anti-TNF therapy, Abatacept, Tocilizumab, Rituximab or patients with&#xD;
      spondyloarthritis treated for the first time with NSAIDs that may be associated with&#xD;
      conventional background treatments for peripheral or biological (anti-TNF, Usketinumab) may&#xD;
      be included. However, they must be subject to a Social Security scheme and will only be able&#xD;
      to participate in the research if they give their consent in writing after receiving full&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the usual visit and after verification of the criteria of inclusion and&#xD;
      signature of consent, arterial stiffness and endothelial function measurement are performed&#xD;
      at M0, M6, M12 and every year and also at each change of treatment, By measuring the pulse&#xD;
      wave velocity and by determining the Alx by the SphygmoCor XCEL (AtCor Medical Pty Ltd, based&#xD;
      in Australia (CE 0120). Cardiac Frequency at rest will be evaluated at M0, M6, M12, every&#xD;
      year and also at each change of treatment, by the realization of an electrocardiogram. The&#xD;
      intima-media thickness (EIM) of the carotid will be evaluated every 5 years According to the&#xD;
      recommendation. EIM is a non-invasive ultrasound technique in which an ultrasound probe is&#xD;
      placed opposite the right primitive carotid artery by convention. A measurement of&#xD;
      endothelial function will be performed at M0, M6, M12 and then every year in patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study of regional myocardial function by high-resolution echocardiography-STI will be&#xD;
      carried out at M0, M6, M12 and then every year in non-hypertensive patients, without&#xD;
      diabetes, without a cardiovascular history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Serum / plasma / urine bank will be constituted at M0, M6, M12, every year and also at each&#xD;
      change of treatment to determine the markers of cardiovascular risk. The plasma bank will be&#xD;
      used for the determination of nitric oxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study of the body composition dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and pQCT allowing to&#xD;
      evaluate lean mass, fat mass and bone mineral mass will be carried out at M0, then every year&#xD;
      and also at each change of treatment M6 assessment of lean mass and fat mass only). When DXA&#xD;
      is examined, a lateral incidence measurement of the rachis will be performed to calculate an&#xD;
      arterial calcification score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle strength will be measured by hydraulic hand dynamometer Jamar (Kinetec company) at M0,&#xD;
      M6, M12 then every year and also at each change of treatment. Physical performances will be&#xD;
      evaluated by a 6-minute walking test, 10 meters walking speed and &quot;Timed up-and-go test&quot;&#xD;
      stool test, which combines both coordination mechanisms, proprioception and muscular strength&#xD;
      of lower limbs than M0, M6, M12 and then every year and also with each change of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical activity and physical inactivity of the patient and food habits will be assessed&#xD;
      by the GPAQ (Global Physical Activity Questionnaire), FFQ and a Food questionnaire to M0, M6,&#xD;
      M12 and every year and also to each change of treatment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression will be assessed by the HAD self-administered questionnaire at M0, M6, M12 and&#xD;
      then every year and also at each change of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia will be assessed by the Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool at M0, M6, M12 and&#xD;
      then annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comorbidities will be assessed by a nurse at M0, M12 and then annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these examinations will be carried out in addition to the usual follow-up.&#xD;
