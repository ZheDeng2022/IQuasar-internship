      To determine whether a combination of four novel agents bortezomib(Velcade), lenalidomide&#xD;
      (Revlimid), Daratumumab (Darzalex) &amp; dexamethasone in combination with low-dose&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide is sufficiently active in a high risk population of myeloma patients, to&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell tumour with an annual incidence in the UK of&#xD;
      approximately 40 -50 per million i.e. 4500 new cases per annum. Approximately 20% of the&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma have a significantly worse prognosis at 3 years than&#xD;
      other multiple myeloma patients and these are characterised as having high risk (HR) disease&#xD;
      defined by genetic lesions and gene expression profiles (GEP). There have been no significant&#xD;
      improvements in outcome over the last decade for patients with HR disease. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      important to identify more effective treatment options for this group of patients especially&#xD;
      given that the number of novel agents are potentially available and which can be given as&#xD;
      part of intensive therapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive treatment in HR patients has been used outside the UK with promising results but&#xD;
      access to drugs in the UK has been challenging with constraints in the NHS treatment pathway.&#xD;
      This is the first time in the UK that newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients may be&#xD;
      entered into a clinical trial prospectively according to their genetic risk profile. It&#xD;
      provides a unique opportunity to improve outcomes and provide evidence for high cost novel&#xD;
      treatment strategies in this restricted population of poor prognosis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MUKnine trial is designed to evaluate the novel treatment strategies for multiple myeloma&#xD;
      patients with HR disease and incorporate a genetic screening component. Patients identified&#xD;
      as having HR disease are then invited to take part in the phase II single arm, multi centre&#xD;
      trial that investigates the intensive treatment schedule comprising four novel agents&#xD;
      bortezomib (Velcade), lenalidomide (Revlimid), daratumumab (Daralex), dexamethasone with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide. The trial will determine if this treatment strategy is sufficiently active&#xD;
      to take forward in to further testing in this population. Patients identified as not having&#xD;
      HR disease will receive standard local treatment and will be followed up in a cohort study to&#xD;
      assess response, progression free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
