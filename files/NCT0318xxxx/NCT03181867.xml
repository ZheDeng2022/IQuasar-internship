      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men. When prostate&#xD;
      cancer is confined to the prostate there is a high chance of cure. However, it is outside the&#xD;
      prostate or comes back after treatment, additional therapy may be needed. Current methods of&#xD;
      imaging prostate cancer are limited. Researchers want to see if a radiotracer called&#xD;
      18F-DCFPyL can identify prostate cancer in patients who have a high risk of cancer spreading&#xD;
      outside the prostate or who have signs of recurrent cancer after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if the radiotracer 18F-DCFyL can help identify prostate cancer in the body before or&#xD;
      after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men ages 18 and older who have prostate cancer that has been newly diagnosed, or has relapsed&#xD;
      after radiation or surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will have blood&#xD;
      taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be divided into 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 will be men with cancer that has been newly diagnosed as high risk by their&#xD;
           doctor who are scheduled to have prostate removal surgery or undergo biopsy before&#xD;
           radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 will be men who have presumed prostate cancer relapse after prostate removal&#xD;
           surgery or radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will have scans taken. Participants will lie still on a table in a machine that&#xD;
      takes pictures of their body. 18F-DCFyL will be injected by intravenous (IV) line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted for follow-up after scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group 1 may have surgery to remove their prostate gland or a biopsy to remove&#xD;
      some prostate tissue. This procedure will be standard of care and is not a part of this&#xD;
      study. They will also have an extra MRI scan of their prostate. For this, a tube, called an&#xD;
      endorectal coil, will be placed in their rectum. Other tubes may be wrapped around the inside&#xD;
      of their pelvis. A contrast agent will be given by IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group 2 may also undergo an MRI of the pelvis and may have a biopsy of&#xD;
      abnormalities found on the 18F-DCFyL scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have data about their prostate cancer collected for up to 1 year.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with high risk but apparently localized disease are often understaged because&#xD;
           disease beyond the prostate is not well detected and thus leads to overtreatment with&#xD;
           prostatectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recurrence of PCa after surgery or radiation is very common and sometimes progresses to&#xD;
           death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early intervention for recurrence has been shown to be of benefit but current methods of&#xD;
           localizing recurrence are either insensitive (CT), non-specific (MRI) or both (bone&#xD;
           scan) Many prostate cancers express the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) a&#xD;
           transmembrane protein with NAALADase (N-acetylated-alphalinked- acidic dipeptidase) and&#xD;
           folate hydrolase enzymatic activity. PSMA is also expressed in angiogenesis but&#xD;
           otherwise has limited expression in normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An initial test of (18)F-DCFBC, a first-generation PET agent targeting PSMA, in patients&#xD;
           with advanced local disease and biochemically recurrent prostate cancer demonstrated the&#xD;
           potential of PET to detect sites of recurrence but it was hampered by excessive blood&#xD;
           pool activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (18)F-DCFPyL, a second generation PSMA PET agent, binds with high affinity to PSMA yet&#xD;
           clears rapidly from the blood pool and thus, whole-body PET imaging with this agent, may&#xD;
           provide a new tool in staging high risk cancers and detecting recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To assess the ability of (18)F-DCFPyL to accurately stage high-risk primary prostate cancer&#xD;
      and detect sites of recurrent prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients fit criteria for one of the following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort 1: known localized high risk prostate cancer (PSA &gt;10, Gleason 8-10 or&#xD;
                clinical stage greater than or equal to T2c) with evidence of disease on standard&#xD;
                imaging, or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort 2: nonspecific or no evidence of disease on standard imaging modality AND&#xD;
                biochemical prostate cancer relapse with a PSA greater than or equal to 0.2 ng/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a single site study enrolling a total of 330 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Up to 50 evaluable patients with presumed localized high-risk prostate&#xD;
                cancerscheduled to undergo prostatectomy or biopsy within 4 months of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  250 evaluable patients with suspected recurrent prostate cancer without definitive&#xD;
                evidence of disease on conventional imaging will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects will under 18F-DCFPyL injection and whole body PET/CT imaging performed 2&#xD;
           hours (+/-15 minutes) post 18FDCFPyl injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 5 eligible patients in cohort 2 will receive an additional second 18F-DCFPyL&#xD;
           PET/CT scan within 1 month of the first study immediately after unilateral salivary&#xD;
           gland cannulation and an infusion of unlabeled DCFPyL into the cannulated gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients from cohort 2 who have a positive 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan at any time may also&#xD;
           have a one-time 18F-FDG PET/CT within 30 days of the positive 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will undergo a standard of care, clinical multiparametric endorectal coil&#xD;
           MRI in the NCI Molecular Imaging Clinic within 4 months of the PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will be followed yearly for 4 years by chart review, phone-call, email or&#xD;
           any other NIH approved platform for PSA relapse and radiologic evidence of metastatic&#xD;
           disease. Additional 18F-DCFPyL might be performed during the subject's follow up period&#xD;
           there has been a considerable change in patient status (progression or response) based&#xD;
           on PSA value, symptomatology, bone scan or CT findings.&#xD;
