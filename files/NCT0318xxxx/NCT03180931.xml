    <textblock>
      Bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS, ABSORB BVS1.1, Abbott Vascular) has been approved (CE&#xD;
      mark) and is used in daily clinical practice. While recent randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      comparing BVS versus metallic drug-eluting stent showed higher risk of definite or probable&#xD;
      device thrombosis after BVS implantation, the causes underlying thrombotic events occurring&#xD;
      beyond one year after scaffold implantation remain unclear and require investigation in an&#xD;
      independent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The INVEST registry is a world-wide, multi-center, observational, retrospective,&#xD;
      investigator-initiated registry, which will include any patients who suffered from very late&#xD;
      (&gt;1 year) scaffold thrombosis, underwent optical coherence tomography (OCT) at the time of&#xD;
      thrombosis and provided informed consent for the further use of their health related data for&#xD;
      this registry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The 3-year clinical outcome data of ABSORB II study failed to reach the two&#xD;
      co-primary endpoints of vasomotion and late loss, but also reported a higher risk of definite&#xD;
      or probable stent thrombosis throughout 3 years (3% vs 0%, p=0.03) with the Absorb BVS&#xD;
      compared with the metallic EES as well as myocardial infarction.(1) In addition, a&#xD;
      numerically higher rate of definite very late device thrombosis (2% vs 0%, p=0.19) was&#xD;
      observed. In ABSORB Japan study, malapposition and late strut discontinuities were observed&#xD;
      at the timepoint of very late scaffold thrombosis in all the 4 cases of definite very late&#xD;
      scaffold thrombosis.(2,3) There is mounting evidence from other studies with extended&#xD;
      follow-up supporting the notion of an increased risk of very late scaffold thrombosis. While&#xD;
      the causes of acute scaffold thrombosis are explained at least in part (i.e. underexpansion,&#xD;
      increased strut thickness), the causes underlying thrombotic events occurring beyond one year&#xD;
      after scaffold implantation remain unclear and require investigation in an independent&#xD;
      manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously reported that scaffold discontinuity and restenosis during&#xD;
      the resorption process may provide mechanistic explanations for very late scaffold&#xD;
      thrombosis.(4) As this report was based on a limited number of cases, the investigators&#xD;
      extend the OCT database to comprehensively study the phenomenon very late scaffold&#xD;
      thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: The investigators consider the establishment of an independent OCT registry of&#xD;
      paramount important as more than 150 000 patients have been implanted with Absorb BVS&#xD;
      worldwide. The findings may provide important insights to identify patients at increased risk&#xD;
      in addition to considerations regarding long-term antiplatelet therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The specific aim is to systematically analyse scaffold thrombosis occurring&#xD;
      beyond 1 year after implantation of a Absorb BVS 1.1 investigated by OCT at the timepoint of&#xD;
      thrombosis (either prior or after thrombus aspiration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary endpoint/outcome(s): The primary endpoint is the underlying main reason&#xD;
      for stent thrombosis as per quantitative and qualitative analysis and per expert panel&#xD;
      consensus. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of very late scaffold thrombosis, the&#xD;
      investigators will systematically assess the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distal and proximal reference area, mm2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scaffold area, mm2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumen area, mm2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incomplete scaffold apposition area, mm2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neointimal area, mm2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intracoronary thrombus area, mm2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percent area stenosis, %&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scaffold expansion, %&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eccentricity index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of macrophage accumulations, %&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncovered struts, %&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malapposed struts, %&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neointimal thickness, µm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incomplete scaffold apposition distance, µm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thrombus area, mm2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other study variables: Retrospective data about clinical and drugs history of patients,&#xD;
      procedural features and any intracoronary imaging information will be collected and analysed.&#xD;
      This will include data for any imaging information between index implantation and very late&#xD;
      scaffold thrombosis, when available, in order to investigate the underlying mechanisms of&#xD;
      very late scaffold thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Any patients who suffered from scaffold thrombosis occurring beyond 1 year after&#xD;
           implantation of a Absorb BVS 1.1 and investigated by OCT at the timepoint of thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sufficient quality of the OCT recording allowing for CoreLab analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: No exclusion criteria will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT assessment: Commercially available ILUMIEN (St. Jude Medical) or OFDI (Terumo) system are&#xD;
      used. The analysis will be conducted at the Core laboratory at Bern University Hospital,&#xD;
      Bern, Switzerland using a systematic and validated approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lumen contour is drawn by semi-automated detection using QCU-CMS software, following the&#xD;
      endoluminal contour of the neointima with manual correction wherever required. In case of&#xD;
      thrombus with low attenuation, the lumen contour can still be drawn. In case of high&#xD;
      attenuation, the lumen contour was extrapolated when the lumen contour was visible in at&#xD;
      least three quadrants. The scaffold area was measured by joining the middle points of the&#xD;
      signal poor core of the abluminal side of the struts if at least one strut was clearly&#xD;
      visible in every quadrant. Distal and proximal reference area and scaffold expansion were&#xD;
      calculated as previously reported by the MUSIC (Multicenter Ultrasound Stenting in&#xD;
      Coronaries) investigators.(5) The neointimal thickness is measured from the abluminal border&#xD;
      of the black strut core to the lumen. Uncovered struts are defined in the absence of a&#xD;
      homogenous coverage by neointima. If the apposed struts is not covered by neointima but&#xD;
      rather by irregular tissue, struts are categorized as &quot;apposed uncovered with superimposed&#xD;
      thrombus&quot;. If the coverage of apposed struts cannot be assessed owing to the presence of&#xD;
      attenuating thrombus precluding the evaluation of neointima, the struts were categorized as&#xD;
      &quot;apposed possibly uncovered&quot;. Malapposed struts were defined as struts where the abluminal&#xD;
      surface was clearly separated from the vessel wall. Incomplete scaffold apposition (ISA)&#xD;
      distance was measured from the abluminal border of the strut core to the vessel wall. If&#xD;
      malapposed struts are partially or completely surrounded by thrombus, struts were regarded as&#xD;
      malapposed with thrombus. The area between the backside of the struts and the vessel wall was&#xD;
      measured as ISA area, while the neointimal area is measured as scaffold area - (lumen area -&#xD;
      ISA area). Intracoronary thrombus was identified as any irregular mass inside the lumen, with&#xD;
      a sharp border and various degrees of attenuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiography assessment: The analysis will be conducted at the Core laboratory at Bern&#xD;
      University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland using a conventional quantitative coronary angiography&#xD;
      software (Qangio XA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of sample size: Up a total number of 30 patients who suffered from very late&#xD;
      scaffold thrombosis and underwent OCT will be analysed retrospectively. This sample size is&#xD;
      justified by the need to have precise estimates of event rates in terms of narrow 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned analysis: Descriptive statistics will be provided. The investigators will assess&#xD;
      geographic association between distribution of thrombus within scaffold and abnormal findings&#xD;
      assessed by OCT. Statistical analyses will be performed with R (R Foundation for Statistical&#xD;
      Computing, Vienna, Austria). Continuous variables will be summarized as mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation or median ± 95% confidence interval, depending on normality of distribution. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess underlying reasons for scaffold thrombosis based on the same&#xD;
      methodology with previous publication.(6)&#xD;
