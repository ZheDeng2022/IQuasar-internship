    <textblock>
      An open-label, single centre, nonrandomized clinical study in healthy volunteers, with&#xD;
      intervention over a 13---week period. After written informed consent, subjects will undergo&#xD;
      screening evaluations (Visit 1). One week after visit 1, subjects who meet the selection&#xD;
      criteria will enter a run---in period of 8 weeks where participants will receive paracetamol&#xD;
      1g tablet and collect a blood sample at monthly intervals (visits 2, 3 and 4). A final visit&#xD;
      for safety assessment will take place at week 13 (visit 5). Blood samples will be used to&#xD;
      quantify P, PG e PS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To be able to predict efficacy and adverse reactions involving compounds metabolized by&#xD;
      sulfonation, the investigators need more information on SULTs. Studies of in vivo sulfonation&#xD;
      in humans are lacking, although they are of key importance in assessing the functional&#xD;
      consequences of individual variation. In our current study, the investigators will start by&#xD;
      developing an HPLC method of quantifying SULT1A1 activity using paracetamol as probe&#xD;
      substrate and studying intraindividual variation in healthy adults. Advantages of using&#xD;
      paracetamol as a probe substrate for in vivo phenotyping of SULT1A1 include: wide safety&#xD;
      margin for in vivo use, easy and ready administration of the drug, significant metabolism by&#xD;
      the enzyme of interest, short half---life, linear pharmacokinetics over a wide concentration&#xD;
      range and a limited number of metabolites, quantifiable in plasma.15,24 In a subsequent&#xD;
      study, the investigators plan to study interindividual variation in a larger sample,&#xD;
      including subjects with chronic disease and on medication.The investigators expect to provide&#xD;
      a valuable new tool to explore the clinical significance of variation of SULT1A1 activity,&#xD;
      the most important SULT on drug metabolism.&#xD;

    <description>Volunteers will be screened at visit 1, and if they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria they will receive the intervention at visit 2. At visit 2, complying subjects will receive a tablet containing 1 gram of paracetamol and have a blood sample collected 2 hours after administration; these procedures will be repeated on 2 more occasions (visits 3 and 4). The subjects will come for 5 visits during the study. Visit 1 and 2 must occur within 7 days of each other, visits 2, 3 and 4 will be four weeks (± 3 days) apart and visit 5 scheduled four weeks (± 3 days) after visit 4.</description>
