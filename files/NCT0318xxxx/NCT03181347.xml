  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and its associated diseases are increasing worldwide. However, the mechanisms behind&#xD;
      the development of obesity is not fully understood. There is evidence that intestinal&#xD;
      bacteria may play a role in the development and perpetuation of obesity through regulation of&#xD;
      energy and fat storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective modality for treating severe obesity with&#xD;
      evidence to support long-term sustained weight loss and improvement in obesity-related&#xD;
      comorbidities. The two most commonly performed bariatric surgical procedures are the&#xD;
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). RYGB leads to greater weight&#xD;
      loss than SG and improved diabetes control in patients following surgery. Despite the success&#xD;
      of RYGB and SG in inducing weight loss and improving comorbidities, the underlying mechanisms&#xD;
      leading to clinical improvement following these operations is not completely understood.&#xD;
      Multiple factors are thought to play a role including reduced caloric intake, decreased&#xD;
      nutrient absorption, increased satiety, release of hormones and shifts in bile acid&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence has suggested that the gut bacteria mediates a number of the beneficial&#xD;
      effects of bariatric surgery. Small studies have demonstrated changes in the composition and&#xD;
      diversity of the gut microbiota after RYGB and SG in humans. One study also confirmed&#xD;
      long-term microbial changes for RYGB. However, comparative trials have been small (less than&#xD;
      15 participants per treatment group) and important differences between specific bacterial&#xD;
      populations have not been well elucidated. Furthermore, no human study has examined the&#xD;
      differences in bacterial composition following RYGB and SG in relation to their metabolic&#xD;
      consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the metabolic and microbial changes that&#xD;
      occur with RYGB, SG, and dietary controls. Specifically, the investigators aim to use a&#xD;
      systems biology approach utilizing powerful analytic techniques including metagenomics,&#xD;
      metabolomics, and multiplex immune profiling to define the combined microbial, metabolic and&#xD;
      immunologic changes that occur after bariatric surgery.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS The investigators hypothesize that intestinal microbial dysbiosis and a decrease&#xD;
      in diversity contributes to the development and perpetuation of obesity. The effect of&#xD;
      dysbiosis is multifactorial and includes a decrease in intestinal barrier function and&#xD;
      resultant local and systemic inflammation that incites the metabolic syndrome. The altered&#xD;
      intestinal physiology following RYGB and SG will lead to identifiable changes in specific&#xD;
      microbial populations and an increase in diversity. Specific beneficial microbial changes&#xD;
      will subsequently result in weight loss, reduced inflammation, and a normalized metabolic&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Study population: Patients will be recruited from the Edmonton Adult Specialty&#xD;
      Bariatric Clinic at the Royal Alexandra hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Each cohort of RYGB, SG and non-surgical dietary controls will have 30 patients&#xD;
      (total n = 90). Previous studies have included 15 or less participants per arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: Sample size calculation was designed to ensure the study would&#xD;
      adequately capture microbial changes induced by surgery. In prior literature, an important&#xD;
      short-chain fatty acid-producing bacterial species' (F. prausnitzii) relative abundance was&#xD;
      lower in a post-RYGB group compared to non-operative controls (0.031 v. 0.053 σ 0.024). With&#xD;
      an alpha of 0.05 and a Beta of 0.90, this would require 26 subjects per arm. Including a&#xD;
      dropout rate of 10%, this increases to 30 subjects per arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: For the intervention arm, subjects will be enrolled at the time they are&#xD;
      scheduled for surgery. Fecal, urine, and blood samples will be collected in clinic 2-6 weeks&#xD;
      prior to surgery. In the post-operative period, fecal collection will take place at scheduled&#xD;
      three- and nine- month clinic visits. All pre-operative samples will be collected prior to&#xD;
      subjects initiating a 2-4 week pre-operative liquid designed to reduce hepatomegaly and ease&#xD;
      in the technical surgical aspects of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-surgical controls will be patients who are treated with dietary and behavioural&#xD;
      interventions for weight loss. This includes dietary and activity modifications and excludes&#xD;
      meal replacement or pharmacologic interventions. For this cohort, subjects will have initial&#xD;
      sampling (fecal, urine, blood) taken prior to initiating weight loss interventions. Further&#xD;
      sampling will then occur at three months and nine months following initiation of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample processing and immune analysis will take place at the Centre of Excellence for&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal Inflammation and Immunity Research (CEGIIR) at the University of Alberta.&#xD;
      Sequencing will be carried out by the Applied Genomics Center within CEGIIR and metabolomics&#xD;
      will be done at the Metabolomic Innovation Center at the University of Alberta as a fee for&#xD;
      service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal microbial analysis: Fecal sample collection will be driven by a previous developed&#xD;
      protocol used by our group for diet studies in inflammatory bowel disease. Collection cups&#xD;
      will be provided to patients and they will be instructed to collect a specimen the night&#xD;
      prior or morning of their appointment. Subjects will be instructed to store the specimen in&#xD;
      the fridge in the interim. Fecal samples will be analyzed for microbial composition,&#xD;
      inflammatory signals, and fecal calprotectin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microbial community composition of fecal samples will be assessed using 16S rRNA gene&#xD;
      analyses. DNA will be extracted from the fecal homogenates combining enzymatic and mechanical&#xD;
      cell lysis with the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Fecal microbiota&#xD;
      composition will be characterized by 16S rRNA tag sequencing using the MiSeq Illumina&#xD;
      technology (pair-end), targeting the V3-V5 regions. Quality-controlled reads will be analyzed&#xD;
      using 1) taxonomic-based approaches such as Global Alignment for Sequence Taxonomy (GAST)15&#xD;
      and the Ribosomal Database Project MultiClassifier tool and 2) non-taxonomic-based clustering&#xD;
      algorithms for Operational Taxonomic Unit determination with the UPARSE pipeline.&#xD;
      Alpha-diversity (observed species, Shannon, Simpson) and β-diversity indices (Bray-Curtis,&#xD;
      binary Jaccard) will be calculated in QIIME and R (VEGAN package). Ordination plots for&#xD;
      β-diversity metrics will be generated by non-parametric multidimensional scaling ordination&#xD;
      in R. In order to assess the functional composition of the microbiome, gene content of the&#xD;
      microbial community will be inferred using the PICRUSt algorithm16. PICRUSt uses information&#xD;
      about gene content and 16S rRNA gene copy number from the IMG (integrated microbial genomes)&#xD;
      database to predict which genes are present in organisms of the experimental samples. OTUs&#xD;
      tables generated with QIIME/UPARSE will be normalized by 16S rRNA gene copy number and such&#xD;
      normalized values are multiplied by the calculated abundance of gene families in each taxon&#xD;
      during the gene content inference procedure performed with PICRUSt. The result is a table of&#xD;
      gene family counts that is comparable to those generated by metagenome annotation pipelines&#xD;
      such as HUMAnN and MG-RAST and which can be organized into metabolic pathways. Finally, the&#xD;
      contribution of each OTU to a given gene function will be quantified. To identify microbial&#xD;
      populations and metabolic pathways with differentiating abundance in the different groups,&#xD;
      the LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) Effect Size (LEfSe) algorithm will be used with the&#xD;
      online interface Galaxy (http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy/root).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine and serum metabolomics: Urine and blood samples will be collected during the subject's&#xD;
      clinic visit. Urine samples will be obtained in a standard urine collection jar containing&#xD;
      sodium azide to prevent bacterial growth, and frozen after collection. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected in heparinized collection tubes at the time of routine clinically indicated&#xD;
      bloodwork, specifically six weeks pre-operatively and three and nine months post-operative.&#xD;
      Serum will be isolated by centrifugation at 2 000 g for 10 minutes following collection and&#xD;
      stored at -80⁰C. Urine and serum samples will be used for metabolomics profiling using NMR&#xD;
      spectroscopy at each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolomic profiling will be done with NMR spectroscopy through the Metabolomics Innovation&#xD;
      Center at the University of Alberta. Samples will be run on a 4-channel Varian INOVA 600 MHz&#xD;
      NMR spectrometer. Standard Chenomx acquisition and processing parameters will be followed. 1&#xD;
      H-NMR analysis using Chenomx NMR Suite software will allow simultaneous identification of up&#xD;
      to 300 small molecules. The resulting NMR spectra will be subjected to analysis using the&#xD;
      technique of targeted profiling comparing spectra to a known reference database to identify&#xD;
      metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines: Serum will be assessed for measurement of&#xD;
      erythropoietin sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) as measurements of&#xD;
      systemic inflammation, and LPS, as a measurement of bacterial translocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both serum and tissue samples will be analyzed for inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.&#xD;
      Tissue samples will be collected by a member of the study team at the time of surgery. A&#xD;
      mucosal specimen from the stomach will be collected for SG patients and from both the stomach&#xD;
      and jejunum for RYGB patients, flash frozen in the operating room using liquid nitrogen, and&#xD;
      subsequently stored at -80⁰C. These specimen are removed as a standard part of the&#xD;
      procedures. They will be analyzed for inflammatory cytokines. The investigators have&#xD;
      established a good working relationship with operating room staff and surgeons around our&#xD;
      cities in previous studies which will facilitate this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Host immune response will be assessed in samples by protein expression of cytokines and&#xD;
      chemokines using the Meso Scale Discovery platform (MSD, Gaithersburg, Maryland USA). Using&#xD;
      this multi-array technology will provide us with a dynamic range and the sensitivity to&#xD;
      measure a large number of inflammatory and homeostatic signals simultaneously in a single&#xD;
      sample. The investigators will initially focus on cytokine involved in the Farnesoid X&#xD;
      receptor pathways, given the apparent relationship between bariatric surgery, weight loss,&#xD;
      and bile acids17. Specifically, these cytokines include IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TNFα, and&#xD;
      MCP-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: A systems biology approach will be used to combine the metagenomics, metabolomics,&#xD;
      and multiplex immune profiling to define the combined microbial, metabolic and immunologic&#xD;
      changes that occur after bariatric surgery. Differences between continuous variables and&#xD;
      outcome will be assessed by Wilcoxon rank sum test. Differences between categorical&#xD;
      explanatory variables and the outcome will be assessed by the chi-square test, or Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test when cell size is &lt;5. Variables significant at the p &lt; 0.10 level by likelihood&#xD;
      ratio testing from univariate logistic regression will be entered into multivariable logistic&#xD;
      regression. A backward stepwise selection procedure will be utilized and those variables with&#xD;
      a likelihood ratio p-value &lt;0.05 will be maintained in the multivariable model. QIIME&#xD;
      (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology), MEGAN (MEtaGenome Analyzer), and Metastats,&#xD;
      will be performed using the expertise developed at CEGIIR and in collaboration with Dr. Gane&#xD;
      Wong, a systems biology expert.&#xD;
