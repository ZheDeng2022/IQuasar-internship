    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) reduction and 24-hour blood&#xD;
      pressure control of Valsartan 80mg or Nebivolol/Valsartan 5/80mg once daily as replacement&#xD;
      therapy for currently treated or untreated hypertensive patients with LVH not at BP goal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The potential benefits of blood pressure reduction have been demonstrated in numerous large&#xD;
      clinical trials. The most recent is the SPRINT Trial demonstrating that lower blood pressure&#xD;
      goals can be achieved and are associated with a significant decrease in morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. The latest NHANES 2012 data reveal that less than 50% of patients that are aware&#xD;
      of the elevated blood pressure and are being treated achieve blood pressure control.&#xD;
      Treatment of hypertension in many patients (&gt;70%) require treatment with more than one drug,&#xD;
      increasing the likelihood of non-compliance and not achieving blood pressure goal. JNC 8&#xD;
      recommends the utilizing of combination therapy both for Stage I and Stage II Hypertensive&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study to assess the efficacy of LVH reduction and 24-hour blood pressure&#xD;
      control of Valsartan 80mg and Nebivolol/Valsartan 5/80mg, once daily for the treatment of&#xD;
      currently treated hypertensive patients with LVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate LVH reduction at 4 and 8 weeks as well as change from baseline in&#xD;
      mean 24 hour ABPM SBP after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment with valsartan 80mg or&#xD;
      nebivolol/valsartan 5/80mg&#xD;
