    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Entinostat on the bioavailability of&#xD;
      Midazolam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of a single oral dose of entinostat on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single oral dose of midazolam in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of combined administration&#xD;
      of entinostat and midazolam in healthy subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, 2 period, fixed-sequence study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-two (22), healthy, adult male subjects will be enrolled; additional subjects may be&#xD;
      enrolled to replace discontinued subjects, at the discretion of the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening of subjects will occur within 28 prior to the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Period 1, a single oral dose of midazolam will be administered followed by PK&#xD;
      sampling for midazolam and 1 OH midazolam for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Period 2, a single oral dose of midazolam will be administered 0.75 hours after a&#xD;
      single oral dose of entinostat. Following midazolam dosing on Day 1 of Period 2, PK samples&#xD;
      for midazolam and 1 OH midazolam will be taken for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a washout period of at least 7 days between the dosing in Period 1 and&#xD;
      entinostat dose in Period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be monitored throughout the study by repeated clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      evaluations.&#xD;
