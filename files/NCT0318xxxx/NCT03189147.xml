  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The appropriate treatment of labral lesions such as SLAP tears in patients undergoing RC&#xD;
      tears repair is controversial. Most surgeons are reluctant to repair RC and SLAP tears&#xD;
      simultaneously due to the high likelihood of prolonged postoperative immobilization,&#xD;
      stiffness and poor clinical outcomes. The current standard care interventions include&#xD;
      debridement, biceps tenotomy or tenodesis rather than surgical repair of SLAP tears. Simple&#xD;
      debridement is a low cost and time-saving procedure that has the advantage of maintaining the&#xD;
      anatomy of the long head of biceps (LHB), a muscle that acts as an active depressor of the&#xD;
      head of the humerus in patients with RC tears. Biceps tenotomy is also low cost and&#xD;
      time-saving; however, since the LHB is released from its attachment in the shoulder joint,&#xD;
      the anatomy is not preserved and results in decreased strength and possible development of a&#xD;
      'Popeye' deformity. Biceps tenodesis has higher costs and time than the other two approaches,&#xD;
      but has the advantage of preserving the LHB anatomy and power, and a lower possibility of&#xD;
      developing complications. Finally, labral repair has the highest costs and associated&#xD;
      surgical time and may lead to increase stiffness after surgery, particularly in patients over&#xD;
      45 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the standard care of the surgeons involved in this study is to use either&#xD;
      debridement or biceps tenodesis to address labral lesions in patients undergoing surgery for&#xD;
      their RC tear. Based on the current evidence and current practice in our facility, we aim to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of tenodesis versus debridement in patients with combined RC tear,&#xD;
      degenerative labrum (SLAP tears) and a normal biceps tendon.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff (RC) tears are the most common source of shoulder pain, disability and&#xD;
      discomfort. In fact, RC disease is the most common cause of shoulder pain seen by physicians.&#xD;
      It has been estimated that as many as 40% of patients with shoulder pain may have a RC tear.&#xD;
      Previous research has shown that 80% of these patients will experience pain, and 40% of&#xD;
      patients will experience tear progression (tear becoming larger, more painful, multiple&#xD;
      muscle involvement). Therefore, it is no surprise that a substantial proportion of&#xD;
      individuals with RC tears do not receive adequate relief from non-operative treatments&#xD;
      (physiotherapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, activity/work modification, cortisone&#xD;
      injection), and require surgical repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical repair has been challenging in this population, since frequently RC tears are&#xD;
      associated with concomitant labral lesions such as SLAP (superior labral anterior-posterior)&#xD;
      tears that may increase patients' symptoms. Miller and Savoie studied one hundred patients&#xD;
      with full-thickness RC tears and determine that 74% had coexisting intra-articular&#xD;
      abnormalities, and labral tears were the most common associated pathology. Gartsman et al&#xD;
      reported that 60.5% of patients with full-thickness RC tears had coexisting intraarticular&#xD;
      abnormalities, with 25 patients (12.5%) having major abnormalities that required surgery,&#xD;
      changed postoperative rehabilitation or impacted the expected end result. Snyder et al. 8&#xD;
      reported that 40% of patients with SLAP lesions had associated full- or partial-thickness RC&#xD;
      tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The appropriate treatment of labral lesions such as SLAP tears in patients undergoing RC&#xD;
      tears repair is controversial. Most surgeons are reluctant to repair RC and SLAP tears&#xD;
      simultaneously due to the high likelihood of prolonged postoperative immobilization,&#xD;
      stiffness and poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, the current standard care interventions&#xD;
      include debridement, biceps tenotomy or tenodesis rather than surgical repair of SLAP tears3.&#xD;
      Recently, Oh et al. compared simple debridement, biceps tenotomy, and biceps tenodesis for&#xD;
      the patients with concomitant RC tear and labral lesions. All concomitant treatments improved&#xD;
      patients' symptoms. Simple biceps debridement had the lowest risk of patients developing a&#xD;
      'Popeye' deformity and preserved forearm supination strength. Biceps tenotomy appeared&#xD;
      preferable for patients with definite groove tenderness while biceps tenodesis was indicated&#xD;
      for patients with groove tenderness, but who wanted to preserve supination strength. However,&#xD;
      this study was compromised by low follow-up (72%) within one year and unbalanced groups&#xD;
      (i.e.one group had significantly more males). Abbot et al. determined that patients over the&#xD;
      age of 45 years treated with arthroscopic RC repair and SLAP debridement had significantly&#xD;
      better function, pain relief, and range of motion than those treated with RC repair and&#xD;
      simultaneous SLAP repair. A systematic review in 2011 looked at the current evidence for&#xD;
      effectiveness of interventions to treat RC tears, and they found limited evidence favoring&#xD;
      debridement compared to anchor replacement and suture repair of Type II SLAP tear. Another&#xD;
      systematic review in 2014 revised the published data on the surgical treatment of superior&#xD;
      labral injuries in patients aged 40 years, including those with concomitant injuries to the&#xD;
      RC and they stated that the cumulative evidence supports labral debridement or biceps&#xD;
      tenotomy over labral repair when an associated RC injury is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above studies are contradictory likely because studies were heterogeneous in terms of&#xD;
      selection as well as assessment periods and outcome measurements performed. Therefore, the&#xD;
      question about best practice to treat labral lesions in patients with concomitant RC tears&#xD;
      remains unanswered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, in previous studies, surgical time and costing with the different approaches were&#xD;
      not considered. Simple debridement is a low cost and time-saving procedure that has the&#xD;
      advantage of maintaining the anatomy of the long head of biceps (LHB), a muscle that acts as&#xD;
      an active depressor of the head of the humerus in patients with RC tears. Biceps tenotomy is&#xD;
      also low cost and time-saving; however, since the LHB is released from its attachment in the&#xD;
      shoulder joint, the anatomy is not preserved and results in decreased strength and possible&#xD;
      development of a 'Popeye' deformity. Biceps tenodesis has higher costs and time than the&#xD;
      other two approaches, but has the advantage of preserving the LHB anatomy and power, and a&#xD;
      lower possibility of developing complications. Finally, labral repair has the highest costs&#xD;
      and associated surgical time and may lead to increase stiffness after surgery, particularly&#xD;
      in patients over 45 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the standard care of the surgeons involved in this study is to use either&#xD;
      debridement or biceps tenodesis to address labral lesions in patients undergoing surgery for&#xD;
      their RC tear. Annually, in the Edmonton region, as an estimate from all of the surgeons&#xD;
      involved in this study, surgeons perform around 200 of each technique (debridement or biceps&#xD;
      tenodesis). Based on the current evidence and current practice in our facility, we aim to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of tenodesis versus debridement in patients with combined RC tear,&#xD;
      degenerative labrum (SLAP tears) and a normal biceps tendon.&#xD;
