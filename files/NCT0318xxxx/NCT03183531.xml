      The objective of present study was to evaluate clinical and laboratory characteristics of&#xD;
      febrile neonate and describe the incidence of SBI in febrile neonates. Secondarly&#xD;
      investigators aimed to test usefulness of major protocols and new protocol in evaluating only&#xD;
      febrile neonate.&#xD;

      This was a prospective observational cohort study, conducted between January 2011 and&#xD;
      December 2015 (5 years) at Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Hospital, a tertiary care&#xD;
      university-affiliated medical center in Istanbul. Written informed consent was obtained from&#xD;
      the parents of all infants enrolled in the study before inclusion. The study protocol was&#xD;
      approved by the local ethic committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population All neonates who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit with a&#xD;
      rectal temperature of ≥38°C (documented at the time of medical evaluation) were eligible for&#xD;
      the participation in this study. The exclusion criteria were gestational age less than 35&#xD;
      weeks, who refused to participate in the study, chromosome abnormality (e.g., trisomy 21,&#xD;
      18), the presence of a chronic disease, congenital malformations (cyanotic heart disease,&#xD;
      meningomyelocele), admission to pediatric surgery, started on antibiotics before admission,&#xD;
      and incomplete records. A complete history was obtained from the parents of infants, and a&#xD;
      specialist in neonatology carried out a physical examination for localizing the source of the&#xD;
      fever in all infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection The data obtained for all infants included: demographic information (age at&#xD;
      admission, gender, and birth weight), general assessment (well or sick-appearing), medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination findings, laboratory test results, and final diagnosis.&#xD;
      Laboratory investigations including complete blood count, CRP level, blood chemistry and&#xD;
      culture, urine sample analysis and culture (obtained by bladder catheterization), and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid sample analysis and culture, were carried out. In the presence of&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms or signs, chest radiography was performed. Lumbar puncture was performed&#xD;
      according to the ward's policy, which is required for every infant if neurologic findings are&#xD;
      positive or without the focus on fever. Stool specimens were obtained when a history of&#xD;
      diarrhea was noted and sent for white blood cell analysis and bacterial culture. Other tests&#xD;
      were conducted as necessary. Skin, soft tissue, and ear infections were diagnosed by physical&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of SBI An episode of SBI was defined as (A) the growth of a known pathogenic&#xD;
      bacteria in one or more of cultures (bacteremia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, suppurative&#xD;
      arthritis, urinary tract infection, bacterial enteritis, and pneumonia), (B) any disease&#xD;
      commonly associated with bacterial pathogens including pneumonia, acute otitis media,&#xD;
      suppurative arthritis, osteomyelitis, and soft-tissue infections (cellulitis, abscess,&#xD;
      mastitis, and omphalitis). Pneumonia was defined as a new discrete infiltration on the chest&#xD;
      film, which was confirmed by an attending pediatric radiologist with the presence of typical&#xD;
      clinical signs and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All specimens for culture were evaluated by standard microbiological methods. No specimens&#xD;
      were processed for viral cultures. The blood culture isolates were considered pathogenic if&#xD;
      the organism was known to cause disease in healthy infants. UTI (urinary tract infection) was&#xD;
      defined as the isolation of &gt;104 CFU/mL of urine of a single pathogen by catheterization. A&#xD;
      positive urine analysis was defined by a positive test for leucocyte esterase or nitrite by&#xD;
      the dipstick method or leukocyte ≥10 cells/mm3 in uncentrifuged urine. Methods of viral agent&#xD;
      evaluation: in infants with viral respiratory symptoms and complaints (a runny nose,&#xD;
      sneezing, coughing), the presence of RSV-Ag (rapid immunochromatographic test produced by&#xD;
      Prima lab SA, Switzerland), and influenza-Ag (Immunoassay test produced by Dalian Rongbang&#xD;
      Medical Healthy Devices, Spain) were assessed from nasopharyngeal secretions. The body weight&#xD;
      of the subjects was taken on admission and weight loss was assessed according to the birth&#xD;
      weight. The proportion of weight loss more than twelve percent of birth weight was considered&#xD;
      as dehydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were hospitalized and prophylactic antibiotic therapy was started and continued&#xD;
      for at least 72 hours (cases diagnosed only with dehydration did not receive antibiotics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newly proposed protocol (Sisli Etfal) includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Unremarkable medical history (no perinatal antibiotics, no underlying disease, not&#xD;
      hospitalized longer than the mother), (2) Good appearance, (3) No focal physical signs of&#xD;
      infection, (4) CRP level &lt; 1 mg/dl, (5) WBC 5000-15000 counts/mm3 and band/neutrophil ratio&#xD;
      (I/T) &lt;0.2, (6) A normal urine analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infants with all these criteria were considered to have a low risk for SBI. All infants&#xD;
      were classified at low-risk by the criteria of Rochester, Boston, Philadelphia and Sisli&#xD;
      Etfal protocols. The criteria of four protocols are presented in Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The data were analyzed by using SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL,&#xD;
      USA). Categorical variables are reported as percentages, and normally distributed data are&#xD;
      expressed as mean±SD. Statistical comparisons between two groups performed with Student's&#xD;
      t-test for normally distributed data, Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed data,&#xD;
      and chi-square test for all numerical and categorical values. The positive predictive value&#xD;
      (PPV) for SBI of at least one abnormal criteria and the NPV for SBI of the low-risk criteria,&#xD;
      in combination, were calculated by the standard statistical formula. All patients were&#xD;
      evaluated according to the Boston, Philadelphia, Rochester and Sisli Etfal protocols, and the&#xD;
      results were compared for sensitivity, specificity, NPV, PPV, and accuracy values. For&#xD;
      predicting SBI, the serum levels of CRP and WBC count were subjected to receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. The results were considered to be significant if&#xD;
      analysis yielded p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
