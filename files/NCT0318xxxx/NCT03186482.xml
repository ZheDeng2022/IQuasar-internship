    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the levels of three HIV medications: Descovy®,&#xD;
      Viread® and Rifadin® in the blood after drug intake has been stopped, in order to understand&#xD;
      how long these drugs persist in the blood. The study will specifically look at blood levels&#xD;
      of these three drugs after taking them every day for 28 days. Participants will take Descovy®&#xD;
      on a first stage, a combination of Descovy® and Rifadin® on a second stage, and Viread® on a&#xD;
      third stage. If the participants decide to take part, the duration of the study will be up to&#xD;
      85 days plus a screening visit which will take place up to 28 days prior to the start of the&#xD;
      study, and a follow up visit, which takes place 28 to 36 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
      medication. This study is not randomised which means that all participants will receive all&#xD;
      study medications in the same order. The participant and the study doctor will know which&#xD;
      study medications the participant is taking at all times during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, numerous blood samples will be taken which could cause inconvenience and&#xD;
      distress for patients. Every effort will be made by study staff to minimise this. There are a&#xD;
      lot of clinic visits during the study and three full days in the unit which may inconvenience&#xD;
      patients. However, participants will be made aware of this both verbally and in the patient&#xD;
      information sheet. Participants will also receive compensation for their time and travel&#xD;
      expenses whilst participating in the trial. Participants or participants' partners who plan&#xD;
      to become pregnant during the study will not be allowed to take part in the study. Further to&#xD;
      this (if applicable), participants must use effective contraception for the duration of the&#xD;
      study. Participants will have to adhere to other restrictions as detailed in the participant&#xD;
      information sheet. These restrictions will be explained in full to all participants.&#xD;

      To assess the pharmacokinetics of TAF, plasma tenofovir, intracellular tenofovir-diphosphate&#xD;
      (TFV-DP), emtricitabine, and emtricitabine tri-phosphate (FTC-TP), during administration of&#xD;
      TAF/FTC and TDF alone and during co-administration of TAF/FTC or TDF plus rifampicin in HIV&#xD;
      negative healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety and tolerability of the co-administered drugs in HIV negative healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. To investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms in drug disposition&#xD;
      genes and drug exposure. To investigate the impact of anti-retroviral drugs on platelet&#xD;
      function in people living with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among patients treated with antiretrovirals (ARVs), many will need to be treated for&#xD;
      tuberculosis (TB) during their lifetime and Rifampicin (Rifadin) is the most commonly used&#xD;
      treatment for tuberculosis. Every new ARV that becomes available for the treatment of HIV&#xD;
      must be studied with rifampicin to understand whether it is safe to be used in patients on&#xD;
      ARV treatment undergoing anti-TB treatment with rifampicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the participant's involvement in the study will be 85 days plus a&#xD;
      screening visit up to 28 days prior to the start of the study, and a follow up visit 27 to 35&#xD;
      days after the last blood measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be asked to visit the clinic on 18 occasions, of which three visits&#xD;
      involve staying in the unit for approximately 12 hours (day 28, 56 and 84). Blood samples&#xD;
      will be taken from the participants throughout the study to measure the levels of Descovy,&#xD;
      Viread and Rifadin in blood. Blood and urine will also be collected throughout the study for&#xD;
      safety analysis. This is to ensure the participants are healthy to take part or to continue&#xD;
      taking part in the study. The total amount of blood collected from each participant during&#xD;
      the study will be approximately 590ml (approximately a pint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with written information about the study in the form of a&#xD;
      participant information sheet and will be allowed adequate time for questions and to consider&#xD;
      the study before agreeing to participate. It will be the responsibility of the investigator&#xD;
      or the co-investigator to obtain written informed consent prior to undertaking any procedure&#xD;
      detailed in the protocol. As part of the consent procedure, participants will also be asked&#xD;
      consent to their personal details being entered into TOPS (the over-volunteering protection&#xD;
      system).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator or designee will provide adequate explanation of the aims, methods,&#xD;
      objectives and potential hazards of the study. They will also be explaining to the&#xD;
      participants that they are free to refuse or withdraw from the study for any reason without&#xD;
      detriment to their future care or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed description of each study visit follows below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening visit If the participant agrees to take part, they will firstly be asked to&#xD;
           sign the informed consent form and they will be given a copy to keep.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the visit the following assessments will be carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Demographic details&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Full medical, drug and social history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical examination including weight, height, and vital signs (temperature, blood&#xD;
                pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Chemistry panel&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Haematology with a differential and clotting screen&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HIV antibody testing&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hepatitis B and C screening&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Registration of TOPS database&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Concomitant medications GP verification of medical history: A medical history&#xD;
                questionnaire will be sent to all participants' GPs for verification of medical&#xD;
                history. This information will be reviewed by the Investigator as part of the&#xD;
                medical history evaluation. If the completed questionnaire is not received from the&#xD;
                GP, then the available information regarding the participant will be reviewed by&#xD;
                the Investigator. The Investigator will assess this information and decide whether&#xD;
                they are sufficiently confident that the inclusion and exclusion criteria are met&#xD;
                and whether the participant may be enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This decision must be documented in writing BEFORE the participant is dosed. Copies of&#xD;
           sent GP letters and returned confirmation of medical history will be filed in each&#xD;
           participant's source documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline Visit, Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will attend the Unit in the morning and will be asked to fast for 8 hours&#xD;

&#xD;
           In Phase 1 and 3, Viread® and Descovy® dosing must be witnessed following a standard&#xD;
           breakfast, made up according to instructions in Appendix 3 along with 240 ml of water.&#xD;
           This will set the nominal time of dosing. Participants will then be instructed to take&#xD;
           the study drug at home at the same time every day within 15 minutes after a standard&#xD;
           breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Phase 2, the Rifadin® dose (either taken in the unit or at home) must be taken on an&#xD;
           empty stomach. Then, at least 30 mins after the Rifadin® dose, participants should have&#xD;
           a standard meal followed by the Descovy® dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be requested to return to site any used/unused Descovy®, Vilead® or&#xD;
           Rifadin® tablets on Days 28, 56 and 84. Site staff will count the IMP and this will be&#xD;
           recorded in the source.&#xD;
