    <textblock>
      In order to improve the sensitivity and specificity of pre-operative imaging localization of&#xD;
      foci in adult endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia (AHH) we aim to evaluate a novel&#xD;
      promising imaging compound targeting the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R),&#xD;
      68Ga-NODAGA-exendin 4. With the currently used imaging techniques, only about 70-80% of&#xD;
      insulin producing pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (IPPNET) can be successfully visualized.&#xD;
      Therefore, we propose to compare GLP-1R PET imaging to the standard imaging techniques in&#xD;
      patients scheduled for surgical removal of the tumour. These highly relevant data will allow&#xD;
      us to interpret the benefits of GLP-1R-imaging over other imaging techniques for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of IPPNET in AHH patients. Since pre-operative localization of foci in AHH remains&#xD;
      challenging and frequently still leading to futile surgery or unnecessary partial&#xD;
      pancreatectomy, a more sensitive and specific imaging technique would be of great value.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Adult endogenous hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia The most common form of functional&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumours of the pancreas are insulin producing pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors&#xD;
      (IPPNET). These tumors are rare and have an incidence of 1-4 newly diagnosed cases per 1&#xD;
      million per year and are malignant in about 10% of the cases. Another cause of AHH is&#xD;
      nesidioblastosis, or adult beta cell hyperplasia. It is difficult to exactly determine the&#xD;
      incidence of the disease, but it appears that in approximately 5% of the cases of AHH&#xD;
      nesiodioblastosis may be the underlying pathology, while IPPNET are responsible for the&#xD;
      majority of the cases. The pathophysiological cause of nesidioblastosis is not well&#xD;
      understood, but the rising incidence of the AHH as a consequence of gastric bypass surgery&#xD;
      for morbid obesity (although often reversible in these patients) may suggest an association&#xD;
      with metabolic and hormonal changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For IPPNET, surgical removal of the tumour is the therapy of choice and is considered&#xD;
      curative in case of a benign tumour. Optimal preoperative localization of the lesion is&#xD;
      warranted in order to reduce morbidity by helping to optimize the surgical procedure.&#xD;
      Successful preoperative localization of IPPNET is a challenging problem since approximately&#xD;
      30% of IPPNET cannot be visualized using the conventional imaging techniques CT and/or MRI&#xD;
      and endoscopic ultrasound. Selective arterial stimulation with calcium with simultaneous&#xD;
      venous sampling (ASVS) has been described to have a sensitivity and specificity of almost 90%&#xD;
      in identifying IPPNET. This is, however, an invasive technique which is accompanied by an&#xD;
      risk for complications. Functional imaging with somatostatin (sst) receptor scintigraphy&#xD;
      (SRS) and SPECT/CT are able to detect less than 50% of benign IPPNET because of low or absent&#xD;
      expression of sst receptor subtypes 2 and 5, which bind octreotide with high affinity. PET&#xD;
      with 68Ga-labeled sst analogs has a higher sensitivity for smaller lesions than SRS. Also&#xD;
      11C-5-HTP and 18F-DOPA, which are used as PET tracers for the detection of IPPNET in some&#xD;
      centers may be more sensitive than SRS and CT with 11C-5-HTP showing the most accurate&#xD;
      visualization. However, when compared to intra-operative findings, 2 out of 6 IPPNET could&#xD;
      still not be detected preoperatively. Palpation and intra-operative ultrasound will allow&#xD;
      identifying the lesion in approximately 70-80% of cases. However, it remains a challenge to&#xD;
      find small or multiple tumours in the pancreas and partial pancreatectomy is frequently&#xD;
      required, especially if the lesion is located close to the pancreatic duct. Precise&#xD;
      preoperative localization of the IPPNET is therefore critical to minimize surgical&#xD;
      intervention. If no IPPNET can be identified pre- or perioperatively, the diagnosis of&#xD;
      nesidioblastosis may be established by resection and histopathologic evaluation of the&#xD;
      pancreatic tail. If nesidioblastosis is present, partial pancreatectomy is required; the&#xD;
      challenge is to remove enough tissue in order to avoid hypoglycaemia while keeping enough&#xD;
      functional endocrine pancreatic tissue so that the patient does not become diabetic.&#xD;
      Currently, with the risk of reoperation being considered lower than the consequences and&#xD;
      complications of diabetes, surgeons usually choose a fairly conservative approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging of diseased beta cells Visualization of the beta cells by a highly specific&#xD;
      radiotracer with which high target-to background ratios can be obtained would benefit&#xD;
      preoperative visualization of IPPNET in patients with AHH. Reliable visualization of diseased&#xD;
      beta cells would then benefit the optimization of treatment of patients with AHH. An&#xD;
      innovative method for imaging of beta cells could allow to optimally guide surgical&#xD;
      interventions In addition, this novel approach could lead to a minimization of side-effects&#xD;
      from the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeting of the GLP-1 receptor In this study we will compare the sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      of pre-operative imaging of IPPNET by GLP-1R scanning to the current standard imaging&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
