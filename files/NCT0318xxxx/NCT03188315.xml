  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a devastating disease, presenting an immense disease burden to affected individuals&#xD;
      and their families as well as health care systems with 10.9 million new cases and 6.7 million&#xD;
      deaths per year. Approximately 12% of human cancers worldwide are caused by oncoviruses&#xD;
      infection with more than 80% of cases occurring in the developing world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor viruses can be classified into two groups based on their genetic material;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. DNA tumor viruses:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Small DNA tumor viruses (Papilloma viruses, Polyoma viruses and adenoviruses).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Complex DNA tumor viruses (Herpes viruses and Hepatitis B viruses).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RNA tumor viruses ( Hepatitis C viruses and human T-cell leukemia virus &quot;HTLV&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are around 100 types of HPV, with different variations in their genetic and oncogenic&#xD;
      potential [5]. Thus, HPV genotypes are divided into 2 groups based on their vulnerability;&#xD;
      High risk HPV (HR-HPV) and low risk HPV (LR-HPV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HPV genome encodes several oncoproteins [5]. E6 and E7 are the main genes responsible for&#xD;
      cell transformation mediated by HR-HPV, and they modulate the activities of cellular proteins&#xD;
      that regulate the cell cycle. Thus, the presence of E6/E7 can be a specific marker for&#xD;
      diagnosing precancerous lesions by HPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge of the etiology of virus-mediated carcinogenesis, the networking of pathways&#xD;
      involved in the transition from infection to cancer and the risk factors associated with each&#xD;
      type of cancer, all suggest prophylactic and therapeutic strategies that may reduce the risk&#xD;
      of virus-mediated cancer.&#xD;

      Study subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age: 18 - 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Women who are positive for HPV diagnosed by routine screening. Women willing to&#xD;
                participate in the study and sign an informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age extremes (less than 18 years old or more than 65 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Immuno-comprised patients, patients under steroid therapy or chemotherapy, or&#xD;
                patients with serious medical illness that could affect their immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Unknown medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 1 (Cases): Patients known to have Cancer cervix with any degree of malignancy&#xD;
                (diagnosed by routine screening or any other diagnostic tests)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 2 (Controls): Women sharing the same inclusion and exclusion criteria, but&#xD;
                not known to have Cancer cervix&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim of The Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Studying the role of HPV as an example of small DNA viruses in cell transformation&#xD;
                and carcinogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Determining the most HPV genotypes associated with high risks of cancer cervix&#xD;
                occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Detection of the HPV oncogenes playing role cell transformation and malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Studying the role of viral DNA integration in cellular transformation and&#xD;
                carcinogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Study methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Samples collection and storing:&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Samples will be obtained from the cervix with the brush or swab\ by following the&#xD;
                instructions corresponding to the type of collecting device.&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Collection tubes will be stored at room temperature (15-30 °C).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Samples will be sent to the laboratory in less than 14 days following&#xD;
                     collection&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The tubes can be preserved for 2-3 weeks at room temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
                HPV detection:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  HPV cannot be propagated in tissue culture, and therefore, in most cases its&#xD;
                     accurate identification relies on molecular biology techniques, such as&#xD;
                     polymerase chain reaction (PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
                HPV Genotyping:&#xD;
&#xD;
                • PCR-RFLP shows good discriminatory power by differentiating between HR and LR HPV&#xD;
                genotypes, and it is possible to identify single or multiple infections .&#xD;
&#xD;
                • In this technique, the amplified DNA is digested by restriction enzymes,&#xD;
                resulting in DNA fragments of various lengths. Each fragment length is&#xD;
                characteristic of a certain HPV genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
                • The commonest restriction enzymes are BamHI, Dd6eI, HaeIII, HinfI, PstI and RsaI.&#xD;
&#xD;
                HPV Oncogenes and oncoproteins:&#xD;
&#xD;
                • The main techniques used to detect mRNA for E6/E7 oncogenes are two commercial&#xD;
                assays: PreTectW Proofer and APTIMAW HPV Assay. These techniques are based on&#xD;
                transcription-mediated amplification of full-length E6/E7 transcripts using PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Data will be analyzed by one-way analysis of variance using SPSS software version&#xD;
                24.0. Values will be expressed as mean ± S.D. For comparison between 2 groups,&#xD;
                Student's t test will be used to determine whether the cases was significantly&#xD;
                different from the control. Differences will be considered statistically&#xD;
                significant at P&lt;0.05, while P&lt;0.01 will represent more significant change.&#xD;
