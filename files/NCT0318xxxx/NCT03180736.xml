      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the addition of daratumumab to&#xD;
      pomalidomide and dexamethasone in terms of progression-free survival in subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase 3, randomized, open-label study comparing daratumumab,&#xD;
      pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (DaraPomDex) with pomalidomide and low-dose&#xD;
      dexamethasone (PomDex) in subjects with relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma who have&#xD;
      received at least 1 prior treatment regimen with both lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor&#xD;
      and have demonstrated disease progression. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive either DaraPomDex or PomDex. The original design of this study was to treat subjects&#xD;
      with daratumumab for intravenous (IV) infusion (Dara IV); however, as of Amendment 1, all new&#xD;
      subjects will be dosed subcutaneously with daratumumab co-formulated with recombinant human&#xD;
      hyaluronidase rHuPH20 (hereafter referred to as Dara SC). Subjects who already began&#xD;
      treatment with Dara IV (ie, prior to Amendment 1) will have the option to switch to Dara SC&#xD;
      on Day 1 of any cycle starting with Cycle 3 or later for the remainder of their participation&#xD;
      in the study, and they will be counted toward the total of 302 subjects. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Drug administration and&#xD;
      follow-up visits will occur more frequently for early cycles (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly).&#xD;
      Disease evaluations will occur every cycle and consist mainly of measurements of myeloma&#xD;
      proteins. Subject safety will be assessed throughout the study. The primary endpoint will be&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS). Study end is anticipated at approximately 5 years after the&#xD;
      last subject is randomized.&#xD;
