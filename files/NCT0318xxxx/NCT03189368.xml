  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given that the main function of the cardiovascular system is to provide sufficient blood&#xD;
      supply to tissues in order to ensure their normal and effective function, combined with the&#xD;
      most efficient possible use of energy produced by ATP degradation, there has been a keen&#xD;
      interest in elucidating the interplay between heart and vessels, critically affecting both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve these goals, it is thought that in healthy humans the cardiovascular&#xD;
      system as a unity operates at a unique combination of parameters (arterial elastance, heart&#xD;
      rate and left ventricular end systolic elastance) so as to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Maximize stroke work (SW) for a given left ventricular contractility. This is related to&#xD;
           the fact that adequate tissue perfusion is dependent both on stroke volume and on&#xD;
           pressure and in fluid dynamics W=∆P×∆V (thus maximizing SW leads to optimal perfusion),&#xD;
           OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Optimize energy efficiency of the heart, in terms of energy transferred to the arterial&#xD;
           bed to total mechanical energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventriculoarterial coupling (VAC) is a composite parameter, defined as the ratio of arterial&#xD;
      elastance (Ea) to end systolic left ventricular elastance (Ees). Thus: VAC=Ea/Ees . It is a&#xD;
      fundamental property of the cardiovascular system, integrating and assessing the interaction&#xD;
      of all individual parameters of the ventricle (pump) and the arterial tree (afterload).&#xD;
      Furthermore, VAC may assess both whether SW produced is maximal for a given contractility of&#xD;
      the left ventricle (condition for maximization: VAC=1) and whether mechanical efficiency of&#xD;
      the ventricle is optimal (optimization condition: VAC=0.5-0.7). Consequently, simultaneous&#xD;
      optimization is not possible, and the cardiovascular system operates either at maximal output&#xD;
      (as in healthy individuals at rest) or at optimal efficiency (healthy individuals at&#xD;
      exercise). Multi-site pacing (MSP) of the left ventricle is a recently introduced technique&#xD;
      with excellent studies' findings concerning echocardiographic parameters of ventricular&#xD;
      function. Recently, the MultiPoint Pacing (MPP) IDE study showed that a specific choice of&#xD;
      electrical dipole for the first left ventricular pulse and a close to simultaneous&#xD;
      application of the two left ventricular pulses achieves a very high percent of clinical&#xD;
      response (87%), with excellent patient safety. Subsequent studies confirmed these findings,&#xD;
      reporting even higher NYHA response rates (95% vs 78% for conventional cardiac&#xD;
      resynchronization therapy - CRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying rationale lies in the better approximation of the normal sequence of left&#xD;
      ventricular activation, through use of two, instead of a single, pulses. According to trial&#xD;
      results, one can achieve, compared to conventional CRT, improved coordination between left&#xD;
      ventricular segments, improved cardiac output and, possibly, tissue perfusion, and&#xD;
      potentially reduction of arrhythmia propensity (mechanism similar to that of CRT). Thus, it&#xD;
      would be interesting to study whether these can be independently confirmed by changes in VAC&#xD;
      values. In heart failure, VAC values increase considerably due to increases in Ea as a result&#xD;
      of the feedback loop regarding pressure (but not volume) maintenance. As a consequence, any&#xD;
      reduction would move them closed to both 1 and the 0.5-0.7 area, yielding improvement in both&#xD;
      SW maximization and efficiency optimization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are objective difficulties in achieving lege artis MSP (according to MPP-IDE&#xD;
      study standards) given that two prerequisites must be met: 1. Interpolar distance for the&#xD;
      first left ventricular pulse &gt;30mm (i.e. non-sequential poles used), 2. Nearly simultaneous&#xD;
      (Δt=5msec) left ventricular pulses and 3. Threshold of ≤3.5V@0.5msec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the first pulse should, ideally, be directed to the most delayed, compared to the&#xD;
      normal activation sequence, viable myocardial segment, a feat not always possible due to&#xD;
      electrode placing constraints. Obviously, presence of scar could alter the course and shape&#xD;
      of the activation front and thus diminish its effects (similar to issues already discussed in&#xD;
      the case of CRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform a comparative study of multi-site left ventricular pacing and cardiac&#xD;
      resynchronization therapy effects on ventriculoarterial coupling and energy efficiency of the&#xD;
      failing heart&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAC values are improved (shift closer to unity/0.5-0.7 area) and work/efficiency increase&#xD;
      with patients on MSP as compared to CRT pacing.&#xD;

    <description>Adult, consenting patients with any cardiomyopathy type and an existing I/IIa indication for a CRT-D device will receive a device with multi-site pacing capability. Initially, for 6 months, optimal, conventional, resynchronization therapy will be delivered. Following this, all patients will crossover to optimized multi-site pacing, and receive this therapy for 6 more months. Optimization of therapy will be determined based on maximization of cardiac output, i.e. maximization of left ventricular outflow tract velocity-time integral.&#xD;
Baseline measurements of serum creatinine and ventriculoarterial coupling will also be acquired.</description>

    <description>Instead of administering a single LV pulse at the most (electrically) delayed segment of the ventricle, multi-site pacing allows for a more detailed &quot;sculpting&quot; of the LV activation sequence. Based on the MPP-IDE study results, activation of the antero-lateral wall, or at least its most delayed segments, closely followed by a pulse to the apex and then by a right ventricular one will yield favorable results in terms of hemodynamics and clinical parameters.&#xD;
