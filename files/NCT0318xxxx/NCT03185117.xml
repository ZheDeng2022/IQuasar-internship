  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the Ohio State University, and across the country, surgical patients admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital are over-prescribed a significant amount of opioid medications upon discharge to&#xD;
      home. Recent studies reveal that a large percentage of patients prescribed opioid medications&#xD;
      after surgery have approximately half of the prescribed medication left over. This study aims&#xD;
      to evaluate reported opioid use after surgery in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery&#xD;
      in order to better approach the issue with current opioid use and abuse trends while still&#xD;
      providing adequate medical care and pain management to patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being discharged from the hospital, opioids are major source of pain relief for&#xD;
      patients. Previous studies show that 71% of patients prescribed opioid medications after&#xD;
      thoracic surgery admitted to taking half or less of their prescribed opioid medications. The&#xD;
      analysis showed a correlation between the amount of opioids consumed during the patient&#xD;
      hospitalization and after discharge. Goesling et al. surveyed patients with or without&#xD;
      previous history of opioid use who underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty (THA). Both groups were followed for 6 months to document the &quot;natural history&quot;&#xD;
      of opioid use postoperatively and post discharge. For patients with preoperative opioid use&#xD;
      undergoing TKA, 88.5% were shown to be using opioids after 1 month, 48.2% after 3 months and&#xD;
      53.5% after 6 months. For patients considered opioid naïve undergoing TKA, 66.5% were shown&#xD;
      to be using opioids after 1 month, 16.6% after 3 months and 8.2% after 6 months. For patients&#xD;
      with preoperative opioid use undergoing THA, 63.9% were shown to be using opioids after 1&#xD;
      month, 37.8% after 3 months and 34.7% after 6 months. For patients considered opioid naïve&#xD;
      undergoing THA, 22.5% were shown to be using opioids after 1 month, 4.4% after 3 months and&#xD;
      4.3% after 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is observational and involves consenting adult patients undergoing major&#xD;
      orthopedic surgery to pre-operative assessments including the Self Administered Gerocognitive&#xD;
      Exam (SAGE) questionnaire, a cognitive test to identify mild-moderate cognitive impairment,&#xD;
      and collection of demographic data and medical history. Phone call follow-ups include&#xD;
      assessments of post-discharge pain and opioid consumption, and completing verbally an adapted&#xD;
      Activities of Daily Living questionnaire. No additional risks have been identified by&#xD;
      participating in this study. Participants may not directly benefit from participating in this&#xD;
      trial, but the data collected could provide valuable insight into the discrepancy between&#xD;
      required opioid pain medications and opioid pain medication prescription for adequate pain&#xD;
      management. This insight could then be applied to reevaluate post-discharge pain management&#xD;
      procedures and standards of care, therefore curbing opioid use and abuse trends.&#xD;
