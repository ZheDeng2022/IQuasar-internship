      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increases in obesity, diabetes, and some metabolic disorders may be linked to how much&#xD;
      processed foods people eat. Researchers want to learn more about how processed foods affect&#xD;
      metabolic health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn about how a processed versus unprocessed diet affects the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men ages 18-50 with stable weight and risk factors for diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened over 3 visits. Screening includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart and blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatric questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about eating, sleeping, and economic status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Riding a stationary bike&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trying a sample meal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between screenings, participants will eat prepared meals. They will wear an accelerometer to&#xD;
      measure physical activity. They will write down what foods they eat and monitor their weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have two 4-week stays in the clinic. They will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eat a special diet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have activity and weight monitored&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drink water and collect urine samples to measure how many calories they are burning&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have resting energy expenditure measured with a clear hood over the head&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a scan to measure body fat and bone density using low-dose x-rays&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a scan on a table that slides into a metal cylinder in a strong magnetic field.&#xD;
           They will get earplugs for the loud noises.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have an ultrasound test to measure blood vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have insulin and glucose infused into an arm vein. Blood will be taken over 10 hours&#xD;
           through a plastic tube in the wrist. This will happen 4 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spend multiple 24-hour periods in a room that measures oxygen used and carbon dioxide&#xD;
           produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give blood, urine and stool samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answer questionnaires and do computer tasks&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nutrition science is beginning to place less emphasis on the nutrient composition of the diet&#xD;
      and more emphasis on its comprising foods. A particular public health concern involves the&#xD;
      consumption of foods that result from extensive industrial processing. Ultra-processed foods&#xD;
      have become increasingly common and now contribute the majority of calories consumed in&#xD;
      America. The rise in the prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome over&#xD;
      the past several decades is believed to have been caused, in part, by the parallel increase&#xD;
      in production, advertising, and consumption of ultra-processed foods. However, the metabolic&#xD;
      effects of industrial processing per se, independent of diet calories or macronutrient&#xD;
      composition, have not been carefully investigated in a controlled feeding study. Therefore,&#xD;
      we will conduct an inpatient controlled feeding study in 20 overweight and obese adult men to&#xD;
      investigate the changes in multi-organ insulin sensitivity and hepatic triglyceride content&#xD;
      resulting from consuming two test diets for a pair of 3 week periods. The test diets will be&#xD;
      implemented in a randomized, crossover design with each test diet following a 1 week run-in&#xD;
      period of inpatient controlled feeding of a standard metabolic diet. The test diets will be&#xD;
      matched for calories, macronutrient composition, sugar, fiber, and sodium, but one diet will&#xD;
      be composed of ultra-processed foods whereas the other diet will be unprocessed foods.&#xD;
      Multi-organ insulin sensitivity and hepatic triglyceride content will be measured at the end&#xD;
      of each 1 week run-in period as well as at the end of each 3 week test diet period.&#xD;
