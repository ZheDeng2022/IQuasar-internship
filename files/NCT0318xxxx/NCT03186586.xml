      Objectives: To assess if the administration of ulipristal acetate (UPA) in users of the&#xD;
      levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) with breakdown bleeding or abnormal&#xD;
      bleeding, could be able to inhibit the bleeding and if this effect will be sustainable up to&#xD;
      three months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: A total of 32 women aged between 18-45 years, users of the LNG-IUS with&#xD;
      breakdown bleeding, abnormal bleeding or prolonged bleeding (bleeding more than 14 days) or&#xD;
      episodes of bleeding with intervals less than 24 days). The study is an experimental, double&#xD;
      blind randomized (16 women will receive UPA 5 mg/day/5 days; 16 women will receive placebo/1&#xD;
      time/day/5 day). The women will invited to participated at the Family Planning clinic at the&#xD;
      day they consulted with the complaint of bleeding. That day they will allocated at random to&#xD;
      UPA or placebo group. They will oriented to fill out a bleeding calendar through 90 days&#xD;
      after the pill intake. In addition a ultrasonography scan will be perform before the first&#xD;
      day of pill intake and at 90 days after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: A a pilot study the sample was estimated in 26 women (13 at each group)&#xD;
      based at the estimative of success of 0.95 with UPA and 0.35 with placebo with significance&#xD;
      of 0.05 and power of 80%. The sociodemographic characteristics will be analyzed as mean and&#xD;
      SD and will compared through Mann-Whitney, Yates χ2 and Fisher exact tests as apropriate.&#xD;
      Also, a regression analysis (Poisson analysis) with the dependent significant variables. The&#xD;
      established level of significance will be p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;

      The LNG-IUS is a contraceptive method with high efficacy, long acting, reversible with&#xD;
      contraceptive failure between 0.1 and 0.5/100 women/year. It released 20 mcg/day of LNG with&#xD;
      a life span duration of 5 years. LNG is a synthetic progestin, 19-northestosterone, six times&#xD;
      more potent than progesterone, with androgenic properties and with binding with sexual&#xD;
      hormones, receptors of human steroids, including receptors of glucocorticoids and&#xD;
      mineralocorticoids, with minimal capacity of binding with estrogen receptors. At endometrium&#xD;
      level it induce antiproliferative effect and strong expression of local markers and&#xD;
      endometrial decidualization, including the prolactin receptor and insulin-like growth factor.&#xD;
      The mechanism of action includes effect upon cervical mucus which affects the sperm movements&#xD;
      through the reproductive tract which affects fertilization. In some women could be ovulation&#xD;
      inhibition. One of the main reason for discontinuation is breakdown bleeding, increase&#xD;
      bleeding or abnormal bleeding including heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and spotting which is&#xD;
      common at the first six month of use. Despite the fact that it is the main cause of&#xD;
      discontinuation, there is no effective treatment for these cases. An effective treatment&#xD;
      could help in the reduction of reduce the rates of discontinuation, improved the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness and quality of life of users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) is Ulipristal Acetate (UPA) is approved in&#xD;
      the European Union as Esmya® as a tretament to reduce the ueterine leiomyomas at te dose of 5&#xD;
      mg/day and it under evaluation at the dose of 5-10 mg as oral contraceptive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This could be an option of treatment for HMB or abnormal bleeding induced by the LNG-IUS. UPA&#xD;
      is agonist/antagonist and binding with progesterone to the receptor level. It has ovarian and&#xD;
      endometrial activity, with dose-dependent effect in inhibition of ovulation and maturation of&#xD;
      the endometrium. There are restricted evidences, that the administration of UPA induce a&#xD;
      quick endometrial atrophy and stop the abnormal bleeding.&#xD;
