  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dupuytren's disease is a very common condition, affecting 4% of the general UK and US&#xD;
      population. It causes the fingers to curl irreversibly into the palm and can be extremely&#xD;
      disabling. The disease usually starts as a small firm lump (nodule) in the palm, and in about&#xD;
      40% of patients advances to form cords that pull the fingers into the palm. There is no&#xD;
      approved treatment for the early stage of disease. Once patients have established&#xD;
      deformities, the diseased tissue can removed by surgery or cut using less invasive techniques&#xD;
      such as a needle or an enzyme. However, recovery following surgery usually takes several&#xD;
      months and recurrence rates with the less invasive techniques are high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have unravelled the cellular process that initiates and maintains the&#xD;
      disease progress and identified tumour necrosis factor (TNF) as a new target for treatment.&#xD;
      Based on these findings the investigators plan to test the effects of adalimumab, an anti-TNF&#xD;
      drug which currently approved for use in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other&#xD;
      inflammatory conditions. The aim of the study is to find out whether treatment by injection&#xD;
      with adalimumab directly into the diseased tissue will control the advance of early&#xD;
      Dupuytren's disease better than a placebo injection with normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will first carry out a small trial in up to 40 patients with established&#xD;
      disease to determine the best dose that reduces the activity of the cells responsible for the&#xD;
      disorder (Dose Response study). In this part patients who will be having surgery to remove&#xD;
      their diseased tissue will receive a single injection of adalimumab into the nodule in their&#xD;
      hand about 2 weeks before surgery. The tissue that is then removed during surgery will be&#xD;
      analysed in the investigator's laboratories to determine the effect of the drug on the&#xD;
      tissue. Patients will be followed for 12 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of the study the investigators will assess whether the optimal dose of the&#xD;
      drug prevents early disease advancing in 138 patients (Early Disease study). Patients who&#xD;
      take part in the second part of the study will receive a total of 4 injections of adalimumab&#xD;
      into the nodule in their hand at three monthly intervals. They will then be checked at 3 &amp; 9&#xD;
      months after the last injection. In additional to assessing the effect of the injections on&#xD;
      the nodule and hand function, information will also be collected to assess the cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of the treatment.&#xD;
