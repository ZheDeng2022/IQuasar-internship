  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vascular surgery is a highest risk procedure when considering postoperative complications&#xD;
      associated with the cardiovascular system. The leading clinical presentation is acute&#xD;
      hemodynamic decompensation. However, one of the possible pathomechanisms might be&#xD;
      repolarization disturbances. Many of perioperative risk factors of cardiac complications are&#xD;
      modifiable. The identification may help in the global perioperative risk reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of the study was an identification of the factors which may release clinically&#xD;
      overt repolarization disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study group consisted of 100 patients, diagnosed with abdominal subrenal aortic&#xD;
      aneurysms or peripheral arterial disease scheduled for an elective &quot;open&quot; vascular surgery&#xD;
      procedure. The authors investigated whether age, gender, comorbidities or some perioperative&#xD;
      factors (including hemodynamic, metabolic or genetic) were related to the occurrence of&#xD;
      clinically concealed repolarization disturbances or clinically disclosed cardiac&#xD;
      complications in postoperative time up to 30 day and one year after vascular surgery&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vascular surgery is thought as the highest risk procedure in the context of cardiac&#xD;
      complications. The range may include acute coronary syndrome, acute circulatory failure,&#xD;
      severe arrhythmias, syncope and sudden cardiac death. The patient population is considered as&#xD;
      a high risk, too. Popular calculators used for risk stratifications are based on preoperative&#xD;
      patient's history and some general laboratory results. However, general status of the patient&#xD;
      changes dynamically during vascular procedures leading to acquired increased risk. For this&#xD;
      reason, sole preoperative risk prediction based on standard calculators is unsuitable and&#xD;
      suboptimal. Advanced monitoring systems may record some temporary disturbances (e.g.&#xD;
      ventricular repolarization disturbances), which may be asymptomatic. The clinical&#xD;
      significance in postoperative risk prediction of such observations remains undefined. On the&#xD;
      other hand, many of perioperative cardiac complications are caused by modifiable factors. The&#xD;
      identification may help in the global perioperative risk reduction.&#xD;

      Metabolic monitoring consisted of electrolytes and arterial blood gas analysis prior to&#xD;
      anesthesia induction and at the end of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood was drawn into anticoagulant for genetic studies. Genomic DNA was isolated from&#xD;
