      In order to evaluate the difference in beta cell mass in women with and without a history of&#xD;
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), investigators aim to compare quantitative PET imaging of&#xD;
      the pancreas between these groups. Investigators propose to measure uptake of&#xD;
      68Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 in the pancreatic beta cells of these women as a measure for beta cell&#xD;
      mass. Furthermore, investigators aim to compare uptake of the radiolabeled tracer to beta&#xD;
      cell function measured by laboratory parameters. These highly relevant data within this&#xD;
      at-risk population for type 2 diabetes (T2D) will provide the investigators with more&#xD;
      information on the role of beta cell mass in the predisposition for development of T2D&#xD;
      leading to better knowledge on the pathophysiology of this disease. This could be of great&#xD;
      interest for development of new treatment options.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes Insulin is produced by pancreatic beta cells and is needed for optimal&#xD;
      glucose homeostasis. In healthy individuals, the mass and function of beta cells changes to&#xD;
      adapt to variations in insulin demand in the body. For example, adaptive beta cell&#xD;
      hyperplasia, hypertrophy and hyperfunction occur in situations of increased metabolic demand,&#xD;
      like pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In rodents a 2-3 fold increase in beta cell mass is observed at the end of gestation. By the&#xD;
      time of delivery, beta cell function as well as beta cell mass return to normal levels.&#xD;
      Although to a lesser extent than in rodents, also in humans there have been studies&#xD;
      indicating that the beta cell mass may increase during pregnancy and return to normal in the&#xD;
      postpartum stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When there is no sufficient compensation during pregnancy due to failure in beta cell&#xD;
      expansion or function, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GDM complicates 2-5% of pregnancies in Caucasian women and is characterized by glucose&#xD;
      intolerance with the onset or first diagnosis during pregnancy. GDM can have serious&#xD;
      consequences for both the child as well as the mother. Risks to the child include fetal&#xD;
      macrosomia as well as long-term health consequences like obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia,&#xD;
      glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Maternal risks include an increased&#xD;
      probability of caesarean delivery accompanied by an increased risk of maternal morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In women with GDM, glucose homeostasis is returned to normal levels shortly after delivery.&#xD;
      However, women with a single gestational diabetes pregnancy present with faster deterioration&#xD;
      in insulin sensitivity and beta cell compensation compared to women without a history of&#xD;
      gestational diabetes. These women therefore have a 7-fold increased risk of developing T2D in&#xD;
      the future. Furthermore, women with a history of GDM have a 10-fold increased risk of&#xD;
      developing GDM in future pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GDM and T2D The prevalence of T2D in the Netherlands is 600.000-800.000 and each year ~70.000&#xD;
      new patients are diagnosed. Patients with T2D have a 2-4 times increased risk of developing&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. These complications seriously decrease the quality of life and life&#xD;
      expectancy of T2D patients. The burden of this disease not only affects these patients but&#xD;
      our society as well. Health care costs with respect to diabetes amounted to 814 million euro&#xD;
      in 2005 in the Netherlands and indirect costs because of absence of work are unknown but&#xD;
      thought to be substantial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2D is mainly characterized by defective insulin secretion and peripheral insulin resistance.&#xD;
      It develops chronically over years to decades before it becomes apparent. Early in the&#xD;
      disease progression, pancreatic beta cells respond to initial insulin resistance by&#xD;
      increasing insulin secretion to preserve a near-normal glucose level. Over time the beta cell&#xD;
      mass reduces gradually, leading to a decline in insulin secretion causing hyperglycemia. Beta&#xD;
      cell failure is dependent on several factors like genetic predisposition, poor dietary&#xD;
      control, glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity, liver steatosis and therapy itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the process of development of disease many secondary changes in metabolism, hormonal&#xD;
      signaling and body composition occur which are difficult to discriminate from those that&#xD;
      initially started the pathophysiological process. Therefore, the early pathogenesis of T2D is&#xD;
      still not completely understood. Risk factors for the development of T2D overlap with the&#xD;
      risk factors for GDM. These common risk factors suggest an overlapping cause of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with GDM glucose homeostasis cannot be maintained under conditions of increased&#xD;
      metabolic demand. This fact, together with the increased risk of developing T2D in the future&#xD;
      suggests a specific predisposition for beta cell dysfunction in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beta cell mass in T2D Besides the well-known role of peripheral insulin resistance in the&#xD;
      early pathogenesis of T2D, there is also evidence suggesting the importance of beta cell&#xD;
      mass. Studies performed on autopsy material of T2D patients in various populations show a&#xD;
      significantly reduced beta cell mass. This reduction could be explained by accelerated beta&#xD;
      cell death in these patients. A genetic difference in beta cell mass could however also play&#xD;
      a role. Large variations in fractional beta cell area have been shown between individuals in&#xD;
      the pre- and postnatal growth period. Furthermore, a recent study by Brom et al. suggests&#xD;
      that there is a large variation in beta cell mass between individuals. In this study beta&#xD;
      cell mass was measured non-invasively in healthy subjects as well as type 1 diabetic patients&#xD;
      by 111In-exendin-4 SPECT/CT. While the beta cell mass in these diabetic patients was found to&#xD;
      be significantly lower than in healthy subjects, a wide range in beta cell mass was found in&#xD;
      both groups. These results are in line with an earlier study where wide ranges in beta cell&#xD;
      mass were found in pancreas obtained at autopsy of diabetic and non-diabetic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial deficit in beta cell mass could thus play a key role in the development of T2D.&#xD;
      Patients with a history of GDM have a significantly increased risk of developing T2D. While&#xD;
      an increase in beta cell mass has been found in healthy women during pregnancy, it is not yet&#xD;
      known whether patients with GDM have a deficit in beta cell mass. While little is known about&#xD;
      beta cell mass in women with a history of GDM, it is well recognized that these women have a&#xD;
      chronic defect in beta cell function that progressively worsens in the years after the&#xD;
      pregnancy and mediates their high risk of progression to T2D. This deterioration of beta cell&#xD;
      function begins as early as the first year after delivery, is partly driven by hepatic&#xD;
      insulin resistance, takes place in the presence of initial normal glucose tolerance, and&#xD;
      precedes the development of abnormal glucose tolerance. Accordingly, women with a recent&#xD;
      history of GDM represent a patient population in which there is beta cell dysfunction without&#xD;
      the potential confounding effect of hyperglycemia (and resultant glucotoxicity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of beta cell mass in women with a history of GDM could thus be very beneficial for&#xD;
      our understanding of the role of beta cell mass in the development of T2D. It would be of&#xD;
      great interest to examine whether the population of women with a history of gestational&#xD;
      diabetes, who have a significantly increased risk of developing T2D, have a lower mean beta&#xD;
      cell mass compared to the population of women without a history of gestational diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also for the development of new treatment options for T2D, more knowledge on the role of beta&#xD;
      cell loss in the development of T2D would be beneficial. While current and new anti-diabetic&#xD;
      drugs are mainly targeting insulin secretion and action or glucose uptake, evidence from&#xD;
      animal experiments suggests the feasibility of regulating beta cell mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging of beta cells in vivo Reliable, sensitive and specific visualization of living&#xD;
      pancreatic beta cells in vivo is important to broaden the understanding of the role of beta&#xD;
      cell mass in the onset and development of T2D. This could benefit further research in the&#xD;
      causes of beta cell failure in T2D and therapeutic options to delay progressive loss of beta&#xD;
      cells. Because of the multifactorial nature of T2D disease, defining a study population for&#xD;
      assessment of beta cell mass is difficult. Patients with a history of GDM would be a very&#xD;
      attractive population to study in this context as an at-risk cohort for T2D. These patients&#xD;
      have a clear predisposition for development of T2D evidenced by their increased risk for&#xD;
      developing this disease and the faster deterioration of insulin sensitivity and beta cell&#xD;
      compensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLP-1 receptor imaging by PET For specific non-invasive imaging of beta cells, investigators&#xD;
      have developed a highly beta cell-specific radiolabeled exendin-based GLP-1 (glucagon-like&#xD;
      peptide-1) analog which, after radiolabeling, can non-invasively be detected in the human&#xD;
      body. GLP-1 is an incretin hormone that specifically binds to beta cells and is responsible&#xD;
      for post-prandial insulin-secretion. Its specificity for beta cells has been shown and a&#xD;
      linear correlation of the beta cell mass and the signal obtained with this tracer has been&#xD;
      established in rats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLP-1R imaging has been shown to be suitable for imaging of insulin producing pancreatic&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumours (IPPNET). Furthermore, the feasibility of visualization of&#xD;
      transplanted beta cells with GLP-1R imaging has been shown by imaging of autologous islets&#xD;
      transplanted into muscle.&#xD;
