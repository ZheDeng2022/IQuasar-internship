      Prospective, global, multicenter study to assess cup position in THA. After written informed&#xD;
      consent has been obtained, study evaluations will be collected from the pre-op clinic visit,&#xD;
      the operative visit (including discharge), and 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively.&#xD;

      This is a global, prospective, multi-center study with a planned analysis of a minimum of 176&#xD;
      Subjects. Up to 15 study sites will participate in this study. The primary and secondary&#xD;
      endpoints are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is acetabular cup position success at 6 weeks postoperatively. Success&#xD;
      is defined as cup inclination and version within 10 degrees of the plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inclination success (as defined for the primary endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Version success (as defined for the primary endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 90-day complication rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Change from preoperative baseline for the Harris Hip Score&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Radiographic Outcomes (based upon: AP Hip, AP Pelvis, and Modified Lauenstein Lateral)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Change from preoperative baseline for the EQ-5D-5L (health state, EQ-VAS, and index&#xD;
           value, if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Change from 6 week baseline for the Forgotten Joint Score&#xD;
