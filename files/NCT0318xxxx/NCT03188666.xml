  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a three period study design consisting of a 6-month, randomized, double-blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled treatment (period 1) followed by a 6-month, open-label treatment (period&#xD;
      2) and a follow-up treatment period (period 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary safety objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of REGN2477 in&#xD;
      male and female patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy objective of the study is to assess the effect of REGN2477 versus placebo on&#xD;
      the change from baseline in heterotopic ossification (HO) in patients with FOP, as determined&#xD;
      by 18-NaF uptake in HO lesions by positron emission tomography (PET) and in total volume of&#xD;
      HO lesions by computed tomography (CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effect of REGN2477 versus placebo on pain due to FOP, as measured by the&#xD;
           area under the curve (AUC) for pain based on daily pain numeric rating scale (NRS)&#xD;
           scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of REGN2477 versus placebo on the change from baseline in HO, as&#xD;
           determined by the number of new HO lesions identified by 18F-NaF PET or by CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of REGN2477 versus placebo on the change from baseline in 18F-NaF&#xD;
           standardized uptake value maximum (SUVmax) of individual active HO site(s) by PET&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of REGN2477, between week 28 and week 56, on the number, activity,&#xD;
           and volume of HO lesions identified by 18F-NaF PET or by CT in patients who switch from&#xD;
           placebo to REGN2477 at week 28 versus the same patients between baseline and week 28&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of REGN2477 versus placebo on the change from baseline in&#xD;
           biochemical markers of bone formation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the concentrations of total activin A at baseline and over time&#xD;
           following the first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the concentration-time profile (pharmacokinetics [PK]) of REGN2477 in&#xD;
           patients with FOP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immunogenicity of REGN2477&#xD;
