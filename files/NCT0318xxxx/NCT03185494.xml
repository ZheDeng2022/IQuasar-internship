      RATIONALE: Placing a tumor antigen chimeric receptor that has been created in the laboratory&#xD;
      into patient autologous or donor-derived T cells may make the body build immune response to&#xD;
      kill cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy in&#xD;
      treating patients with B-cell leukemia or lymphoma that is relapsed (after stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation or intensive chemotherapy) or refractory to chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced&#xD;
      with the anti-CD19/CD22 vector (referred to as tanCART-19/22 cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of tanCART-19/22 cells. RT-PCR (reverse&#xD;
      transcription polymerase chain reaction) analysis of whole blood will be used to detect and&#xD;
      quantify survival of tanCART-19/22TCR (T-cell receptor) zeta:CD137 and TCR zeta cells over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to tanCART-19/22&#xD;
      cell infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. CD137 transgene is measured by the relative engraftment levels of tanCART-19/22 CD137 and&#xD;
      TCR zeta cells over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Estimate relative trafficking of tanCART-19/22 cells to tumor in bone marrow and lymph&#xD;
      nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. For patients with stored or accessible tumor cells (such as patients with active chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia(CLL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), etc) determine tumor cell&#xD;
      killing by tanCART-19/22 cells in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD19/22,&#xD;
      and assess correlation with loss of detectable tanCART-19/20 (loss of engraftment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Determine the relative subsets of tanCART-19/22 T cells (Tcm, Tem, and Treg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 group according to order of enrollment. Patients receive&#xD;
      anti-CD19/22-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling domains)vector-transduced&#xD;
      autologous T cells on days 0,1, and 2 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 13 years.&#xD;
