          <description>GFR is a measure of the rate at which blood is filtered by the kidney. Cockcroft-Gault is an equation (calculation) used to estimate GFR based on serum creatinine, weight, and gender. eGFRcg = (140 - age in years) * (body weight in kg) * (0.85 if female) divided by 72 * serum creatinine in mg/dL.</description>

        <description>GFR is a measure of the rate at which blood is filtered by the kidney. Cockcroft-Gault is an equation (calculation) used to estimate GFR based on serum creatinine, weight, and gender. eGFRcg = (140 - age in years) x (body weight in kg) x (0.85 if female) divided by 72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL.&#xD;
Moderate renal impairment= 30 mL/min ≤ eGFRCG ≤ 59 mL/min Severe renal impairment= 15 mL/min ≤ eGFRCG &lt; 30 mL/min Change from baseline was calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the value at Baseline.</description>

          <description>GFR is a measure of the rate at which blood is filtered by the kidney. Cockcroft-Gault is an equation (calculation) used to estimate GFR based on serum creatinine, weight, and gender. eGFRcg = (140 - age in years) x (body weight in kg) x (0.85 if female) divided by 72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL.&#xD;
Moderate renal impairment= 30 mL/min ≤ eGFRCG ≤ 59 mL/min Severe renal impairment= 15 mL/min ≤ eGFRCG &lt; 30 mL/min Change from baseline was calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the value at Baseline.</description>

Central laboratory ULN for ALT were as follows: ≤ 43 U/L for males aged 18 to &lt; 69 years and ≤ 35 U/L for males aged ≥ 69 years; ≤ 34 U/L for females aged 18 to &lt; 69 years and ≤ 32 U/L for females aged ≥ 69 years. The ULN for ALT using the 2018 AASLD normal range was 25 U/L for females and 35 U/L for males. The M = F approach was used for this analysis.</description>
