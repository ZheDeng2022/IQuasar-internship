      Background:The lack of physical activity and increasing time spent in sedentary behaviours&#xD;
      during childhood place importance on developing low cost,easy-to-implement school-based&#xD;
      interventions to increase physical activity among children. The PREVIENE Project will&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of five innovative, simple, and feasible interventions(active&#xD;
      commuting to school, Physical Education lessons, active school recess physical activity,&#xD;
      sleep health promotion, and an integrated program incorporating all 4 interventions) to&#xD;
      improve physical activity, fitness, anthropometry, sleep health, academic achievement,and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life in primary school children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:A total of 350 children (grade 3; 8-9 years of age) from six schools in Granada&#xD;
      (Spain) will be enrolled in one of the 8-week interventions (one intervention per school; 50&#xD;
      children per school) or a control group (no intervention school; 50 children). Outcomes will&#xD;
      include physical activity (measured by accelerometry), physical fitness (assessed using the&#xD;
      ALPHA fitness battery), anthropometry (height, weight and waist circumference), sleep health&#xD;
      (measured by accelerometers, a sleep diary, and sleep health questionnaires), academic&#xD;
      achievement (grades from the official school's records), and health-related quality of life&#xD;
      (child and parental questionnaires).To assess the effectiveness of the different&#xD;
      interventions on objectively measured PA and the other outcomes, the generalized linear model&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The PREVIENE Project will provide the information about the effectiveness and&#xD;
      implementation of different school-based interventions for physical activity promotion in&#xD;
      primary schoolchildren.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of physical activity and increasing time spent in sedentary behaviours during&#xD;
      childhood place importance on developing low cost,easy-to-implement school-based&#xD;
      interventions to increase physical activity among children. The PREVIENE Project will&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of five innovative, simple, and feasible interventions (active&#xD;
      commuting to school, Physical Education lessons, active school recess physical activity,&#xD;
      sleep health promotion, and an integrated program incorporating all 4 interventions) to&#xD;
      improve physical activity, fitness, anthropometry, sleep health, academic achievement,and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life in primary school children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PREVIENE Project uses a quasi-experimental approach with a convenience sample size of 300&#xD;
      children (grade 3, 8-9 years old) from six primary schools in Granada (Spain) (2 classes per&#xD;
      school x 6 schools = 12classesin total). With the average class size of 25 children and the&#xD;
      expected recruitment rate is 90%, two classes will be selected in each participating school.&#xD;
      All 79 primary schools in Granada will be invited to participate in this study. The schools&#xD;
      will initially be contacted by email followed by a phone call. Research team will arrange a&#xD;
      meeting with the interested schools and their staff (principal, physical education teacher&#xD;
      and other relevant teachers). At this meeting, the researchers will explain the main&#xD;
      objective of this study and the inclusion criteria for schools' participation: 1) At least 2&#xD;
      classes of grade 3 children at school, 2) the average class size has to be 25 or more&#xD;
      children. Once determined the schools that satisfy the inclusion criteria and express their&#xD;
      willingness to participate, a total of six schools will be randomly selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Regional Ministry of Education will endorse the participation of each selected school in&#xD;
      the study. At the beginning of the study, families of all children in the selected classes&#xD;
      will receive an invitation to an initial meeting at school to receive information about the&#xD;
      study. Both children and parents will be encouraged to participate in the study. Parents will&#xD;
      sign an informed consent which include the participation of them and their child. The study&#xD;
      protocol has been approved by the University of Granada Human Research EthicsCommittee&#xD;
      (Reference: 57/CEIH/2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five schools will be randomly assigned to an intervention schools, four of them will apply a&#xD;
      single intervention (n=50 children per intervention/school) and one school will implement the&#xD;
      integrated program (all four interventions simultaneously;n=50 children).The sixth school&#xD;
      will serve as a control school and will not receive any intervention (n=50 children). In&#xD;
      schools assigned to the active PE lesson and integrated intervention, standard PE lessons&#xD;
      will be replaced for the Active Didactics Unit. In all other schools, children will be&#xD;
      exposed to the usual PE session's structure according to the National Education Program in&#xD;
      Spain (i.e. 45 min sessions twice per week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active commuting to/from school&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention will include a range of school-, family- and community-based activities.&#xD;
      These activities will be focused on children and their families following the ecological&#xD;
      model proposed by Sallis et al., targeting mainly individual factors such as children's&#xD;
      perceptions (safety perception on the way to school) and attitudes (independence or&#xD;
      motivation to walk). A total of six 1-hour activities will be conducted at the classroom and&#xD;
      two activities in the school neighborhood designed based on previous literature. Taken&#xD;
      together, these activities will emphasize the benefits of active commuting to/from school and&#xD;
      promote active commuting to/from school using phrases such as &quot;If you rides a bike for 1.200&#xD;
      km, the medium number of disease days will be reduced by one&quot; for families.Moreover,&#xD;
      supporting information will be sent to families on four occasions during the intervention to&#xD;
      encourage families to use active modes of commuting to/from school. The supporting&#xD;
      information will consist of sending messages by whatsapp and advices (text and images)&#xD;
      explaining the most important ideas related active commuting and benefits of active commuting&#xD;
      on academic achievements and children´s mental and physical health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, throughout the intervention period, the teacher will ask children their mode of&#xD;
      transport to school of that day twice a week by raising their hand and encourage possible&#xD;
      changes in mode of commuting as motivational strategy by using positive reinforcement (as&#xD;
      reinforce when some children accompanied each other in the way to school). The objective of&#xD;
      this reinforcement is to remind children to active commute to and from school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active PE lessons&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention has been developed by the Spanish Ministry of Health, Social Services and&#xD;
      Equality and the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport to increase the amount of&#xD;
      children's PA during PE lessons in primary schools. At the time of this study, any school in&#xD;
      Spain could choose to adopt this programme. This intervention includes two sets of eight&#xD;
      active PE lessons specifically developed for third grade of primary school. These lessons&#xD;
      will replace the original PE lessons in schools assigned to Active PE lesson intervention and&#xD;
      integrated intervention. Additionally, this intervention provides some methodological advices&#xD;
      to increase the PA time during the PE lesson (i.e. different ways to take attendance or&#xD;
      deciding on the most suitable activity given the availability of resources).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active school recess&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention has been designed based on previous research. The teacher will prepare the&#xD;
      school playground offering adequate space and games to encourage children to be active. A&#xD;
      sheet placed on the wall as a reminder will help teacher to remind children to participate&#xD;
      and motivate them. On this sheet, each child will write the activity completed during the&#xD;
      school recess every day during the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep health promotion&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention will aim to raise the awareness of the importance of having a good quality&#xD;
      sleep at night and to teach healthy sleep behaviours that will contribute to improving sleep&#xD;
      hygiene. As a part of this intervention, eight activities will be carried out at home and at&#xD;
      school. During the first activity, parents and children will attend a general talk about&#xD;
      sleep and health and will sign a contract for a &quot;healthy sleep at home&quot;. Signing &quot;the&#xD;
      contract&quot; will enable participants to have an active role in the sleep intervention. Also,&#xD;
      with help of their parents at home, children will complete a diary in which they will keep a&#xD;
      record of their activities prior to going to bed and after waking up in the morning. The&#xD;
      objective of this activity is to strengthen the importance of a routine before going to sleep&#xD;
      and its benefits on the adequate sleep behaviour. Parents will be given a manual to help&#xD;
      children use an adequate sleep routine and reinforce children's achievements. At school,&#xD;
      several teachers assisted by the researchers will implement the activities. The first&#xD;
      classroom-based activity will be based on the educational program &quot;I have a dream&quot; (Spanish&#xD;
      adaptation of the SimplyHealthy@Schools International Program; Philips Ibérica, S.A., Madrid,&#xD;
      Spain). The remaining classroom-based activities will include with a group art project with&#xD;
      questions and answers about sleep, children's calculation of their own sleep parameters from&#xD;
      the sleep log data, and discussion groups about the sleep diary completed at home and other&#xD;
      sleep issues, as well as strategies to achieve the commitments included in the &quot;signed&#xD;
      contract&quot;. In addition, the class teacher will introduce the concept of relaxation and its&#xD;
      benefits at bedtime and will teach an abbreviated version of the Jacobson's progressive&#xD;
      relaxation technique every morning after the recess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      School global intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, a simultaneous implementation of all four interventions (see the others arms) will be&#xD;
      examined in one of the intervention schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic characteristics will be analysed using descriptive statistics. Data will be&#xD;
      presented using the mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range, where&#xD;
      appropriate for continuous variables, and frequency and percentage for categorical variables.&#xD;
      To assess the effectiveness of the different interventions on objectively measured PA and the&#xD;
      other outcomes, the generalized linear model will be used with the outcome measures as&#xD;
      dependent variables in separate models, the intervention as an independent variable and&#xD;
      controlling for potential confounders (such as gender, body mass index, socioeconomic status,&#xD;
      and baseline PA). Statistical significance will be set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;

Also, children will complete a diary in which they will keep a record of their activities prior to going to bed and after waking up in the morning. At school, the first classroom-based activity will be based on the educational program &quot;I have a dream&quot; (Spanish adaptation of the SimplyHealthy@Schools International Program). The remaining classroom-based activities will include with a group art project with questions and answers about sleep, discussion groups about the sleep diary completed at home, and an abbreviated version of the Jacobson's progressive relaxation technique.</description>
