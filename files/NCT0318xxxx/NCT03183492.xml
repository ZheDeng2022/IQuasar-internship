  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the persistence, immunogenicity and safety of Havrix® (hepatitis A&#xD;
      vaccine) in adults primed in infancy. The enrolled subjects will be assessed for circulating&#xD;
      antibodies against hepatitis A and will also receive a challenge dose of Havrix Adult&#xD;
      vaccine. In the present study, the anamnestic response will be assessed 30 days after the&#xD;
      challenge dose.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    Sponsor cancelled the study as real life impact data has already shown the value of HepA&#xD;
    vaccination &amp; as no critical need to gather additional data in Israel.&#xD;

The AEs will be categorized depending on their intensity into the following grades:&#xD;
(mild) = An AE which is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.&#xD;
(moderate) = An AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.&#xD;
(severe) = An AE which prevents normal, everyday activities.</description>
