  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is easy to chronic and can progress to cirrhosis and liver&#xD;
      cancer. Direct-acting antiviral treatment can significantly improve the prognosis of the&#xD;
      disease and the efficacy is seemingly not affected by a variety of viral factors. In&#xD;
      addition, direct-acting antiviral agents therapy may affect the transformation of the immune&#xD;
      cells and ameliorate the host immune status consequently. This study mainly investigated the&#xD;
      relationship between Direct Acting Antiviral Treatment effect and the functional activity of&#xD;
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and natural killer cells (NK cells) in Chronic&#xD;
      Hepatitis C.&#xD;

      32 treatment-naive CHC patients and 20 healthy controls were recruited. Patients were&#xD;
      examined before DAAs therapy (0w) and at weeks 4 (4w) and weeks 12 (12w) and weeks24 (24w) of&#xD;
      the therapy. The percent age of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and NK cells of the&#xD;
      peripheral blood were analyzed by flow cytometry. The investigators discuss the relationship&#xD;
      between direct acting antiviral treatment effect and myeloid-derived suppressor cells and NK&#xD;
      cells activity in chronic hepatitis C.&#xD;
