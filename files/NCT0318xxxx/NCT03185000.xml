    <textblock>
      Crohn's Disease (CD) is a condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system or gut.&#xD;
      Crohn's can affect any part of the gut, though the most common area affected is the end of&#xD;
      the ileum (the last part of the small intestine), or the colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crohn's is a chronic condition. This means that it is ongoing and life-long, although&#xD;
      patients may have periods of good health (remission), as well as times when symptoms are more&#xD;
      active (relapses or flare-ups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current available therapies frequently fail to maintain long-term remission and may be&#xD;
      complicated by significant side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an unmet medical need for novel therapies. Cellular therapies are emerging as&#xD;
      potentially attractive therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TRIBUTE trial will use autologous regulatory T cells (Tregs) expanded in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped that the administration of this treatment to patients with active CD will change&#xD;
      the immune responses in the gut and reduce bowel wall inflammation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TRIBUTE trial is looking at a new type of treatment for Crohn's Disease (CD), called&#xD;
      regulatory T-cells (Tregs) immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulatory T-cells are naturally produced by the immune system. These cells have a powerful&#xD;
      immunosuppressive action; they prevent auto-immune diseases by suppressing the over-active&#xD;
      response that the immune system mounts against the body in these diseases. In addition it is&#xD;
      thought that in patients with active CD, other immune cells in the gut are resistant to the&#xD;
      normal controlling action of Tregs. Finally, we have found that Tregs that are isolated from&#xD;
      patients and then are grown in the laboratory are more suppressive than Tregs freshly&#xD;
      isolated from patients' blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treg immunotherapy, TR004, will be unique to each patient. White blood cells will be&#xD;
      extracted from their blood via leukapheresis. These cells will form the starting material to&#xD;
      manufacture TR004 by expansion in a GMP accredited laboratory following a validated&#xD;
      manufacturing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will take between 20 and 45 days to produce enough cells for the immunotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial aims to recruit a total of 24 patients diagnosed with moderate to severe CD. Men&#xD;
      and women aged over 18 years who did not tolerate or did not respond to at least 2 standard&#xD;
      treatments for the condition will be eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIBUTE is a double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover, First Into Human clinical trial of&#xD;
      a single dose of TR004, with an adaptive Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) dose finding&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stage 1 of the study, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined from an initial&#xD;
      cohort of 16 patients. In the second stage, 8 further patients will be added to allow a&#xD;
      minimum effective dose (MED) to be determined from all patients. Patients will be block&#xD;
      randomised in a two-period crossover design to the order in which they receive both TR004 and&#xD;
      placebo. In each successive pair of subjects, one will first receive TR004 and the other will&#xD;
      first receive placebo at the same dose as each other and in each period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 3 dose levels for TR004: 0.5 - 1.0 million TR004/kg, 3.0 - 5.0 million TR004/kg&#xD;
      and 8.0 - 10.0 million TR004/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first pair on the trial will be dosed at 0.5 - 1.0 million TR004/kg. Dose levels for&#xD;
      subsequent pairs will be allocated by the CRM algorithm program. DSMB members will oversee&#xD;
      the decision making process and make the final decision on the next dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be involved in the study for up to 14 months, from screening to safety&#xD;
      follow-up at Week 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will receive two infusions eight weeks apart, one at Week 0 and one at&#xD;
      Week 8. One infusion will be the TR004 infusion, the other one will be a placebo infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a number of blood tests over the course of the trial. This will allow the&#xD;
      doctors to monitor how safe TR004 is and how the body reacts to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other tests, including vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate and temperature, stool&#xD;
      testing, and colonoscopy/biopsy will also be performed for this purpose and participants will&#xD;
      have regular check-ups by the trial team. Scans such as CT scans, MRI scans or ultrasounds&#xD;
      may be performed prior to starting the trial and participants will fill out questionnaires&#xD;
      and diaries to monitor their progress over the course of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no known benefits to the participants in taking part in the study. While&#xD;
      it is hoped that the treatment will reduce bowel inflammation, this may not happen.&#xD;
      Participants may not directly benefit from taking part in this study but the information&#xD;
      gained from their participation may help to improve the treatments available to other people&#xD;
      with Crohn's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the blood tests participants may experience discomfort and there is a risk of bleeding&#xD;
      and bruising around the puncture site but this is very rarely serious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During leukapheresis and on infusion days cannulas will be inserted in participant's veins.&#xD;
      The cannula insertion may cause pain, bruising, or, on rare occasions, infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some people find the leukapheresis uncomfortable due to having to stay in the same position&#xD;
      for 2-3 hours. Blood calcium level may fall during the procedure and this can cause numbness&#xD;
      and tingling in hands and feet and around the mouth. Patients can also feel cold, dizzy or&#xD;
      sick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A colonoscopy poses few risks. Rarely, complications of a colonoscopy may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reaction to the sedative used during the test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding from the site where the tissue sample (biopsy) is taken&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A tear in the colon or rectum wall (perforation). The risk of this is less than 1 in&#xD;
           1,000&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first time this particular expanded Tregs treatment will be tested in human so&#xD;
      there may be potential unknown risks that could be serious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated risks of Treg administration are similar to those of a blood transfusion. The&#xD;
      potential risks are likely to be lower because the cells infused will be the patient's own&#xD;
      cells rather than cells from a blood donor. Common transfusion symptoms include a red, itchy&#xD;
      skin rash, swelling of the hands, arms, feet, ankles and legs, dizziness and headaches. Less&#xD;
      common symptoms include high temperature, chills and shivering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TRIBUTE study will be set-up and run at Guy's and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London.&#xD;
      It will be the only UK centre recruiting participants into the study although patients may be&#xD;
      referred from other hospitals in order to take part in the trial.&#xD;
