      The study is a blinded cross over test of in-home air filtration. Participants will have a&#xD;
      window unit air filter (HEPA) installed that will filter for 3 weeks and do sham filtration&#xD;
      for another 3 weeks. During the time that the filter is installed in the home a machine that&#xD;
      measures particulate air pollution of the type that the filter is designed to remove will be&#xD;
      installed. A survey will be administered, blood samples taken and blood pressure measured&#xD;
      immediately prior to starting the filter, at 3 weeks when the filtration is changed from sham&#xD;
      to real filtration or visa versa and at the end of the second three week period. All&#xD;
      participants will be recruited from the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study cohort.&#xD;

      Project 4 Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Aims and Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: That in-home active HEPA filtration will reduce ultrafine particle (UFP) levels &gt;70%&#xD;
      compared to sham filtration. Further, that HEPA filtration will reduce all size classes of&#xD;
      ultrafine particles equally well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: That markers of cardiovascular health, including C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, IL-6 and&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor, will be lower after living with active HEPA filtration&#xD;
      compared to sham filtration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: In-home HEPA filtration will be seen by policy-makers as an effective policy option for&#xD;
      reducing UFP exposure in near-highway residences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a double-blind, randomized crossover trial in which each participant served as&#xD;
      their own control, thereby greatly reducing the role of time-invariable confounders. Up to&#xD;
      two homes were enrolled and randomized at a time, with one allocated to receive HEPA&#xD;
      filtration and the other sham filtration first. At three weeks, the homes were switched from&#xD;
      HEPA filtration to sham or vice versa. There was no washout period between sham and HEPA&#xD;
      filtration. While field staff were aware of the type of filter in use, the participants and&#xD;
      the lab that analyzed blood samples were not. The approach and methods were largely similar&#xD;
      to another HEPA intervention we conducted in public housing in the City of Somerville, which&#xD;
      was still in progress at the start of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were recruited from the BPRHS cohort. The parent study was in the process of&#xD;
      follow-up at approximately five years since baseline with close to 1000 participants&#xD;
      remaining. The cohort staff recommended non-smoking participants who they thought might be&#xD;
      receptive to our intervention. Of the 25 participants enrolled, 23 (92%) completed the study&#xD;
      and were included in the analysis. One home was removed due to the failure of the flow&#xD;
      sensor, which identified indoor versus outdoor air, while the other was removed because the&#xD;
      participant opted to end the study early. All participants lived in the cities of Boston or&#xD;
      Chelsea. Data on demographics and health were obtained from surveys collected during&#xD;
      longitudinal follow-up of the cohort. For the participants receiving the intervention, the&#xD;
      investigators collected additional surveys with information on recent exposures, recent&#xD;
      illnesses, and participant time-activity patterns (at home, work/school, travel on highways,&#xD;
      other).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants signed consent forms for the parent study and a separate consent for the air&#xD;
      filtration intervention. The studies were approved by the IRBs at Tufts Medical Center,&#xD;
      Northeastern University, and the University of Massachusetts Lowell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention Window-mounted HEPAirX air filtration units (Air Innovations, Inc., North&#xD;
      Syracuse, NY, USA) equipped with MERV 17 filters (rated to remove ≥99.97% of particles ≥0.3&#xD;
      μm in diameter) were used. These units can operate at ~10 exchanges/hour in a 28.3 m3 (103&#xD;
      ft3) room and have user-controlled air heating and cooling elements. The units were installed&#xD;
      preferentially in living rooms of apartments (N=16), where participants spent much of their&#xD;
      day. Eight units were installed in bedrooms due to space restrictions or because living room&#xD;
      windows did not accommodate the HEPAirX unit. To maximize particle removal, the HEPA units&#xD;
      were operated at the highest possible fan speed and the vents were blocked so that there was&#xD;
      no flow of outdoor air through the unit into the apartment. Also, participants were asked to&#xD;
      keep windows closed as much as possible during the study period to minimize infiltration from&#xD;
      outside. Filters were changed in each apartment after 21 days (HEPA for sham or vice versa).&#xD;
      A new HEPA filter (MERV 17) was used in each apartment. The sham filter was an empty,&#xD;
      perforated sheet metal box that was the same size and shape and had the same appearance as&#xD;
      the metal frame around the HEPA filters. The HEPAirX sounded the same regardless of sham or&#xD;
      HEPA filtration. A sign written in English and Spanish was placed on the HEPA-unit cover&#xD;
      asking participants not to tamper with or expose the filter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Air pollution monitoring Particle number concentrations (PNC) were measured continuously&#xD;
      during the six-week trial in each apartment using water-based condensation particle counters&#xD;
      (CPC; TSI Model 3783, d50 7 nm, maximum detectable particle &gt;3 µm). The CPCs were installed&#xD;
      in the same room as the HEPAirX unit and recorded 30-second mean PNC (one-minute mean PNC in&#xD;
      the first five homes). Both outdoor and indoor PNC were measured; a solenoid valve switched&#xD;
      every 15 minutes between two, 1-m-long conductive silicon inlet tubes: one pulled from&#xD;
      indoors and the other pulled from outdoors. An in-line flow sensor logged different voltages&#xD;
      depending on whether a flow was detected in the line (2.49 V with flow, ~1.00 V with no&#xD;
      flow); these were used to identify indoor and outdoor sampling periods. Before the start of&#xD;
      the intervention in each apartment, CPC flow rates were measured using a flow meter (TSI&#xD;
      Model 4140) (no discrepancies were observed throughout the study). The CPC vacuum was also&#xD;
      checked for leaks by placing a polyethersulfone membrane filter (rated at 99.96% removal&#xD;
      efficiency for 0.45 µm particles) on the inlet to insure the CPC measured &lt;100 particles/cm3.&#xD;
      Sites were visited weekly for regular maintenance (flow checks, time resets, etc.) and to&#xD;
      download data. Data flagged by the CPC as erroneous (typically &lt;1% of all data per home) were&#xD;
      removed from the data set. Consistent with manufacturer specifications, all CPCs performed&#xD;
      within 10% of one another in laboratory side-by-side comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Somerville study, which the investigators combined with the current study in a&#xD;
      meta-analysis, followed the same study design and methods with the following differences: 1)&#xD;
      there was no outdoor monitoring; 2) all study participants resided within 200 m of a highway;&#xD;
      and 3) the study participants differed in their demographics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indoor sources Indoor measurements reflect both the fraction of outdoor UFP that infiltrate&#xD;
      indoors and indoor-generated UFP - e.g., from cooking, candle and incense burning, and&#xD;
      cleaning. These sources result in large but variable magnitude spikes in indoor&#xD;
      concentrations and further, the rate of decay of these spikes depends on several factors,&#xD;
      such as source strength and duration, room volume and ventilation rate. It is thus&#xD;
      challenging to completely separate the contributions from outdoor and indoor UFP sources&#xD;
      based on indoor PNC measurements. Nonetheless, to test effects of indoor spikes on&#xD;
      associations with biomarkers, the investigators generated a PNC time-series for each home and&#xD;
      calculated the six-hour moving median for indoor PNC measurements. The investigators then&#xD;
      calculated the standard deviation for the three-week period corresponding to HEPA or sham&#xD;
      filtration; indoor measurements that were two standard deviations above this six-hour moving&#xD;
      median were classified as spikes and replaced with the last indoor measurement that was not&#xD;
      considered to be a spiked value. Even though the investigators' method did not completely&#xD;
      remove the contribution from indoor sources, it attenuated the contributions from spikes that&#xD;
      skewed the three-week indoor average values used as exposure concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers A venous blood sample was collected at the start, at the change of filter types&#xD;
      (end of week 3) and at end of the intervention (end of week 6). Samples were transported to&#xD;
      the Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (Tufts University, Boston campus), where they&#xD;
      were processed to plasma and stored at minus 80 ºC within 1-3 h of collection. Participants&#xD;
      were instructed to fast overnight prior to the blood draws (79% confirming fasting), which&#xD;
      occurred between 8 and 10 AM. Samples were assayed in batches using immunoassay kits for&#xD;
      TNF-RII (Quantitative, R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and IL-6 (Quantitative HS, R&amp;D&#xD;
      Systems). High sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) was measured by a solid-phase, two-site&#xD;
      chemiluminescent immunometric assay, (IMMULITE 2000, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Los&#xD;
      Angeles, CA 90045). These biomarkers are a measure of the levels of systemic inflammation.&#xD;
