      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy of Hydroxyurea in the study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis: The study will result in either maintenance or rise in hemoglobin as&#xD;
           compared to the control treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the compliance of Hydroxyurea in study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of Hydroxyurea in the study participants. Design and Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open label randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy and safety of Hydroxyurea on&#xD;
      beta thalassemia major patients. It is a six months study. Findings of physical examination,&#xD;
      vital sign variables, laboratory variables and ultrasound at baseline, during and end of the&#xD;
      study will be listed. Schedule of intervention is mentioned in section 6.1. later in the&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions and Duration Hydroxyurea will be given to the participants in intervention arm&#xD;
      along with the standard treatment if thalassemia (blood transfusion and iron chelation&#xD;
      therapy) and the control arm will receive the standard treatment (blood transfusion and iron&#xD;
      chelation therapy) only. Each participant will be followed up for 6 months after initiating&#xD;
      the intervention. Intervention will be given for 6 months or until the participant withdraws&#xD;
      from the study or due to any reason, the investigator stops the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Population This pilot study will be done on 100 patients initially.&#xD;
      Stratified randomization will be done on the basis of presence of Xmn polymorphism. And the&#xD;
      study population will be assigned to intervention or control arm randomly through a computer&#xD;
      software (randomizer.org).&#xD;

      Study Enrollment Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study participants will be examined on the screening visit to assess their&#xD;
           eligibility to participate. Each participant will consent in writing (Appendix I) to the&#xD;
           screening process before the start of the examination and laboratory or radiology&#xD;
           investigations. Screening log will be maintained to record this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parental consent (for minors age group &lt; 18 years) will be obtained from a legal&#xD;
           guardian accompanying the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research unit will produce a computer generated sets of random allocations&#xD;
           stratified on the basis of presence or absence of Xmn in advance of the start of the&#xD;
           study. They will be then sealed in consecutively numbered opaque envelopes. The study&#xD;
           participants will be randomly assigned to the investigation arm or control arm&#xD;
           accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Storage and Accountability&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study drugs must be kept in a secure place under adequate storage conditions - protected&#xD;
      from moisture and light and under required temperature (in refrigerator if required). Records&#xD;
      of dispensing and returns will be maintained by the trial site (Omair Sana Foundation) in&#xD;
      form of counts of tablets dispensed or returned. The subject must return all unused study&#xD;
      medication for each treatment period to the trial center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis plan Intention to treat analysis Each participant will be analyzed in&#xD;
      the group he was assigned to (investigational arm and control arm) at the time of study&#xD;
      initiation rather than what he /she will take (drug orstandard treatment). Data will be&#xD;
      entered and analyzed through statistical software SPSS version 17. Descriptive and&#xD;
      inferential statistics will be analyzed. Descriptive statistics will be presented as means,&#xD;
      standard deviations and ninety five percent confidence levels of the means for continuous&#xD;
      variables and frequency and percentages for categorical variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis per protocol patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional sensitivity analysis will be done as per protocol patient. Those participants will&#xD;
      be analyzed who will receive at least 80% of the assigned intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inferential analysis: The mean difference in the efficacy and safety parameters from baseline&#xD;
      to end will be reported along with p-value and ninety five percent confidence intervals. To&#xD;
      find the difference, dependent T-test will be performed in case of normally distributed&#xD;
      variables, Wilcoxan Signed Rank test for variables assuming non-parametric distribution and&#xD;
      chi-square test of independence will be performed in case of categorical variables. The&#xD;
      results will be displayed in form of graphs and tables. The results will be considered as&#xD;
      statistically significant if p-value is less than 0.05 (level of significance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics: The demographic, background and baseline data and baseline&#xD;
      characteristics of study participants will be presented descriptively. Protocol violations&#xD;
      will be listed per participant, describing the nature of the violation. Participants failing&#xD;
      to complete the study (as well as the times and reasons for discontinuation) will be&#xD;
      displayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Safety: Adverse Events, as reported throughout the course of the trial will be&#xD;
      listed. Pre-, study and post-study findings of physical examination, vital sign variables,&#xD;
      laboratory variables will be listed individually and summarized; values outside the normal&#xD;
      range will be highlighted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE Data Collection Forms Standard CRF (Appendix II) is&#xD;
      designed for the data collection purpose. Data Management Database will be formed in order to&#xD;
      record data from the folders for the trial patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance Data from the study will be collected in CRFs. Data editing will be&#xD;
      performed at the trial center, comparing source and CRF entries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study an independent monitor will visit the investigational site randomly without&#xD;
      prior notification to confirm that the facilities remain acceptable, that the investigational&#xD;
      team is adhering to the protocol and that data are being accurately recorded in the CRFs.&#xD;
      Source data verification (a comparison of the data in the CRF with the participants'&#xD;
      laboratory test results and other source documents) will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Authorized representatives of the regulatory authority (e.g. IRB) may visit the center to&#xD;
      perform inspections, including source data verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clean File for the final database will be declared when all data have been entered and a&#xD;
      quality check on a sample of the data has been performed. The database will be locked after&#xD;
      Clean File has been declared and data extracted for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study committee meetings will be held as needed prior to or during the study. The medical,&#xD;
      nursing and other research staff involved in the study will receive proper training on how to&#xD;
      conduct the study and record the information according to the protocol.&#xD;
