    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy works in&#xD;
      improving quality of life in patients with stage IIIC-IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer. In hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, the chemotherapy is warmed&#xD;
      before being used and may help the drugs get into the cancer cells better, minimize the&#xD;
      toxicity of the drugs on normal cells, and help to kill any cancer cells left over after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare quality of life in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with standard&#xD;
      of care (SOC) neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with&#xD;
      hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) at 6 weeks post-treatment versus quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL) patients treatment with intravenous-therapy (IV) chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe quality of life in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC&#xD;
      followed by CRS with HIPEC at 3 and 6 months post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe neurotoxicity in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC&#xD;
      followed by CRS with HIPEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe abdominal discomfort in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with&#xD;
      NAC followed by CRS with HIPEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe toxicities in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC followed&#xD;
      by CRS with HIPEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To describe the response rate in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC&#xD;
      followed by CRS with HIPEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To describe progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced ovarian cancer&#xD;
      treated with NAC followed by CRS with HIPEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Beginning 4-8 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo CRS. Patients&#xD;
      then receive carboplatin intraperitoneally (IP) over 90 minutes immediately following CRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of chemotherapy, patients are followed up at 30 days, and 3, 6, and 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of life (QOL) assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The longitudinal data of QOL will be displayed graphically with individual trajectories. Repeated measures analysis of covariance models will be used for the primary analysis. The baseline QOL visit (as a categorical variable), randomization assignment, and a randomization by visit interaction will be included in the model. The test for the randomization effect at the 6-week post-treatment will be performed using a contrast of the 6-week randomization means. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abdominal discomfort assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Abdominal Discomfort questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Abdominal discomfort will be compared between the two treatment arms. The data will be analyzed using Poisson model with GEEs to account for the dependency between repeated measures. This approach will be treated as a sensitivity analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of toxicities evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The toxicities will be measured by the number and severity of adverse events defined by CTCAE version 5.0. The count data will be compared assuming a Poisson distribution.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurotoxicity assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurotoxicity will be compared between the two treatment arms. The data will be analyzed using Poisson model with generalized estimating equations (GEEs) to account for the dependency between repeated measures. This approach will be treated as a sensitivity analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival will be compared between the two treatment arms using survival analysis. The follow-up time will be calculated from the date of end of treatment. Survival will be measured up to the time until progression, date of last contact, or death, whichever comes first. Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be used to estimate the survival probabilities by treatment arms. Cox proportional hazards models will be used to calculate the hazards ratio and its confidence interval for the treatment effect.</description>

             enrollment (patients who have received hormone therapy within 3 years of enrollment&#xD;
             are still eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received at least 3 but not more than 6 cycles of&#xD;
             carboplatin-doublet based IV neoadjuvant chemotherapy and achieved at least stable&#xD;

             (IRB)-approved informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with extra-abdominal metastatic disease.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because carboplatin doublet therapy&#xD;
             consists of pregnancy category D agents with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with carboplatin&#xD;
             doublet therapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men are excluded from participating due to the site specific nature of the disease&#xD;
             being studied.&#xD;
