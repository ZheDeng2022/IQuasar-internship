  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mother-to-Child-Transmission (MTCT) of HBV is the most important route in high endemic&#xD;
      countries. Although active-passive immune prophylaxis is generally administrated to infants&#xD;
      delivered by HBsAg positive women, there are a lot of people infected with HBV in China. High&#xD;
      HBV DNA load (&gt;10^5IU/ml) is the vital cause of MTCT. So some researchers used TDF&#xD;
      （tenofovir） or LDT（telbivudine） to treat patients with high HBV DNA load during middle, late&#xD;
      pregnancy, in order to decrease MTCT. As a result, some data about it were gradually reported&#xD;
      in late years. Recently, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, European&#xD;
      Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and China guidelines for CHB (chronic hepatitis&#xD;
      B) suggest that pregnant women with high HBV DNA load be treated with TDF or LDT at 24-28&#xD;
      weeks of gestation to lower MTCT of HBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although TDF or LDT is classified as pregnancy B drugs by FDA, and many studies report that&#xD;
      MTCT rate of HBV decreases after women with high HBV DNA load are administrated with TDF or&#xD;
      LDT at 24-28 weeks of gestation, a few birth defects are reported. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      long-effect of TDF or LDT on infants remains unclear thoroughly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some CHB women had severe liver dysfunction before pregnancy or during pregnancy, and routine&#xD;
      liver protection therapy could not effect. Some of them could develop into liver failure,&#xD;
      fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even died. Moreover, severe liver dysfunction often leads to adverse&#xD;
      effects to pregnant women and fetuses, such as pregnancy failure, lower weight, premature&#xD;
      birth, etc. As a result, these women have to accept TDF or LDT before pregnancy, or during&#xD;
      early pregnancy. So the long-effect of TDF or LDT on infants needs thoroughly investigating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, the investigators will enroll women with chronic HBV infection and evaluate&#xD;
      their state of illness. Then the investigators treat participants with TDF or LDT or routine&#xD;
      liver protection therapy, and follow up the participants for a long period. The&#xD;
      investigators' objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A, To clarify efficacy and adverse effects of TDF/LDT in preventing MTCT between&#xD;
      immune-tolerant and immune-active CHB patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B, To clarify efficacy and adverse effects of TDF/LDT in preventing MTCT during different&#xD;
      trimesters of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C, To compare MTCT rate between patients received TDF/LDT therapy and patients without&#xD;
      TDF/LDT therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D, To compare MTCT rate and adverse effects between LDT and TDF.&#xD;
