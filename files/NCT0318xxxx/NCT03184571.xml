  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, single arm, phase II study to assess the anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity and safety of bemcentinib when given in combination with pembrolizumab in up to 106&#xD;
      participants with previously treated, advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung. The study will&#xD;
      enroll three cohorts of participants with previously treated, advanced adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
      lung: Cohort A will consist of participants who received a maximum of 1 prior line of&#xD;
      platinum-containing chemotherapy and no prior immunotherapy of any kind. Cohort B will&#xD;
      consist of participants who received a maximum of one prior line of an anti-programmed death&#xD;
      receptor (PD)-(L)1 therapy (monotherapy). Cohort C will consist of participants who received&#xD;
      a maximum of one prior line of therapy with an anti-PD-(L)1 therapy in combination with a&#xD;
      platinum-containing chemotherapy.The primary objective is to assess the anti-tumor activity&#xD;
      of bemcentinib and pembrolizumab when given in combination.&#xD;
