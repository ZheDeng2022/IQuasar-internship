  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical study was to investigate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor zanubrutinib&#xD;
      (BGB-3111) in Chinese participants with B-cell lymphoma by conducting in two stages, the&#xD;
      first stage being the safety assessment of dose and the second stage being the dose&#xD;
      expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: Safety evaluation - according to the results of preclinical toxicological trials and&#xD;
      the results of the phase I clinical study conducted in Australia and New Zealand, two&#xD;
      regimens of zanubrutinib 320 milligrams (mg) daily (160 mg twice daily [BID]), administered&#xD;
      in the morning and at night, or 320 mg once daily [QD]) and &quot;3+3&quot; design was adopted for the&#xD;
      assessment. The recommended dose and method of administration of the phase II clinical study&#xD;
      was determined according to the Part I results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Dose expansion - this stage was to further evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor&#xD;
      effects of zanubrutinib in Chinese participants with follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal&#xD;
      zone lymphoma (MZL), approximately 20 participants with relapsed or refractory FL or MZL were&#xD;
      to be enrolled. The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) was used in Part II.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From the date of informed consent until 30 +/- 7 days after treatment discontinuation (up to 4 years and 1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>All adverse events were treatment emergent and were defined as an adverse event with a reported onset time or increase in severity after the initial dose of study drug and within 30 days after the last dose of study drug or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever was sooner. A serious adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is significant medical event requiring intervention. All toxicity and adverse events were assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03 (NCI-CTCAE v4.03) grading criteria. A summary of serious and all other non-serious adverse events, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 4 years and 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response in overall response rate (ORR) was defined as a participant's best overall response: CR or PR for NHL participants; CR, complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery, nodular PR, PR, or PR with lymphocytosis for the CLL participants; CR, very good PR, PR, or minor response for the Waldenstr√∂m macroglobulinemia participants. ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved an overall response.</description>

    <measure>Part II: Duration of Response (DOR) Of Zanubrutinib In Participants With FL And MZL</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years and 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response for responders (those who achieved an overall response of PR or better) was defined as the time interval (in number of days) between the date of the earliest qualifying response and the date of progressive disease or death for any cause (whichever occurs earlier). Duration of response analysis included only responders.</description>

    <measure>Part II: Progression Free Survival (PFS) Of Zanubrutinib In Participants With FL And MZL</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years and 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time (in months) from the date of first study treatment to disease progression or death (due to any cause), whichever occurred first. For purposes of calculating PFS, the start date of progressive disease was the date at which progression was first observed. The duration and primary analysis of PFS was right-censored for participants who met 1 of the following conditions: 1) no baseline disease assessments; 2) starting a new anticancer therapy before documentation of disease progression or death; 3) death or disease progression immediately after more than 1 consecutively missed disease assessment visit; and 4) alive without documentation of disease progression before the data cutoff date.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at 4 centers in China, all of which enrolled participants. The first participant was dosed on 05 July 2016. As of the final database lock (15 October 2020), 44 participants were enrolled and treated with zanubrutinib (BGB-3111). Once the final analysis was completed, the study was terminated and all participants who were still on treatment were transferred to long term extension study.</recruitment_details>

        <description>All adverse events were treatment emergent and were defined as an adverse event with a reported onset time or increase in severity after the initial dose of study drug and within 30 days after the last dose of study drug or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever was sooner. A serious adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is significant medical event requiring intervention. All toxicity and adverse events were assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03 (NCI-CTCAE v4.03) grading criteria. A summary of serious and all other non-serious adverse events, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>
