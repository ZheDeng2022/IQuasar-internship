    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) complicated by motor fluctuations ('OFF' episodes) were recruited in 13 study sites in Italy and the United States, starting April 2017. The study was completed in December 2017. Approval was obtained from the Enrollment Adjudication Committee and Sponsor prior to enrollment of each patient.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Dose Titration Phase: individual responses to single doses of APL 130277 were evaluated at 5 mg increments up to 40 mg and then 10 mg increments up to 60 mg until a full 'ON' was achieved. If tolerated, patients were titrated to a supratherapeutic dose (up to 60 mg) which was 1 or 2 levels above the initial dose producing an 'ON' response.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Patients who successfully completed the Dose Titration Phase of the study were randomized to 1 of 6 treatment sequences in the single-dose Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase. Following confirmation by both the Investigator and the patient that the patient was in the 'OFF' state, the patient was dosed according to the patient's random treatment assignment with&#xD;
APL-130277 at the dose determined in the Dose Titration Phase; OR&#xD;
Matched placebo APL-130277; OR&#xD;
A single 400 mg dose of moxifloxacin. Patients were randomized in equal numbers to 6 possible sequences of the above 3 study treatments determined by a 3-way balanced crossover design.&#xD;
There was a 3-day washout period between treatment period dosing visits. Dosing of APL-130277 and placebo was double-blinded, and dosing of moxifloxacin was open-label.</description>

        <description>For the primary central tendency analysis, the changes from baseline (ΔQTcF) were compared between APL-130277 and placebo (ΔΔQTcF). Baseline was defined as the mean of the 9 ECGs (3 sets of triplicate ECGs) recorded at baseline (P1V1). In case any of the 9 ECGs were missing, the baseline was defined as the mean of the available baseline values. The post-dose ECGs were evaluated at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes (mins) and 2, 3 and 4 hours post-dose at each of the 3 treatment period dosing visits during the Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase. For each of the time points, an average value was calculated based on the 3 (or all available) ECGs. These average values were used in all change from baseline calculations.</description>

Baseline was defined as the mean of the 9 ECGs (3 sets of triplicate ECGs) recorded at baseline (P1V1). In case any of the 9 ECGs were missing, the baseline was defined as the mean of the available baseline values. The post-dose ECGs were evaluated at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes (mins) and 2, 3 and 4 hours post-dose at each of the 3 treatment period dosing visits during the Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase. For each of the time points, an average value was calculated based on the 3 (or all available) ECGs. These average values were used in all change from baseline calculations.</description>
          <population>The ECG Population included all randomized patients who had evaluable baseline 12-lead ECG (Holter) data at P1V1 and at least one evaluable post-dose 12-lead ECG (Holter) assessment during the Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase.&#xD;
Please Note: The pre-specified primary comparison was between APL-130277 and Placebo.</population>

        <description>The maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) for apomorphine and apomorphine sulfate (metabolite) was determined in patients treated with APL-130277. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were derived using a non-compartmental analysis method. Bioanalysis of apomorphine and apomorphine-sulfate plasma concentration were measured using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) method. The calibration range was 0.0200 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) to 20.0 ng/mL apomorphine and 10.0 to 1000 ng/mL apomorphine sulfate (metabolite). PK assessments were performed at each period of the Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase (at P1V1, P2V2 and P3V3) and results are presented for each of the APL-130277 doses administered (as determined for each patient during the Dose Titration Phase).</description>
        <time_frame>Blood samples for PK assessments were taken prior to dosing and at 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, and 4 hours post-dose.</time_frame>
        <population>The PK population included all patients with at least one PK evaluation. Only patients with data available for analysis are presented.</population>

Bioanalysis of apomorphine and apomorphine-sulfate plasma concentration were measured using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) method. The calibration range was 0.0200 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) to 20.0 ng/mL apomorphine and 10.0 to 1000 ng/mL apomorphine sulfate (metabolite). PK assessments were performed at each period of the Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase (at P1V1, P2V2 and P3V3) and results are presented for each of the APL-130277 doses administered (as determined for each patient during the Dose Titration Phase).</description>
          <population>The PK population included all patients with at least one PK evaluation. Only patients with data available for analysis are presented.</population>

        <description>AE definition: any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant. Serious AE definition: an AE that is fatal, life threatening, requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in permanent (persistent) disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is an important medical event. Severity of AEs were classified as: mild: causes no limitation of usual activities, moderate: causes some limitation of usual activities; or severe: prevents or severely limits usual activities. The investigator assessed AEs for relatedness to study medication. TEAEs were defined as all AEs that started on or after the first dose of study medication (APL-130277, moxifloxacin or placebo). Results are presented for TEAEs during the Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase.</description>

          <description>AE definition: any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant. Serious AE definition: an AE that is fatal, life threatening, requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in permanent (persistent) disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is an important medical event. Severity of AEs were classified as: mild: causes no limitation of usual activities, moderate: causes some limitation of usual activities; or severe: prevents or severely limits usual activities. The investigator assessed AEs for relatedness to study medication. TEAEs were defined as all AEs that started on or after the first dose of study medication (APL-130277, moxifloxacin or placebo). Results are presented for TEAEs during the Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase.</description>

        <title>ECG Assessments: Mean Change From Baseline to Post-Baseline Value for QTcB Interval During Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase</title>
        <description>QTcB was defined as QT interval corrected with Bazett's method. QT was defined as time between start of Q wave and end of T wave. QTcB was determined during continuous 12-lead ECG (Holter) monitoring at each of the 3 treatment period dosing visits at pre-specified timepoints post-dose. Baseline was defined as the mean of the 9 ECGs (3 sets of triplicate ECGs) recorded at baseline (pre-dose P1V1). In case any of the 9 ECGs were missing, the baseline was defined as the mean of the available baseline values. The post-dose ECGs were evaluated at 15, 30, 45 and 60 mins and 2, 3 and 4 hours post-dose at each of the 3 treatment period dosing visits during the Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase. For each of the time points, an average value was calculated based on the 3 (or all available) ECGs. Results are presented for the mean change from baseline at each pre-specified post-dose timepoint.</description>

        <description>The Motor Function section (Part III) of the MDS-UPDRS was administered by the Investigator, and included 33 scores based on 18-items, each anchored with 5 responses: 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The scale range was from 0 to 132, with a lower score indicating better motor function and a higher score indicating more severe motor symptoms.&#xD;
The least squares mean change in the MDS-UPDRS Part III score from pre-dose to 30, 60 and 90 minutes post-dose during the Dose Titration Phase at the highest tolerated APL-130277 dose level (indicated as Day 2) and the lowest APL-130277 dose resulting in a full 'ON' (indicated as Day 1) are presented.</description>

Patients were dosed with increasing doses of APL 130277 starting with 10 mg at TV 1 up to a maximum of 60 mg. Patients who did not achieve a complete and full 'ON' response with the 10 mg APL 130277 dose at TV1 restarted their normal PD medications and were asked to return to the clinic the next business day for TV2, to assess the next highest dose. The evaluation continued sequentially with 15 mg (TV2), 20 mg (TV3), 25 mg (TV4), 30 mg (TV5), 35 mg (TV6), 40 mg (TV7), 50 mg (TV8), and 60 mg (TV9) doses of APL-130277 until a full 'ON' state was achieved. If tolerated, patients were titrated to a supratherapeutic dose (up to 60 mg) which was 1 or 2 levels above the initial dose producing an 'ON' response. If the patient was unable to tolerate 1 or either of the 2 additional dose levels after reaching a full &quot;ON&quot; state patients were randomized to the previous tolerable dose.</description>

        <description>For the assay sensitivity analysis in support of the primary central tendency analysis, the changes from baseline (ΔQTcF) were compared between moxifloxacin (positive control) and placebo (ΔΔQTcF). Baseline was defined as the mean of the 9 ECGs (3 sets of triplicate ECGs) recorded at baseline (P1V1). In case any of the 9 ECGs were missing, the baseline was defined as the mean of the available baseline values. The post-dose ECGs were evaluated at 60 mins and 2, 3 and 4 hours post-dose for each of the 3 treatment period dosing visits in the Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase. For each of the time points, an average value was calculated based on the 3 (or all available) ECGs. These average values were used in all change from baseline calculations.</description>

          <title>Time-Matched Change From Baseline in QTc, Placebo-Adjusted and Corrected for Heart Rate Based on QTcF Using ΔΔQTcF: Comparison Between Moxifloxacin and Placebo (Assay Sensitivity Analysis)</title>
          <description>For the assay sensitivity analysis in support of the primary central tendency analysis, the changes from baseline (ΔQTcF) were compared between moxifloxacin (positive control) and placebo (ΔΔQTcF). Baseline was defined as the mean of the 9 ECGs (3 sets of triplicate ECGs) recorded at baseline (P1V1). In case any of the 9 ECGs were missing, the baseline was defined as the mean of the available baseline values. The post-dose ECGs were evaluated at 60 mins and 2, 3 and 4 hours post-dose for each of the 3 treatment period dosing visits in the Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase. For each of the time points, an average value was calculated based on the 3 (or all available) ECGs. These average values were used in all change from baseline calculations.</description>

        <title>ECG Assessments: Mean Change From Baseline to Post-Baseline Value for Heart Rate During Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase</title>
        <description>Heart rate was determined during continuous 12-lead ECG (Holter) monitoring at each of the 3 treatment period dosing visits at pre-specified timepoints post-dose. Baseline was defined as the mean of the 9 ECGs (3 sets of triplicate ECGs) recorded at baseline (pre-dose P1V1). In case any of the 9 ECGs were missing, the baseline was defined as the mean of the available baseline values. The post-dose ECGs were evaluated at 15, 30, 45 and 60 mins and 2, 3 and 4 hours post-dose at each of the 3 treatment period dosing visits during the Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase. For each of the time points, an average value was calculated based on the 3 (or all available) ECGs. Results are presented for the mean change from baseline at each pre-specified post-dose timepoint.</description>

        <title>ECG Assessments: Mean Change From Baseline to Post-Baseline Value for PR Interval During Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase</title>
        <description>PR interval was defined as time from the onset of the P wave to the start of the QRS complex. PR interval was determined during continuous 12-lead ECG (Holter) monitoring at each of the 3 treatment period dosing visits at pre-specified timepoints post-dose. Baseline was defined as the mean of the 9 ECGs (3 sets of triplicate ECGs) recorded at baseline (pre-dose P1V1). In case any of the 9 ECGs were missing, the baseline was defined as the mean of the available baseline values. The post-dose ECGs were evaluated at 15, 30, 45 and 60 mins and 2, 3 and 4 hours post-dose at each of the 3 treatment period dosing visits during the Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase. For each of the time points, an average value was calculated based on the 3 (or all available) ECGs. Results are presented for the mean change from baseline at each pre-specified post-dose timepoint.</description>

        <description>Uncorrected QT interval was defined as time between start of Q wave and end of T wave. QT interval was determined during continuous 12-lead ECG (Holter) monitoring at each of the 3 treatment period dosing visits at pre-specified timepoints post-dose. Baseline was defined as the mean of the 9 ECGs (3 sets of triplicate ECGs) recorded at baseline (pre-dose P1V1). In case any of the 9 ECGs were missing, the baseline was defined as the mean of the available baseline values. The post-dose ECGs were evaluated at 15, 30, 45 and 60 mins and 2, 3 and 4 hours post-dose at each of the 3 treatment period dosing visits during the Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase. For each of the time points, an average value was calculated based on the 3 (or all available) ECGs. Results are presented for the mean change from baseline at each pre-specified post-dose timepoint.</description>

          <title>ECG Assessments: Mean Change From Baseline to Post-Baseline Value for Uncorrected QT Interval During Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase</title>
          <description>Uncorrected QT interval was defined as time between start of Q wave and end of T wave. QT interval was determined during continuous 12-lead ECG (Holter) monitoring at each of the 3 treatment period dosing visits at pre-specified timepoints post-dose. Baseline was defined as the mean of the 9 ECGs (3 sets of triplicate ECGs) recorded at baseline (pre-dose P1V1). In case any of the 9 ECGs were missing, the baseline was defined as the mean of the available baseline values. The post-dose ECGs were evaluated at 15, 30, 45 and 60 mins and 2, 3 and 4 hours post-dose at each of the 3 treatment period dosing visits during the Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase. For each of the time points, an average value was calculated based on the 3 (or all available) ECGs. Results are presented for the mean change from baseline at each pre-specified post-dose timepoint.</description>

          <description>Patients were titrated to an effective and tolerable dose of APL-130277. Patients were dosed with increasing doses of APL 130277 starting with 10 mg at TV 1 up to a maximum of 60 mg. Patients who did not achieve a complete and full 'ON' response with the 10 mg APL 130277 dose at TV1 restarted their normal PD medications and were asked to return to the clinic the next business day for TV2, to assess the next highest dose. The evaluation continued sequentially with 15 mg (TV2), 20 mg (TV3), 25 mg (TV4), 30 mg (TV5), 35 mg (TV6), 40 mg (TV7), 50 mg (TV8), and 60 mg (TV9) doses of APL-130277 until a full 'ON' state was achieved. If tolerated, patients were titrated to a supratherapeutic dose (up to 60 mg) which was 1 or 2 levels above the initial dose producing an 'ON' response. If the patient was unable to tolerate 1 or either of the 2 additional dose levels after reaching a full &quot;ON&quot; state patients were randomized to the previous tolerable dose.</description>
