  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study will assess whether people with major depressive disorder experience&#xD;
      psychological and behavioral benefits and/or harms from psilocybin. This study will&#xD;
      investigate acute and persisting effects of psilocybin on depressive symptoms and other&#xD;
      moods, attitudes, and behaviors. The primary hypothesis is that psilocybin will lead to rapid&#xD;
      and sustained antidepressant response, as measured with standard depression rating scales.&#xD;
