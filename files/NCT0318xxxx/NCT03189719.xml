  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus standard&#xD;
      of care (SOC) chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) versus placebo plus SOC&#xD;
      chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-FU as first-line treatment in participants with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic esophageal carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall primary efficacy hypotheses are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In participants with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), participants whose&#xD;
           tumors are programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive (defined as combined positive&#xD;
           score [CPS] ≥10), ESCC participants whose tumors are PD-L1 positive (CPS ≥10), and in&#xD;
           all participants, overall survival (OS) is superior with pembrolizumab plus SOC&#xD;
           chemotherapy compared with placebo plus SOC chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In participants with ESCC, participants whose tumors are PD-L1 positive (CPS ≥10), and&#xD;
           in all participants, progression-free survival (PFS) according to Response Evaluation&#xD;
           Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 as assessed by investigator is superior with&#xD;
           pembrolizumab plus SOC chemotherapy compared with placebo plus SOC chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-OES18 is a disease-specific questionnaire developed and validated to address measurements specific to esophageal cancer and contains 18 items assessing symptoms of dysphagia, pain, reflux symptoms, eating restrictions, anxiety, dry mouth, taste, body image, and hair loss. For the purposes of this study, the Dysphagia subscale (three items), Pain subscale (three items), and Reflux subscale (two items) were evaluated. All subscale items were scored using a four-point Likert scale with the following response choices: 1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much. Raw scores for the subscales were standardized into a range of 0 to 100 by linear transformation, with higher symptom scores represent a higher (&quot;worse&quot;) level of symptoms. Per protocol, change from baseline to Week 18 in the Dysphagia, Pain, and Reflux subscales was reported for all participants in each treatment arm. Negative changes from baseline indicate a decrease in symptom severity.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) As Assessed By Investigator in Participants With ESCC</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. The sponsor allowed a maximum of 10 target lesions in total and 5 per organ on this study. Per protocol, PFS is reported here for all participants of the ITT population (all randomized) who had ESCC.</description>

        <title>PFS Per RECIST 1.1 As Assessed By Investigator in All Participants</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. The sponsor allowed a maximum of 10 target lesions in total and 5 per organ on this study. Per protocol, PFS is reported here for all participants of the ITT population (all randomized) who were PD-L1 CPS ≥10.</description>

        <description>For participants who demonstrated a confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of confirmed CR or PR until PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. DOR for participants who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis was censored at the date of their last tumor assessment. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. Per protocol, DOR is reported here for all participants of the ITT population (all randomized) who had CR or PR.</description>

          <title>DOR Per RECIST 1.1 As Assessed By Investigator in Participants Whose Tumors Are PD-L1 Biomarker-Positive (CPS ≥10)</title>
          <description>For participants who demonstrated a confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of confirmed CR or PR until PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. DOR for participants who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis was censored at the date of their last tumor assessment. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. Per protocol, DOR is reported here for all participants of the ITT population (all randomized) who had CR or PR, and were PD-L1 CPS ≥10.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.

        <description>The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to the Global Health Status (GHS) question &quot;How would you rate your overall health during the past week?&quot; (Item 29) and the Quality of Life (QoL) question &quot;How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?&quot; (Item 30) were scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent). Using linear transformation, raw scores were standardized so that scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a better overall outcome. Per protocol, change from baseline to Week 18 in the GHS/QoL combined score was reported by treatment arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis for all participants who had ESCC.</description>

        <description>The EORTC QLQ-OES18 is a disease-specific questionnaire developed and validated to address measurements specific to esophageal cancer and contains 18 items assessing symptoms of dysphagia, pain, reflux symptoms, eating restrictions, anxiety, dry mouth, taste, body image, and hair loss. For the purposes of this study, the Dysphagia subscale (three items), Pain subscale (three items), and Reflux subscale (two items) were evaluated. All subscale items were scored using a four-point Likert scale with the following response choices: 1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much. Raw scores for the subscales were standardized into a range of 0 to 100 by linear transformation, with higher symptom scores represent a higher (&quot;worse&quot;) level of symptoms. Per protocol, change from baseline to Week 18 in the Dysphagia, Pain, and Reflux subscales was reported for all participants in each treatment arm. Negative changes from baseline indicate a decrease in symptom severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the EORTC QLQ-OES18 Subscale Scores in Participants With ESCC Whose Tumors Are PD-L1 Biomarker-Positive (CPS ≥10)</title>
        <description>The EORTC QLQ-OES18 is a disease-specific questionnaire developed and validated to address measurements specific to esophageal cancer and contains 18 items assessing symptoms of dysphagia, pain, reflux symptoms, eating restrictions, anxiety, dry mouth, taste, body image, and hair loss. For the purposes of this study, the Dysphagia subscale (three items), Pain subscale (three items), and Reflux subscale (two items) were evaluated. All subscale items were scored using a four-point Likert scale with the following response choices: 1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much. Raw scores for the subscales were standardized into a range of 0 to 100 by linear transformation, with higher symptom scores representing a higher (&quot;worse&quot;) level of symptoms. Change from baseline to Week 18 in the Dysphagia, Pain, and Reflux subscales was reported for participants with ESCC who were PD-L1 CPS≥10 in each treatment arm. Negative changes from baseline indicate a decrease in symptom severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the EORTC QLQ-OES18 Subscale Scores in Participants Whose Tumors Are PD-L1 Biomarker-Positive (CPS ≥10)</title>
        <description>The EORTC QLQ-OES18 is a disease-specific questionnaire developed and validated to address measurements specific to esophageal cancer and contains 18 items assessing symptoms of dysphagia, pain, reflux symptoms, eating restrictions, anxiety, dry mouth, taste, body image, and hair loss. For the purposes of this study, the Dysphagia subscale (three items), Pain subscale (three items), and Reflux subscale (two items) were evaluated. All subscale items were scored using a four-point Likert scale with the following response choices: 1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much. Raw scores for the subscales were standardized into a range of 0 to 100 by linear transformation, with higher symptom scores representing a higher (&quot;worse&quot;) level of symptoms. Change from baseline to Week 18 in the Dysphagia, Pain, and Reflux subscales was reported for participants who were PD-L1 CPS≥10 in each treatment arm. Negative changes from baseline indicate a decrease in symptom severity.</description>
