  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders and depression are more prevalent in patients living with inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel disease (IBD) than in healthy controls. Approximately 40% of IBD patients have elevated&#xD;
      anxiety. Given the robust effectiveness of cognitive behavioral approaches for anxiety&#xD;
      disorders and the paucity or mixed findings of cognitive behavioral approaches for anxiety in&#xD;
      IBD, an integrated behavioral approach and combining face to face and online cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral modalities is recommended for IBD patients with anxiety.&#xD;

      If the patient is eligible for, interested in, and consents to, participating in this study,&#xD;
      the social worker will use the randomization program (social worker remains blind to random&#xD;
      assignment until the moment this group assignment is delivered to the patient) to determine&#xD;
      to which group the patient is randomized. The Social Worker will provide the patient's MRN,&#xD;
      name, date of birth and contact information to the UPMC research team. The UPMC research team&#xD;
      will generate a unique ID for each patient. Lantern is a behavioral health app that is used&#xD;
      to help people manage their stress and anxiety. There are many modules that the subjects will&#xD;
      be offered through the course of Lantern. There is a coach available to the subject who will&#xD;
      guide the subject through the modules and be available for check-ins.For those patients that&#xD;
      are randomized to Lantern at baseline, they will be provided a postcard with a sign up code&#xD;
      so they can sign up directly on their mobile device. The PCMH research assistant will assign&#xD;
      a study ID at the time of consent and study enrollment and enter this into the UPMC study&#xD;
      database. Once patient is in Lantern, they are assigned a Lantern User ID. The Lantern User&#xD;
      ID along with DOB and name will be sent to the UPMC research team through a secure VPN&#xD;
      connection so that a crosswalk can be created in the UPMC study database that links their&#xD;
      study IDs and Lantern User IDs. Patients will be recommended to start and use the anxiety&#xD;
      management program to help address their anxiety/stress symptoms. The techniques to try are&#xD;
      available for participants to access at any time. The coaches are not therapists, but are&#xD;
      there to provide information and encouragement to the patient. To keep confidentiality, the&#xD;
      coach only knows the first name of the patient. The coordinator of the coaches has access to&#xD;
      the patient's identifying information if the patient has an escalation in distress/anxiety&#xD;
      that needs to be addressed. This information will be passed to the PI when necessary as part&#xD;
      of the escalation procedures (as outlined above in Section 2.5.2 and in the attachments-&#xD;
      Escalation Procedure). The personally identifying information is held internally within the&#xD;
      Amazon web services at Lantern. The coaches for the patients have access to an internal&#xD;
      Coaching Portal where they have a dashboard for each of their users. This dashboard includes&#xD;
      all information that the user inputs into the Lantern program, including both their direct&#xD;
      messages to coaches and all content they complete in the program. Coaches receive a&#xD;
      notification when users complete a path in the program or send them a message, which prompts&#xD;
      their response to the individual (See Other Attachments - Example Messages from Lantern&#xD;
      Coaches to read examples of how the coach interacts with the user as well as Sample Lantern&#xD;
      Content.) The 6 core components include:1. Education and awareness about stress and how&#xD;
      thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are interrelated. This provides the rationale of the&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral model. In this unit, patients will learn how you can change your&#xD;
      thoughts and behaviors to change your emotions. 2. Relaxation - patients learn several&#xD;
      empirically supported relaxation techniques to manage stress/anxiety. 3. Thoughts - This unit&#xD;
      is about the stories we tell ourselves and how these stories determine our mood and help us&#xD;
      decide what actions we will take. This component also guides patients how to challenge their&#xD;
      assumptions about these thoughts/stories to create new stories.4. Behavior Change and&#xD;
      Exposure - patients will learn how to avoid things that contribute to stress and identify&#xD;
      adaptive coping activities. Through learning the principle of exposure, patients learn how&#xD;
      exposing themselves to anxiety provoking situations can help to overcome anxiety in the&#xD;
      long-term.5. Mindfulness - This unit is about taking a step back from our thoughts and&#xD;
      feelings to interrupt the thoughts-feelings-behaviors cycle. Several mindfulness exercises&#xD;
      are offered so the patient can find the type that feels best for them.6. Habit&#xD;
      formation/Maintaining skills - patients will reflect on what they have learned and work on&#xD;
      making a habit out of the most effective techniques.Lantern, the third-party program&#xD;
      provider, will collect de-identified usage data (e.g., progression through the program,&#xD;
      frequency of messages to coaches, and techniques completed) and quantitative data (e.g.,&#xD;
      anxiety score responses) as the patients' progress through the program. Lantern internally&#xD;
      has a database that tracks user progress through the programs, so they understand how&#xD;
      patients have moved through the program. This de-identified data will be sent to the UPMC&#xD;
      study staff coded only with the patient's unique ID. At several time points, Lantern will&#xD;
      push self-report validated questionnaires (e.g., GAD7) to patients enrolled in Lantern via&#xD;
      their Qualtrics account. Lantern's Qualtrics Account is a third party, HIPAA compliant survey&#xD;
      tool. Thrive Network, Inc. has a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with Lantern's Qualtrics&#xD;
      Account and owns all data collected through surveys. Lantern will share this de-identified&#xD;
      self-report questionnaire data with the UPMC clinical team using unique Lantern User IDs.&#xD;
      Lantern's coaches will not have access to any of the questionnaire data collected via&#xD;
      Qualtrics. For those patients randomized to PCMH Behavioral Health control condition at&#xD;
      baseline to 3 months, they will receive PCMH care as usual without any skills-based behavior&#xD;
      therapy. Standard behavioral health clinical monitoring will continue to occur according to&#xD;
      best practice guidelines. Specifically, this means that for patients with a baseline GAD7 &gt;&#xD;
      10 will receive a phone call from a PCMH behavioral health provider to do a mood check at one&#xD;
      month after baseline assessment. Regardless of baseline GAD7 score, if the baseline PHQ2 &gt; =&#xD;
      3, a behavioral health provider will conduct the phone call for a mood check at one month&#xD;
      follow up. From the baseline PHQ8 assessments, we will extrapolate the PHQ2 to use for&#xD;
      clinical decision making to rely on affective components of depression rather than somatic&#xD;
      component as this overlaps substantially with inflammatory-related medical conditions. At 3&#xD;
      month study follow-up, patients in both groups will be re-assessed with the study assessment&#xD;
      battery (outlined in measures section and in Table x). Non-responders will be re-randomized&#xD;
      to an adaptive care strategy. The 3 month GAD7 assessment will be used to determine&#xD;
      'responder' vs. 'non-responder' status. In the Lantern group, patients are defined as&#xD;
      'non-responders' if their 3 month GAD7 is &gt; = 11 or if there is &lt; 4 point reduction on GAD7.&#xD;
      These cutoff scores and magnitude of change are based on the literature establishing&#xD;
      thresholds for 'treatment response'. We conservatively estimate a 40% non-response rate in&#xD;
      Mobile anxiety self-management program group based on CBT for anxiety meta-analyses. In the&#xD;
      PCMH Behavioral Health control condition, 'non-responders' are defined as 3 month GAD7 scores&#xD;
      increasing by &gt;=3 points from baseline. It's estimated that 1/2 of patients in PCMH&#xD;
      (behavioral health WL control) will either be responders or remain stable/unchanged based on&#xD;
      findings of natural course of in GAD. At 3 months, the Lantern non-responders will be&#xD;
      re-randomized to either 1) PCMH care as usual (i.e., this includes individual skills-based&#xD;
      behavioral therapy provided by behavioral health providers) or 2) PCMH care as usual +&#xD;
      Lantern. The PCMH Behavioral Health Control group non-responders will be re-randomized to&#xD;
      either 1) PCMH care as usual or 2) Lantern only. For PCMH care as usual groups, individual&#xD;
      CBT will be provided as follows: if 3 month GAD7 &gt; = 15 and/or PHQ2 &gt;=4, the patient will be&#xD;
      offered every other week CBT sessions. If 3 month GAD7 and PHQ2 are below these thresholds,&#xD;
      then patients will be offered monthly individual CBT sessions. The 'Responders' will continue&#xD;
      in their original randomly assigned group (either Lantern or PCMH Behavioral Health control&#xD;
      group). All study participants will engage in their respective care approaches for another&#xD;
      three-month period and then the same study assessment battery will be re-administered at 6&#xD;
      months. For those patients who were defined as 'responders/stable' at 3 months within the&#xD;
      PCMH Behavioral Health Control group, standard behavioral health clinical monitoring will&#xD;
      continue. Specifically, if 3 month GAD7 &gt; = 15 and/or 3 month PHQ2 &gt;=3, then a behavioral&#xD;
      health provider will call the patient monthly to conduct mood check ins. A subset of&#xD;
      participants (12 completers and 12 non-completers)who were offered the stress management app&#xD;
      will be asked to participate in an in-depth qualitative phone interview 6 months after&#xD;
      enrollment. Participants will be randomly selected and will include those who completed and&#xD;
      those who did not complete the program. The interviews will be conducted by research staff&#xD;
      contacting the randomly selected subjects. The qualitative interview will explore patient's&#xD;
      experience with the program and areas of suggested improvement. All interviews will be&#xD;
      audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. All study participants, regardless of the condition&#xD;
      to which they are assigned, will complete the study assessment battery at 9 and 12 months as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
