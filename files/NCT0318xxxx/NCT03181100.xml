      This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy works in&#xD;
      treating patients with anaplastic or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Vemurafenib and&#xD;
      cobimetinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs such as nab-paclitaxel and paclitaxel work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. This trial is being done to see if&#xD;
      atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy works better in treating patients with&#xD;
      anaplastic or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer compared to standard treatments.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if targeted therapy + atezolizumab (cohorts 1-3) will lead to improved&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and efficacy (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]&#xD;
      response rate, progression-free survival [PFS]) of targeted therapy + atezolizumab (cohorts&#xD;
      1-3) in ATC and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the OS in patients with PDTC treated with targeted therapy + atezolizumab&#xD;
      (cohorts 1-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the efficacy (RECIST/immune-related Response Criteria [irRC] response rate,&#xD;
      progression-free survival [PFS]) and OS of ATC and PDTC patients treated with taxanes +&#xD;
      atezolizumab (cohort 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate changes in the tumor-associated and systemic immune system biomarkers in ATC&#xD;
      and PDTC patients treated with immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To report radioactive iodine (RAI) uptake in patients who have a diagnostic whole body&#xD;
      scan and therapeutic I-131 in cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I (BRAF MUTATION): Patients receive vemurafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days&#xD;
      1-21, cobimetinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21, and atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      30-60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression and unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II (RAS, NF1, OR NF2 MUTATION including patients with MAPK activating mutations at or&#xD;
      above MEK): Patients receive cobimetinib PO QD on days 1-21 and atezolizumab IV over 30-60&#xD;
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      and unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT III (NON-BRAF/NON-RAS MUTATION): Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes&#xD;
      and bevacizumab IV over 60-90 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT IV: Patients receive nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and&#xD;
      atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Patients may receive paclitaxel IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes on day 1 as a substitute for nab-paclitaxel. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for years 1-2,&#xD;
      every 6 months for years 3-4, then yearly thereafter.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The use of corticosteroids is not allowed for 10 days prior to initiation of&#xD;
             atezolizumab except patients who are taking steroids for physiological replacement.&#xD;
             Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses are permitted in&#xD;

                  cohort 3 may be enrolled on taxane + atezolizumab cohort (cohort 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR COHORTS 1 and 2: Ocular Exclusion Criteria for&#xD;
             vemurafenib and cobimetinib containing cohorts-cohorts 1 and 2. (However, these&#xD;
             patients may be assigned other cohorts if they do not meet the ocular exclusion&#xD;
             criteria): History of or evidence of retinal pathology on ophthalmologic examination&#xD;
             that is considered a risk factor for neurosensory retinal detachment, central serous&#xD;
             chorioretinopathy, retinal vein occlusion (RVO), or neovascular macular degeneration&#xD;
             Patients will be excluded from participation in cohorts 1 and 2 if they currently are&#xD;
             known to have any of the following risk factors for RVO unless a retinal specialist&#xD;
             has determined that the risk of retinal detachment is low:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of serous retinopathy.&#xD;

             dysfunction, including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mean (average of triplicate measurements) QTc interval corrected using&#xD;
                  Fridericia's method &gt;= 480 ms at screening, or uncorrectable abnormalities in&#xD;
                  serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS IN COHORTS 1 and 2 (cobimetinib-containing&#xD;
