  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical benefit of ASP2215 therapy in&#xD;
      participants with FMS-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) mutated AML who are refractory to or have&#xD;
      relapsed after first-line AML therapy as shown with overall survival (OS) compared to salvage&#xD;
      chemotherapy. In addition, this study will evaluate safety as well as determine the overall&#xD;
      efficacy in event-free survival (EFS) and complete remission (CR) rate of ASP2215 compared to&#xD;
      salvage chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants considered an adult according to local regulations at the time of signing&#xD;
      informed consent will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive ASP2215 or salvage&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Participants will enter the screening period up to 14 days prior to the start&#xD;
      of treatment. Prior to randomization, the investigator will preselect a salvage chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen for each participant; options will include low-dose cytarabine (LoDAC), mitoxantrone,&#xD;
      etoposide and intermediate-dose cytarabine (MEC) or fludarabine, high-dose cytarabine and&#xD;
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG). The randomization will be stratified by&#xD;
      response to first-line therapy and preselected salvage chemotherapy. Participants will be&#xD;
      administered treatment over continuous 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the participants, approximately 20 Chinese participants who are randomized into the&#xD;
      ASP2215 arm will be allocated to the pharmacokinetic (PK) cohort. Participants in the PK&#xD;
      cohort will be requested to be hospitalized from the date of randomization (Day 1) to at&#xD;
      least the completion of all the assessments planned on Day 2. All participants in the PK&#xD;
      cohort will undergo blood sampling for PK measurement of ASP2215. Participants in PK cohort&#xD;
      will be administered the study drug in the same manner and undergo the same efficacy and&#xD;
      safety assessments as other participants except for blood sampling for additional PK&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
