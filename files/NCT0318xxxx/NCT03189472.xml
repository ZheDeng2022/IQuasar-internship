  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind randomized controlled pilot study to test the effects of&#xD;
      Remotely-Supervised (RS)-tDCS using a dorsolateral prefrontal cortex montage to ameliorate&#xD;
      fatigue and cognitive slowing in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue and slowed thinking are very prevalent symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD). To date there are no concrete effective treatment available for either symptom. This&#xD;
      study will test transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to ameliorate fatigue and&#xD;
      slowed thinking in PD. tDCS is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that is low-cost,&#xD;
      relatively safe, and reproducible when conducted in repeat clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following procedures for our validated protocol, participants will receive training on the&#xD;
      use of study tDCS device and pre configured laptop computer. The device will be programmed to&#xD;
      deliver either active or sham tDCS (all study personnel and participants will be blinded),&#xD;
      and operated with unlock codes provided by the study technician daily to release one session.&#xD;
      Once trained, and following an initial in-clinic baseline tDCS tolerability test and initial&#xD;
      treatment session, participants will use the equipment to complete the remaining sessions&#xD;
      from their home using our tele medicine platform. Remote supervision will be provided using&#xD;
      HIPAA secure online video conference with the study technician following clearly-defined&#xD;
      operational procedures. Participants will be monitored to determine if any predefined &quot;stop&quot;&#xD;
      criteria are met using VSee software, a telemedicine software. Additionally, Team Viewer&#xD;
      software will allow study technicians to troubleshoot any computer issues, to initiate the&#xD;
      video conference on behalf of participants, and to remotely supervise the entire tDCS&#xD;
      session.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of PD confirmed by neurologist;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parkinson fatigue scale binary coding scoring a score of &gt; 7;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to understand the informed consent process and provide consent to participate in&#xD;
             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has stable and continuous access to internet service at home compatible with the study&#xD;
             laptop (Wi-Fi or ethernet cable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate internet capacity for remote monitoring, as tested by&#xD;
             http://www.speedtest.net/)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are stable in their PD medication for 2 or more weeks prior to&#xD;
