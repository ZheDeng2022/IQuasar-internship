  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see whether Avmacol®, a dietary supplement made from broccoli&#xD;
      sprout and seed extract powder, induces changes in inner cheek cells that may be protective&#xD;
      against environmental toxins such as tobacco.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three main goals of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To learn whether the dietary supplement, Avmacol®, can stimulate cheek cells to repair&#xD;
           damage from environmental toxins;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to learn how the body metabolizes Avmacol®, by measuring its byproducts in the&#xD;
           participant's urine and blood;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to learn whether the immune system can be stimulated by Avmacol®, by studying the&#xD;
           natural killer cells and T cells in the participant's blood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study hypothesizes that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway&#xD;
      activation in oral epithelium can be induced by administering Avmacol® to patients curatively&#xD;
      treated for a first tobacco-related HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this Phase 0 clinical study is to determine the oral bioavailability of&#xD;
      sulforaphane in the commercially available dietary supplement, Avmacol®, and to determine the&#xD;
      level of pharmacodynamic upregulation of NRF2 target gene transcripts that occurs in the oral&#xD;
      epithelium of patients who have completed curative treatment for tobacco-related HNSCC,&#xD;
      including high grade dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or invasive carcinoma.&#xD;
