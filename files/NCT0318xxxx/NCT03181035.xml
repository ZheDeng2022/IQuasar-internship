  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study in the form of a prospective Phase II, single centre, single arm&#xD;
      hypoxia study of oral tongue cancer with FAZA-PET imaging and pimonidazole targeted IHC of&#xD;
      surgical specimens.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In head and neck cancer, areas of tumours with low oxygen supply (called tumour hypoxia)&#xD;
      harbour cells that are resistant to radiation and are prone to metastasize. Modern&#xD;
      radiotherapy techniques are precise enough to deliver radiation to these small areas and&#xD;
      could be used to target these areas to receive higher doses of radiation than the rest of the&#xD;
      tumour to overcome resistance. Hypoxia can be &quot;seen&quot; in the body using special imaging such&#xD;
      as [F-18]-FAZA-PET ([F-18]-Fluoroazomycin arabinoside positron emission tomography) but it&#xD;
      has not been tested as a method for creating radiation treatment targets. As part of regular&#xD;
      pathology tumour tissue is sliced extremely thinly (&lt;1/100th of a millimeter) and stained so&#xD;
      that individual cells can be seen under a microscope. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special&#xD;
      type of &quot;stain&quot; that can specifically highlight hypoxic areas. This method is considered the&#xD;
      most accurate way to inspect for the presence of hypoxia. There is not a specific staining&#xD;
      target for hypoxia ordinarily, but when patients ingest a substance called pimonidazole&#xD;
      hydrochloride (HCl) it builds up specifically in hypoxic areas and can be targeted for IHC&#xD;
      staining. In this study participants with oral tongue cancer will have a [F-18]-FAZA-PET scan&#xD;
      and take a single dose of oral pimonidazole-HCl before having surgery to remove their cancer.&#xD;
      The whole tumour will be used to create microscope slides using very thin slices of the&#xD;
      tumour. The slices will be stained using IHC to show where the pimonidazole has built up and&#xD;
      digital scans of the slides will be made. The hypoxia seen on the FAZA-PET scan will be&#xD;
      &quot;matched&quot; with hypoxia on the electronic slides to see if the FAZA truly shows where hypoxia&#xD;
      is in tumours and if it could be used as a way to plan radiation treatments to deliver more&#xD;
      radiation to just those areas.&#xD;
