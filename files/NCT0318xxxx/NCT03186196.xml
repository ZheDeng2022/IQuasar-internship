  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The C677T polymorphism of the MTHFR gene is associated to several biochemicals imbalances, as&#xD;
      changes in folic acid serum levels and some inflammatory markers, elevating the oxidative&#xD;
      stress and increasing the risk of developing non communicable diseases (NCDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, a diet containing folate as a main antioxidant nutrient, could reduce not only the&#xD;
      oxidative stress, but also has many others benefits for individuals with this genetic&#xD;
      alteration, like the anti-inflammatory function, which could help restore the altered serum&#xD;
      levels and minimizing or avoiding the development of future diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the C677T polymorphism of the MTHFR&#xD;
      gene and the effect of a diet containing folate in the inflammatory markers levels, such as&#xD;
      homocysteine, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukins in women with overweight&#xD;
      or obesity. This is an intervention study, double-blind, held in a city in northeastern&#xD;
      Brazil, with a sample of 48 adult women (20-59 years old) with BMI among 26.19 kg / m² and&#xD;
      49.64 kg / m². In which we evaluated the TNF-α levels, Interleukins 1β, Interleukin 6,&#xD;
      Interleukin 8, Interleukin 12p70, Interleukin 10, homocysteine, folic acid and in addition to&#xD;
      these markers evaluation, were made the genotyping for the C677T polymorphism in the MTHFR&#xD;
      gene and the food consumption assessment by the 24 hour dietary recall (24HR). For the&#xD;
      intervention, the sample was divided by randomization into two groups, each one with 24&#xD;
      indivuals, receiving daily during 8 weeks, a salad with 300g vegetables containing 191 ug of&#xD;
      folate for group 1 and 90 ug for group 2.&#xD;

      This work is linked to a population-based survey entitled &quot;Diagnosis and Intervention II&#xD;
      Cycle Situation Food, Nutrition and Noncommunicable Diseases prevalent over the city of João&#xD;
      Pessoa Population / PB&quot; (II DISANDNT / PB). For the realization of this dissertation we&#xD;
      (teams of undergraduate researchers and graduates of Nutrition Course, masters and doctoral&#xD;
      students of the Post Graduate Program in Nutrition Sciences (PPGCN) of UFPB) did home visits,&#xD;
      applied questionnaires related to anthropometric and food intake assessment, by duly&#xD;
      previously trained at the beginning of data collection and after completion of the pilot&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the selection of individuals from the sample of adults who participated in the II&#xD;
      DISANDNT / JP and considering the inclusion criteria and genotyping of the C677T polymorphism&#xD;
      in the MTHFR gene, they were invited to participate.&#xD;
