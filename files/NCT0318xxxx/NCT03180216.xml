      This Phase I dose-escalation trial is designed to evaluate the safety of rapidly generated&#xD;
      multivirus-specific T-cell products with antiviral activity against CMV, EBV, adenovirus,&#xD;
      HHV6, BK virus, JC virus, and human parainfluenza-3 (HPIV3), derived from eligible HSCT&#xD;
      donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, we will utilize a rapid generation protocol for broad spectrum&#xD;
      multivirus-specific T cells for infusion to recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (HSCT), who are at risk of developing EBV, CMV, adenovirus, HHV6, BKV, JCV and/or&#xD;
      HPIV3, or with PCR/culture confirmed active infection(s) of EBV, CMV, adenovirus, HHV6, BKV,&#xD;
      JCV, and/or HPIV3 that has failed to resolve with at least 14 days of standard antiviral&#xD;
      therapy (if available and tolerated). These cells will be derived from HSCT donors, and the&#xD;
      study agent will be assessed at each dose for evidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have two arms: Arm A will include patients who receive prophylactic&#xD;
      treatment, and Arm B will include patients who receive VSTs for one or more active infections&#xD;
      with targeted viruses. Determination of the study arm will be determined by the patient's&#xD;
      clinical status. Study arms will each be analyzed for safety endpoints and secondary&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;

      Viral infections are normally controlled by T-cell immunity and are a cause of significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality during the period of immune recovery after hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT). Risk for infection is impacted by the degree of tissue mismatch&#xD;
      between donor and recipient and the immune status of the donor, including the degree and&#xD;
      length of immunosuppression following transplantation. Reactivation of latent viruses such as&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and Human Herpesvirus 6B (HHV6) are common&#xD;
      and often cause symptomatic disease. Reactivations of the polyomaviruses BK virus and JC&#xD;
      virus are also common and frequently cause renal disease including hemorrhagic cystitis and&#xD;
      less commonly neurologic disease (pervasive multifocal leukoencephalopathy). Respiratory&#xD;
      viruses such as adenovirus and human parainfluenza also frequently cause infection. Antiviral&#xD;
      pharmacologic agents are only effective against some of these viruses; their use is costly,&#xD;
      and associated with significant toxicities and the outgrowth of drug-resistant mutants. As&#xD;
      delay in recovery of virus-specific cellular immune response is clearly associated with viral&#xD;
      reactivation and disease in these patients, cellular immunotherapy to restore viral-specific&#xD;
      immunity is an attractive option that has already been successfully used to target several of&#xD;
      these viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To broaden the specificity of single T cells lines to include the three most common viral&#xD;
      pathogens of stem cell recipients, the investigators reactivated CMV and adenovirus-specific&#xD;
      T cells by using mononuclear cells transduced with a recombinant adenoviral vector encoding&#xD;
      the CMV antigen pp65 (Ad5f35CMVpp65). Subsequent stimulations with EBV-LCL transduced with&#xD;
      the same vector both reactivated EBV-specific T cells and maintained the expansion of the&#xD;
      activated adenovirus and CMV-specific T cells. This method reliably produced T cells with&#xD;
      cytotoxic function specific for all three viruses, which the investigators infused into 14&#xD;
      stem cell recipients in a Phase I prophylaxis study. The investigators observed recovery of&#xD;
      immunity to CMV and EBV in all patients but an increase in adenovirus-specific T cells was&#xD;
      only seen in patients who had evidence of adenovirus infection pre-infusion. A follow-up&#xD;
      study in which the frequency of adenovirus-specific T cells was increased in the infused T&#xD;
      cells produced similar results, thus highlighting the importance of endogenous antigen to&#xD;
      promote the expansion of infused T cells in vivo. Nevertheless, all patients in both clinical&#xD;
      trials with pre-infusion CMV, adenovirus or EBV infection or reactivation were able to clear&#xD;
      the infection, including one patient with severe adenoviral pneumonia requiring ventilatory&#xD;
      support. T cells recognizing multiple antigens can therefore produce clinically relevant&#xD;
      effects against all three viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have extended the number of targeted viruses, and included HHV6B, BK virus,&#xD;
      and Varicella-zoster virus (VZV). In a recent study, 11 patients were treated with VST&#xD;
      targeting 5-viruses (CMV, EBV, Adv, HHV6B, BKV) which were generated using a rapid protocol&#xD;
      with overlapping peptides encompassing 12 viral protein. VST infusion resulted in a 94%&#xD;
      antiviral response rate in these patients (complete or partial responses against CMV=3/3,&#xD;
      EBV=5/5, Adv=1/1, HHV6B=2/2, BKV=6/7). Two of the patients who received 5-virus VST developed&#xD;
      transplant-associated microangiopathy, which was deemed secondary to HSCT and unrelated to&#xD;
      VST infusion. One of these patients developed grade II skin GVHD, which improved with topical&#xD;
      therapy. In another recent study, ten adult patients were prophylactically treated with VST&#xD;
      specific for CMV, EBV, Adv, and Varicella (VZV). These VSTs were generated using&#xD;
      donor-derived dendritic cells which were infected with either Ad5f35-pp65 or with varivax&#xD;
      vaccine, and were then pooled and used to stimulate donor PBMCs. All ten patients were&#xD;
      protected against EBV, Adv, and VZV. Six patients developed CMV reactivation, but only one&#xD;
      required antiviral therapy. Of these 10 patients, 7 developed acute or chronic GVHD, though&#xD;
      compared to a non-treated group at the same institution, the rate of GVHD did not differ&#xD;
      significantly. Thus, it has been possible to target an extended panel of viruses with a&#xD;
      single VST product.&#xD;
