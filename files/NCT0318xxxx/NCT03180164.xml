  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic airways diseases involve alterations in the person's social roles, relationships and&#xD;
      self-perception so demands continual psychological adjustment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also Kunik studied patients with chronic breathing disorders for depression and anxiety and&#xD;
      found that 65% of patients were positive for depression and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shackell found that patients' anxiety and fears of breathlessness and dying extended into the&#xD;
      night and were aggravated by feelings of isolation and frustration. One patient reported that&#xD;
      they often thought 'am I going to see the next morning?'&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This fear and sense of helplessness can lead to panic and evidence suggests that patients&#xD;
      with chronic breathlessness often call for emergency assistance during the night According to&#xD;
      GOLD report 2017, anxiety and depression in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients&#xD;
      are both associated with poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of the evidence explored so far relates to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. While&#xD;
      other chronic lung diseases have received less attention In addition to, several studies have&#xD;
      been found relationship between asthma and psychological disturbance .One review of&#xD;
      literature describes an increased prevalence of psychological co-morbidity in asthmatic&#xD;
      adults and another research suggests that anxiety and depression are more common in patients&#xD;
      with moderate to severe asthma than in the general population Gift. found significantly&#xD;
      greater self-reported depression scores among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease receiving prednisone compared to patients not receiving any steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, the psychiatric sequel of steroid treatment are often sudden in onset and&#xD;
      appear to generally occur within 2 weeks after steroid introduction&#xD;
