      This study will be a randomized open-label pilot study. The purpose of the study is to&#xD;
      compare standard of care outpatient heart failure management versus a weight based torsemide&#xD;
      regimen. Subjects admitted to the hospital for heart failure exacerbation will be randomized&#xD;
      upon discharge to either standard of care outpatient heart failure management or a weight&#xD;
      based torsemide regimen. Those subjects randomized to standard of care therapy will be&#xD;
      prescribed a daily fixed dose of a loop diuretic at hospital discharge and have a follow-up&#xD;
      appointment within one week of discharge. All management decisions including loop diuretic&#xD;
      type, dose and frequency will be made at the discretion of the subject's personal physician.&#xD;
      Those randomized to an individualized weight based torsemide regimen will be prescribed a&#xD;
      dose of torsemide upon hospital discharge based on a prespecified algorithm. These subjects&#xD;
      will then undergo physician-subject phone encounters three times a week where the subject's&#xD;
      torsemide dose will be modified based on the prespecified algorithm which incorporates&#xD;
      current symptoms and weight. Primary end-point will be an unbiased estimate of 30-day all&#xD;
      cause readmission rates. Secondary end-points include incidence of acute kidney injury,&#xD;
      changes in brain natriuretic peptide levels from baseline and a preliminary estimate of the&#xD;
      effect size and feasibility of a weight-based torsemide regimen intervention in order to plan&#xD;
      a future larger study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label parallel randomized pilot study comparing an individualized&#xD;
      weight-based torsemide dosing regimen vs. standard outpatient management in patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of heart failure.The study will include consenting subjects who are admitted to&#xD;
      Jacobi Medical Center with heart failure and were treated with loop diuretic therapy during&#xD;
      hospitalization. Prior to discharge, these subjects will be randomized to one of two groups,&#xD;
      either an individualized weight-based torsemide regimen group vs. a standard heart failure&#xD;
      management group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, all subjects will undergo an initial assessment prior to discharge. All&#xD;
      subjects will be examined, weighed and assigned a composite congestion score (CCS). CCS is a&#xD;
      measurement of current fluid status that has been shown to correlate with clinical outcomes&#xD;
      in heart failure patients (19). It assesses a patient's signs and symptoms of congestion,&#xD;
      including dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue, jugular venous distention, rales and peripheral edema.&#xD;
      Each category is given a score from 0-3, 0=none, 1=mild,2=moderate and 3=severe. Each subject&#xD;
      is given a final composite score for their current volume status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge, those randomized to standard care will receive standard heart failure care&#xD;
      as currently provided in our institution. This routinely includes, but is not limited to, an&#xD;
      appointment with their primary care physician within one week of discharge, nutrition&#xD;
      consultation, and social work evaluation with support services provided as determined by the&#xD;
      social worker. At discharge, all heart failure medication changes including diuretic type,&#xD;
      dose and frequency, as well as further management decisions, will be left to the discretion&#xD;
      of the subject and the subject's doctors. Those who will be randomized to the individualized&#xD;
      weight-based torsemide regimen will be given a standup home scale and torsemide 20mg tabs in&#xD;
      a bottle with 100 tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial torsemide dose will be assigned based on the patient's GFR and CCS at discharge.&#xD;
      These subjects will then have a phone encounter with a physician three times a week where&#xD;
      subjects will be instructed to modify the torsemide dose based on their current weight.&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to weigh themselves at the same time of the day, postvoid, prior&#xD;
      to eating, prior to the medication dose, and while wearing the same clothing for consistency.&#xD;
      The scales should stand on a flat, solid surface rather than carpets unless specifically&#xD;
      designed for use in that setting. All phone call encounters and loop diuretic changes will be&#xD;
      based on the pre-specified algorithm. These subjects will also receive all the same care and&#xD;
      support as a standard subject, including the primary care appointment in one week and other&#xD;
      support services, except with instructions to the subject and provider to follow the loop&#xD;
      diuretic recommendations from this protocol. Subjects who have been instructed to take more&#xD;
      than 80 torsemide 20mg tablets will receive a delivery of 100 additional torsemide 20mg&#xD;
      tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects in the study will have follow up visit at week 5 from discharge date. Total&#xD;
      diuretic use during the study period will be assessed and current symptoms/quality of life&#xD;
      will be evaluated using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. The patient will&#xD;
      receive a physical examination including a final weight and calculation of composite&#xD;
      congestion score. Serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) will be obtained as well as a basic&#xD;
      metabolic panel and serum magnesium level to assess for electrolyte disturbances and changes&#xD;
      in kidney function. Intervention group subjects will have a count of the remaining number of&#xD;
      torsemide tablets in the bottle of torsemide given to them at discharge. Compliance with the&#xD;
      algorithm will be assessed by comparing the number of remaining tablets with the number of&#xD;
      tablets prescribed during the study. Subjects whose follow-up visit occurs over 45 days after&#xD;
      the date of hospital discharge for the enrollment hospitalization shall be deemed to be late&#xD;
      for follow-up. Acute kidney injury (AKI) will be defined as an increase in serum creatinine&#xD;
      concentration of 0.3 at the five-week follow-up visit compared to the final serum creatinine&#xD;
      level measured during hospitalization. Adherence will be measured by comparing the number of&#xD;
      tablets in the subject's torsemide supply to the number of expected tablets in the torsemide&#xD;
      supply. Adherence will be defined as a tablet count consistent with the subject having taken&#xD;
      88% or more of the expected torsemide tablets&#xD;
