  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is widely argued that the promotion of water consumption, as an alternative to&#xD;
      sugar-sweetened beverages, can assist in childhood obesity prevention efforts. Yet no studies&#xD;
      have tested this argument in real world schools where flavored milk or juices are available.&#xD;
      This trial will fill gaps by examining how promoting fresh water intake-both in schools that&#xD;
      do and do not provide access to caloric beverages -impacts children's consumption of food and&#xD;
      beverages both during and outside of school, and obesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining a healthy weight is important for young children because childhood obesity is&#xD;
      predictive of adult obesity and related chronic illness. Intake of sugar-sweetened beverages&#xD;
      (SSBs: sodas, flavored milks, fruit-flavored drinks, and other drinks with added sugar) is a&#xD;
      major contributor to obesity. This is particularly true for low income children who are more&#xD;
      likely to drink SSBs and to be obese. Children spend substantial time in schools where they&#xD;
      consume up to 50% of daily calories, including those from SSBs. Consequently, many obesity&#xD;
      prevention efforts have targeted reductions in SSB intake in schools. Recently, scientific&#xD;
      authorities have also recommended that schools improve the availability of potable and free&#xD;
      drinking water - a healthy alternative to SSBs - as a low-cost and feasible obesity&#xD;
      prevention strategy. Emerging policies also mandate water access in schools; but&#xD;
      implementation is poor. Although the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act requires schools&#xD;
      participating in federal meal programs to provide free potable water where meals are served,&#xD;
      25% of US schools still fail to do so. And even in schools that offer free water, drinking&#xD;
      fountains may be avoided due to concerns about cleanliness or sub-standard water quality.&#xD;
      While promotion of drinking water intake in schools is a plausible obesity prevention&#xD;
      strategy, no large studies have systematically examined how this tactic can change children's&#xD;
      overall dietary patterns and obesity rates in schools that offer SSBs and juices. This&#xD;
      study's central hypothesis is that in elementary schools, increased access to fresh water and&#xD;
      rigorous promotion of its consumption will reduce student intake of caloric beverages,&#xD;
      thereby leading to lower rates of obesity. This hypothesis will be tested through a&#xD;
      cluster-randomized trial in 26 low-income elementary schools in the San Francisco Bay Area,&#xD;
      in which 13 schools will receive a water promotion intervention and 13 schools will serve as&#xD;
      controls. The intervention, based on Social Cognitive Theory and the PRECEDE-PROCEED Model&#xD;
      and cultivated in the investigators' prior developmental studies, promotes water consumption&#xD;
      by: 1) installing lead-free water stations in cafeterias, physical activity spaces and&#xD;
      high-traffic common areas, 2) providing cups and reusable water bottles for students, and 3)&#xD;
      conducting a 6-month health education campaign that includes a kick-off play, class lessons,&#xD;
      family homework activities, signage, and rewards. From baseline to 9 and 15 months after the&#xD;
      start of the intervention, researchers will measure differences in: 1) water intake&#xD;
      (observations and measurements of water taken from water sources) 2) total caloric intake&#xD;
      from foods and beverages (24-hour food and beverage diaries) and 3) overweight/obesity&#xD;
      prevalence between students in intervention and control schools. If the proposed school water&#xD;
      intervention is effective, school officials will have a feasible and low-cost obesity&#xD;
      prevention tool. US schools will soon be federally mandated to reevaluate their wellness&#xD;
      policies in order to implement new food and beverage regulations. This study presents a&#xD;
      timely opportunity to provide leaders with an evidence-based strategy for improving student&#xD;
      nutrition and health.&#xD;
