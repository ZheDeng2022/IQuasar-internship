  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, open-label, non-controlled, multicenter phase II clinical trial&#xD;
      with two different primary objectives: a biological and a clinical objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a clinical point of view, the objective is to assess the clinical benefit of the&#xD;
      combination of palbociclib and hormonotherapy in patients with advance breast cancer that had&#xD;
      previously received endocrine therapy in combination with palbociclib and had achieved&#xD;
      clinical benefit during palbociclib treatment with subsequent disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a biological point of view, the challenge is to define a molecular profile that allow&#xD;
      identifying patients that could benefit more from continuing on palbociclib after progression&#xD;
      on a prior palbociclib-containing regimen&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will receive palbociclib capsules orally for 21 days every four weeks in&#xD;
      combination with endocrine therapy (physician's choice based on prior administered agent&#xD;
      including tamoxifen, exemestane, fulvestrant, anastrozole, or letrozole).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive treatment until disease progression (with the exception of patients who&#xD;
      develop isolated progression in the brain), unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation&#xD;
      from the study treatment for any other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients discontinuing the study treatment period will enter a post-treatment follow-up&#xD;
      period during which survival and new anti-cancer therapy information will be collected every&#xD;
      six months (± 14 days) from the last dose of investigational product. The treatment follow-up&#xD;
      period will conclude at six months after the last patient has received first treatment dose&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
