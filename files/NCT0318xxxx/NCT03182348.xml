  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of illness and death in the world. The disease&#xD;
      involves narrowing of blood vessels due to deposits of fat which can become coated in&#xD;
      calcium. It is treated by percutaneous coronary intervention in which a balloon is passed&#xD;
      down the blood vessel to remove the obstruction and where appropriate a stent is placed in&#xD;
      the blood vessel to scaffold it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early stage research suggests that the growth of small blood vessels in and around the&#xD;
      deposits of fat and calcium leads to the growth of the deposit and may contribute to plaque&#xD;
      rupture into the vessel leading to clot formation the process which leads to heart attacks.&#xD;
      Drugs which prevent the development of these small blood vessel restrict the development of&#xD;
      the deposit, and those that encourage the development of these small blood vessel also&#xD;
      increase the development of the deposit. Researchers would like to find out more about the&#xD;
      system of blood vessels around deposits of fat and calcium in the larger blood vessels. This&#xD;
      involves looking just beneath the surface of the blood vessel wall, and requires a detailed&#xD;
      and accurate image. Researchers on this project would like to find out if optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT) is a suitable technique for imaging in this way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT works like an ultrasound, but using light instead of sound waves. The additional imaging&#xD;
      will prolong the clinical procedure by 10-15 minutes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of illness and death in the world. Central to the&#xD;
      process of this disease is the narrowing of blood vessels due to deposits of fatty residue&#xD;
      which can become coated in calcium. Significant narrowing of the blood vessels is treated by&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention in which a balloon is inflated and passed down the blood&#xD;
      vessel to remove the obstruction and where appropriate a stent is placed in the blood vessel&#xD;
      to scaffold it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants are those who have been scheduled for a percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention, are stable, and have a diagnosis of angina pectoris, unstable angina or acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome. These patients will be identified and screened by their healthcare team.&#xD;
      Potential participants will be given study information by their healthcare team, or&#xD;
      identified to the research team who will provide study information. The initial approach may&#xD;
      be in clinic, in hospital, or by post.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to give written informed consent to participate in the study. At&#xD;
      the clinical pre-procedure visit consent is sought, exclusion and inclusion criteria checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: On the day of the patients procedure they will receive standard clinical care&#xD;
      comprising angiography (imaging of the blood vessel), angioplasty (removal of fatty deposits&#xD;
      with a balloon) and stenting. Before and after the procedure the patient will receive&#xD;
      medication and after care as per standard clinical care. Those patients who are clinically&#xD;
      indicated for stenting will undergo OCT imaging prior to the angioplasty and stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers need to allow flexibility in the process of acquiring the OCT images, so they&#xD;
      can optimize the quality of the image. Therefore, the speed of pullback (removal of the&#xD;
      catheter) and choice of blood clearing agents will not be pre-specified. Serial images of the&#xD;
      same part of the vessel may be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the clinical angioplasty procedure the patient will have a coronary guidewire&#xD;
      passed down the artery usually from the groin to the heart which is used to position balloons&#xD;
      and stents. OCT passes over the wire in the same way. From the patients perspective the&#xD;
      procedure may take a small amount of additional time - maximum 10-15 minutes. We would like&#xD;
      to be able to pass a second wire down the same coronary artery called a 'buddy wire' which is&#xD;
      sometimes required in coronary procedures. This would be used to inflate a balloon at low&#xD;
      pressure near the area of interest in the heart in order either to exclude blood or to oppose&#xD;
      the OCT catheter to the vessel wall if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient returns for subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention they will be invited&#xD;
      to participate again.&#xD;
