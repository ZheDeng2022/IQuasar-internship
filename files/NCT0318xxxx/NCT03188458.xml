  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to support the recommendation of vaccination of all pregnant&#xD;
      women in Colombia with Diptheria, tetanus and pertussis (dTpa) by studying the transfer of&#xD;
      pertussis specific IgG antibodies from mother to the child.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the immunogenicity in infants (at birth and just prior to primary&#xD;
      pertussis vaccination [i.e. diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis [DTP] vaccination] administered&#xD;
      at 8 weeks of age), of a single Boostrix booster dose administered to their mothers during&#xD;
      the second or third trimester as per routine practice in Bogota, Colombia.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    As similar local evidence recently available, present study will not add new information; no&#xD;
    ethical justification exists to continue study procedures.&#xD;
