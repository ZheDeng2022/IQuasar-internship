    <textblock>
      Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH) is a rare complication that occurs 1 to 5 years after&#xD;
      gastric bypass surgery. The underlying mechanism of this complication is not yet completely&#xD;
      understood. Changes in hormone levels, such as GLP1 after RYGB, nesidioblastosis or an&#xD;
      increase in the number of beta cells may be one of the underlying causes. However, several&#xD;
      study results are conflicting and it is hypothesized that the patient population with HH&#xD;
      after RYGB is heterogeneous and several underlying causes may be present. In order to&#xD;
      differentiate between hyperfunction with normal beta cell mass and a general or localized&#xD;
      increase in beta cell mass we aim to compare quantitative 68Ga-exendin-4 PET imaging of the&#xD;
      pancreas between patients with and without HH after RYGB. Thereby, investigators aim to&#xD;
      increase the insight in the underlying mechanism of HH after RYGB. If different underlying&#xD;
      causes can be diagnosed, treatment for HH can be optimized for patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycemia after bariatric surgery. Overweight and obesity are an&#xD;
      increasing health problem globally and in the Netherlands, about 15% of the population in the&#xD;
      Netherlands is obese. Obesity is associated with increased risk of morbidity, such as&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Weight loss is the most important&#xD;
      intervention in obese patients, reducing obesity related morbidity and increasing life&#xD;
      expectancy. Non-invasive weight loss interventions such as diet, lifestyle or medication only&#xD;
      have a moderate effect which is short lived. Weight reducing surgery, i.e. bariatric surgery,&#xD;
      is the only intervention that leads to persistent weight loss and is superior above&#xD;
      conventional treatment. The most performed and preferred bariatric surgery is Roux-en-Y&#xD;
      Gastric Bypass (RYGB), which is a food restrictive and malabsorptive procedure. Besides&#xD;
      weight loss, metabolic improvement in T2D patients is an additional result after RYGB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A frequent late complication of RYGB is the dumping syndrome and a rare late complication is&#xD;
      hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycemia (HH). Reported incidences of dumping syndrome range from 20 to&#xD;
      70% of the patients. Dumping is a condition where food enters the small bowel too rapidly and&#xD;
      can be divided into early and late dumping. Early dumping is due to rapid gastric emptying&#xD;
      and comprises intestinal and vasomotor symptoms within minutes after food ingestion. Late&#xD;
      dumping occurs 1 to 3 hours after a meal and the symptoms are partly caused by hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reported incidences of HH range from 0.2 to 1% after RYGB and is observed after gastric&#xD;
      bypass procedures only. In HH plasma glucose concentrations reach values below 50 mg/dL (2.8&#xD;
      mmol/L) and adrenergic and neuroglucopenic symptoms occur, often occurring after a meal.&#xD;
      After a meal or glucose challenge an early large glucose peak followed by an insulin peak is&#xD;
      observed in HH patients. Additionally, an increased postprandial GLP1 level compared to RYGB&#xD;
      controls without HH was observed. Low plasma glucose levels are also found in asymptomatic&#xD;
      patients after RYGB in 30 to 50% of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying mechanism of HH is not completely understood and several potential causes have&#xD;
      been proposed, including, 1) An inappropriate increase of beta cell mass and function, that&#xD;
      is persisting despite the increased insulin sensitivity after RYGB, 2) late dumping syndrome,&#xD;
      i.e. an inappropriate insulin secretion following rapid food entry into the small intestine,&#xD;
      3) an inappropriate counter-regulatory glucagon response and 4) post-RYGB an increase in the&#xD;
      incretin secretion (GLP1 and GIP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides stimulation of the postprandial insulin secretion, GLP1 may induce beta cell&#xD;
      hypertrophy or an increase in the number of beta cells by inhibiting apoptosis and increasing&#xD;
      replication. Nesidioblastosis (beta cell hypertrophy, islet hyperplasia and increased beta&#xD;
      cell mass) is associated with HH after RYGB in some cases, however, nesidioblastosis was not&#xD;
      found in these patients and an overexpression of GLP1-receptors in individual islets was not&#xD;
      found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed treatment options for HH after RYGB include diet therapy with a low-carbohydrate&#xD;
      diet, drug therapy to inhibit carbohydrate digestion (acarbose) or to inhibit insulin&#xD;
      secretion by beta cells (e.g. diaxozide, octreotide, pasireotide) or surgical treatment by a&#xD;
      reconstruction of the gastric bypass or by a partial pancreatectomy. The effectiveness of&#xD;
      these therapies vary among patients, we expect that the effectiveness of different treatments&#xD;
      depends on the underlying cause of HH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different possible underlying mechanisms and different types of treatment suggest diverse&#xD;
      causes of HH. In order to increase the insight in these causes and to be able to determine&#xD;
      the best treatment for each patient in the future, the underlying cause(s) will be examined&#xD;
      first in this study. In previous studies that assessed beta cell mass, only only pathological&#xD;
      assessment of pancreas specimens was performed, because in vivo assessment was impossible.&#xD;
      The control group was determined from patients undergoing a (partial) pancreatectomy for&#xD;
      other diseases or post-mortem. However, ideally the control group would consist of patients&#xD;
      who have had RYGB as well, without developing HH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it became possible to assess beta cell mass in vivo by SPECT and PET imaging. In&#xD;
      this study it is examined if this imaging technique can detect an increase in beta cell mass&#xD;
      in patients suffering from persisting HH after RYGB. For this purpose we will compare beta&#xD;
      cell mass in patients with and without HH after RYGB. Additionally, beta cell function and&#xD;
      postprandial incretin responses will be determined in these subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this pilot study may lead to improved diagnostics and treatment options for&#xD;
      persisting HH in bariatric patients in future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging of beta cells in vivo by GLP-1 receptor imaging by PET For specific non-invasive&#xD;
      imaging of beta cells, investogators have developed a highly beta cell-specific radiolabeled&#xD;
      exendin-based GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) analog which, after radiolabeling, can&#xD;
      non-invasively be detected in the human body. GLP-1 is an incretin hormone that specifically&#xD;
      binds to beta cells and is responsible for post-prandial insulin-secretion. Its specificity&#xD;
      for beta cells has been shown and a linear correlation of the beta cell mass and the signal&#xD;
      obtained with this tracer has been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLP-1R imaging has been shown to be suitable for imaging of insulin producing pancreatic&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumours (IPPNET). Furthermore, the feasibility of visualization of&#xD;
      transplanted beta cells with GLP-1R imaging has been shown by imaging of autologous islets&#xD;
      transplanted into muscle.&#xD;
