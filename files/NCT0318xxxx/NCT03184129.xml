      To verify and assess the safety and efficacy of newly developed knee prosthesis (Wuhan&#xD;
      Yijiabao Biomaterial Co., Ltd.) in total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Total knee arthroplasty is one of major means in the treatment of end-stage knee&#xD;
      disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a safe, effective, high-quality and&#xD;
      inexpensive knee prosthesis so as to meet the huge demand for replacement repair in patients&#xD;
      with knee diseases in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined with international advanced design concept, Wuhan Yijiabao Biomaterial Co., Ltd. of&#xD;
      China has developed a new set of knee prosthesis system with cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloy&#xD;
      and high cross-linked polyethylene as the main materials. This knee prosthesis system&#xD;
      contains femoral condyle, meniscus, tibial tray, and patella. This system uses&#xD;
      cobalt-chrome-molybdenum and high cross-linked polyethylene as the active friction interface,&#xD;
      which has excellent wear resistance, and provides an ideal treatment for patients with knee&#xD;
      diseases. The difference in the efficacy and safety between widely used knee prosthesis and&#xD;
      this newly developed knee prosthesis after total knee arthroplasty deserves further&#xD;
      verification by randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection, management, analysis, and open access&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection: The researchers will fill out a papery case report form for each case.&#xD;
           The case report form will be truthfully and carefully recorded in detailed to ensure&#xD;
           that the case report form is complete, authentic and reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data management: The entire experiment will strictly enforce quality management&#xD;
           specification for clinical trials. All papery case report form records will be complete,&#xD;
           true, clear and objective. All data will be input to the computer, locked and stored.&#xD;
           The completed case report form will be reviewed by the inspector. The first page of the&#xD;
           case report form will be handed over to the data manager for data entry and management.&#xD;
           From then on, the contents of the case report form will not be altered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data analysis: After the test plan has been determined, the statisticians will be&#xD;
           responsible for consultation with the major researchers and formulate a statistical&#xD;
           analysis plan. All data will be analyzed using SAS9.3 software. Statistical analysis&#xD;
           includes actual number of participants in the two groups, the conditions of dropped-out&#xD;
           and eliminated cases, demographic and other baseline characteristics, efficacy analysis,&#xD;
           and safety analysis. Besides the statistical methods listed below, detailed and&#xD;
           additional exploratory analyses may be necessary, and may be identified in the study&#xD;
           report and analysis plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data open access: If the researchers want to publish or disclose the results obtained&#xD;
           from the products of this clinical trial, they must have the prior written consent of&#xD;
           the sponsor. The sponsor will review and reply the contents of the proposed disclosure&#xD;
           within 30 working days. Without the consent of the researchers, the sponsor will not use&#xD;
           the name of the researcher in the advertising of the test equipment. However, in the&#xD;
           case of a clinical trial of the test instrument and the submission of a production&#xD;
           license to the China Food and Drug Administration, the sponsor can, without the consent&#xD;
           of the researchers, directly use all the results obtained from the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control The researchers will strictly comply with the state regulations on the&#xD;
      clinical trials of medical devices and the relevant operating procedures. Institutional and&#xD;
      personnel requirements: The research center must obtain the qualification of the national&#xD;
      clinical drug testing institution in orthopedics. Before the trial, the related personnels&#xD;
      will be trained, including clinical protocols, informed procedures, equipment use, and file&#xD;
      filling. During the trial, the researchers and test-related personnels will receive targeted&#xD;
      training according to the clinical situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data will be analyzed using SAS 9.3 software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measurement data will be expressed as means ± standard deviation and minimums and&#xD;
           maximums. Measurement data and registration data will be described by frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The difference in the excellent and good rate between the trial and control groups and&#xD;
           its 95%CI will be calculated. The lower limit greater than -10.0% can be considered as&#xD;
           non-inferiority. Measurement data will be compared using two-sample t-test or Mann&#xD;
           Whitney U rank sum test between the two groups. Intergroup comparison will be conducted&#xD;
           using Pearson's chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Ranked data in both groups will&#xD;
           be analyzed using Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Efficacy evaluation: The excellent and good rate between the trial and control groups&#xD;
           will receive non-inferiority trial. Non-inferiority margin δ = 10.0%. The test is&#xD;
           assumed to be:&#xD;
&#xD;
           H0: Difference of excellent and good rate between the trial and control groups (πT-πC) ≤&#xD;
           -δ H1: Difference of excellent and good rate between the trial and control groups&#xD;
           (πT-πC) &gt; -δ Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test will be considered to compare the difference&#xD;
           of excellent and good rate between the trial and control groups and to calculate the&#xD;
           lower limit of 95%CI on one side. The lower limit greater than -10.0% will be considered&#xD;
           as non-inferiority.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Safety evaluation: The incidence of adverse events between the two groups will be&#xD;
           compared using chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Data processing for patients undergoing arthroplasty on both knees: If the indicators&#xD;
           are evaluated separately on both sides, the data on one side are included in the&#xD;
           statistical analysis set under two conditions. When both knees are operated&#xD;
           simultaneously, data of the knee with poor postoperative efficacy will be taken into the&#xD;
           analysis set. When both knees are operated in different stages, data of the knee&#xD;
           undergoing the second operation will be taken into the analysis set.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Report deviated from the original statistical plan: In case of &quot;incomplete&#xD;
           implementation of statistical analysis plan&quot;, the change procedure will be applied in&#xD;
           advance. For example, changes in the statistical plan shall be faithfully recorded in&#xD;
           the statistical analysis plan, including place, reason and time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Subjects' selection criteria and set analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full analysis set: According to the intention-to-treat principle, the data sets consisting of&#xD;
      subjects who participated in the treatment and had baseline efficacy evaluation. For subjects&#xD;
      who do not have the overall efficacy evaluation, the last observation carry forward principle&#xD;
      will be used for data conversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per protocol set: Patients have finished the trial and breach of inclusion criteria or&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety set: All subjects using the test apparatus and who have at least one baseline safety&#xD;
      evaluation. The efficacy analysis will be carried out on the basis of full analysis set and&#xD;
      per protocol set. All baseline demographic data analyses will be conducted on the full&#xD;
      analysis set, and security evaluation will be carried out on the safety set.&#xD;
