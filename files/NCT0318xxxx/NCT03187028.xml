      Determine feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in pancreatic (&amp; other foregut)&#xD;
      cancer patients comparing the effects of diet alone vs. diet+exercise on functional and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Foregut cancers such as pancreatic cancer cause significant side effects and poorer&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (QOL), as well as a 5-year survival rate of only 6%.&#xD;
      Importantly, the reduction in physical functioning caused by this cancer and its therapies is&#xD;
      associated with higher mortality risk. Although multiple studies in more prevalent cancer&#xD;
      types support exercise benefits (e.g., improved physical functioning), data cannot be&#xD;
      generalized from one cancer type to another. Little is known about exercise feasibility and&#xD;
      benefits in pancreatic (&amp; other foregut) cancer patients, and no data regarding potential&#xD;
      mechanistic outcomes that may explain the link between poor physical performance status and&#xD;
      cancer survival have been reported. We will enroll 20 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      (or other foregut cancer) who are expected to undergo surgical resection or who are within 3&#xD;
      years of surgical resection, in a pilot project involving a 6-month home-based lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention (diet along versus diet+exercise). Research assessments will be done pre-surgery&#xD;
      (if applicable), post-surgery (and prior to starting the intervention), 3 months, and 6&#xD;
      months post-surgery. Intervention counseling will be delivered using visual communication&#xD;
      (e.g., Skype). Participants will be provided a computer tablet for the intervention with&#xD;
      participants randomized to receive exercise counseling also receiving a fitness bracelet to&#xD;
      facilitate counseling by the certified Cancer Exercise Trainer. Our primary study aim is to&#xD;
      determine feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in pancreatic cancer patients&#xD;
      comparing the effects of diet alone with diet+exercise on pancreatic cancer-related&#xD;
      functional and disease outcomes; feasibility measures include recruitment, retention,&#xD;
      intervention adherence, assessment completion, adverse events, and participant satisfaction.&#xD;
      Our secondary study aim is to determine the effect of diet+exercise compared with diet alone&#xD;
      on physical functioning and QOL. Also, we will draw and store blood samples so that&#xD;
      additional funds can be requested to test intervention effects on biomarkers of cancer risk&#xD;
      (e.g., tumor immunity, inflammatory cytokines, etc.). The goal of the study is to advance the&#xD;
      exercise oncology field into an understudied cancer type and develop an intervention that&#xD;
      will improve the survivorship care of pancreatic cancer patients through distance-delivered&#xD;
      counseling methods.&#xD;
