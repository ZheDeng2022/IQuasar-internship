  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of the recent World Health Organization report, highlighting that every 40 seconds a&#xD;
      person dies from suicide somewhere in the world, are to increase awareness on the public&#xD;
      health significance of suicide and make suicide prevention a greater priority within the&#xD;
      global public health agenda. Across age groups, less than half of individuals at elevated&#xD;
      suicide risk interface with some form of mental health services. Several barriers to&#xD;
      help-seeking have been identified (maladaptive coping, lack of perceived need, beliefs about&#xD;
      treatment effectiveness, fear of hospitalization or mistrust of providers, stigma...), which&#xD;
      are key targets in knowledge-based interventions on suicide. Psychoeducational programs have&#xD;
      shown effectiveness in prevention relapse for several mental disorders such as schizophrenia,&#xD;
      bipolar disorder or recurrent depressive disorder, improving treatment adherence and&#xD;
      self-confidence in coping with symptoms of the disease. They are highly recommended for&#xD;
      addressing adherence problems in patients with serious and persistent mental illness. Only&#xD;
      one team has published a study protocol for a controlled trial assessing a 10 group sessions&#xD;
      psychoeducational program for prevention in patients having a suicide history, in a one-year&#xD;
      follow-up. Interestingly, diagnosis-mixed group psychoeducation have shown superiority than&#xD;
      an unspecific intervention add-on routine care, on the suicide prevention and compliance for&#xD;
      severe psychiatric disorders. Those psychoeducational-specific elements are namely the&#xD;
      interactive transfer of illness and treatment-related knowledge and management/coping -&#xD;
      cognitive/behavioral - strategies, as defined by the National Institute for Health and Care&#xD;
      Excellence)-Guidelines (NICE). Notably, as several psychiatric diagnoses are associated with&#xD;
      suicidal behavior (SB), coping strategies have to target processes that overlap among these&#xD;
      psychiatric disease, as well as suicidal vulnerability. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy&#xD;
      (ACT), a &quot;third wave&quot; behavioral therapy, targets experiential avoidance and psychological&#xD;
      flexibility, at the core of psychiatric disorders. Interestingly, in patients with a history&#xD;
      of suicidal depression, training in mindfulness can help to weaken suicidal thinking&#xD;
      associated with depressive symptoms , and thus reduce an important vulnerability for relapse&#xD;
      to suicidal depression. ACT would also increase intrinsic motivation for daily life action&#xD;
      (i.e. reasons for living and acting). Then, the functional analysis (matrix) used in ACT&#xD;
      seems to be an useful tool to help patient in decision making, a neuropsychological factor&#xD;
      impaired in suicidal patients. Finally, acceptance and commitment group therapy has suggested&#xD;
      effectiveness in reducing intensity and frequency of suicidal thoughts, through improvement&#xD;
      in acceptance, in high risk suicidal patients. As compared with ACT, Dialectical behavior&#xD;
      therapy (DBT) teaches added distress tolerance in view of survive the crisis. DBT is the most&#xD;
      validated therapy for borderline personality disorder, the mental disorder the most&#xD;
      associated with SB . Notably, group skills training is the most effective component in DBT&#xD;
      for preventing suicidal behavior in borderline patients with high suicidal risk. Furthermore,&#xD;
      interventions based on positive psychology have suggested efficacy in reducing depressive&#xD;
      symptoms and suicidal ideation. Notably, in a recent pilot study, positive psychology&#xD;
      exercises delivered to suicidal inpatients were feasible and associated with short-term gains&#xD;
      improvement in optimism and hopelessness. Finally, as altered social link and sense of&#xD;
      belonging have been widely involved in SB, relationship skills are an interesting positive&#xD;
      psychology area for suicide prevention program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychoeducational program integrating knowledge as well the last innovating&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral coping strategies for SB is of major interest in suicide prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators developed the first French program of suicide psychoeducation called &quot;PEPSUI&quot;.&#xD;
      The aim of this innovating program is to teach patients the more recent knowledge about&#xD;
      suicidal behaviour (SB) and effective treatments, through didactic and interactive sessions.&#xD;
      Thus, the objective is to conduct the patients to become experts and actors of their disease,&#xD;
      increasing adherence to treatment. Besides, the patients will experiment the last innovating&#xD;
      psychological skills to cope with unpleasant emotions and thoughts (including suicidal&#xD;
      thoughts), distress tolerance skills and crisis strategies, and identify personal purpose in&#xD;
      life and learn positive psychological skills in order to anchor with meaningful and pleasant&#xD;
      components in life. Thus, this program will include skills from ACT, DBT and positive&#xD;
      psychology. Finally, this primary care research is about a program which aim at improving&#xD;
      accessibility to mental health services, care adherence and continuity for suicidal patients.&#xD;

      The project aims at to compare the effectiveness on suicide re-attempt rate reduction at&#xD;
      2-years follow-up of add-on PEPSUI psychoeducational program versus relaxation program in&#xD;
      patients having attempted suicide in the past year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary, the project aims to compare between add-on psychoeducational program and&#xD;
      relaxation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interrupted or aborted suicide attempt rate reduction during the follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severity and intensity of suicide ideation: at post-treatment, and at 6, 12, 18 and 24&#xD;
           months after the intervention (and the evolution between pre and each post-intervention&#xD;
           point)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intensity of suicidal intent: at post-treatment, and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after&#xD;
           the intervention (and the evolution between pre and each post-intervention point)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adherence to treatment and perceived utility of mental health services: at&#xD;
           post-treatment, and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the intervention (and the evolution&#xD;
           between pre and each post-intervention point)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Levels of depression, anxiety, psychological pain and hopelessness: at post-treatment,&#xD;
           and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the intervention (and the evolution between pre and&#xD;
           each post-intervention point)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Global functioning and quality of life: at post-treatment, and at 6, 12, 18 and 24&#xD;
           months after the intervention (and the evolution between pre and each post-intervention&#xD;
           point)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective social support: at post-treatment, and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the&#xD;
           intervention (and the evolution between pre and each post-intervention point)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The need to emergency psychiatric consultation and psychiatric hospitalisation for&#xD;
           suicidal ideation: at post-treatment, and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the&#xD;
           intervention (and the evolution between pre and each post-intervention point)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptance, contact with present moment and meaning in life: at post-treatment, and at&#xD;
           6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the intervention (and the evolution between pre and each&#xD;
           post-intervention point)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Satisfaction and adherence to the intervention: at post-treatment (likert scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
           500 patients suffering from current suicidal behavior disorder (according to the&#xD;
           Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) will be recruited, i.e.&#xD;
           having attempted to suicide in the past year. Eligible patients will be randomized in&#xD;
           one of the two arms: add-on psychoeducation or add-on relaxation (computer-generated&#xD;
           randomisation in a 1 :1 ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographic data, psychiatric diagnoses using Mini-International Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Interview (M.I.N.I.) and pharmacological treatment will be also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent researcher not involved in the study will perform the allocation. Each patient&#xD;
      will be evaluated at baseline (pre intervention V1) and followed-up during 24 months after&#xD;
      treatment completion, with 5 visits: post intervention (V2) 6 months (V3), 12 months (V4), 18&#xD;
      months (V5) and 24 months (V6) after the intervention. Blind trained evaluators will assess&#xD;
      patients. Patients will be told to avoid saying their group of allocation to the evaluator.&#xD;
