  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New treatments to help to reduce the emotional dysregulation of mood disorders are critically&#xD;
      needed. This is a study of an emotional dysregulation psychotherapy treatment in which&#xD;
      participants will learn skills to help to down-regulate maladaptive emotional responses and&#xD;
      learn beneficial, healthy habits. Investigators will perform symptom and behavioral&#xD;
      assessments and scanning prior to the treatment and will then repeat scanning, symptom and&#xD;
      behavioral assessments at the midpoint, and after the psychotherapy is completed. This&#xD;
      collected information will assess whether the treatment can improve functioning of emotion&#xD;
      regulation brain circuitry.&#xD;

      Aim: To use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), before, at mid point, and after an&#xD;
      emotional regulation intervention, to assess intervention-associated changes in brain&#xD;
      circuitry responses to emotional stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis : The emotional regulation psychotherapy treatment will be associated with changes&#xD;
      in emotional regulation circuitry.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>It is planned that 72 of the 86 participants who meet criteria for bipolar disorder (BDI, BDII, BD-OS) will complete this combined psychotherapy (BE-SMART) and imaging study. There will be variation of therapies, but no comparison between groups. Actigraphy and ecological momentary assessments on 20 participants will be integrated as part of the supplement to parent grant.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants will take part in 12 therapy sessions, at a rate of about 1 session every one to two weeks. Sessions are anticipated to last about 1 hour each. Sessions may be focused on teaching skills to regulate emotions or regularize sleep and activity. These therapy sessions may be videotaped and audiotaped (only with the expressed written consent of the participant, and when appropriate, the participant's parent or guardian). Participants will be asked to complete worksheets and practice the skills learned from these sessions and will be asked questions about feelings. There will be an interview, assessments and scanning performed prior to treatment and at the midpoint and end to assess progress. The intervening 9 sessions may be by video telecommunication. Participants may be given devices to track actigraphy and ecological momentary assessments.</description>
