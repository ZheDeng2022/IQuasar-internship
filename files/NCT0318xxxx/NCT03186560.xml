    <textblock>
      This is a single centre open label study measuring microcirculatory flux using Speckle&#xD;
      imaging Device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microcirculation will be measured using laser speckle contrast imaging, at baseline and with&#xD;
      the device active for 30 minutes in the wound, peri-wound and other point on the lower leg.&#xD;
      The same procedure will be done on all the different patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temperature variations can be assessed using Infrared Temperature Scanner (Exergen DermaTemp&#xD;
      DT1001), a measurement will be taken at baseline, and then at 5 minutes interval during the&#xD;
      30 minutes activity of the device.&#xD;

      The most common underlying etiologic factors responsible for chronic delayed healing among&#xD;
      lower extremity wounds encountered in the outpatient clinic are chronic venous insufficiency&#xD;
      (CVI), diabetic neuropathy, and arterial insufficiency (AI). One or more of these factors can&#xD;
      be identified in more than 90% of chronic lower extremity ulcers, and treatment protocols&#xD;
      have been designed to manage wounds of each type to maximize healing potential. It is&#xD;
      important to remember that multiple factors may coexist in any individual patient with a&#xD;
      chronic wound, complicating management and hindering the healing process. Recently, it has&#xD;
      been reported that the neuroischemic diabetic foot ulcer is now more common than nonischemic&#xD;
      neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers, as arterial insufficiency promoted by poorly controlled&#xD;
      diabetes complicates already impaired healing present in patients with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic leg ulcers are painful, debilitating wounds that place a significant burden on the&#xD;
      patient, their family, and healthcare resources. Treating leg ulcers can present a&#xD;
      significant challenge to clinicians, who currently have a limited range of treatments at&#xD;
      their disposal. The mainstay of treatment is compression bandaging, ambulation and elevation&#xD;
      at rest. In patients with mobility deficits, or in those who are unable to tolerate&#xD;
      compression bandaging, ulcers may deteriorate and never heal. Accordingly, there is a need&#xD;
      for novel, alternative devices or strategies that can be used to complement or replace&#xD;
      compression therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous pathophysiological and metabolic factors can affect wound healing and result in a&#xD;
      poor outcome. They include local causes such as oedema, ischemia, tissue hypoxia, infection,&#xD;
      necrosis and growth factor imbalance, as well as systemic causes including metabolic disease,&#xD;
      nutritional status general perfusion disturbances and pre-existing illness. These factors&#xD;
      alter the wound repair environment, impede healing and increase the risk of chronic wound&#xD;
      development. All healing processes including, inflammatory cell influx, fibroblast migration,&#xD;
      and collagen and extracellular matrix deposition, are delayed in this situation, leading to&#xD;
      prolonged wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any wound management should assist the healing process and optimise the patient's blood flow&#xD;
      to the wound area4. An acute wound in a stable patient with normal blood flow should heal&#xD;
      successfully. Anything that compromises tissue oxygen delivery, such as poor vascularisation,&#xD;
      will impede healing. There is a strong scientific basis for oxygen treatment as prophylaxis&#xD;
      against infection; to facilitate wound closure and to prevent amputation in wounded patients.&#xD;
      Oxygen delivery is a critical element for the healing of wounds. Hypoxemia, caused by&#xD;
      disrupted vasculature, is a key limiting factor against wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The link between compromised circulation and ulceration is well established and well&#xD;
      described. Chronic venous insufficiency is a direct cause of ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic foot ulcer is a major complication of diabetes mellitus, and probably the major&#xD;
      component of the diabetic foot. Diabetes mellitus is one such metabolic disorder that impedes&#xD;
      the normal steps of the wound healing process. Many studies show a prolonged inflammatory&#xD;
      phase in diabetic wounds, which causes a delay in the formation of mature granulation tissue&#xD;
      and a parallel reduction in wound tensile strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of diabetic foot ulcers should include: blood sugar control, removing dead tissue&#xD;
      from the wound, dressings, and removing pressure from the wound through techniques such as&#xD;
      total contact casting. Surgery in some cases may improve outcomes. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy&#xD;
      may also help but is expensive. It occurs in 15% of people with diabetes and precedes 84% of&#xD;
      all diabetes-related lower-leg amputations.&#xD;

    <description>The geko™ W devices are small disposable, internally powered, neuromuscular stimulators that are applied externally to the leg. The W device has a fixed 27mA current. The devices are self-adhesive and are applied to the outer/posterior aspect of the knee. This positioning enables integral electrodes to apply a stimulus to the lateral popliteal nerve (often additionally termed the common peroneal) which branches from the sciatic nerve. This nerve controls the contraction of several muscles in the lower leg.</description>
