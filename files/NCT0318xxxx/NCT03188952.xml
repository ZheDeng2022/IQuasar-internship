      1. A total of 40 volunteer patients will be assigned in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All patients will be randomly selected with variable caries risks .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For each patient The Examiner will use Two screening methods used in caries detection ,&#xD;
           where D1 represents ICDAS index and D2 represents ICCMS index which are used by each&#xD;
           examiner for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Each examiner will record the dental findings using the visual- tactile assessment&#xD;
           method .The visual-tactile assessment method includes the use of mirror, probe under&#xD;
           good illumination condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After full caries assessment in the 1st visit , All patients will receive full treatment&#xD;
           and oral hygiene control .&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After 6-months follow up re-assessment of same patients will be done by same Examiners .&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The data of each examiner will be collected, and then the repeat-ability and the&#xD;
           reproducibility of each method as well as the inter- and intra-operator agreement will&#xD;
           be evaluated using the kappa statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of visits &amp; follow up period: There will be 2 visits and 6-months follow up&#xD;
                between 2 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Direct benefit of the research to the human volunteer:To get the most appropriate&#xD;
                treatment plan .&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Scientific Value and social benefits:obtain better information quality and support&#xD;
                Dentist Discussion making.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Expected risk to human subjects:: the ordinary side effects associated with any&#xD;
                restorative treatment and no of the study variable has side effect on the patient&#xD;
                and in case of any side effect due to the restorative treatment , the participant&#xD;
                will directly contact the operator.&#xD;

      1. Study setting ----------------------------- The study will be conducted in Conservative&#xD;
           Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University, The operator in charge&#xD;
           will be: Amr Sobhy Abd Elmounem The researcher will bear ultimate responsibility for all&#xD;
           activities associated with the conduct of a research project including recruitment of&#xD;
           patients, explaining and performing the procedures to them&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Variables of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
           ------------------------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
           A total of 40 volunteer patients will be assigned in this study. For each patient Two&#xD;
           screening methods will be used in caries detection , where D1 represents ICDAS index and&#xD;
           D2 represents ICCMS index which are used by each examiner for each patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intervention/control assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           ------------------------------------------- Each examiner will record the dental&#xD;
           findings using the visual- tactile assessment method .The visual-tactile assessment&#xD;
           method includes the use of mirror, probe under good illumination condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Control assessment: ICDAS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any carious lesions detected are rated in score as the follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Code 0 Code 1 Code 2 Code 3 Code 4 Code 5 Code 6 .b. Intervention assessment:&#xD;
           (International Caries Classification and Management System):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any carious lesions detected are rated in score as the follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Code 0 = ICDAS 0 Code A = ICDAS 1,2 Code B = ICDAS 3,4 Code C= ICDAS 4,6&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Outcome assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           ---------------------------------- Each examiner will record the dental findings using&#xD;
           both the intervention and control assessment method. Each method will be repeated twice&#xD;
           at the first visit and the other after 6 months after oral hygiene control to calculate&#xD;
           the repeat ability and reproducibility after and before treatment. The data of each&#xD;
           examiner will be collected, and then the repeatability and the reproducibility of each&#xD;
           method as well as the inter- and intra-operator agreement will be evaluated using the&#xD;
           kappa statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participant timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
           ------------------------------ All procedures will be carried out in two visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           ---------------------------------- A sample size of 40 subjects achieves 80% power to&#xD;
           detect an estimated Kappa value of 0.40; this power calculation is based on significance&#xD;
           level 5%. The sample size was calculated by PASS 2008&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Recruitment &amp; Recruitment Strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           -------------------------------------------------- Screening of patients that come to&#xD;
           the conservative dentistry department seeking dental care will continue until the target&#xD;
           population is achieved. The patients 'Oral condition will be subjected to visual&#xD;
           examination and diagnosis using dental charts. Once the patients that are potentially&#xD;
           eligible for this study are identified, they will be contacted by the research&#xD;
           investigator who will explain the study and ascertains the patient's interest. If&#xD;
           interested, more detailed evaluations and preparations are made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Randomization and assignment of interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
           --------------------------------------------------------------- No randomization will be&#xD;
           done as all patients will be examined by all examiners&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The assessors will not be blind to intervention/control assessment methods. However it&#xD;
           will not be allowed among the examiners to exchange any information throughout the&#xD;
           entire study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Data collection methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
           ---------------------------------- Caries will be assessed by both methods. Patients&#xD;
           with other dental work, not included in the study design, will be treated prior to&#xD;
           recruitment. Examiners will record the dental findings of the diagnosed fillings by both&#xD;
           intervention/control assessment methods on a dental chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
           --------------------------- The data will be entered and stored on a personal computer.&#xD;
           Double data entry will be saved on an external hard disc to prevent loss of data&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
           -------------------------------- Data will be analyzed using advanced statistics IBM&#xD;
           SPSS . Numerical data will be described as mean and standard deviation or median and&#xD;
           range. Categorical data will be described as numbers and percentages. Correlation&#xD;
           analysis will be used. Agreement between both methods will be analyzed with the use of&#xD;
           kappa statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
           --------------------- A. Data monitoring: The main supervisor will monitor this study.&#xD;
           His role is to monitor any risk of bias could be done from participants&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Harms:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main researcher should inform participants about the possible harms, if present.&#xD;
           Participants are allowed to contact the main researcher at moment through telephone&#xD;
&#xD;
           C. Auditing:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the present trial, auditing will be done by the main and co-supervisors to assure&#xD;
           quality of the research frequency procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      13-Ethics and Dissemination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Research ethics approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Application forms for carrying out the clinical trial, checklist and informed consent of&#xD;
           Research Ethics Committee (REC) Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo University&#xD;
           will be retrieved and filled, then will be delivered for (REC) committee for approval.&#xD;
