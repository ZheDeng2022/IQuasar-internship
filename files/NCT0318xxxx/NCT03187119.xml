  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the potential benefit of Pictorial versus Written&#xD;
      Asthma Action Plans (AAPs) to support asthma management among young people with persistent&#xD;
      asthma. Participants will be randomly allocated to the Pictorial or Written AAP group and&#xD;
      followed up over a 6-month period. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected from&#xD;
      young people, parents and clinical teams involved in recruitment to assess the feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of the Pictorial AAP (PAAP) software developed for this study, the PAAPs&#xD;
      produced by the software, and the study procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common chronic health condition of childhood, and continues to be&#xD;
      associated with morbidity and mortality. Many children with persistent asthma follow a&#xD;
      treatment plan including a prescription to take a daily inhaled corticosteroid (controller),&#xD;
      often in conjunction with a daily oral controller medication, and a dose of an albuterol&#xD;
      (rescue) inhaler before activity or exercise. Young people with asthma must add to this&#xD;
      treatment plan in response to a flare in symptoms by taking additional medication and&#xD;
      contacting their asthma provider or getting to a hospital. Adherence to daily medications is&#xD;
      essential for maintaining lung health and reducing symptom flares, but asthma treatment is&#xD;
      complex, requiring regular decision-making in response to symptoms and environmental issues&#xD;
      like symptom triggers. As a result consistent adherence is a challenge for families and young&#xD;
      people. It is recommended to provide an Asthma Action Plan (AAP) to all people diagnosed with&#xD;
      asthma, summarizing their treatment plan using a traffic light format; Green Zone for daily,&#xD;
      symptom-free management, Yellow Zone for symptom flare, and Red Zone for extreme symptom&#xD;
      flare. Despite evidence for the effectiveness of AAPs, they are often not prescribed for&#xD;
      reasons including readability and accessibility for families and young people, and asthma&#xD;
      provider perceptions of their utility and suitability. In this study, young people with&#xD;
      persistent asthma will be given a Written (WAAP) or Pictorial Asthma Action Plan (PAAP) to&#xD;
      compare the differential impact on AAP knowledge, adherence to daily inhaler use, and asthma&#xD;
      control. Software developed for the study, in collaboration with providers, young people with&#xD;
      asthma and their parents, will be used to generate personalized PAAPs. Quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative data will be collected to explore perceptions of providers, parents and young&#xD;
      people of different versions of AAPs, the influence of AAPs on asthma understanding and&#xD;
      management, and the experience of taking part in the study, as well as to assess the impact&#xD;
      of different AAPs on the asthma and psychosocial outcomes mentioned. The findings will inform&#xD;
      the development of the PAAP software and as the basis for a definitive Randomized Controlled&#xD;
      Trial of the efficacy of PAAPs.&#xD;

    <measure>The Asthma Action Plan Knowledge Interview (AAPKI)-Child</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at three time points over 6 months; baseline, 3- and 6-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The Asthma Action Plan Knowledge Interview (AAPKI) was developed for the purposes of this study. The first section of the structured interview included 8 items describing hypothetical situations in which the respondent was asked to categorize themselves or their child into one of three zones. These items were scored as correct (1) or incorrect (0). Two items were excluded because they were not relevant to all participants. The second section of the structured interview included 3 open response items asking the respondent to describe the treatment instructions for the three zones according to the AAP. Responses were coded on a 4-point scale: 0 = incorrect; 1 = possibly correct, but vague or missing important details; 2 = correct but not detailed; 3 = correct and specific. Percent correct knowledge scores were calculated using six items from the first section and the three additional questions about treatment, for a total of nine questions.</description>

    <measure>Asthma Control Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at four time points over 6 months; baseline, 1-, 3- and 6-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma control was measures via the Asthma Control Test (ACT) 12 for participants 12 and older (7 items), and the ACT 11 for participants 11 and younger (5 items). These scales include a 5 point Likert type response. Total score is calculated by summing response with higher scores indicating more control. Possible range of scores is 0-35. The raw scores were dichotomized for a clinical cut-off, with a score of 19 and less considered &quot;poor control&quot;.</description>

          <description>Asthma control was measures via the Asthma Control Test (ACT) 12 for participants 12 and older (Nathan et al., 2004), and the ACT 11 for participants 11 and younger (Liu et al., 2007). These scales include Likert type response options that differ by item, but for all items higher scores indicate more control. The raw scores were dichotomized for a clinical cut-off, with a score of 19 and less considered &quot;poor control&quot;.</description>

          <description>The Asthma Numeracy Questionnaire (ANQ) assessed specific numerical skills used in asthma self-management. It is a 4-item questionnaire of numerical concepts (arithmetic and percentage) adapted from standard asthma education (Apter et al., 2006).The score is the number correct and ranges from 0 to 4. Lower scores indicate lower asthma numeracy. Higher scores indicates higher asthma numeracy.</description>

        <title>The Asthma Action Plan Knowledge Interview (AAPKI)-Child</title>
        <description>The Asthma Action Plan Knowledge Interview (AAPKI) was developed for the purposes of this study. The first section of the structured interview included 8 items describing hypothetical situations in which the respondent was asked to categorize themselves or their child into one of three zones. These items were scored as correct (1) or incorrect (0). Two items were excluded because they were not relevant to all participants. The second section of the structured interview included 3 open response items asking the respondent to describe the treatment instructions for the three zones according to the AAP. Responses were coded on a 4-point scale: 0 = incorrect; 1 = possibly correct, but vague or missing important details; 2 = correct but not detailed; 3 = correct and specific. Percent correct knowledge scores were calculated using six items from the first section and the three additional questions about treatment, for a total of nine questions.</description>

The PAAP will be personalized according to the young person's gender, race, favorite sport/activity, provider's gender, provider's clinic contact details, and hospital in emergency situations. The PAAP contains minimal text, instead illustrating each participant's asthma regimen using pictures, such as color-coded daily controller and rescue inhalers. Each participant will receive multiple copies of their PAAP, after receiving a brief education session with their provider, outlining the treatment summarized in the PAAP.&#xD;

          <title>Pictorial Asthma Action Plan</title>
          <description>Young people in the Pictorial Asthma Action Plan (PAAP) arm will receive a PAAP generated by their asthma provider using a software program developed for the study. The PAAP will be personalized according to the young person's gender, race, favorite sport/activity, provider's gender, provider's clinic contact details, and hospital in emergency situations. The PAAP contains minimal text, instead illustrating each participant's asthma regimen using pictures, such as color-coded daily controller and rescue inhalers. Each participant will receive multiple copies of their PAAP, after receiving a brief education session with their provider, outlining the treatment summarized in the PAAP.&#xD;
Pictorial Asthma Action Plan: Participants will receive a PAAP plan, personalized to their asthma treatment. Each participant will take part in a brief education session during which their asthma provider will outline the treatment plan summarized in their PAAP.</description>
