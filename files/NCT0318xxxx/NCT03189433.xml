  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ryanodex is being investigated as a potential adjuvant treatment for people suffering from&#xD;
      psychostimulant drug-induced toxicity (PDIT), a life-threatening medical condition that&#xD;
      results mainly from the abuse of certain illicit drugs, most notably methamphetamine, and&#xD;
      related forms (MDMC or &quot;Molly&quot;; MDMA or &quot;Ecstasy&quot;). Ryanodex is approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      malignant hyperthermia in conjunction with appropriate supportive measures and for prevention&#xD;
      of malignant hyperthermia in patients at high risk and in this study, will be investigated&#xD;
      for the treatment of PDIT. The hypothesis of this study is that administration of Ryanodex as&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment to Standard of Care (SOC) will improve the clinical outcome compared with&#xD;
      SOC alone, in subjects with psychostimulant drug induced toxicity. Current SOC is defined as&#xD;
      body cooling and supportive measures.&#xD;

      This study will be conducted at pre-hospital emergency care (PHEC) facilities. The PHECs are&#xD;
      medical units that are fully equipped and staffed to provide adequate emergency medical care&#xD;
      to patients with PDIT. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ryanodex&#xD;
      in an on0site pre-hospital emergency setting where subjects are anticipated to be treated&#xD;
      over a short period of time and then transferred to another medical facility or released.&#xD;
      After screening and diagnosis of PDIT, SOC treatment will be initiated. Subjects eligible for&#xD;
      the study will be randomized to either receive SOC + Ryanodex or to receive SOC only. Study&#xD;
      subjects are expected to remain at the study site for a maximum of 6 hours post-baseline.&#xD;

        Dysfunction System score of greater than or equal to 6 (In the event of any delay in&#xD;
        obtaining the results for baseline LODS score determination, subject may be enrolled. After&#xD;
        enrollment, if the pending baseline LODS score turns out to be less than 6, the subject&#xD;
