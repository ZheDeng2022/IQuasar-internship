      Prevention of malnutrition in infants and children requires access and intake of nutritious&#xD;
      food starting at birth with exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life,&#xD;
      breastfeeding in combination with complementary foods from 6-24 months of age, access to&#xD;
      clean drinking water and sanitation, access to preventive and curative health care (including&#xD;
      prenatal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Ghana, the Demographic and Health Survey of 2014 reports rates of stunting, wasting and&#xD;
      underweight in children aged 0-59 months are 28%, 14% and 9% respectively. Furthermore,&#xD;
      height for age starts dropping from age 4-6 months with children aged 6-23 months being more&#xD;
      likely to be stunted (40%) than those below 6 months (4%). Infant and young child feeding&#xD;
      data show that for breast-fed children ranging from 6 months through 35 months of age,&#xD;
      cereals are predominantly the first foods introduced in the diet (6-8 months of age). As the&#xD;
      child grows older, consumption of fruits rich in Vitamin A, other fruits and vegetables and&#xD;
      meat, fish, poultry and eggs are reported by the mothers. The Demographic and Health Survey&#xD;
      (DHS) found that the proportion of breast fed children aged 6-23 months who received a&#xD;
      recommended variety of foods the minimum number of times per day increases with child's age&#xD;
      from 28% in children 6-8 months to 50% in children aged 18-23 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objective is to examine the effect of providing a macro- and micro-nutrient&#xD;
      fortified complementary food supplement (KokoPlusTM) on growth and nutritional status of&#xD;
      Ghanaian infants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study is a cluster randomized single blind intervention design study with three&#xD;
      study arms that aimed to examine the effect of providing a macro- and micro-nutrient&#xD;
      fortified complementary food supplement (KokoPlus) for a period of 12 months (starting at 6&#xD;
      months of age) on growth and nutritional status of Ghanaian infants at 18 months of age.&#xD;
      KokoPlus was formulated using linear programming methodology based on formative and market&#xD;
      analysis research findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects in this cluster-randomized trial are from communities in three districts of the&#xD;
      Central region in Ghana with high rates of moderate and severe acute malnutrition. A total of&#xD;
      38 communities will be randomly assigned to one of three groups using block randomization and&#xD;
      another 11 (randomly selected) will be followed cross sectionally as part of a fourth/non&#xD;
      intervention group (growth monitoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total sample size is 1204. Sample size calculations were based on two outcome measures:&#xD;
      expected reduction in diarrheal morbidity and growth (improvements in height-for-age). Sample&#xD;
      size estimates for detecting a 0.5 cm change in height in children provided a caloric and non&#xD;
      caloric micronutrient supplement using a design effect of 2, power of 0.80, alpha of 0.05 and&#xD;
      assuming an attrition rate of 15%, the required sample size per group was 301.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mother-infant pairs will be recruited between infant age of 0 to 3 months to participate in&#xD;
      monthly nutrition educations sessions and to encourage the women to continue exclusive breast&#xD;
      feeding across all three groups. At 6 months of age, infants in each of the three groups were&#xD;
      enrolled into the intervention study (upon receipt of informed consent). Data collection&#xD;
      involves baseline, midline and endline measurements in the infants at 6, 12 and 18 months of&#xD;
      age. In addition, participating mother-infant pairs will be visited weekly for delivery of&#xD;
      the supplements and for morbidity monitoring and monthly for the measurement of&#xD;
      anthropometry. Anthropometric measurements include: length (Infant/Child Shorr Height Board;&#xD;
      Weigh and Measure, LLC ), weight (Seca 874 digital scale ), mid-upper arm circumference&#xD;
      (MUAC) (Child MUAC Tape; Weigh and Measure, LLC), subscapular and triceps skinfolds (Holtain&#xD;
      skinfold caliper ),head and chest circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection at baseline, midline and endline included one venous sample (3ml) from the&#xD;
      infant, HemoCue (Model 301) measurement to assess severe anemia (7 &lt;g/dl) with appropriate&#xD;
      referrals as mentioned earlier. Ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) Vacutainers (BD ;&#xD;
      catalog number 368841) for whole blood and plasma analyses and Trace Element Serum Separator&#xD;
      Tube Vacutainers (BD; catalog number 368380) for serum analyses will be used for the sample&#xD;
      collection with butterfly needles (21 or 23 gauge). Samples will be immediately placed in a&#xD;
      super cooler tube rack and transported back to the lab within five hours where they were&#xD;
      processed immediately. Questionnaires will be administered to assess socio-economic status,&#xD;
      infant and young child feeding practices, morbidity (past week), household food security&#xD;
      along with a 24 hour diet recall. Data was uploaded daily through cellular network, stored on&#xD;
      Formhub and then Ona organization servers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study is the change in length for age Z-score from 6 to 18 months&#xD;
      of age in infants in the KokoPlus group versus Micronutrient powder group and the Nutrition&#xD;
      Education group. Data calculations included estimating anthropometric indices using the WHO&#xD;
      (World Health Organization) 2006 growth reference charts using the WHO macro in STATA (18),&#xD;
      computing the USAID Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance (FANTA) household insecurity&#xD;
      access scores (HFIAS) (19) maternal body mass index (BMI), dietary diversity scores (20), and&#xD;
      re-coding variables as required to binary and accounting for missing. Infant anthropometric&#xD;
      indices calculated include length for age (LAZ) Z- score, weight for age Z-score (WAZ) and&#xD;
      weight for length (WLZ score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses are intent to treat. Descriptive statistics (means, medians, standard deviations&#xD;
      and standard errors) were computed. To verify the randomization assumption, any differences&#xD;
      in mean values at baseline across three groups were tested using linear mixed effects&#xD;
      regression analyses accounting for clustering. The effect of the supplement (KokoPlus,&#xD;
      Micronutrients and Nutrition Education group) on different dependent variables across the&#xD;
      intervention period will be tested using mixed effects regression analyses accounting for&#xD;
      clustering and repeated measures. The dependent variables tested included change in LAZ&#xD;
      between baseline and endline (primary outcome), change in LAZ on a monthly basis (primary&#xD;
      outcome 2), change in WAZ, WLZ, serum hemoglobin (unadjusted and adjusted for inflammation),&#xD;
      serum ferritin (unadjusted and adjusted for inflammation), serum zinc, serum cortisol, serum&#xD;
      insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1), serum retinol binding protein, C-reactive protein and alpha&#xD;
      glycoprotein, prevalence of acute and chronic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional assessment (anthropometry) will be conducted at baseline, midline and&#xD;
      endline in 301 infants that are randomly selected from another set of communities (to be&#xD;
      identified based on the same community selection criteria). These infants will not be&#xD;
      followed longitudinally and the only measurements to be collected include weights and&#xD;
      heights. Informed consent procedures will be similar to the three intervention arms. This&#xD;
      group is a reference group only and cannot be included in any comparative analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of groups that receive a supplement will happen weekly. Compliance will be defined&#xD;
      based on the number of supplement packets that are consumed per week. To assure that the&#xD;
      mothers are compliant in using the supplement, they will be asked to return the empty&#xD;
      supplement packages at the end of the week. Optimal compliance will be defined as consumption&#xD;
      of at least 50% of the weekly samples. Supplements will be provided in plastic or paper bags&#xD;
      with a clearly labelled household ID (identity number). Compliance and dose response to&#xD;
      compliance will be reviewed in existing studies to determine minimum compliance required.&#xD;
