    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a major mental illness that presents in young adulthood and affects ~1% of&#xD;
      the population. Impact on affected persons life is often major and life expectancy is reduced&#xD;
      by ~20 years. Better and more effective care models are needed to increase health in these&#xD;
      persons. Person-centered care have been suggested to be one way to increase efficiency in&#xD;
      care delivery for patients with chronical and complex conditions. The impact of&#xD;
      person-centered care on a inpatient psychosis care setting is now being tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test whether inpatient Person-centered psychosis care (PCPC)&#xD;
      can&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. increase patient empowerment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. improve patient satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. reduce the frequency of involuntary treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. reduce the duration of inpatient care and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. reduce overall ward burden&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further purpose is to qualitatively explore which components in this complex intervention&#xD;
      are experienced as facilitators or barriers to the achievement of good care, from both&#xD;
      patient, next-of-kin and staff perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data is collected through questionnaires from patients (measuring empowerment,&#xD;
      care satisfaction and perceived health) before and after an educational intervention for&#xD;
      staff, along with ward level measures such as care burden, number of involuntary treatments&#xD;
      and length of stay on ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative interview is used to study experiences of patients, next-of-kin and staff.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schizophrenia is a major mental illness that presents in young adulthood. It affects&#xD;
      approximately 1% of the population and is a major cause of Disability-adjusted Life Years&#xD;
      worldwide. Besides impacting on the ability to independently carry out daily activities,&#xD;
      work/studies and interactions with family and community, the illness has a profound effect on&#xD;
      physical health. Diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are common complications and life&#xD;
      expectancy is reduced by as much as two decades. The long term nature of this complex illness&#xD;
      highlights the need for more effective, holistic care models. Increased patient involvement&#xD;
      is central, as it has been shown that patients' views of appropriate interventions often&#xD;
      differ from those of formal care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Person-centered care (PCC) is recognized by the WHO as a valuable approach to the care of&#xD;
      chronic conditions. A basic assumption of person-centered care (PCC) is that healthcare must&#xD;
      recognize the patient as a person, with own knowledge, capacity and preferences along with&#xD;
      needs and problems. The PCC way to deal with illness and disease is to form a partnership&#xD;
      with the person and together form a plan of action to increase health (i.e. not only focus on&#xD;
      symptoms or signs of diagnosed disease) taking into account the person's context and&#xD;
      priorities. Previous studies show that persons with serious mental illness can and want to&#xD;
      participate in their own care and participation might increase adherence. Improved social&#xD;
      function and consumer satisfaction were demonstrated when a person-centered care approach,&#xD;
      Integrated Care (IC) was tested in a psychosis outpatient-based randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of the authors knowledge, PCC has yet to be tested in an inpatient setting for&#xD;
      persons with severe mental illness. Favorable results have been demonstrated with regard to&#xD;
      both ward level and patient level outcomes from inpatient settings within somatic care.&#xD;
      Person-centered care in geriatric settings, which might share some common issues with&#xD;
      hospital care for persons with schizophrenia (decreased cognitive function, lack of insight,&#xD;
      compromised autonomy), have shown positive outcomes for QoL and agitation in patients and job&#xD;
      satisfaction for staff. Reviews show mixed results though. Thus, we wanted to evaluate an&#xD;
      intervention for inpatient psychiatric care for persons with schizophrenia and similar&#xD;
      psychoses. To this end, we developed Person-centered Psychosis Care (PCPC), a staff&#xD;
      educational intervention involving components of PCC as well as IC. Person Centered Psychosis&#xD;
      Care was defined as having four key elements; dialogue, building partnership, formulation and&#xD;
      documentation of a health plan, and early involvement of the patient's outpatient facility.&#xD;
      The latter means that the patient's outpatient-based social resource group can come into play&#xD;
      already during the inpatient stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test whether inpatient PCPC can&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. increase patient empowerment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. improve patient satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. reduce the frequency of involuntary treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. reduce the duration of inpatient care and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. reduce overall ward burden&#xD;
&#xD;
           A further purpose is to qualitatively explore which components in this complex&#xD;
           intervention are experienced as facilitators or barriers to the achievement of good&#xD;
           care, from both patient, next-of-kin and staff perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study employs a simple &quot;before and after&quot; design. Quantitative data (patient-level,&#xD;
           ward-level) are collected pre- and post intervention on all four wards. Qualitative data&#xD;
           are provided through interviews with patients as well as focus groups with staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection: Patient-level data All patients on any of the four wards who fulfill&#xD;
           study criteria during pre- and post-intervention periods will be asked to participate in&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anticipated number of participants: 50 pre intervention, 50 post intervention.Those who&#xD;
           accept will complete questionnaires at the clinic together with the interviewer. The&#xD;
           following outcomes will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Empowerment will be measured with The Empowerment Scale. This scale is validated&#xD;
                and used internationally in studies involving persons with severe mental&#xD;
                ill-health. There are 28 questions; responses are given on a scale of 1 (agree&#xD;
                totally) to 4 (disagree totally).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient satisfaction measured with the UKU-ConSat Rating Scale consists of 11 items&#xD;
                on different aspects of the care provided where response is given on a scale 1&#xD;
                (Very bad/negative/little) to 7 (very good/positive/much). The scale also includes&#xD;
                two VAS-like scales where an answer is marked on a 100 mm line to a question on&#xD;
                overall life experience (0=worst imaginable, 100=best imaginable).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Confounders including illness burden, functional ability, and overall health will be&#xD;
           quantified for each patient at discharge. Positive and negative symptom burden will be&#xD;
           rated with the Remission subscale of PANSS, consisting of 8 items reflecting core&#xD;
           symptoms of schizophrenia and functional ability will be determined using the GAF scale&#xD;
           and overall health with the EQ-5D. Ratings will be carried out by two nurses and one&#xD;
           psychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the completion of the scales, all participants are asked the following open-ended&#xD;
           questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1a) What are the most important things that have improved for you during your stay at&#xD;
           the hospital?&#xD;
&#xD;
           1b) What was the reason that you got better? 2a) What do you wish could improve for you&#xD;
           in the future, after your hospital stay? 2b) How could the health care sector help you&#xD;
           to achieve this?&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the end of the interview, participants are asked for permission for researchers to&#xD;
           contact them after discharge for invitation to a qualitative interview study. A&#xD;
           purposive selection of stabilized patients who accepted follow-up contact will be asked&#xD;
           if they would like to participate in an interview with a study nurse or psychologist.&#xD;
           The interview will focus on experiences of care during the inpatient stay and&#xD;
           patient-relevant endpoints will be explored. The sampling will aim at a heterogeneous&#xD;
           group with regard to gender, age, ethnicity, level of psychosocial function, involuntary&#xD;
           vs voluntary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection: Next-of-kin A purposive sample of family members or other persons close&#xD;
           to the patient will be asked if they would like to participate in focus groups/an&#xD;
           interview. The selection of family members' for focus group interview will strive to&#xD;
           include next-of-kin of patients with varied backgrounds with regard to age, gender,&#xD;
           ethnic background, education level, living situation (do they live together with the&#xD;
           patient or not?) etc. The main focus for this focus group will be the identification of&#xD;
           positive and negative experiences in the care, discrimination, facilitators and barriers&#xD;
           for good care&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection: Staff experiences A purposive sample of staff were invited to&#xD;
           participate in focus group to collect experiences of the educational intervention and&#xD;
           implementation. Facilitators and barriers to implementation of PCPC will be in focus.&#xD;
           Staff were recruited through invitation via e-mail and posters on their wards. In a&#xD;
           second step section leaders at the wards asked persons who would be on duty on the days&#xD;
           of interview to participate. All focus groups are led by an experienced clinician with&#xD;
           research experience of qualitative studies. All interviews will be recorded and&#xD;
           transcribed verbatim.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection: Ward level data Mean number of inpatient days, mean number of inpatient&#xD;
           days with compulsory care and mean number of involuntary treatment interventions&#xD;
           (involuntary injections, medical restraint) for pre- and post intervention periods will&#xD;
           be derived from the clinic's administrative database. Overall care burden is measured at&#xD;
           each ward with an instrument developed by the Psychosis Clinic for quality monitoring.&#xD;
           The instrument includes objective items (number of admissions and discharges, number of&#xD;
           involuntary treatments during the shift etc), followed by a subjective item on the&#xD;
           overall level of burden perceived during the shift. The form is filled out by one staff&#xD;
           member on each ward once a day according to clinical routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data analysis: Quantitative data The main study question is whether the intervention is&#xD;
           associated with a change in the degree of empowerment experienced by persons who receive&#xD;
           hospital care due to psychosis. The secondary outcome measure is patient satisfaction at&#xD;
           discharge. Quantitative ratings before and after the care intervention will be compared&#xD;
           with standard statistical methods. Similarly, for the ward level analyses, wardwide&#xD;
           outcomes will be compared in wards before and after the implementation of the&#xD;
           intervention: mean number of inpatient days, mean number of inpatient days with&#xD;
           compulsory care, mean number of involuntary treatment interventions and overall ward&#xD;
           burden. Distribution of the variables to be studied will determine whether parametric or&#xD;
           non-parametric analyses are employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data analysis: Qualitative data Free text responses to the open-ended questions at the&#xD;
           end of the quantitative interview (see patient level data above) as well as data from&#xD;
           individual patient interviews and focus group interviews with staff and next-of-kin will&#xD;
           be analyzed using content analysis and thematic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ethics All participants (patients, next-of kin and staff) are given written and oral&#xD;
           information about the study, the voluntary participation, possibility to withdraw from&#xD;
           participation without having to give explanation. All will sign consent form before&#xD;
           participating in any study related task, a copy of signed consent is given participants.&#xD;
           The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Board in Gothenburg, Dnr. 773-13.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Time plan Data collection for the pre-intervention phase is completed (December 2014);&#xD;
           the educational intervention is completed (May 2015) and the implementation period will&#xD;
           end April 30, 2017. Focus group interviews with staff regarding the educational package&#xD;
           are now underway (2017). Audit to determine the level of PCPC implementation is&#xD;
           currently underway (April 2017), which will determine whether post-intervention data&#xD;
           collection could start. Complete data set should be available fall 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Comment on project so far&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a complex intervention involving action research and the study is registered&#xD;
           first after the completion of the educational intervention and on-ward implementation of&#xD;
           PCPC. The implementation process has been dynamic and varied at the four different wards&#xD;
           involved in the project. The duration of the implementation period was considerably&#xD;
           longer than anticipated. This is in part related to high staff turnover, serious lack of&#xD;
           psychiatrically trained RNs, as well as other barriers to implementation. Barriers have&#xD;
           slowly been overcome by changes in routines instigated from within the care staff (as&#xD;
           opposed to being imposed on staff from &quot;above&quot;). While the long implementation process&#xD;
           can be seen as a limitation, it's interactive nature can at the same time be construed&#xD;
           as a strength, as change from within can be expected to increase sustainable change.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A quantitative study was planned with questionnaires investigating consumer satisfaction&#xD;
           and care giver burden in next-of-kin but baseline collection resulted in too few&#xD;
           participants to continue that subproject.&#xD;
