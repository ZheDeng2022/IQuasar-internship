  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decompressive craniectomy is frequently used to treat increased intracranial pressure or an&#xD;
      intracranial mass effect. Trephined Syndrome describes a neurological deterioration, which is&#xD;
      attributed to a large craniectomy. The symptomatology is varied but includes headache,&#xD;
      aggravation of a hemisyndrome or cognitive disorders, often has an orthostatic component and&#xD;
      improves or disappears with cranioplasty. The incidence of Trephined Syndrome has been&#xD;
      reported between 7% and 26%. However, it might be underestimated if the course of cognitive&#xD;
      functions before and after cranioplasty were insufficiently documented.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decompressive craniectomy is a neurosurgical procedure that is used frequently for mass&#xD;
      and/or intracranial hypertension. The Trephined Syndrome (or Sinking Skin Flap Syndrome) is a&#xD;
      neurological deterioration which follows craniectomy and which is attributed to a large bone&#xD;
      flap size. The symptomatology is varied but includes headache, aggravation of a hemisyndrome&#xD;
      or cognitive disorders, often has an orthostatic component and improves or disappears with&#xD;
      cranioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of the Trephined Syndrome is not clearly understood. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that the contents of the skull, which is no longer isolated by the bone, is then subjected to&#xD;
      atmospheric pressure, which would lead to changes in the blood flow, but also abnormalities&#xD;
      in the circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid and even cell metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The precise incidence of the Trephined Syndrome is poorly known but is described to be 7% up&#xD;
      to 26%. It is much likely underestimated since it concerns patients with preexisting&#xD;
      neurological symptoms and often multiple comorbidities. Furthermore its presentation varies&#xD;
      in a way, that in certain patients the Trephined Syndrome manifests itself by neurological&#xD;
      aggravation, while in other patients it is only the absence of evolution in rehabilitation,&#xD;
      followed then by improvement after cranioplasty, which makes it possible to retain this&#xD;
      diagnosis a posteriori.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis is also difficult since it is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion. The cerebral&#xD;
      imaging that shows contralateral herniation than the craniectomy is pathognomonic, but is not&#xD;
      a gold standard for diagnosis, since the symptomatology can occur before this stage of&#xD;
      radiological presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is, of course, necessary to wait until the regression of the edema makes it possible to&#xD;
      restore the flap without risk of inducing a new lesion but the ideal moment of the&#xD;
      cranioplasty is unknown. The risk of infectious disease may be increased during &quot;early&quot;&#xD;
      remission, on the other hand the risk of developing the Trephined Syndrome or other&#xD;
      complications increases during &quot;late&quot; cranioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently at our university teaching hospital the cranioplasty is planned after a delay of 3&#xD;
      months, because of a fear of infectious complications in case of earlier remission. However,&#xD;
      in neuro-rehabilitation, a shortening of this delay is desirable, especially when the patient&#xD;
      can mobilize and/or be discharged home (helmets are often not well supported) or when a&#xD;
      radiological and clinical Trephined Syndrome occurs. Indeed, the solution of staying in bed&#xD;
      awaiting the 3 month delay is not ideal both from the point of view of rehabilitation (very&#xD;
      limited therapies in the prone position, risk of the appearance of complications of the&#xD;
      decubitus), comfort of the patient and eventual non reversible neurological damage due to the&#xD;
      Trephined Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational prospective study focus on patients with cerebral damage who underwent&#xD;
      decompressive craniectomy due to mainly traumatic brain injury and ischemic stroke with&#xD;
      malignant edema or hemorrhagic stroke and other causes of intracranial mass effect). The&#xD;
      study comprises a fragile population, but it is also a population that is affected by a&#xD;
      possible modification of the delay to cranioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence and type of symptomatology attributable to the Trephined Syndrome, its duration,&#xD;
      severity and its modification after cranioplasty will be recorded. The delay for cranioplasty&#xD;
      and any complications (such as hematoma or infectious complications) of the latter will be&#xD;
      noted. The study aims to provide valuable information on how to to better plan the care for&#xD;
      patients who undergoes decompressive craniectomy and to determine the optimal delay for the&#xD;
      cranioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, observational study. It will include a neurological and cognitive&#xD;
      examination upon arrival in the neuro-rehabilitation department. It is expected that the&#xD;
      patient will remain stable or improve during the stay in neuro-rehabilitation. In case of&#xD;
      neurological aggravation, if a Trephined Syndrome is suspected (other causes must be well&#xD;
      dismissed such as recurrence of stroke, haemorrhage, infection, hydrocephalus, electrolytic&#xD;
      or metabolic disorder, toxic and metabolic abnormalities, epileptic crisis etc) a new&#xD;
      neurologic evaluation will specify the type of deficit. The examination will take place in&#xD;
      the morning and evening after a day of therapies to eventually observe the neurological&#xD;
      aggravation due to orthostatism. In the event of a evident worsening due to orthostatism, as&#xD;
      usual, a bed rest awaiting cranioplasty will be offered to the patient. In all patients&#xD;
      (improved compared to admission, stable or worse) an examination at 7-10 days before the&#xD;
      cranioplasty will be performed and then repeated 1-4 days before and then 1-4 days after the&#xD;
      cranioplasty. The delay of cranioplasty in relation to the date of craniectomy, the date (if&#xD;
      known) when a cranioplasty was considered possible in terms of radiological and clinical&#xD;
      evaluation and the date of start of the Trephined Syndrome will be recorded. Complications&#xD;
      related to cranioplasty will be noted. At the patient's discharge from neuro-rehabilitation&#xD;
      department a final examination will be performed. The mentioned evaluations will be carried&#xD;
      out by the medical residents in charge of the patient under the supervision and assistance of&#xD;
      the study investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be classified as having the Trephined Syndrome if s/he: a) shows a&#xD;
      neurological aggravation with no other cause (see above) with a typical imaging; (B) a&#xD;
      neurological aggravation with no other cause (see above) but aggravated to orthostatism and /&#xD;
      or at least partially reversible shortly following cranioplasty (no longer than 4 days after)&#xD;
      or c) if there is a rapid neurological improvement after cranioplasty (no longer than 4 days&#xD;
      after). The waiting period until the cranioplasty will be recorded for each case. The&#xD;
      possible complications of the cranioplasty (in particular hematoma and infectious) will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no randomization since this is an observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study is offered to all patients with decompressive craniectomy upon&#xD;
      arrival in neuro-rehabilitation department. The duration of follow-up will be that of stay in&#xD;
      neuro-rehabilitation (usually for this type of population at least 4-6 months). The study&#xD;
      will cover 5 years in view of the low number of patients with craniectomy. The patient can of&#xD;
      course leave the study at any time if he wishes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected Data will include age, sex, baseline diagnosis, neurological assessment at the&#xD;
      various stages (admission at neuro-rehabilitation, at the time of a possible neurological&#xD;
      deterioration, 7-10 days then 1-4 days before, 1-4 Days after cranioplasty, at the time of&#xD;
      final discharge from the neuro-rehabilitation department), the results of the neurological&#xD;
      imaging, the delay between craniectomy and cranioplasty, delay between the theoretic&#xD;
      possibility of cranioplasty (if known) and the actual cranioplasty, complications related to&#xD;
      cranioplasty and functional and cognitive outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not include administration of medicinal products or changes in the usual&#xD;
      management of patients in neurosurgery and neuro-rehabilitation departments. In the case of a&#xD;
      recognized Trephined Syndrome, cranioplasty is always promptly requested. Unfortunately the&#xD;
      waiting periods remain, even in this case sometimes long, due to the availability of&#xD;
      neurosurgeons. The study could provide objective data to improve the management of these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria to be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical history data: Orthostatic headache, motor function deterioration or other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local examination of the craniectomy site: presence of edema, fluid collection, sinking skin&#xD;
      flap, size of the bone flap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological examination with in particular visual field assessment, Glasgow Coma Scale if&#xD;
      vigilance impaired, National Institute of Health Stroke Score if stroke as etiology, motor&#xD;
      hemisyndrome evaluation with &quot;The Motricity Index for Motor Impairment After Stroke&quot; and&#xD;
      Jamar. pyramidal signs in neurological evaluation . Balance (rating according to &quot;Postural&#xD;
      Assessment Scale for Stroke&quot;), gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive examination: verbal span, geometric objects drawing span, Trail Making Test Type A&#xD;
      and Type B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For aphasic patient: denomination of drawn objects and Token test. For patients with&#xD;
      visuo-spatial neglect: Bells cancellation test. Results of cerebral CT and MRI imaging.&#xD;
      Functional outcome: Functional Independence Measure at admission and discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' anonymity and data confidentiality will be respected as the data will be reported&#xD;
      on sheets with neither the name nor the date of birth of the patient to whom a number will be&#xD;
      assigned (separate number for each patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be stored and archived for 10 years in a secure and closed place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of adverse events :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of adverse effects the patient is excluded from the study, the promoter is warned,&#xD;
      who undertakes to take the appropriate measures if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted, however, that no adverse effects are expected in this purely&#xD;
      observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control and assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, monitoring will be carried out in order to verify the strict&#xD;
      application of the protocol as well as the concordance between the source data and the case&#xD;
      report forms, corrections of the case report forms as well as the collection of undesirable&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of an audit or inspection of the regulatory authorities, the investigator will&#xD;
      allow the persons authorized to visit the premises, installations and materials used, to meet&#xD;
      the persons involved and to have access to the documents of the study as well as to the&#xD;
      source data and to consult all documents of importance for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sample estimate: by taking the incidence of the Trephined Syndrome in the&#xD;
      craniectomized population between 7% - 26%, it takes 100 patients with craniectomy to hope to&#xD;
      have data comprising at least 15-20 patients with the studied syndrome. There are about 30&#xD;
      patients craniectomized per year at our institution, but not all of them are transferred to&#xD;
      our neuro-rehabilitation unit and hence the duration of the study expected over 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the data: comparison of differences in occurrence of the Trephined Syndrome&#xD;
      (presence vs absence) in relation to delay to cranioplasty. Non-parametric variables will be&#xD;
      compared with Mann-Whitney U test, parametric variables with t-test and categorical variables&#xD;
      with Chi-square.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For pre- and post-cranioplasty: repeated-measure ANOVA with group factor (with / without&#xD;
      Trephined Syndrome) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of complications related to cranioplasty will be collected and correlation between&#xD;
      delay to cranioplasty and presence complications will evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria to stop the study: The study is stopped or at least modified if on the data&#xD;
      published by others there strong evidence of optimal delay to cranioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice. Being purely&#xD;
      observational, it should not lead to any particular ethical problem. Treatment will not be&#xD;
      altered unless the patient agrees to participate in the study. The free and informed consent&#xD;
      will probably be difficult to obtain at the arrival of the patient if it has a severe&#xD;
      neurological impairment with often an altered capacity of discernment and in this case the&#xD;
      relatives will be asked to consent. As soon as possible the patient himself will be informed&#xD;
      and his free consent obtained. If it is a minor patient the informed consent will be asked to&#xD;
      their parents. All data collected will be anonymized.&#xD;
