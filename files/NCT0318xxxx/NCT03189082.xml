  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of the intradermal injection of&#xD;
      botulinum toxin in lower face rejuvenation. The study will also compare this intervention&#xD;
      with the &quot;Nefertiti Lift&quot; intramuscular injection technique.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The abobotulinumtoxinA will be used for the intervention. The abobotulinumtoxinA will be&#xD;
      prepared by adding 2.5 cc of normal saline to a 500-unit DysportÂ© (Ipsen Ltd, Berks, UK)&#xD;
      vial. Further dilution to the appropriate Microbotox concentration will be done in the&#xD;
      syringe itself. Each 1mL syringe of Microbotox solution will contain 20-28 units of&#xD;
      onabotulinumtoxinA per mL of solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preinjection frontal, oblique and lateral patient pictures will be taken (at rest and with&#xD;
      contraction)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of 100-150 intradermal microdroplets injection points 1 cm apart will be delivered&#xD;
      in the lower face. The area to be injected is bounded by a line 3 fingerbreadths above and&#xD;
      parallel to the lower border of the mandible, 1 fingerbreadth posterior to the depressor&#xD;
      anguli oris, and all the way down over the cervicomental angle and anterior neck to the upper&#xD;
      border of the clavicle, and posteriorly to the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the average patient, 2 syringes of 28 units per mL of microbotox will be used to cover the&#xD;
      entire area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In heavier necks, 3 syringes of 28 units per mL will be used. In thinner necks, 2 syringes of&#xD;
      20 units per mL will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up will be done at 15 days for post injection pictures. A total of 15 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited&#xD;
