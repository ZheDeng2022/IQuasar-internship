  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases like schizophrenia, dependency on drugs&#xD;
      of abuse, depression and Parkinson's disease are related to motivational and cognitive&#xD;
      deficits in value-based decision making, which frequently persist even after a successful&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment. According to current neurobiologic models, cortical dopamine D1&#xD;
      receptors play a crucial role in taking value-based decisions. In this study, it will be&#xD;
      investigated whether value-based decisions in healthy volunteers can be improved by&#xD;
      stimulation of D1-receptors. For this purpose, a newly developed dopamine D1-agonist will be&#xD;
      used, which selectively increases the activities of frontal D1- and D5-receptors. In this&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, the effects of different single doses of&#xD;
      PF-06412562, a not yet licensed D1-agonist, on value-based decision making will be compared&#xD;
      with placebo. The use of different dosage strengths will allow to investigate a potential&#xD;
      relationship between the extent of activity of the D1-receptor and its influence on&#xD;
      behavioral indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, four parallel groups will be investigated. Each participant takes in a single dose&#xD;
      of either PF-06412562 in different doses or placebo. A screening exam will be carried out 1-3&#xD;
      weeks before the drug intake, and a follow-up examination will be carried out approx. 1 week&#xD;
      after the drug intake. At all 3 visits in the study centre, several tests for the&#xD;
      investigation of value-based decision making will be carried out.&#xD;
