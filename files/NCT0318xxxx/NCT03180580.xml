  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Bangladesh, the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children varies from less than&#xD;
      1% to 17.9% based on different reference standard. In 2014 school based country wide study&#xD;
      has been demonstrated that among children (6-15 years of age), 9.6% were overweight and 3.5%&#xD;
      children were obese. Childhood obesity is getting increasing attention due to its association&#xD;
      with adult obesity and increased risk of co morbidities in adulthood. Childhood obesity is&#xD;
      known to be an independent risk factor for adult obesity and once a child is obese, it is&#xD;
      difficult to reverse through interventions. This suggests an urgent need to address&#xD;
      overweight and obesity levels in childhood. The increasing trend of childhood obesity&#xD;
      suggests urgent solution of the problem. There is no evidence of intervention for childhood&#xD;
      overweight and obesity exists in Bangladesh. This feasibility study will be able to generate&#xD;
      evidence for overcoming this upcoming epidemic in resource poor setting. If the proposed&#xD;
      study will be able to address its objective that will create a possibility for developing a&#xD;
      large cluster randomized trial in low resource setting like Bangladesh. This study will also&#xD;
      give opportunity to our policy makers for advocating to the government of Bangladesh for&#xD;
      adopting an obesity control policy for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to develop a school based healthy eating and active lifestyles module&#xD;
      and assess feasibility and acceptability of the guideline in school setting.&#xD;

      Study Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators were purposively selected four wards with the highest prevalence of obesity&#xD;
      out of 30 wards that were surveyed in the previous study (PR-13024) conducted by Centre for&#xD;
      control of chronic diseases (CCCD), icddr,b. Investigators were obtained the list of schools&#xD;
      from city corporation head office for the 4 selected wards. Investigators were randomly&#xD;
      selected 2 English medium and 2 Bengali medium schools from the available list. Investigators&#xD;
      were included only those schools who will give us a letter of supports for their voluntary&#xD;
      participation in the research project. We were followed the available list of both Bengali&#xD;
      and English medium schools collected from City Corporation. If any school disagrees to&#xD;
      participate in the research, we were approached next available school in the list and&#xD;
      selected following a letter of supports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With supports of the school authority, investigators were assessed BMI of all children in&#xD;
      Grade 3 (aged 7-8 years) up to Grade 9 (aged 13-14 years) in order to make a list of those&#xD;
      children who will have a higher than normal BMI. Investigators were randomly selected 3&#xD;
      children from that list from each grade and obtain parental consent to recruit them.&#xD;
      Investigators were additionally obtained assent for children 11-14 years of age. A written&#xD;
      voluntary consent was provided to parents describing the study purpose, objectives and&#xD;
      methodology prior to obtaining consent of the parents and get permission to recruit their&#xD;
      child participate in the study. Thus investigators were recruited 27 children from one school&#xD;
      and a total of 108 children were selected from 4 schools for inviting to participate in the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was adopted both of quantitative and qualitative designs. Investigators were&#xD;
      conduct secondary analysis to achieve specific aim 1 using data on diet and physical activity&#xD;
      pattern from previously conducted study by Centre for Control of Chronic Diseases (CCCD) in&#xD;
      2013 in 7 divisional cities in Bangladesh. For achieving aims 2, and 3 we were adopted&#xD;
      qualitative methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve specific aim 1, investigators were performed secondary data analysis to determine&#xD;
      the usual dietary and physical activity pattern of the children. Investigators were analyzed&#xD;
      data on childhood dietary pattern following food frequency questionnaire and food preference&#xD;
      were also be calculated. There were 20 food groups for listing food preference that has been&#xD;
      collected through 7 days recall method. These food groups were analyzed for children's food&#xD;
      preference by rating 'preferred' and 'not preferred' as well as frequency of consumption&#xD;
      within 24 hours and last 7 days. Thus we were determined the dietary patterns of children&#xD;
      5-18 years of age with normal BMI, high BMI and low-BMI which has already been defined in the&#xD;
      study by following the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) guideline. In order to develop&#xD;
      healthy eating guideline, we were developed a dietary guideline that would be suitable for&#xD;
      children with normal weight, and make adjustment in the dietary pattern for underweight and&#xD;
      overweight children. We will determine appropriate portion size of carbohydrates, proteins,&#xD;
      fats, vitamins and minerals required for a balanced nutritional supply for different ages.&#xD;
      The total daily calorie intake should comprise of: Fat - 30-35%, Protein - 15% and&#xD;
      Carbohydrates - 50-55% for the children during their school time. Vitamins and minerals will&#xD;
      come from a range of fruits and vegetables along within these three major food groups,&#xD;
      including 3 serving of vegetable and 2 serving of fruits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneously physical activity pattern was analyzed based on data from 24 hour physical&#xD;
      activities by children. There were 17 listed physical activities and games questions to&#xD;
      assess their frequency of activity on a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under aim 1, investigators were designed a &quot;Healthy Tiffin Box&quot; intervention for children. We&#xD;
      were provided a specially designed Tiffin box that will contain five different compartments&#xD;
      of various sizes for stuffing with five different food types in order to ensure healthy&#xD;
      balanced diet. It was recommended to parents to provide food from all food groups and make a&#xD;
      'Healthy Tiffin Box' with an amount adjusted to the recommended size of the designated&#xD;
      compartment. We were suggested a seasonally available and culturally appropriate list of&#xD;
      healthy foods and recipes for children. The use of 'Healthy Tiffin Box' was demonstrated to&#xD;
      parents, children and school authority by study staff and the benefit of the box will be&#xD;
      explained to understand the importance of healthy eating and physical activity practice from&#xD;
      their early life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve specific aim 2, a healthy Tiffin box (intervention material) and healthy eating&#xD;
      and active living intervention guideline (intervention module) were developed to deliver&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle message encouraging healthy dietary habit and physical activity pattern in&#xD;
      order to control childhood overweight and obesity. The guideline was consisted of detail&#xD;
      description of healthy dietary behaviour and appropriate physical activity within school&#xD;
      environments. There were some pictorial messages and food items in the guideline for clear&#xD;
      understanding. We were delivered messages through one hour interactive group session&#xD;
      consisting of child and parents pair based on guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators were provided specially designated healthy tiffin box to encourage children&#xD;
      healthy eating habit started from their school time. In this feasibility study, children were&#xD;
      selected for tiffin box intervention based on their higher BMI and based on consent from&#xD;
      their parents. For children aged 11-12 years old, we were collected their assent beside their&#xD;
      parent's consent. The tiffin box was designated based on available design of box with&#xD;
      addition compartment from the local market. In order to building a healthy tiffin box, we&#xD;
      were designed additional four compartments with appropriate portion size for whole grain,&#xD;
      snakes, fruits and vegetable. For assessing feasibility of implementing &quot;Healthy Tiffin Box&quot;&#xD;
      intervention we were adopted three steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step 1: Demonstration sessions on healthy Tiffin box and guidelines for children and&#xD;
           parents&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step 2: Implementation of intervention and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step 3: Assessment of intervention among children&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Investigators were demonstrate to parents and children how they will use healthy&#xD;
      Tiffin box for school meal and how healthy eating guideline will guide them to prefer healthy&#xD;
      foods with appropriate portion size for their children through group session. We were&#xD;
      suggested the parents a list of healthy food items for each compartment of the Tiffin box.&#xD;
      Selected parents and children were rigorously trained on healthy eating and active living&#xD;
      guideline. We were conducted session with child and mother in pair and give an overview on&#xD;
      the following topics related to energy intake and expenditure 1) a decrease in the&#xD;
      consumption of unhealthy diets 2) Culturally and seasonally available healthy foods for&#xD;
      children 3) proper method of providing food for school 4) increasing the ratio of healthy to&#xD;
      unhealthy snacks importance of physical activity during childhood 5) Type of indoor and&#xD;
      outdoor activities for children 6) a reduction in screen-based activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training was included interactive lecture on the above topics within children's&#xD;
      appropriate time (during Tiffin period or after school time) and demonstration on the proper&#xD;
      use of healthy Tiffin box. We were involved children and parents prioritizing few photographs&#xD;
      of available healthy and unhealthy foods as first activity; the second activity was involved&#xD;
      sorting few existing photographs of active and sedentary, indoor and outdoor activities, and&#xD;
      discussion around a photograph of an overweight adolescent boy and girl playing basketball&#xD;
      was third activity. Photographs were collected from existing sources through relevant website&#xD;
      to understand and encourage discussion amongst children that previously have been shown to be&#xD;
      an effective method (Curtin, 2001). We were performed an hour session among school teachers&#xD;
      for their understanding about the programme and guideline. As teachers are responsible for&#xD;
      children's school hour's activities, they were also be included in the training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: This step was included implementation of intervention and follow-up. We were set&#xD;
      goals during the training session on Tiffin box and guideline with the parents and&#xD;
      children's. We were asked the parents to provide locally available healthy foods and tasty&#xD;
      recopies for their children from all food groups that they have learnt from their session.&#xD;
      Parents were also being asked to monitor active physical game during their leisure time. For&#xD;
      activities during school, teachers were being requested to reinforce their pupils for&#xD;
      physical activity. Selected participants were followed up each weekly by a staff in order to&#xD;
      ensure compliance to intervention by providing recommended healthy foods and ensure&#xD;
      activities to keep energy balance. Throughout the programme the children and parents were&#xD;
      encouraged to find acceptable activity and dietary replacements from available list to ensure&#xD;
      healthy energy balance. Teachers were asked to follow children's daily eating patterns as&#xD;
      well as physical activity. Our study staffs were followed up each participant weekly up to 4&#xD;
      weeks after the training session and document findings through a check-list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3: Investigators were assess the feasibility of the intervention among children at the&#xD;
      schools. Parents of the students were asked about the intervention to assess compliance. We&#xD;
      were developed an assessment tool based on guideline in order to understand problem parents&#xD;
      faced while implementing the intervention. This assessment tool (check-list) was used to&#xD;
      understand the feasibility of intervention which was consist of prescribed information on&#xD;
      diet and physical activity that have been given during training session. The assessments of&#xD;
      feasibility of intervention among child and parents pair were conducted in school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve specific aim 3, Investigators were adopted qualitative approach to assess&#xD;
      the feasibility of proposed Healthy Tiffin Box intervention for children with higher than a&#xD;
      normal BMI for promoting healthy eating and active living in school setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus group discussion of parents Focus group discussion of children and parents were used to&#xD;
      assess the likelihood and acceptance of the proposed future healthy eating and active living&#xD;
      intervention as well as their opportunity and barrier to implement such intervention in&#xD;
      school setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All activities were designed to allow spontaneous discussion amongst the children; the one&#xD;
      research officer was act as a facilitator. During focus group discussion, one research&#xD;
      officer was responsible for keeping a written record that was include notation of children's&#xD;
      responses, relevant quotes, and facilitator observations. An observer was also be present&#xD;
      while discussion to observe whether the discussion is continuing according to discussion&#xD;
      guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Informant interviews (KII) of teachers and policy makers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators were perform key informant interviews to collect information from a wide range&#xD;
      of experts-including teacher and policy makers, involve with schools, planner of schools and&#xD;
      parents/guardian- who have detailed knowledge about opportunity of school facilities and&#xD;
      experiencing barriers for school health programs. Through these interviews, with their&#xD;
      particular knowledge and understanding, Investigators would be able to evaluate insight on&#xD;
      nature of the problem and take recommendations for solutions.&#xD;
