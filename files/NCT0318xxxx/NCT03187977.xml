  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computer-based cognitive training has been found to be helpful for improving attention and&#xD;
      working memory in pediatric and adult patients with existing cognitive difficulties. A&#xD;
      previous study was conducted at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital with survivors of&#xD;
      childhood cancer who were experiencing difficulties with attention and/or working memory.&#xD;
      Findings from that study indicated that the use of Cogmed, computer-based cognitive training,&#xD;
      is effective in improving attention and working memory in survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn whether Cogmed intervention completed at the end of therapy for&#xD;
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia will be effective for all survivors (i.e., regardless of whether&#xD;
      they have existing difficulties).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the overall participation rate in a randomized, standard-of-care controlled&#xD;
           trial of computerized cognitive intervention administered at the end of TOTXVI therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the study completion rate in a randomized, standard-of-care controlled trial&#xD;
           of computerized cognitive intervention administered at the end of TOTXVI therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the compliance rate for participants randomized to the intervention arm of a&#xD;
           computerized cognitive intervention administered at the end of TOTXVI therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the standard deviation for the overall cohort on a measure of working&#xD;
           memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To use neuroimaging data collected in the context of the Total Therapy XVI trial to&#xD;
           explore candidate biomarkers predictive of response to the computerized cognitive&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;

      Participants enrolled on the TOTXVI protocol at SJCRH will be randomized to either complete&#xD;
      the Cogmed intervention at the end of their therapy, or to a standard-of-care condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cogmed is a computer-based cognitive training program that consists of rotating exercises&#xD;
      that train attention and working memory. The exercises are presented in a child-friendly,&#xD;
      game-like format. Training is completed at home in 25 sessions for 15-45 minutes each weekday&#xD;
      for 5-9 weeks. A research team member serves as a coach who monitors progress and provides&#xD;
      support through weekly phone calls with study participants and their parents/guardians.&#xD;
      Information regarding compliance and performance is tracked over the internet and used to&#xD;
      tailor feedback during weekly telephone coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurocognitive assessments will be conducted at baseline, immediate-post (3-4 months after&#xD;
      baseline), and 8 month follow-up (12 months after baseline).&#xD;
