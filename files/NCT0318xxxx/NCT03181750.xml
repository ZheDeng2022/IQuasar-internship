  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Palliative care is a priority area of focus for the National Institute of Nursing Research.&#xD;
      Despite the evidence-based benefits of palliative care, access remains limited, especially in&#xD;
      poor urban and rural settings. Cultural and linguistic barriers may also increase disparities&#xD;
      in palliative care for Latinos. Due to a nationwide shortage of palliative care providers and&#xD;
      the unique cultural preferences and values of patients, our innovative study has the&#xD;
      potential to improve palliative care outcomes and reduce health disparities in both urban and&#xD;
      rural underserved communities.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Latinos are more likely to experience uncontrolled pain, institutional death, and are less&#xD;
      likely to engage in advance care planning. Efforts to increase access to palliative care must&#xD;
      maximize primary palliative care and community based models to meet the ever growing need in&#xD;
      a culturally-sensitive and congruent manner. Patient navigator interventions are community&#xD;
      based, culturally tailored models of care and have been successfully implemented to improve&#xD;
      disease prevention, early diagnosis and treatment. The investigators have developed and&#xD;
      implemented a patient navigation intervention to improve palliative care outcomes for&#xD;
      seriously ill hospitalized Latinos. They have demonstrated feasibility and early findings&#xD;
      suggest this intervention can improve palliative care outcomes for Latinos with advanced&#xD;
      cancer. Building on this prior research, the investigators propose a fully powered randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of the manualized patient navigator&#xD;
      intervention in a non-cancer population. A total of 240 Latino adults with non-cancer,&#xD;
      advanced medical illness enrolled from 8 urban and 4 rural clinical sites will be randomized&#xD;
      to the intervention group (5 palliative care-related patient navigator visits plus&#xD;
      educational materials) or control group (usual care plus educational materials). Participants&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention group will demonstrate better quality of life, will be more&#xD;
      likely to have a palliative approach to their care, have higher rates of advance care&#xD;
      planning, better pain and symptom control, and higher rates of hospice utilization compared&#xD;
      to the control group). They will conduct a cost analysis of the patient navigator&#xD;
      intervention by comparing direct costs of the intervention and cost and utilization of health&#xD;
      care system resources across the study arms. Participants randomized to the intervention will&#xD;
      have lower costs in the 6 months following study enrollment compared to participants in the&#xD;
      control arm. Decedent participants randomized to the intervention will have lower costs in&#xD;
      the last 3 months of life compared to decedent participants in the control arm. For the&#xD;
      intervention visits, bicultural, bilingual navigators (guias) integrate core Latino values,&#xD;
      while addressing barriers to a palliative approach through education, culturally tailored&#xD;
      messaging, and patient activation. Patients will be interviewed at baseline and 3 months&#xD;
      using the QUAL-E quality of life scale, Brief Pain Inventory, Edmonton Symptom Assessment&#xD;
      Scale, and the Patient Navigator Process and Outcomes Measure. Medical records will be&#xD;
      reviewed to assess advance directive completion, hospice and health care utilization and&#xD;
      intensity of care at the end of life. This culturally tailored, evidence-based, theory&#xD;
      driven, highly innovative patient navigation intervention has significant potential to&#xD;
      improve palliative care for Latinos, and facilitate true health equity in palliative and end&#xD;
      of life care.&#xD;
