      To seek the efficacy signals of trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy in pretreated&#xD;
      patients of HER2 positive, relapse or metastatic carcinoma of digestive system as response&#xD;
      rate (RR) determined by the Investigator using RECIST 1.1, and provide evidence for phase III&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, (HER2) is overexpressed /amplified in multiple&#xD;
      carcinomas, for example, gastric cancer(GC), gastroesophageal junction&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma(GEJA),and breast cancer.And HER2 is closely related to tumor proliferation&#xD;
      &amp;metastases.About 90% Chinese esophagus cancer are squamous cell origin. The reported HER2&#xD;
      overexpression ranged from 5-30%, Beijing cancer hospital reported an 11% positive rate. The&#xD;
      variety of HER2 positive rate may because of the absence of standard HER2 testing criteria.&#xD;
      The current treatment for metastatic Esophageal squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) is not&#xD;
      satisfactory. Fluorouracil and platinum are considered as first line standard of care (SOC)&#xD;
      with a 20-30% RR and 7-9 months overall survival (OS). In second line setting, there is no&#xD;
      SOC in china. And the efficacy is not satisfactory. Esophageal adenocarcinoma has a higher&#xD;
      HER2 positive rate of 14%, but no data reported of using trastuzumab in these patients in&#xD;
      China. Biliary tract cancer (BTC), including intrahepatic/extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and&#xD;
      Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is very aggressive, total 5y survival is less than 5% for&#xD;
      unresectable patients. GBC is account for approximately 2/3 of BTC, and it's estimated the&#xD;
      incidence in china is 52800 and the mortality is 40700 in 2015. Most patients are diagnosed&#xD;
      in advanced stage and lose the opportunity of surgery. However, there is no SOC for&#xD;
      unresectable BTC, gemcitabine plus platinum provided a 30% RR and 10 month OS. In second line&#xD;
      treatment, no differences were seen between various experimental agents. The reported HER2&#xD;
      positive rate range from 5.1% to 57% in biliary duct cancer and 4.7% to 64% in GBC.&#xD;
      Researchers reported her2 amplification is related to tumor stage and lymph nodes metastasis&#xD;
      in 221 BTC patients. Another study reported a 16.6% positive rate and worse prognosis with a&#xD;
      sample size of 230 GBC patients. Meanwhile, HER2 pathway mutation rate reached 37%. All imply&#xD;
      that BTC may be the potential anti HER therapy population. Besides, other digestive system&#xD;
      tumor has low HER2 positive rate (Small intestinal cancer 0.9-3%; hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      2.4%; Pancreatic cancer 3%; etc.). However, the patient pool is large and has no SOC in&#xD;
      second Line. Whether these HER2 + patients can gain benefit form anti- her treatment is worth&#xD;
      investigating. In 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), a study reported that&#xD;
      using trastuzumab and pertuzumab combination, 35% metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) and 50%&#xD;
      BTC patients who heavily pretreated had objective response. However, china doesn't have&#xD;
      studies for these patients. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concurrent basket trial will explore the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab with&#xD;
      chemotherapy in Chinese patients of pretreated, HER2 positive, relapse or metastatic&#xD;
      carcinoma of digestive system.&#xD;
