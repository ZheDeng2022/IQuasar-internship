    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study testing whether Vyvanse&#xD;
      (lisdexamfetamine; LDX) improves executive functioning (EF) in 100 postmenopausal women who&#xD;
      report onset of EF difficulties after oophorectomy. This study involves magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) to see how LDX affects brain chemistry while undergoing two 6-week trials of&#xD;
      the study drug and placebo capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UPDATE: We have recently updated this protocol (09/2020) to offer a remote version of the&#xD;
      study that can be completed entirely from the participant's home. This alternate version of&#xD;
      the study eliminates travel, the MRI, and blood draws.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following a medically induced menopause, many women report difficulty in remembering things,&#xD;
      focusing and concentrating. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a&#xD;
      stimulant medication called Vyvanse® (lisdexamfetamine; LDX) on executive functioning, such&#xD;
      as attention, processing, organization, and memory, in women who are experiencing executive&#xD;
      functioning difficulties after having undergone a risk-reducing bilateral&#xD;
      salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO). This study involves magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to see how&#xD;
      LDX affects brain chemistry while undergoing two 6-week trials of the study drug and placebo&#xD;
      capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals wishing to participate in this study are medically healthy women between the ages&#xD;
      of 35-58 years old who have undergone a risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO)&#xD;
      within the previous 15 years. Participants must have been premenopausal before undergoing&#xD;
      RRSO (meaning they were having regular periods). They also must not have undergone radiation&#xD;
      or chemotherapy in the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, participants must not suffer from a mental illness, including Attention Deficit&#xD;
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and must not have a recent history of drug abuse.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants must not suffer from a fear of small, enclosed spaces&#xD;
      (claustrophobia), and not have any implanted medical devices such as a pacemaker, orthodontic&#xD;
      braces, or shrapnel. They must not have a history of seizures, uncontrolled hypertension or&#xD;
      known renal impairment.&#xD;
