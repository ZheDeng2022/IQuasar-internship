  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the amount of a protein in the brain known as tau&#xD;
      using an imaging procedure called Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT). 18F-AV-1451 is a&#xD;
      specialized radioactive PET imaging agent that is able to detect the presence of tau in the&#xD;
      brain. In this study, the investigator will use the 18F-AV-1451 to capture images of tau in&#xD;
      the brain. Findings from this study will likely provide insight into the mechanisms and&#xD;
      distinctions of age-related cognitive decline and that of very early Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

      The investigator will conduct a tau PET scan in cognitively normal older adults enrolled in&#xD;
      the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) study at the University of Pennsylvania's&#xD;
      Penn Memory Center/Alzheimer's Disease Core Center (PMC/ADC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Study duration will generally be a one-day study visit, but all subjects will&#xD;
      be followed annually as part of their participation in the NACC study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked to obtain a longitudinal follow-up scan approximately 2-3 years&#xD;
      after the baseline scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Center(s): Penn Memory Center/Alzheimer's Disease Core Center at Perelman Center for&#xD;
      Advanced Medicine, UPHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To collect Tau PET imaging in cognitively normal older adults adults and patients&#xD;
      with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), in the NACC study to determine relationship to&#xD;
      clinical, cognitive, and other biomarker data. In particular, the investigator will examine&#xD;
      relationship of tau PET to structural and functional measures of medial temporal lobe (MTL)&#xD;
      subregions. Findings from this study will likely provide insight into the mechanisms and&#xD;
      distinctions of age-related cognitive decline and that of preclinical Alzheimer's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subject: 200, approximately 150 cognitively normal older adults and 50 with mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria Eligible subjects will be NACC cohort participants who&#xD;
      have received a consensus conference designation of &quot;Cognitively Normal and patients with&#xD;
      Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)&quot;. All participants must have had their annual NACC clinical&#xD;
      and cognitive examination within 6 months of the tau PET imaging and an MRI scan (including&#xD;
      high resolution imaging of medial temporal lobe regions) and amyloid PET within 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a cross-sectional study using the radiotracer 18F-AV-1451 to determine&#xD;
      the relationship of tau pathology to both cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical and&#xD;
      biomarker data of NACC cohort participants who are Cognitively Normal and patient with mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment . All subjects will already be part of the longitudinal cohort study,&#xD;
      known as the &quot;NACC&quot; cohort, of the PMC/ADC. For the current protocol, participants will&#xD;
      provide informed consent before beginning any study procedures. After screening assessments,&#xD;
      participants will undergo PET scan imaging with 18F-AV-1451 and again 2 to 3 years after the&#xD;
      baseline scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration: Subjects will receive a single IV bolus injection target dose of&#xD;
      approximately 370 MBq (10 mCi ± 20%) of 18F-AV-1451 At approximately 75 minutes post dose,&#xD;
      scanning will begin. An approximately 30-minute acquisition (six 5 minute intervals) will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be monitored continuously during the imaging session. Subjects who&#xD;
      experience any adverse event during an imaging session will not be discharged until the event&#xD;
      has resolved or stabilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methodology This is a data gathering protocol to obtain molecular imaging data in&#xD;
      a cohort of older adults without cognitive symptoms. However, specific analyses will include&#xD;
      quantitative measures of 18F-AV-1451 within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and its&#xD;
      relationship to volume and thickness of MTL subregions measured with high-resolution MRI.&#xD;
      Additional correlation and regression analyses will be performed to determine relationships&#xD;
      between 18F-AV-1451 and cross-sectional and longitudinal measures acquired as part of each&#xD;
      individuals participation in the NACC longitudinal cohort study, including, but not limited&#xD;
      to, MRI imaging, neurocognitive testing, demographic information, genetic data, and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
