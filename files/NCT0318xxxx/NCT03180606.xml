  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present health care situation for the elderly in many countries is insufficient and not&#xD;
      designed according to the health care needs of the aged population. In a pragmatic&#xD;
      multicenter primary care setting (n= 1600), the investigators use an evidence based&#xD;
      prediction model to find elderly (75+) with high risk for complex medical care or&#xD;
      hospitalization and apply a differentiated and directed medical and social care to this risk&#xD;
      group, in comparison to usual care. The intervention will include all the latest evidence&#xD;
      based tools in the care of elderly (multi-professional team, social support, medical care&#xD;
      home-visits, telephone support, general practitioner visits, etc). The project has high&#xD;
      potential impact on the development of future care of elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the intervention study, several academic sub-studies focusing on patient's&#xD;
      perspective, professional roles, equality, implementation and governance management of health&#xD;
      care will be performed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current project is a multidisciplinary research project covering several aspects of a&#xD;
      shift in elderly care, with outcome measures not only related to primary medical or&#xD;
      functional measures. The analyses will widen the view to overall societal costs and effects&#xD;
      of changes in key institutions of social security as well as to hidden mechanisms in the&#xD;
      governance system of care and health care of elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the present study is to investigate the extent to which a differentiated&#xD;
      (personalized) and targeted primary care intervention provided to a statistically predicted&#xD;
      risk population of elderly, results in care that is more effective and of higher quality than&#xD;
      that of a control group receiving standard care. In a pragmatic multicenter primary care&#xD;
      setting (n= 1600), an evidence based prediction model to find elderly (75+) with high risk&#xD;
      for complex medical care or hospitalization is used followed by a differentiated and directed&#xD;
      medical and social care to this risk group, in comparison to usual care. The intervention&#xD;
      will include all the latest evidence based tools in the care of elderly (multi-professional&#xD;
      team, social support, medical care home-visits, telephone support, general practitioner&#xD;
      visits, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also aim to study the care model in a broader sense; experiences of the&#xD;
      elderly, their social networks and diversity. Finally, the project will also investigate how&#xD;
      the health care system, from specific health care professionals (primary care nurses,&#xD;
      doctors, para-medical staff) to management levels and politicians influence the&#xD;
      implementation of the present and future care models. One specific subproject focuses on the&#xD;
      mechanisms behind the inability of steak holders/politicians and top administrative&#xD;
      executives to find efficient governance principals for elderly care and health care, despite&#xD;
      already available knowledge sources.&#xD;
