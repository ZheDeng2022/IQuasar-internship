  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will test a measure of treatment quality, Exposure Guide, for therapists using&#xD;
      exposure therapy for youths and young adults with anxiety or OCD. We anticipate that users of&#xD;
      this measure will be able to complete it reliably, find it acceptable, and that the measure&#xD;
      will predict patient outcome. This project will include 40 therapists treating 300 anxious&#xD;
      youth and young adults ages 5-25 at a large community mental health agency. Results of this&#xD;
      study will establish the Exposure Guide as a measure of exposure quality in real world&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Empirically supported behavioral treatments cannot be effectively disseminated without&#xD;
      understanding key quality components. Mechanism-informed quality measures have extraordinary&#xD;
      potential to enhance pragmatism by eliminating unnecessary elements and targeting multiple&#xD;
      problems and populations, and to enhance predictive value by detecting mechanism engagement&#xD;
      early in treatment. Community Mental Health Agencies (CMHAs), however, are often ill-equipped&#xD;
      to use such measures of treatment quality due to burden and limited resources. Exposure&#xD;
      therapy for anxiety is an ideal prototype for testing a practical, mechanism-informed quality&#xD;
      measure in CMHAs given its potential for public health impact and clear theory of mechanism.&#xD;
      The Exposure Guide (EG), a brief quality tool measuring therapist behaviors and mechanism,&#xD;
      was developed based on microanalytic coded data showing a strong link between therapist&#xD;
      behavior and patient outcome across three RCTs of exposure therapy in youth. Initial&#xD;
      psychometrics for the EG using these RCT data are promising showing reliability, construct&#xD;
      validity, and predictive validity, and pilot data suggests it may be acceptable and feasible&#xD;
      in a community setting. Building upon these findings, we propose to test this novel measure&#xD;
      of exposure quality, EG, in a community setting including its reliability and validity, its&#xD;
      pragmatism, and which community end-users can become reliable and valid reporters. Therapists&#xD;
      at a large local CMHA (N = 40) treating anxious youth and young adults ages 5-25 (N = 300)&#xD;
      will participate in this study. The EG will be completed by 1) agency supervisors monthly, 2)&#xD;
      therapists per session, 3) patient/families per session, and 4) study raters per session.&#xD;
      Results from this study will establish an innovative model for measuring therapeutic elements&#xD;
      that trigger mechanism of change in real-world therapy as well as inform future use of EG as&#xD;
      a training tool to improve exposure quality in community settings.&#xD;
