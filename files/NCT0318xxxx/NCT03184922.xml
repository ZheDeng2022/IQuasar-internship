      Study Aims and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the following null hypothesis: that there is no difference in clinical and&#xD;
      functional outcome when comparing outcomes of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction&#xD;
      when comparing femoral side graft fixation with either a fixed versus an adjustable&#xD;
      suspensory loop system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will achieve this aim by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrolling 150 patients into this study over a period of 2 years and 8 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carrying out a prospective randomised study looking at the subject matter over a period&#xD;
           of 5 years and 8 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysing patients functional status pre and post-surgery using patient generated&#xD;
           questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitatively measuring knee joint laxity using the KT1000 testing device at the 3, 6&#xD;
           and 12 month post-surgery time frames&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collating the data received into a spread sheet for analysis by a professional&#xD;
           statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not uncommon to tear the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) particularly during sporting&#xD;
      activities. Younger and sportier patients will often have this ligament reconstructed so as&#xD;
      to allow them to return to sport with a stable knee joint that they feel they can trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various surgical techniques exist to perform ACL reconstruction. In Exeter, the favoured&#xD;
      technique is to reconstruct the ligament by taking two of the hamstring tendons from the back&#xD;
      of the knee and creating a graft with these, passing them through a bony tunnel to replace&#xD;
      the torn ACL. On the shin bone side of the knee the graft is fixed in place using a screw. On&#xD;
      the thigh bone side, the graft is attached to a device known as a suspensory loop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of the graft and the length of the tunnel in the thigh bone vary from patient to&#xD;
      patient. It is important to get a good length of the graft material in both the shin and&#xD;
      thigh bones so as to give the best chance of the graft attaching to the surrounding bone.&#xD;
      With the fixed loop system, once the metal button attached to the outer thigh bone is in&#xD;
      place, the length of the loop cannot be adjusted. Thus the amount of hamstring graft in&#xD;
      either end of the bony tunnel cannot be changed. One potential advantage of an adjustable&#xD;
      loop system is that the amount of graft in either end of the bone tunnel can be altered to&#xD;
      ensure sufficient graft is accurately placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team are planning to run this study to identify which type of loop system gives&#xD;
      the best outcome for patients, examining the results in different ways including&#xD;
      questionnaires to measure how well the patients feel their knee is performing, and specific&#xD;
      tests to measure knee function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients consent to be in the study, they will be randomly allocated to receive one of the&#xD;
      2 ACL reconstruction options above and their progress monitored for 2 years after the&#xD;
      operation. All aspects of surgical care will be as routine practice apart from the decision&#xD;
      to fix the graft to the thigh bone with an adjustable or fixed suspensory loop.&#xD;

      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treatment of patients requiring anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, is&#xD;
      there any difference in clinical and functional outcomes for patients when comparing femoral&#xD;
      side graft fixation using a fixed loop versus an adjustable suspensory loop system?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the following null hypothesis: that there is no difference in clinical&#xD;
           and functional outcome when comparing outcomes of ACL reconstruction when comparing the&#xD;
           use of a fixed versus an adjustable suspensory loop system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify the optimal surgical technique for patients requiring ACL reconstruction&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will achieve these aims by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrolling 150 patients into this study over a period of 2 years and 8 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carrying out a prospective randomised study looking at the subject matter over a period&#xD;
           of 5 years and 8 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysing patients functional status pre and post-surgery using patient generated&#xD;
           questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitatively measuring knee joint laxity using the KT1000 testing device at the 3, 6&#xD;
           and 12 month post-surgery time frames&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collating the data received into a spread sheet for analysis by a professional&#xD;
           statistician&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACL rupture is a common injury. The National Ligament Registry (NLR) report (2016) details&#xD;
      that 2585 patients with this injury were added to the Registry between 31/01/15 and 31/01/16.&#xD;
      Of these, 1851 (71.6%) underwent reconstruction surgery and 734 patients (28.4%) were treated&#xD;
      non-operatively. There is no clear consensus as to the best surgical technique for this&#xD;
      procedure. However, one of the commonest techniques used is that involving the use of&#xD;
      hamstring autograft- 95% of ACL reconstructions in Sweden in 2012 were performed using this&#xD;
      method and 88% in the UK in 2015. A tunnel is drilled through the distal femur and proximal&#xD;
      tibia, and the ACL graft passed through the tunnel. With this hamstring autograft method,&#xD;
      various methods exist for fixing the graft on the femoral side- interference screws,&#xD;
      transfemoral suspensory devices and femoral suspensory devices. There is no consensus as to&#xD;
      which is best.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation after this type of surgery has become more aggressive over the years with&#xD;
      early full weight-bearing, range of motion and strengthening exercises beginning soon after&#xD;
      surgery. It is essential to preserve the initial stability of the graft whilst healing of the&#xD;
      graft to the surrounding bony tunnel occurs so as to provide maximal benefit from the surgery&#xD;
      for the patients. This healing process can take up to 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure of an ACL reconstruction can take different forms with graft stretching, graft&#xD;
      failing to incorporate, traumatic re-rupture and infection being the most frequent causes.&#xD;
      The assessment of ACL reconstruction failure can be performed in different ways. Samitier et&#xD;
      al report the knee may demonstrate objective laxity (as tested by clinical tests such as&#xD;
      Lachman and Pivot Shift or mechanical tests such as the KT1000). There may be a patient&#xD;
      perception of instability even though objective tests are satisfactory). Using the KT1000&#xD;
      arthrometer, Alford and Bach report the rationale for a maximum manual side-to-side&#xD;
      difference of 3 mm when assessing anterior tibial translation or an absolute laxity of 10 mm&#xD;
      in the injured knee as the diagnostic criteria for ACL deficiency. Patient recorded outcome&#xD;
      measures such as the Knee Osteo-arthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Tegner activity scale and the&#xD;
      International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective questionnaire are all validated&#xD;
      and can be used to assess satisfaction with surgical outcome and functional ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suspensory fixation devices are used to draw the graft in to the femoral tunnel. Tunnel&#xD;
      lengths differ between patients as do graft lengths. With a fixed length suspensory loop,&#xD;
      once the metal device to fix the graft in the femoral tunnel has been deployed, it cannot be&#xD;
      adjusted. In theory, fixed length suspensory loops may result in insufficient graft in the&#xD;
      femoral tunnel. Whilst fixed suspensory loops are available in a multitude of sizes to&#xD;
      overcome this problem, this will necessitate keeping a large stock of differing size products&#xD;
      available in the operating theatre which will incur cost repercussions. With an adjustable&#xD;
      suspensory loop, the graft can continue to be pulled up into the femoral tunnel even after&#xD;
      the fixation button is attached to the outer femoral cortex giving the operating surgeon&#xD;
      greater intra-operative flexibility. This will allow a greater amount of graft to be drawn&#xD;
      within the femur. If one can have a short length of suspensory loop and a greater amount of&#xD;
      graft in the tunnel, there will be less motion of the graft in the tunnel and a greater&#xD;
      ability of the graft to unite to the surrounding bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the harvested graft is unexpectedly found to be short, the adjustable loop may offer a&#xD;
      further advantage to the surgeon over the fixed loop. In this situation, if the fixed loop is&#xD;
      deployed, there may be a sub-optimal amount of graft in the tibial tunnel. Thus, there is&#xD;
      less graft for the interference screw to engage against for fixation on the tibial side. In&#xD;
      these circumstances, the ability for the surgeon to lengthen the loop, and pull some extra&#xD;
      graft into the tibia will allow for better fixation of the graft on the tibial side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently, the fixed loop devices are available in varying sizes. Keeping a range of&#xD;
      different sized products in stock to cover graft length issues, will incur extra costs. A&#xD;
      benefit of an adjustable loop system may be therefore, that it will only require the single&#xD;
      size product to be kept on the shelf, with an implication for cost savings in terms of amount&#xD;
      of stock that needs to be on hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been several biomechanical studies comparing the strength and lengthening of fixed&#xD;
      versus suspensory loop devices in a laboratory environment. In particular, assessment is made&#xD;
      of the lengthening of the suspensory loop when subject to repetitive cyclic loading and also&#xD;
      of ultimate failure when subject to load to failure testing. Varying results have been&#xD;
      reported. Petre et al showed 4 suspensory loops had ultimate failure tolerances that would&#xD;
      exceed the forces that an ACL graft would be subjected to. However, on repetitive cyclic&#xD;
      testing one of the adjustable length suspensory loops stretched in excess of 3mm which was&#xD;
      beyond the threshold which would be considered a clinical failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eguchi et al reported a fixed loop suspensory device as having greater statistically&#xD;
      significant strength and lower total displacement/ stretching values by comparison to an&#xD;
      adjustable loop device. Barrow et al similarly found that the ultimate load to failure of all&#xD;
      3 devices tested (fixed and adjustable loops) exceeded the forces likely to be experienced in&#xD;
      a patient's knee during the early postoperative rehabilitation period. They also reported the&#xD;
      adjustable loop devices lengthening to a clinically significant degree when subject to cyclic&#xD;
      loading. However, they reported this lengthening significantly reduced for one adjustable&#xD;
      loop device when the free suture ends were tied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barrow and Petre's papers examined loop strength and failure rates in a laboratory&#xD;
      environment using a mechanical device for loop testing. Eguchi's work included testing loops&#xD;
      fixed to porcine femurs and bovine femurs. Whilst recognised as models for such biomechanical&#xD;
      testing, neither test scenario replicates the in-vivo situation that an ACL graft will face&#xD;
      in human tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only clinical study comparing the loops was published by Boyle et al in 2015. In this&#xD;
      retrospective study, the results of 188 patients were compared for 73 patients with an&#xD;
      adjustable suspensory loop and 115 with a fixed loop. At varying time intervals of follow-&#xD;
      up, no clinically statistically significant different outcomes were identified using&#xD;
      stability testing via the KT1000 device and nor were differences found in graft failure. This&#xD;
      study however, was not a prospective randomised study and has methodological flaws. In&#xD;
      particular, there is a potential for bias in interpreting the assessment of the pivot shift&#xD;
      and Lachman tests post-operatively as this was carried out by the operating surgeons who were&#xD;
      not blinded to the type of surgery undertaken. Data was available for all 188 patients at the&#xD;
      6 month post-operative time frame- by which time graft healing should have occurred. However,&#xD;
      only 58.5% of patients had data at 1 year follow-up and only 11.2% of patients achieved 2&#xD;
      year follow up. The graft diameter was statistically significantly larger in the adjustable&#xD;
      loop cohort which can affect graft healing. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, this&#xD;
      study outlined there was no detriment to using the adjustable loop system compared to the&#xD;
      fixed loop in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the evidence of load to failure strength for all types of loop appears satisfactory,&#xD;
      whilst some makes of adjustable loop appear to lengthen beyond acceptable levels in a&#xD;
      laboratory situation after cyclic testing. We have carried out independent biomechanical&#xD;
      testing of the loops being examined in this study and both met requirements for not&#xD;
      lengthening excessively after cyclic loading and having pull to failure strength measurements&#xD;
      in excess of those than would occur in daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study therefore, aims to examine if there is any difference in clinical and&#xD;
      functional outcome for patients undergoing ACL reconstruction using a hamstring autograft in&#xD;
      a group of patients having a fixed length suspensory device used on the femoral side versus a&#xD;
      group with an adjustable length one. It will be the first purely clinical prospective&#xD;
      randomised study of these type of loops with the assessors of both clinical tests and the&#xD;
      KT1000 device blinded as to which type of surgery the patient has undergone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised, prospective, study is to be set up to compare the results of 2 different ways&#xD;
      of undertaking femoral fixation in ACL reconstruction surgery. One arm of the study will be&#xD;
      randomised to have their surgery using a fixed length suspensory loop device for achieving&#xD;
      femoral side graft fixation, and the other to have an adjustable suspensory loop used. The&#xD;
      study will be carried out in the operating theatres, orthopaedic out-patients department and&#xD;
      the physiotherapy department at the Royal Devon and Exeter (RD+E) Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be invited to take part in the study in one of 2 ways. Firstly, by their&#xD;
      surgeon when they are initially listed for ACL reconstruction surgery at their out-patient&#xD;
      consultation at the RD+E Hospital orthopaedic department. Alternatively, if they are&#xD;
      identified from the current surgical waiting list as suitable for inclusion. In this latter&#xD;
      case, they will be contacted by letter by their surgeon asking for permission for one of the&#xD;
      research team to contact them to discuss the study. All participants will be sent a copy of&#xD;
      the patient information leaflet. At their preparation for surgery appointment- usually 2-4&#xD;
      weeks before their operation, they will meet one of the research team who can answer any&#xD;
      questions about the study. A study consent form will be signed at this meeting if the patient&#xD;
      is willing to be involved in the research Patients who agree to enter the trial will be&#xD;
      divided at random to enter the different treatment arms of the study. The randomization&#xD;
      schedule will be determined using an on-line random assignment sequence generator&#xD;
      (www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1.cfm) and will be kept and controlled by the study&#xD;
      co-ordinator, and the surgeons will not have access to this schedule. The randomisation&#xD;
      details for each patient will be written on to a slip of paper and placed inside an opaque&#xD;
      envelope. Each envelope is attributed to one patient and given a study number. One of the&#xD;
      research team (study coordinator or research nurse) will supply the operating theatre staff&#xD;
      with one of the envelopes containing the slip of paper upon which will be written the&#xD;
      randomisation allocation for the patient undergoing surgery at that time. The operating&#xD;
      theatre staff will inform the surgeon of the allocation. 150 patients will be initially&#xD;
      included with allocation to either arm of the trial. The operating surgeon will not be able&#xD;
      to read the slips before the envelope is opened, nor will they perform the randomisation&#xD;
      which will be carried out by one of the investigators not carrying out the surgery on the&#xD;
      individual patients i.e. the operating surgeon takes no part in the randomisation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015, at the RD+E Hospital 75 ACL reconstruction procedures were undertaken. 35 cases were&#xD;
      performed at Sidmouth hospital giving a total of 110 per annum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lanzetti's paper (Ref 11) indicated that the mean and Standard Deviation (SD) values using&#xD;
      the KT-1000 to measure Antero-Posterior (AP) translation of the tibia in relation to the&#xD;
      femur were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group a Group b KT 1000 Manual maximum 2.3+/-0.9 2.5+/-1 side to side difference&#xD;
      (millimetres-mm) 2.1+/-1.2 2.3+/-1 Based on these values the study was powered to detect a&#xD;
      Minimum Clinically Important difference (MCID) of 0.6 mm, which would shift the KT-1000&#xD;
      reading from 3.0 mm (upper bound of satisfactory level) to 3.6 mm (0.6 mm above the&#xD;
      satisfactory upper bound).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: If the true minimum difference (or Minimal Clinically Important Difference)&#xD;
      between the experimental and control group KT-1000 measurement means is 0.6mm the researchers&#xD;
      will need to recruit 60 cases in each group to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the&#xD;
      population means are equal with probability (power) 0.9, type I error rate of 5%&#xD;
      (significance) and mean SD of 1.0 (Lanzetti paper referred to above) An adjustment of 20% to&#xD;
      account for drop outs would increase the number in each group to 75 and the total sample size&#xD;
      to 150 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of all the primary outcome between the 2 groups will be analysed at the 12 month time&#xD;
      frames using students t-test to compare the groups. A stats package such as SPSS version 24&#xD;
      software will be used (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois) for analysing the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential candidates for this study will be identified in one of 2 ways. Firstly, when&#xD;
      patients are listed for ACL reconstruction surgery whilst attending orthopaedic out-patient&#xD;
      clinics at the RD+E Hospital. At the time of this consultation they will be offered the&#xD;
      opportunity to participate in the study. They will be given a copy of the information about&#xD;
      the study and the consent form. They will have the opportunity therefore, to discuss the&#xD;
      study with their family, friends or General Practitioner (GP) if they wish to do so. It will&#xD;
      be explained that a member of the research team will contact them by telephone or letter to&#xD;
      ask if they wish to participate in this research. Alternatively, patients will be identified&#xD;
      from existing surgical waiting lists. In this case, they will be contacted by their surgeon&#xD;
      in writing asking for their permission for one of the study team to approach them about the&#xD;
      study. If permission is given, the patient will be sent a copy of the participant information&#xD;
      sheet and a consent form so that they can decide if they would like to be involved. One of&#xD;
      the research team- either the study coordinator or one of the research nurses- will then&#xD;
      contact the patient and if they are willing to be involved, will obtain written consent for&#xD;
      study participation. Consent is will be obtained at the preparation for surgery appointment&#xD;
      which usually occurs 2-4 weeks before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 copies of written consent will be obtained. One will be returned to the patient. One will&#xD;
      be placed in the medical notes and one will be kept by the research team in the patient's&#xD;
      case record file (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Generated Clinical Outcomes/ Pre-operative Functional Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ACL reconstruction patients attend the hospital for routine pre-operative&#xD;
      assessment-whether involved in the study or not. At this appointment-usually 2-4 weeks before&#xD;
      their operation- trial participants will complete the questionnaires related to the study:&#xD;
      the Knee Osteo-arthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the International Knee Documentation Committee&#xD;
      (IKDC) subjective knee questionnaire, the Lysholm Knee Questionnaire and the Tegner activity&#xD;
      score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Radiological Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients will have undergone a Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) scan of the affected knee&#xD;
      prior to surgery as part of routine care. This test is not performed on all patients having&#xD;
      this type of surgery, and is not one of the procedures being examined in this study; hence it&#xD;
      is not necessary for every patient to undergo this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be to one of 2 arms of the study. The patient will either receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An ACL reconstruction using a fixed length suspensory loop for femoral fixation, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An ACL reconstruction using an adjustable length suspensory loop for femoral fixation&#xD;
           Tibial fixation for all participants will be as per routine care with an appropriately&#xD;
           sized interference screw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who agree to enter the trial will be divided at random to enter the different&#xD;
      treatment arms of the study. The randomization schedule will be determined using an on-line&#xD;
      random assignment sequence generator (www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1.cfm) and will be&#xD;
      kept and controlled by the study co-ordinator, and the surgeons will not have access to this&#xD;
      schedule. The randomisation details for each patient will be written on to a slip of paper&#xD;
      and placed inside an opaque envelope. Each envelope is attributed to one patient and given a&#xD;
      study number. One of the research team will supply the operating theatre staff with one of&#xD;
      the envelopes containing the slip of paper upon which will be written the randomisation&#xD;
      allocation for the patient undergoing surgery at that time. The operating surgeon will not be&#xD;
      allowed to open the envelope. The patient will be assigned the study number and their&#xD;
      randomisation slip returned to the study coordinator to be kept with the Masterfile copy of&#xD;
      the consent form. A hand written note will be made by one of the research team in the&#xD;
      orthopaedic section of the patient's medical notes after their surgery, confirming that they&#xD;
      consented to the study and detailing which arm of the study they were allocated to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operating techniques will be standard ACL reconstruction techniques using hamstring autograft&#xD;
      as used by the 2 surgeons involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operating surgeon will record in the operation note evidence of meniscal damage,&#xD;
      cartilage and ACL status, including presence of any residual ACL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate Post-operative Care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be discharged home allowed to fully weight-bear as comfort allows with walking&#xD;
      aids for use for a 2 week period. They will be discharged wearing a locked knee brace. They&#xD;
      will be reviewed at 2 days after surgery for a wound check and brace removal. They will be&#xD;
      instructed in closed kinetic chain knee exercises, range of motion exercises, advised on&#xD;
      cryotherapy and referred to the physiotherapy department for a formal ACL rehabilitation&#xD;
      programme which will begin 2-3 weeks after surgery. This is all routine care in the&#xD;
      researcher's institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per routine care, the patients will be followed up in the orthopaedic clinic at 2 and 6&#xD;
      weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 6 month, 1 and 2 year timeframe they will repeat the KOOS, IKDC subjective knee score,&#xD;
      Tegner Activity score and the Lysholm Knee questionnaire. These can be completed and posted&#xD;
      from home by the patients or when they attend for KT1000 testing- see below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional assessment using the KT1000 device will also be carried out at the 3 and 6 month&#xD;
      and 1 year follow up time frames.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapy will continue as clinical need dictates- as per routine care. If possible, all&#xD;
      patients will undergo their rehabilitation at the RD+E Hospital to ensure standardisation of&#xD;
      care. However, there will be practical logistical reasons why all patients will not be able&#xD;
      to do this and they will have to have their physiotherapy in their local hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative Radiological Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will get a single Antero-Posterior (AP) and Lateral X-ray of the operated&#xD;
      knee on the day of surgery as per routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Storage The KOOS, IKDC subjective knee score, Tegner Activity Score and the Lysholm Knee&#xD;
      Questionnaire are all undertaken by patients. This is in paper format and transcribed onto an&#xD;
      Excel spread sheet on an RD+E Trust computer. The results of the KT1000 measurements will be&#xD;
      also put on the spread sheet. The data will remain the property of the RD+E Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the remaining data associated with the study will be kept electronically on the hard&#xD;
      drives of computers within the Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit (EKRU). These are encrypted&#xD;
      and password protected hospital computers. The data will only be accessible by members of the&#xD;
      research team and the study sponsor who will need access for research regulatory purposes.&#xD;
      The data will be analysed and reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study Masterfile will be kept in the EKRU offices-an area that is inaccessible to the&#xD;
      general public and for which staff require keypad door access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be undertaken by the clinician undertaking the specific procedure concerned, the study&#xD;
      coordinator or by research nurses attached to the Research and Development (R+D) department&#xD;
      in the RD+E Hospital. The data will be stored on RD+E Hospital secure computers. Data will be&#xD;
      entered into an Excel spread sheet for later transfer into a statistical package such as&#xD;
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 for analysis. All patient&#xD;
      identifiers will be removed. The study data will be kept until the study analysis has been&#xD;
      completed and then archived in accordance with the archiving Standard Operating Procedures&#xD;
      (SOPs) of the study sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be carried out by an appropriately qualified statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personnel:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chief Investigator-Andrew Toms (ADT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgeons-Vipul Mandalia (VIM) and Peter Schranz (PZS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study coordinator-Patrick Hourigan (PGH)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional outcome assessment team-Dean Chisling De Burgh (DCDB) -physiotherapy&#xD;
           department RD+E Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Database support provided by David Searle- surgical care practitioner in the EKRU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clerical staff attached to the EKRU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the research staff will be trained in guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) in&#xD;
      research. All National Health Service (NHS) staff involved are bound by patient&#xD;
      confidentiality requirements of the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants General Practitioner (GP) will be informed that their patient is&#xD;
      involved in the research- particularly as the patient may wish to discuss their involvement&#xD;
      in the research with their GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the data associated with the study will be kept electronically on the hard drives of&#xD;
      computers within the Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit (EKRU). It will be stored on encrypted&#xD;
      and password protected hospital computers. The data will only be accessible by members of the&#xD;
      research team and by the R+D department at the RD+E Hospital who will require access to the&#xD;
      data to ensure compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the data is to be sent to the statistician for analysis, it will be anonymised and only&#xD;
      a study number used for identification. The statistician uses password and encrypted&#xD;
      computers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study (see timescales below), all research data will be archived in line&#xD;
      with the sponsors SOPS. Radiographs and scans will remain on the secure hospital systems as&#xD;
      per routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timescales:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 110 ACL reconstructions carried out per annum by the surgeons within the&#xD;
      research team. Allowing 50% declining recruitment, not meeting entry criteria or missed for&#xD;
      logistical reasons this will leave 55 potential participants per annum. Thus recruitment&#xD;
      should be in approximately 2 years and 8 months. Follow up is for 2 years post entry into the&#xD;
      study as outlined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will take a further 1 year for data analysis, project write up and submission for&#xD;
      publication post study end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data will be archived as per the study sponsors archiving SOP's after completion of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be informed in writing of the results if they so desire. The R+D&#xD;
      department at the RD+E will be informed of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team plan to present the results both nationally and internationally at knee&#xD;
      surgery conferences and to publish the results in a peer reviewed journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The team will also present the results to the 2 patient networks in Exeter: The Patient&#xD;
      Research Panel and The Patient Knee Support Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of this study as yet is unknown. If the research identifies a clear advantage of&#xD;
      one study arm over the others, then it is likely that this technique will become the standard&#xD;
      ACL reconstruction procedure within the RD+E Hospital- with the aim of providing patients&#xD;
      with the best clinical and functional results after their ACL reconstruction surgery.&#xD;
      Similarly, if a clear difference is found in one study arm, one would hope that presentation&#xD;
      of the results to colleagues at other institutions will result in better long term results&#xD;
      for their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that no technique proves superior to the others, then this will provide surgeons&#xD;
      with the reassurance that no matter what their preferred technique, their patient is not&#xD;
      being disadvantaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If results between both arms of the study are the same, there is a potential cost saving for&#xD;
      the NHS if only one size of adjustable suspensory loop needs to be kept in stock a opposed to&#xD;
      multiple different sizes of the fixed loop device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conflicts of Interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit has received external funding to allow them to undertake&#xD;
      studies as this. This is subject to a Masters Service Agreement (MSA) and the monies are&#xD;
      already in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both devices being studied are made by the same company and thus using one or the other is of&#xD;
      no financial benefit to the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADT and VIM undertake consultancy work for Stryker UK and will complete the necessary&#xD;
      paperwork for this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Involvement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team have consulted with patients on the feasibility of participating in the&#xD;
      study at all and in particular about the demands of attending the appointments for functional&#xD;
      assessment. The commitment for the majority of the study is the same whether patients are&#xD;
      involved in the research or not but nevertheless the research team will emphasise the need&#xD;
      for attendance. However, rehabilitation for patients living in Exeter is undertaken at the&#xD;
      RD+E site. For some patients who live in the surrounding areas, rehabilitation could normally&#xD;
      be undertaken in their local community hospital using current protocols. Ideally the research&#xD;
      team would like all patients to attend for rehabilitation at the RD+E so as to standardise&#xD;
      care. However, this will not always be possible as patients may have logistical difficulty&#xD;
      travelling to Exeter when the study population is drawn from a wide geographical area. If&#xD;
      patients do not wish or cannot travel to Exeter for this however, they will have to come to&#xD;
      Exeter on 3 extra separate occasions for the KT100 functional test. Attendance at all time&#xD;
      frames is critical for completion of the functional outcome assessment. This is both the&#xD;
      study primary outcome measure but also the safety net of ensuring neither study arm is&#xD;
      failing catastrophically. It was stressed by the patient representatives that the patients&#xD;
      need to be fully informed of the commitment required should they agree to take part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team have consulted on the design and wording of the patient information leaflet&#xD;
      and the consent form. Various changes were recommended in particular to the patient&#xD;
      information leaflet- all were implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team do not believe involvement in this study changes the risks from surgery&#xD;
      that the patients already face as a part of routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring Adverse Events/Stopping the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A log of adverse events will be kept by the study coordinator. Adverse events occurring in&#xD;
      the immediate peri and post-operative events should be reported to the coordinator by the&#xD;
      consultant surgeon in charge of the case. Adverse events may be identified in clinic and&#xD;
      again, the surgeon concerned should report these back to the coordinator to be logged and&#xD;
      further action considered if necessary after discussion with the study sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that adverse events will occur that are dealt with either by the Accident and&#xD;
      Emergency (A+E) department, the patient's GP or other hospitals. These may not be readily&#xD;
      apparent to the research team. The research team will therefore specifically ask participants&#xD;
      to inform their surgeon if any complications or adverse events occur and similarly ask the&#xD;
      surgeons to specifically ask their patients for this information at each clinic attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A meeting of the research team will be held on a 3 monthly basis to discuss progress of the&#xD;
      study, any specific problems and to consider whether there are any justifications for&#xD;
      stopping the study. As both techniques being studied of performing ACL are already part of&#xD;
      routine practice, the research team do not anticipate identifying an unexpected complication&#xD;
      that would necessitation an early termination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval for this study will be sought from the National Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      via the Health Research Authority.&#xD;
