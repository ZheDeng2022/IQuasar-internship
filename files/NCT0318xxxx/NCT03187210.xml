      The trial assess the maximum tolerated dose of a single-dose of Brentuximab Vedotin added to&#xD;
      standard BeEAM chemotherapy (comprising Bendamustin, Etoposide, Cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      Melphalan) before autologous stem cell transplantation in CD30+ malignant lymphomas.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD30+ lymphomas typically comprise Hodgkin lymphomas and a variety of T-cell non-Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma (T-NHL) entities including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas (AITL), anaplastic&#xD;
      ALK+ large-cell T-cell lymphomas (ALCL), Sézary-syndrome, peripheral T-NHL NOS and other rare&#xD;
      malignant T-cell lymphoma types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prognosis of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is excellent for the majority of these&#xD;
      usually young patients; however, HL patients relapsing after autologous stem-cell&#xD;
      transplantation (ASCT) have a rather poor outcome, with approximately only up to 20% of the&#xD;
      patients surviving longer than 5 years. For those in advanced stage Hodgkin's lymphoma&#xD;
      multiple first-line and second-line treatments, including the combination of doxorubicin,&#xD;
      bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) - internationally, the most widely used&#xD;
      regimen in Hodgkin's lymphoma - is expected to cure about 70-80% of patients. However, in&#xD;
      addition to treatment failures noted for ABVD, the regimen is often associated with&#xD;
      unpredictable bleomycin-induced lung related toxic effects that can be life-threatening.&#xD;
      Although High Dose Chemotherapy (HDCT) with ASCT is a curative strategy for some patients&#xD;
      with relapsing Hodgkin lymphomas, relapse or progression after ASCT is a major limitation of&#xD;
      this procedure. For these reason, the outcome of Hodgkin lymphoma patients relapsing after&#xD;
      ASCT is poor, and novel concepts for such patients is an unmet clinical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD30+ T-NHL generally have a limited prognosis, with a minority of patients being cured after&#xD;
      specific lymphoma treatment. The incorporation of consolidating high-dose chemotherapy with&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplantation for young fit patients within the first-line treatment&#xD;
      algorithms has improved the prognosis of such patients to some extent. However, the majority&#xD;
      of such patients still ultimately die of their disease. Again, improvement of lymphoma&#xD;
      treatment is an urgent requirement for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brentuximab Vedotin (BV; Adcetris®) is an antibody-drug conjugate and is licensed in&#xD;
      Switzerland and the European Medicine Agency region for the single-agent treatment of&#xD;
      relapsed and refractory Hodgkin lymphoma or for relapsed and refractory anaplastic T-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BeEAM high-dose chemotherapy (comprising Bendamustin, Etoposide, Cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      Melphalan) is the standard conditioning regimen before ASCT for lymphoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial BV will be used together with BeEAM high-dose chemotherapy according to its&#xD;
      conventional schedule in CD30+ lymphomas as conditioning regimen before ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: The primary objective of the trial is to assess the maximum tolerated dose of a&#xD;
      single-dose of Brentuximab Vedotin added to standard BeEAM chemotherapy before autologous&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation in CD30+ malignant lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: The main objective of the trial is to assess differences in disease-free survival&#xD;
      between CD30+ lymphoma patients treated with the standard BeEAM high-dose chemotherapy versus&#xD;
      Brentuximab Vedotin together with BeEAM (B-BeEAM) high-dose chemotherapy. We aim to&#xD;
      demonstrate an improvement by 20% of the rate of disease-free survival 1 year after ASCT&#xD;
      (DFS1) from 70% in patients treated with BeEAM alone to 90% in patients treated with the&#xD;
      combination of B-BeEAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I part was planned to last from 3 to 18 months (permitting the enrolment of minimum of&#xD;
      6 patients). The Phase I has been stopped after the RP2D (1.8mg/kg/day) was established with&#xD;
      enrolment of 12 patient in 24 months. The Phase II will stop after the inclusion of 42&#xD;
      evaluable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up for up to 12 months after end of treatment..&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the current version of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki, the ICH-GCP or ISO EN 14155 (as far as applicable) as well as all&#xD;
      national legal and regulatory requirements.&#xD;
