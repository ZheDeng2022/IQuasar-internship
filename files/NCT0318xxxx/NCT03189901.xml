  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are always poor outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction(AMI) combined&#xD;
      with elevated BNP/NT-proBNP level. An elevated BNP/NT-proBNP level highly indicates acute&#xD;
      heart failure(AHF).Levosimendan is recommended in many clinical trials of heart failure and&#xD;
      Chinese heart failure guidelines. As a result, the investigators form a hypothesis that when&#xD;
      patients with AMI combined with elevated BNP/NT-proBNP level are in conditions before AHF, to&#xD;
      use levosimendan may reduces the risk of heart failure and improve the outcome.&#xD;
