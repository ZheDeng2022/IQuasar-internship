    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease characterized by destruction of pancreatic&#xD;
      beta-cells, resulting in absolute deficiency of insulin. Presently there is no known cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposed interventional trial is based on 'immunological reset' approach: T-depletion&#xD;
      therapy and anti-inflammatory treatment will restore self-tolerance in T1DM; Autologous,&#xD;
      peripheral-blood mobilized hematopoietic CD34+-enriched stem cells and a long-acting GLP-1&#xD;
      analogue will promote pancreatic islet regeneration and repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The short-term goals of this protocol is to demonstrate that subjects with new-onset T1DM&#xD;
      undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and immunologic reset will have&#xD;
      greater preservation of endogenous insulin secretion compared to controls, and foremost that&#xD;
      this nonmyeloablative treatment is safe, without the need for chronic immune suppression.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous efforts to prevent or reverse new-onset T1DM have been fraught with disappointment,&#xD;
      despite considerable promise. The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse is a poor surrogate of human&#xD;
      T1DM. Over 463 different treatments have been shown to prevent or reverse autoimmune diabetes&#xD;
      in these mice. Efforts focused on clinical translation of the most promising strategies have&#xD;
      led to negative findings despite enormous investment and large-scale clinical trials.&#xD;
      Encouraging preliminary clinical pilot data suggested that a non-Fc binding CD3 antibody,&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) + daclizumab, rituximab B-lymphocyte depletion, a soluble&#xD;
      NBI-6024 altered insulin peptide ligand, vitamin D3, nicotinamide, parenteral insulin, oral&#xD;
      insulin, nasal insulin, and elimination of cow's milk from infant feeding could each&#xD;
      potentially mitigate diabetes onset, or at least prolong endogenous C-peptide and sustain&#xD;
      honeymoon. To date, none of these approaches have demonstrated robust benefit when subjected&#xD;
      to adequately powered randomized clinical trials. Basing further clinical trials solely on&#xD;
      responses in NOD mice would seem ill-advised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most promising approaches to date has been use of intravenous non-myeloablative&#xD;
      autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after mobilization with granulocyte&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), thymoglobulin and cyclophosphamide, as first described by&#xD;
      Voltarelli et al in 2007 in Brazil. Voltarelli et al demonstrated that a potentially toxic,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide-based depletional therapy and autologous bone marrow transplant rescue&#xD;
      restores self-tolerance, prolongs honeymoon, and remarkably, secures insulin independence.&#xD;
      This 'immunological reset' approach was designed to eliminate autoreactive lymphocyte clones,&#xD;
      with subsequent immune reconstitution. Remarkably, 20/23 children and adolescents with&#xD;
      new-onset T1DM were rendered insulin independent for periods of 6-35 months. In longer&#xD;
      follow-up, 12/23 maintained this state for a mean of 31 months. There were no deaths, but&#xD;
      nosocomial pneumonia occurred in 2, and oligospermia in 9. The underpinning mechanism appears&#xD;
      to be restoration of apoptosis-related gene deregulation that contributed to breakdown of&#xD;
      immune tolerance in T1DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposed new-onset intervention trial is based on Voltarelli's concept, but we have&#xD;
      eliminated cyclophosphamide, replaced GCSF with plerixafor, substituted thymoglobulin for a&#xD;
      single dose of alemtuzumab, and added anti-inflammatory treatments derived from the Clinical&#xD;
      Islet Program in Edmonton with excellent safety profiles to date. Cellular and immunologic&#xD;
      data from our Clinical Islet Transplant program indicates that T-depletion with alemtuzumab,&#xD;
      and anti-inflammatory treatment with etanercept and anakinra, markedly suppress autoimmunity:&#xD;
      a much safer and better tolerated combination than cyclophosphamide. The addition of a&#xD;
      long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue (liraglutide) is based on its known&#xD;
      positive trophic and metabolic protective effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient selection: New onset of T1DM, diagnosed &lt; 180 days, positive anti-GAD&#xD;
