  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common cause of congenital infection, with approximately&#xD;
      0.5% of pregnant women being infected during pregnancy. CMV transmission to the fetus occurs&#xD;
      in about one third of women who are infected in first trimester. Babies infected before birth&#xD;
      are at risk for serious neurological complications such as intellectual disability, seizures,&#xD;
      deafness, and even death. Most couples facing a diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus&#xD;
      infection in their unborn baby focus heavily on the predicted neurological outcome for their&#xD;
      child. To date, methods to assess brain development in fetuses have been mainly limited to&#xD;
      detecting structural brain abnormalities by ultrasound. However, these ultrasound signs may&#xD;
      not become apparent until very late in pregnancy, and some neurological disability is not&#xD;
      accompanied by any structural brain changes. More research on methods of predicting&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome independent of structural brain malformations before third&#xD;
      trimester is urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate a new method of studying the health of unborn&#xD;
      babies using amniotic fluid. Amniocentesis is often performed after maternal CMV infection to&#xD;
      diagnose fetal infection. Prior research by Dr Hui has demonstrated that cell free RNA in&#xD;
      amniotic fluid can provide meaningful information from multiple organs including the fetal&#xD;
      brain. The investigators propose to collect and analyse a small sample of amniotic fluid to&#xD;
      detect which genes are turned &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; (gene expression) in a fetus that has a&#xD;
      congenital CMV infection, compared to those without any infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genes that are differentially expressed in CMV infected fetuses will then be analysed to&#xD;
      provide information on the broad physiological processes that are altered due to the&#xD;
      infection (&quot;functional analysis&quot;) and identify neurodevelopmental gene transcripts of&#xD;
      interest for future studies (&quot;biomarker discovery&quot;).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale for the study Current tools for prediction of perinatal outcome after fetal&#xD;
      infection with CMV are very limited. Amniocentesis is usually offered from 20 weeks gestation&#xD;
      to diagnose fetal infection. This sampling provides an opportunity to investigate novel&#xD;
      approaches to predicting perinatal outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to develop an mRNA based approach to studying the impact of CMV on the&#xD;
      developing fetus. Dr Hui's PhD thesis was based on the study of amniotic fluid mRNA as a gene&#xD;
      expression &quot;summary fluid&quot; of the fetus that provides meaningful information about&#xD;
      development. This work suggested that information about fetal neurodevelopment is obtainable&#xD;
      from amniotic fluid via cell-free fetal brain specific transcripts (mRNAs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a woman at risk of congenital CMV chooses to have an amniocentesis for diagnosis of fetal&#xD;
      infection, this sampling provides an opportunity to collect an aliquot of AF for RNA&#xD;
      analysis. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) is a relatively new technology that enables detailed&#xD;
      analysis of the genes that are actively expressed ('switched on') during a particular disease&#xD;
      state. The investigators will apply RNAsequencing methods to amniotic fluid to search for&#xD;
      potential gene expression differences that may assist in understanding the disease through&#xD;
      functional analysis and identifying candidate biomarkers for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis That fetuses infected with CMV will have an altered gene expression profile&#xD;
      compared with noninfected fetuses, as ascertained in amniotic fluid cell-free RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims To perform comparative whole transcriptome analysis of AF RNA from CMV-infected and&#xD;
      uninfected fetuses using RNA sequencing technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This will be a multicentre study involving fetal medicine units in Melbourne (Mercy&#xD;
      Hospital for Women), Sydney (Royal Hospital for Women, Randwick) and Leuven (UZ Leuven,&#xD;
      Leuven). The investigators aim to recruit 20 women (10 cases, 10 controls) over 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be collected during clinically-indicated amniocentesis performed for the&#xD;
      purposes of diagnosing the presence or absence of congenital infection. This is usually&#xD;
      performed at 20-21 weeks gestation for women with seroconversion in early pregnancy, or at&#xD;
      the time of fetal assessment in cases of referrals with structural abnormalities. An amniotic&#xD;
      fluid (AF) volume of 5-10ml would be required for the research study. This sample volume does&#xD;
      not pose a significant burden on the clinician performing the procedure (only 10-20 seconds&#xD;
      additional collection time) and does not increase the risk of the procedure for the pregnancy&#xD;
      or woman as there is NO additional needle insertion (no increase in miscarriage or impact on&#xD;
      fetal or maternal well-being).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research sample will be stored in a separate vial to the clinical sample at the&#xD;
      respective recruitment sites. It is stored at 4 degrees Celsius and then centrifuged at 300 x&#xD;
      g for 10 minutes within 6 hours of collection. The AF supernatant will be taken off and&#xD;
      stored in a separate tube. Both the cellular portion and the supernatant will be frozen and&#xD;
      stored at - 80°C. The Sydney recruitment site will transport the specimens to the University&#xD;
      of Melbourne laboratory at the Mercy Hospital for Women on dry ice, where they will be&#xD;
      processed. All samples will be given a study sample ID number before transport to the&#xD;
      University of Melbourne research lab at the Mercy Hospital for Women to protect the&#xD;
      participants privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total RNA from AF samples from 10 CMV infected and 10 uninfected fetuses, matched for&#xD;
      gestational age and fetal sex, will be analysed. Total RNA will be extracted from the AF&#xD;
      supernatant samples will be performed using the Qiagen Circulating Nucleic Acid extraction&#xD;
      kit. Whole transcriptome amplification and RNA-sequencing of the cell free RNA will be&#xD;
      performed and the expression profiles of the case and control groups compared in a paired&#xD;
      analysis as performed in previous studies of AF RNA. Pathway analysis of the&#xD;
      differentially-regulated genes will be used for the biological interpretation. The&#xD;
      investigators will employ both widely used commercial software (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis™)&#xD;
      and a fetus-specific functional analysis tool developed by collaborators at Tufts University&#xD;
      (DFLAT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most down- and up-regulated brain transcripts will be identified as candidate biomarkers&#xD;
      of abnormal outcome for future validation studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy outcomes to six weeks postpartum for mother and baby will be collected from the&#xD;
      hospital medical record, including fetal abnormalities detected on ultrasound or MRI,&#xD;
      gestation and mode of birth, birth weight, use of prenatal therapies (CMV immunoglobulin or&#xD;
      other), newborn investigations such as urine/saliva/ cord blood test results, cranial&#xD;
      ultrasound, physical examination and results of newborn hearing screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes: Compared to uninfected fetuses, CMV-infected fetuses will show altered&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental pathways and gene expression on functional analysis. Fetal-brain specific&#xD;
      transcripts that are differentially expressed in CMV-infected fetuses will be identified as&#xD;
      candidate biomarkers of neurodevelopmental outcome for future validation studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data storage and security The database will be set up within RedCap (Research Electronic Data&#xD;
      Capture), a free, secure, web-based application designed to support patient data capture for&#xD;
      research studies. The University of Melbourne REDCap service provides secure storage and&#xD;
      backup policies that comply with University standards and the the United States Health&#xD;
      Information and Privacy Act. Only the study investigators will have access to this database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hard copies of consent forms and other study information will be kept in locked filing&#xD;
      cabinets. Only the study investigators and the HREC will have access to the files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 Inclusion criteria Women undergoing clinically-indicated amniocentesis for suspected&#xD;
      congenital CMV infection through the Department of Perinatal Medicine at the Mercy Hospital&#xD;
      for Women or the Royal Hospital for Women, Randwick will be identified from the perinatal&#xD;
      clinic referrals by Dr Hui or Dr Shand respectively. These women will include (i) women with&#xD;
      evidence of maternal primary CMV infection during pregnancy (ii) Fetuses with structural&#xD;
      abnormalities suggestive of congenital CMV infection (as listed in Hui L and Wood G.&#xD;
      Perinatal outcome after maternal primary cytomegalovirus infection in first trimester: a&#xD;
      practical update and counseling aid. 2015 Prenatal Diagnosis; 35:1-7. ) Any English-speaking&#xD;
      woman aged 18 or over who is capable of giving informed consent will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with confirmed fetal CMV infection will form the case group. Fetuses without&#xD;
      evidence of congenital infection will form the control group. Structurally abnormal fetuses&#xD;
      that are CMV negative will be excluded from the control group analysis. The rate of infected&#xD;
      vs noninfected fetuses following maternal infection is approximately 40%, so we anticipate a&#xD;
      reasonable ratio of cases and controls for our target sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial contact will be made by the clinical team, but follow up by a research midwife to&#xD;
      discuss the research study in detail will be made, either by telephone, or face-to-face&#xD;
      following the clinical consultation wherever possible. This is to minimize potential&#xD;
      conflicts from having the clinicians obtain patient consent for the study. Patients will be&#xD;
      reassured that they will be under no obligation to participate and that their decision will&#xD;
      not affect their clinical care or relationship with their treating medical practitioner&#xD;
      Written, informed consent will be obtained from women prior to their procedure and be stored&#xD;
      in a locked filing cabinet in the respective Departments of Perinatal Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Women who do not give consent, who are not capable of consent for medical&#xD;
      procedures, non-English speaking, or who are under 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses Sample size In general, the more biological replicates (larger sample&#xD;
      size), the stronger the inferences that can be made from the gene expression data. Biological&#xD;
      variation between samples and the expected spread of differential gene expression are&#xD;
      important factors influencing the ideal sample size. For this study, the investigators do not&#xD;
      know in advance how the gene expression levels would be distributed, thus restricting our&#xD;
      ability to use sample size algorithms for RNA-seq experiments. In addition to the&#xD;
      restrictions on sample availability discussed above, the high costs associated with&#xD;
      laboratory processing limited the feasibility of using large numbers of AF samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main factors that influence formal sample size calculations for RNA-sequencing&#xD;
      experiments are: depth of sequencing, coefficient of variation, magnitude of differential&#xD;
      expression detected, false positive rate and power. Assuming average read depth of 20, equal&#xD;
      within group coefficient of variation of 0.4, an effect size of 2 fold, 0.05 false positive&#xD;
      rate and 80% power, the number of subjects per group required is 7.1 The investigators&#xD;
      therefore aim for a minimum target of ten samples per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of differential gene expression and functional analysis A consultant bioinformatics&#xD;
      specialist within the Translational Obstetric Group will be available for statistical and&#xD;
      analysis support for the gene expression data. Genes that are significantly dysregulated in&#xD;
      the CMV infected cases compared with non-infected controls will be identified. Functional&#xD;
      analyses of the differentially expressed genes will be performed using Ingenuity Pathways&#xD;
      Analysis (IPA) Version 9.0 software (Ingenuity; Redwood City, CA). Ingenuity is a&#xD;
      manually-curated database that identifies over-represented biological processes in a given&#xD;
      data set and calculates a significance score for each result using the right tailed Fisher's&#xD;
      test. The investigators will also use a publicly available fetus-specific functional&#xD;
      annotation &quot;Developmental FunctionaL Annotation at Tufts&quot; (DFLAT) that has previously been&#xD;
      shown to enhance biological interpretation of perinatal datasets&#xD;
      (http://dflat.cs.tufts.edu).2&#xD;
