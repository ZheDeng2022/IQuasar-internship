    <textblock>
      The effect of chlorpromazine (Largactil) on esophageal sensitivity will be investigated in&#xD;
      this study. Overnight fasted subjects will be asked to fill out 2 questionnaires to assess&#xD;
      the emotional status before their onset of the stimulation tests. The multimodal stimulation&#xD;
      probe will be positioned through the mouth in the distal esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the ingestion of the stimulation probe, 10mg of chlorpromazine or placebo (saline) will&#xD;
      be slowly administered via intravenous injection. Hereafter the multimodal stimulation tests&#xD;
      will be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal sensitivity will be assessed by performing thermal, mechanical, electrical and&#xD;
      chemical stimulation of the esophagus. The chlorpromazine condition will be compared with a&#xD;
      placebo condition, this will be organised on 2 separate study visits in a randomised order.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), defined as the presence of symptoms or&#xD;
      lesions that can be attributed to the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus, is an&#xD;
      increasingly prevalent condition in Western societies. The most typical symptoms are&#xD;
      heartburn and regurgitation, however GERD can also manifest itself through a variety of&#xD;
      esophageal and extra-esophageal symptoms (e.g. chronic cough).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, pain is a multimodal experience composted of sensory, physiological and&#xD;
      psychological aspects. In order to mimic the clinical situation, experimental models should&#xD;
      be based on multimodal testing regimens in which different receptors and central nervous&#xD;
      system mechanisms are activated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in esophageal sensory stimulation have established that both typical and atypical&#xD;
      symptoms may not only arise from acid reflux, but also from reflux events with less acidic pH&#xD;
      (pH 4-7). Literature review shows that in GERD patients with persisting symptoms in spite of&#xD;
      PPI therapy, ongoing weakly acidic reflux can be considered as an important underlying&#xD;
      factor. The basis for symptom generation during weakly-acidic reflux events remains to be&#xD;
      determined, but acid sensitivity in the pH range 4-7, mechanical distention (enhanced by air&#xD;
      in the refluxate), sensitivity to other chemical factors (e.g. bile salts) and esophageal&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to physiological levels of reflux have all been proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kahrilas et al. described psychogenic factors as an alternative explanation for&#xD;
      PPI-refractory symptoms: hyperalgesia, allodynia, hypervigilance, and increased anxiety.&#xD;
      Anxiety and depression were found to increase GERD-related symptoms in a population-based&#xD;
      study. Patients with a poor reflux-symptom correlation reportedly exhibit a high level of&#xD;
      anxiety compared with patients exhibiting good reflux-symptom correlation. In addition, it&#xD;
      has been shown that increased levels of anxiety were associated with more severe retrosternal&#xD;
      pain and retrosternal burning in GERD patients along with increased levels of anxiety and&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of the interaction between psychological state and gastrointestinal function is&#xD;
      complex. It is known that anxiety is one of the factors affecting visceral sensitivity in&#xD;
      humans. The investigators speculate that visceral hypersensitivity plays an important role in&#xD;
      symptom perception in refractory GERD. This is suggested by the reflux parameters that are&#xD;
      usual within the physiological range during PPI therapy. The investigators previously&#xD;
      demonstrated that refractory GERD patients have increased visceral sensitivity for thermal,&#xD;
      chemical and mechanical esophageal stimulation compared to healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL OBJECTIVES Dopamine is an important modulator of gastrointestinal function and is known&#xD;
      to play a role in anxiety. Certain dopamine antagonists have gained interest in the clinical&#xD;
      setting because of their effect on motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dopamine inhibits lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and gastroduodenal motility.&#xD;
      Expression of dopamine receptors in human LES has been shown by Liu et al. Certain dopamine&#xD;
      antagonists e.g. metoclopramide and domperidone, elicit an increase in LES pressure and&#xD;
      stimulate gastroduodenal motility and gastric emptying. It has been consequently proven to be&#xD;
      of value in certain cases of gastroparesis, and in relieving nausea and vomiting. Dopamine&#xD;
      antagonists also appear to be useful in the management of reflux oesophagitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chlorpromazine, a dopamine receptor antagonist, has been used in the clinical practice as one&#xD;
      of the first anti-psychotic drugs since 1952 and is used to treat various disorders such as&#xD;
      schizophrenia and autism in adults and children, short term treatment of anxiety, severe&#xD;
      hiccups, nausea, vomiting, severe pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of chlorpromazine (Largactil®),&#xD;
      on esophageal sensitivity in a group of healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL DESIGN This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of chlorpromazine (Largactil®) on esophageal sensitivity. Due to the potent sedative&#xD;
      effect of chlorpromazine, the recommended administration dose is an intravenous bolus&#xD;
      injection of 10 mg for healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chlorpromazine is rapidly absorbed and widely distributed in the body. Plasma half-life is&#xD;
      approximately 30 hours and the elimination of metabolites may be prolonged. It is metabolized&#xD;
      in the liver and excreted in the urine and bile. Whilst plasma concentration of&#xD;
      chlorpromazine itself rapidly declines, excretion of chlorpromazine metabolites is very slow.&#xD;
      Therefore, 10 mg chlorpromazine (Largactil®, Sanofi Aventis France) for i.v. infusion will be&#xD;
      taken from Largactil® 25 mg/5ml ampoules for i.v. infusion (Largactil®, Sanofi Aventis&#xD;
      France). Each ampoule of 25 mg/5ml will be used for only one volunteer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two sessions will be scheduled for every subject: one placebo and one chlorpromazine session,&#xD;
      with at least one week interval. During placebo sessions, 3ml NaCl 0.9% will be administered&#xD;
      i.v. with an identical syringe as the one used for i.v. chlorpromazine administration.&#xD;
      Sessions will run in a double-blind randomized-controlled way. The order of placebo and&#xD;
      chlorpromazine administration will be randomized by an online randomization tool&#xD;
      (http://www.randomization.com/). The randomization scheme will be carried out by an&#xD;
      experienced independent researcher or study nurse, this person will prepare and inject&#xD;
      chlorpromazine or placebo. In this way, the investigator performing the actual study and data&#xD;
      analysis will be blinded until termination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL PROCEDURES After an overnight fast subjects are expected at the endoscopy unit of the&#xD;
      UZ Gasthuisberg, where the study will be performed. At the beginning of each session the&#xD;
      volunteer will be asked to fill out 2 questionnaires (PANAS and STAI-state) to assess the&#xD;
      emotional status before the onset of the stimulation tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multimodal stimulation probe will be positioned through the mouth in the distal&#xD;
      esophagus. After the probe is positioned in the esophagus (top of the balloon 10 cm above the&#xD;
      LES), it will be fixed to the chin and the volunteer will remain in a bed, in semi-recumbent&#xD;
      position for the entire study period. Fifteen minutes after the ingestion of the multimodal&#xD;
      esophageal stimulation probe, 10mg of chlorpromazine (Largactil®) or placebo (saline) will be&#xD;
      slowly administered via intravenous injection. After de administration of chlorpromazine or&#xD;
      placebo (saline) the multimodal stimulation tests will be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies will be performed using a multimodal esophageal stimulation probe which allows&#xD;
      thermal, mechanical, electrical and chemical stimulations of the esophagus. This technique is&#xD;
      performed routinely since 2010p.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each stimulation, subjects will be instructed to record perception of stimuli using&#xD;
      pain scoring scale. This allows the subject to scale perception and pain on a scale from 0 to&#xD;
      10. First perception, pain perception threshold (PPT) and pain tolerance threshold (PTT) will&#xD;
      be recorded. All types of esophageal stimulations will be immediately terminated when the&#xD;
      pain tolerance threshold is reached. At the time when the pain tolerance threshold is reached&#xD;
      (PTT), the subjects will be asked to draw the referred pain area, to identify where the pain&#xD;
      is located.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermal stimulation will be performed by re-circulating a saline solution (NaCl 0.09%),&#xD;
      heated by a water bath, through the polyurethane balloon mounted on the probe. Stimulation&#xD;
      temperature will be steadily increased by increasing the flow rate from the water bath to the&#xD;
      balloon. Flow rate will be controlled by a computer operated pump. The volume in the balloon&#xD;
      will be kept constant at 5mL to avoid mechanical stimulation of the esophagus. A temperature&#xD;
      sensor present in the balloon will continuously monitor the stimulation temperature, which&#xD;
      will be displayed on a computer display throughout the study. Maximum stimulation temperature&#xD;
      is set at 62°C. Thermal stimulation will be terminated when the subject reaches PTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical stimulation will be performed by distention of the balloon mounted on the probe.&#xD;
      The flow of saline (NaCl 0.09%) into the balloon, inducing the distention, is regulated by a&#xD;
      computer controlled pump (ramp distention). The volume in the balloon is displayed on the&#xD;
      computer screen throughout the stimulation. Mechanical stimulations will be performed with&#xD;
      water of 37°C, to avoid thermal stimulation of the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical stimulation will be preceded by a preconditioning period during which the balloon&#xD;
      will be distended until the pain perception threshold (PPT) is reached. This preconditioning&#xD;
      period is used to precondition the esophageal tissue and to allow the subject to get used to&#xD;
      the feeling of mechanical distention. The stimulation will be terminated when subject reached&#xD;
      PTT or when the maximal inflation volume of 50mL is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical stimulation will be performed by 2 stimulation electrodes mounted on proximal to&#xD;
      the balloon. Electrical block pulses will be given using a standard electrical stimulator.&#xD;
      Single burst pulses will be given with duration of 1ms at 200Hz. The amplitude of the pulses&#xD;
      will steadily increase, with steps of 0.5mA and an interval of 15 seconds. For safety, the&#xD;
      maximum intensity is limited to 40 mA. ECG monitoring will be performed as a safety measure&#xD;
      during the electrical stimulations of the esophagus. Electrical stimulation will be&#xD;
      terminated when the subject reached PPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemical stimulation will be performed in distal esophagus by infusing an acidic solution&#xD;
      (HCl 0.1N) in the esophagus. This is an adaptation of the Bernstein test, used in routine&#xD;
      clinical practice since the early sixties. Infusion rate is controlled by a peristaltic&#xD;
      infusion pump with a flow rate of 2ml/min. The stimulation will last for a maximum of 30&#xD;
      minutes or will be terminated when subjects reach pain tolerance threshold (PTT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During both session, blood pressure will be monitored and an assessment of general mood will&#xD;
      be performed by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PAS and NAS, also PANAS) and the&#xD;
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI state) questionnaires before and after the stimulation&#xD;
      tests. The PANAS consists of a number of words that describe different feelings and emotions&#xD;
      at the present moment. The STAI state is validated, and widely used questionnaire measuring&#xD;
      transitory anxiety states. The scale consists of 20 items, which are answered on a 4-point&#xD;
      scale. Scores are expressed as total sum scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject that is willing to participate in this study will be submitted to an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) since alteration of the heart rhythm (prolongation of QT interval),&#xD;
      is a possible side effect. Medical history will be taken and the use of medication will be&#xD;
      inquired. During both study visits blood pressure will be measured at baseline and after&#xD;
      administration of chlorpromazine or saline.&#xD;
