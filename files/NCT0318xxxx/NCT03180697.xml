  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Targeted therapy with bevacizumab is the main method to prolong the progression-free survival&#xD;
      of patients with recurrent malignant gliomas in recent years. Using noninvasive imaging&#xD;
      methods to predict which RMG may respond to bevacizumab regimen therapy is a clinical problem&#xD;
      ; on the other hand, repeated gadolinium enhancement may increase the risk of gadolinium ion&#xD;
      deposition of brain tissue. Furthermore,there may be a false response phenomenon and cause&#xD;
      assessment bias.in the evaluation of treatment efficacy,owing to bevacizumab is only&#xD;
      anti-tumor angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amide Proton Transfer (APT) is a new molecular imaging technique. Our previous studies have&#xD;
      shown that imaging features and signal changes of APT can fully reflect the therapeutic&#xD;
      effect of malignant glioma,without the injection of contrast agent and avoid the side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RMG patients will be recruited in this study . This project will be designed multi-center,&#xD;
      prospective, observational clinical research. The changes of APT signal intensity before and&#xD;
      after treatment will be compared with those of different types of RMG line. The relationship&#xD;
      between APT imaging characteristics and clinical end point events will be investigated and&#xD;
      compared with conventional MR imaging technique. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of&#xD;
      the progression-free survival and median overall survival will be measured after treatment&#xD;
      with bevacizumab.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recurrent Malignant Gliomas (RMG) have a very short survival time, and re-operation risk is&#xD;
      large and failed to significantly improve the prognosis of patients. At present, targeted&#xD;
      therapy with bevacizumab is effective in prolonging the progression of patients However, a&#xD;
      considerable proportion of recurrent malignant gliomas are insensitive to bevacizumab, and&#xD;
      therefore, using noninvasive imaging methods to predict which RMG is sensitive to bevacizumab&#xD;
      therapy prior to targeted therapy is very important On the other hand, the current evaluation&#xD;
      of bevacizumab is mainly based on the degree of gadolinium enhancement and tumor volume&#xD;
      changes, repeated gadolinium injection may increase the risk of gadolinium ion deposition of&#xD;
      brain tissue, and because of Bevacizumab only acting as an anti-tumor angiogenesis, and a&#xD;
      false response may occur in assessing efficacy, which is a bias in the overall assessment of&#xD;
      bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amide Proton Transfer (APT) is a new molecular imaging technique for the detection indirect&#xD;
      of free protein and peptide concentrations based on chemical saturation exchange. Our&#xD;
      previous studies have shown that APT signal is independent of gadolinium-enhanced imaging&#xD;
      markers , The signal intensity is closely related to the density of tumor cells, cell&#xD;
      proliferation and angiogenesis. Therefore, the imaging features and signal changes of APT can&#xD;
      fully reflect the therapeutic effect of malignant glioma, and avoid the side effects caused&#xD;
      by contrast injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be designed as multi-center, prospective, observational clinical research.&#xD;
      100 cases of RMG patients in Zhujiang Hospital and Nanfang Hospital will be recruited. The&#xD;
      patients will be examined with conventional MRI and APT-MRI imaging of 3.0T high field MRI.&#xD;
      The treatment of different types of RMG line will be scanned with APT protocol. The changes&#xD;
      of signal intensity will be studied. The relationship between APT imaging characteristics and&#xD;
      clinical end point events will be observed and compared with conventional MR imaging&#xD;
      technique. Two techniques will be used to predict the the 6-month progression-free survival&#xD;
      after bevacizumab treatment. The aim of this study is to determine whether APT can predict&#xD;
      the efficacy of bevacizumab in the treatment of RMG, and which RMG is effective and sensitive&#xD;
      to bevacizumab therapy .Also,we will evaluate the feasibility of APT-MR imaging as a&#xD;
      surrogate biomarker for predicting the efficacy of targeted therapy and to establish the&#xD;
      basic criteria for the selection of individualized targeted therapy regimens for RMG.&#xD;
