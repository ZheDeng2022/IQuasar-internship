    <textblock>
      In order to create insights in the effects of Motor cortex stimulation (MCS) on intractable&#xD;
      pain, an open observational study was started in 2003. The aim of this research is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine the clinical effectivity of MCS on pain intensity after 1 month, 1 year and&#xD;
           3 years of stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the clinical effectivity of MCS on QoL and daity medication intake after 3&#xD;
           years of MCS&#xD;

      2.1 Study protocol In 2003, an observational study protocol was set up in the university&#xD;
      medical centers of Nijmegen and Groningen, the Netherlands, in order to study the effects of&#xD;
      MCS in patients that suffered from chronic neuropathic pain. Patients were included between&#xD;
      2005 and 2013 when they suffered from chronic intractable pain and reported high levels of&#xD;
      pain (VAS &gt; 5, measured three times daily during four days) and when the chronic neuropathic&#xD;
      pain had showed to be intractable. Furthermore, on radiographic imaging techniques performed&#xD;
      less than three years before inclusion for the implantation of MCS should show a possible&#xD;
      conflict that might contribute to the pain. A multidisciplinary approach by the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist-pain specialists, neurosurgeons, and clinical psychologists was chosen for&#xD;
      the selection of patients. Patients with severe, current psychological problems (e.g.,&#xD;
      depression, high anxiety) or substance-abuse were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were the&#xD;
      use of therapeutic anticoagulants, cognitive and/or psychiatric disorders in the medical&#xD;
      history, nociceptive pain, an expected life expectancy less than 3 years due to other&#xD;
      diseases (e.g., cancer), contra- indications for general anesthesia (e.g., severe&#xD;
      cardio-pulmonal diseases), convulsive disorders and the presence of other neuromodulation&#xD;
      systems. All patients underwent preoperative somatosensory-evoked potential (SSEP)&#xD;
      measurement to determine the integrity of the somatosensory system in order to facilitate&#xD;
      intra-operative neurophysiological monitoring. A MRI-scan was used to determine any&#xD;
      anatomical contra-indications (brain atrophy, pathological structures) for the operative&#xD;
      procedure. All patients presented in this study had a follow up of three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Surgical technique The pre-operative fMRI was fused with the neuronavigation MRI. For&#xD;
      this purpose, cortex surface rendering technique was performed using the Stealthviz software&#xD;
      (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) to visualize the cortical areas and determine the&#xD;
      central sulcus and the motor cortex, which then was marked on the skin by using&#xD;
      neuronavigation. All patients were operated under general anesthesia without muscle&#xD;
      relaxation. A small craniotomy (approximately 4 × 4 cm) was carried out over the central&#xD;
      sulcus. An electrode was placed perpendicular to the central sulcus in the epidural space&#xD;
      (Specify, model 3998, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). A phase-reversal&#xD;
      somatosensory-evoked potential was used to confirm the position of the central sulcus,&#xD;
      thereafter cortical stimulation was performed to map functional motor areas. Following&#xD;
      identification of the optimal target, the electrode was sutured to the dura mater. After&#xD;
      placement of the electrode, the electrode was tunneled subcutaneously and connected with an&#xD;
      internalized pulse generator (IPG) (Medtronic Versitrel and later Prime Advanced) that was&#xD;
      implanted in the subclavian space or in a subcutaneous abdominal pocket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Data-analysis An independent researcher, who was blinded to the stimulation conditions,&#xD;
      investigated the patient records in this observational study. Only patients who were treated&#xD;
      in accordance to the aforementioned treatment protocol and with a minimal follow-up of three&#xD;
      years in whom the effect of MCS, occurrence of complications, daily intake of medication and&#xD;
      change in quality of life was complete, were analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Ethical statement and registration of clinical trial This observational study was&#xD;
      performed under the approval of the medical ethical committee of the region Arnhem-Nijmegen.&#xD;
      All patients, after extensive pre-operative information, gave written informed consent due to&#xD;
      the experimental nature of this treatment at that time. This clinical trial was not&#xD;
      registered in 2003 due to the fact that, in The Netherlands, MCS was not an experimental&#xD;
      method at that moment. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this&#xD;
      intervention are registered&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 Assessment Pain is a complex, subjective and multidimensional phenomenon that is&#xD;
      difficult to measure by unidimensional pain scores only. Apart from the visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS), the intake of pain medication is thought to be a valid tool of measuring pain relief.&#xD;
      Adding analgesic drug intake as an outcome parameter could provide a more realistic&#xD;
      assessment of long-term benefits of MCS. Four outcome variables were examined: 1) the amount&#xD;
      of pain relief, measured by the mean difference between VAS score pre-operatively and the VAS&#xD;
      score during the follow-up (1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years after implantation of the&#xD;
      MCS electrodes); 2) the change in the drug regimen of all patients per day; 3) adverse events&#xD;
      (infection, bleeding, hardware removal, temporary seizures, and battery dysfunction); and 4)&#xD;
      the correlation between stimulation parameters and the pain relief per patient. Pain relief&#xD;
      was divided into three categories. A good pain relief, level 1, was defined as a VAS&#xD;
      reduction of 70-100%. Reduction of pain according to a VAS scores change between 40% and 69%&#xD;
      was defined as satisfactory (level 2), while a minimal pain relief was defined as a reduction&#xD;
      of ≤ 40% on the VAS scores. An effective pain relief was defined as ≥ 40% reduction of pain&#xD;
      (levels 1 and 2). The use of medication was monitored using the electronic patient record&#xD;
      during follow-up. The medication quantification scale (MQS) was used in order to quantify&#xD;
      medication use and was calculated for each drug by multiplying the dosage levels by their&#xD;
      respective detriment weight. The dosage levels (0-6) were based on the recommended daily&#xD;
      dosage range as described by Masters Steedman et al. These scores are summed to provide a&#xD;
      quantitative index of total drug intake suitable for statistical analysis. The occurrence of&#xD;
      complications was documented as well. Apart from biological complications (eg. bleeding,&#xD;
      infection), the removal of the hardware due to a minimal effect was evaluated as well. To&#xD;
      determine whether there was a correlation between the used stimulation parameters and the&#xD;
      pain relief, the used stimulation parameters (intensities [V], pulse widths [µs], and&#xD;
      frequencies [Hz]) were reviewed. Interference of pain with quality of life (QoL) was measured&#xD;
      before and after (&gt; 1 year) MCS with use of the Quality of Life Index (QLI), based on the&#xD;
      Dutch version of the McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ-DLV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6 Statistical analysis IBM SPSS Statistics version 22 was used for statistical analyses of&#xD;
      the retrieved data (IBM Corp. Released 2013. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0.&#xD;
      Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). To analyze the differences in pain relief and MQS scores and&#xD;
      QoL-indices per subgroup, the Mann-Whitney U test was used. In order to correlate the applied&#xD;
      stimulation parameters, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient was conducted. Values are&#xD;
      represented as mean ± standard deviation (minimum- maximum). Alterations in MQS scores and&#xD;
      QoL-indices before and after MCS were calculated with use of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.&#xD;
      Statistical tests were two sided and with a significance level of P &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
