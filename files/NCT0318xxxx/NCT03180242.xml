    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the pharmacokinetic similarity of EG12014&#xD;
      (Test IMP) compared to reference products sourced from the European Union (Reference IMP 1:&#xD;
      Herceptin® 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion) and the United States&#xD;
      (Reference IMP 2: Herceptin® 440 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion) after&#xD;
      intravenous infusion over 90 minutes of a single dose of 6 mg/kg trastuzumab in 3 parallel&#xD;
      groups of healthy male subjects.&#xD;
