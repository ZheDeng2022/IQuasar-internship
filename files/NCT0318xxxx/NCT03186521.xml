  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To show that the nurse implementation of a sedation and analgesia algorithm is beneficial to&#xD;
      the patient in terms of sedative drugs reduction and thus overall decrease in duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and the morbidity and mortality which is associated with it, without&#xD;
      altering patient comfort and tolerance of the environment. This, compared to the less&#xD;
      frequent assessments by doctors and thus regular adjustments during the day as opposed to a&#xD;
      fixed drug dose.&#xD;

      Outcome Measures : The primary objective of this non-invasive, non-interventional study is to&#xD;
      show that the establishment of a titration algorithm for sedation and analgesia administered&#xD;
      by nurses is more beneficial to the patient than the use of such a drug without a suitable&#xD;
      regimen. The goal is to improve the quality of our painkillers and sedative drugs use needed&#xD;
      in the intensive care environment in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated&#xD;
      with it, without altering patient comfort and tolerance to the environment. For this we&#xD;
      propose to collect a database including patient demographic details, pharmacological&#xD;
      information and any possible complications during the ICU stay as well as a distant&#xD;
      assessment exploring the psychological complications (3, 6 months and 1 year). The primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be the duration of mechanical ventilation, and secondary endpoints, the length&#xD;
      of stay in ICU and in hospital, mortality and other complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The two study populations will be in two distinct time periods, the first so-called&#xD;
      control without any modification of practices, and the second, by introducing the algorithm&#xD;
      with the same drugs being used. Quantitative comparisons of data following a normal&#xD;
      distribution will be done using a Student's t test. Otherwise quantitative data will be&#xD;
      compared using a Mann-Whitney test or Wilcoxon. The comparison of qualitative data will be&#xD;
      done using a Fisher exact test. To increase the power of this before / after study, we&#xD;
      calculated the number of patients to be included by period, based on the reduction in&#xD;
      duration of mechanical ventilation with such protocols in the literature, and the mean&#xD;
      duration of mechanical ventilation in our unit before the study.&#xD;
