      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Endobar gastric embolization system for the&#xD;
      treatment of obesity before continuing to a larger Pivotal Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Device The investigational device in this clinical study is the Endobar&#xD;
      Infusion Catheter System - a disposable system consisting of an occlusion balloon catheter, a&#xD;
      Smart Manifold delivery system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design/Planned Number of Subjects This study is a prospective, sham controlled,&#xD;
      single-blind 12-month trial with 1:1 randomization. A maximum of 40 subjects (obese men and&#xD;
      women who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35.0-50.0 kg/m2) will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized to treatment with Endobar Therapy (n = 20) or sham&#xD;
      procedure control (n = 20). Endobar Therapy involves catheter-based embolization of the left&#xD;
      gastric artery. All subjects in both Endobar Therapy and Sham Control groups will receive&#xD;
      Lifestyle Therapy (behavioral and diet education). At the end of 6 months all subjects&#xD;
      randomized to the Sham Control group will receive catheter-based embolization of the left&#xD;
      gastric artery. Both Endobar Therapy and Sham Control crossover to Endobar Therapy groups&#xD;
      will be followed for a total of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration The duration of the study is expected to last approximately 18 months from the&#xD;
      first enrollment . An additional 12 months to the study closeout after the last follow-up.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES Objective The objective of this study is to conduct a sham controlled&#xD;
      randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Endobar System for the treatment&#xD;
      of obesity. Efficacy, Safety, and secondary outcomes will be evaluated at 6 and 12 months to&#xD;
      allow expansion of the investigation into a larger, pivotal clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a prospective randomized, single blind, active treatment and sham&#xD;
      controlled, single-center trial . After the informed consent and screening process are&#xD;
      completed, all subjects who are eligible and wish to participate in the study will undergo&#xD;
      baseline testing. Those who complete baseline testing will be randomized to either Endobar&#xD;
      Therapy (ET) or Sham Treatment (ST) for 52 weeks. Both groups will be given lifestyle therapy&#xD;
      for weight loss, which involves treatment with a behavioral education weight loss program&#xD;
      delivered as 19 individual sessions in person over 52 weeks. Endobar Therapy involves&#xD;
      catheter-based embolization of the left gastric artery. After 26 weeks, the ET group will&#xD;
      continue to be monitored for an addition 26 weeks and the ST subjects will be given ET and&#xD;
      monitored for 26 weeks. The duration of the entire study will be 52 weeks.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Interventional Group: These subjects will undergo catheter-based embolization.&#xD;
Sham Control Group: These subjects will not undergo femoral artery catheterization. Instead, lidocaine will be injected subcutaneously at the femoral artery site in the Sham Control group. Since all patients will have received at least sedation, they will not be aware of what has been done, and thus be blind to their treatment assignment</masking_description>
