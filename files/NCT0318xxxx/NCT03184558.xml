    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Until disease progression or death or withdrawal of consent whichever comes first, up to end of study (Up to 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of evaluable participants who had at least one confirmed overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) since baseline, any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeter (mm). PR: At least a 30 percent decrease in the sum of the diameters of TLs, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Until disease progression or death or withdrawal of consent whichever comes first, up to end of study (Up to 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression (PD); the end of response should coincide with the date of progression or death from any cause. PD per modified RECIST 1.1 defined as: at least a 20 percent increase in the sum of diameters of TLs and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Until disease progression or death or withdrawal of consent whichever comes first, up to end of study (Up to 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). CR: Disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) since baseline, any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm. PR: At least a 30 percent decrease in the sum of the diameters of TLs, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. SD per modified RECIST 1.1 defined as: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Until disease progression or death or withdrawal of consent whichever comes first, up to end of study (Up to 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the duration from start of treatment until the date of radiological disease progression (the date on which the confirmed progression was initially observed) or the date of death (regardless of cause of death), whichever was earlier.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Until disease progression or death or withdrawal of consent whichever comes first, up to end of study (Up to 1 year)</time_frame>

    <description>Participants received Bemcentinib (BGB324) capsules orally once daily as a loading dose of 400 milligram (mg) on Days 1, 2, and 3. A dose of 200 mg pembrolizumab was given by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks in all participants. Dosing of both drugs commenced on Day 1. On days when both BGB324 and pembrolizumab were given, pembrolizumab was given first and participants were observed for 1 hour after the end of infusion before BGB324 was administered. From Day 4 onward, participants received a daily maintenance dose of 200 mg along with Pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression, until an unacceptable toxicity occurred that required treatment withdrawal or withdrawal of consent or until 106 weeks had passed.</description>

          <description>Participants received Bemcentinib (BGB324) capsules orally once daily as a loading dose of 400 milligram (mg) on Days 1, 2, and 3. A dose of 200 mg pembrolizumab was given by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks in all participants. Dosing of both drugs commenced on Day 1. On days when both BGB324 and pembrolizumab were given, pembrolizumab was given first and participants were observed for 1 hour after the end of infusion before BGB324 was administered. From Day 4 onward, participants received a daily maintenance dose of 200 mg along with Pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression, until an unacceptable toxicity occurred that required treatment withdrawal or withdrawal of consent or until 106 weeks had passed.</description>

        <title>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</title>
        <description>DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). CR: Disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) since baseline, any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm. PR: At least a 30 percent decrease in the sum of the diameters of TLs, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. SD per modified RECIST 1.1 defined as: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>
        <time_frame>Until disease progression or death or withdrawal of consent whichever comes first, up to end of study (Up to 1 year)</time_frame>
        <population>The evaluable analysis set included all evaluable participants who had received at least 1 combination dose of pembrolizumab and bemcentinib and who had measurable disease at entry, as determined by the investigator site assessment.</population>

            <description>Participants received Bemcentinib (BGB324) capsules orally once daily as a loading dose of 400 milligram (mg) on Days 1, 2, and 3. A dose of 200 mg pembrolizumab was given by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks in all participants. Dosing of both drugs commenced on Day 1. On days when both BGB324 and pembrolizumab were given, pembrolizumab was given first and participants were observed for 1 hour after the end of infusion before BGB324 was administered. From Day 4 onward, participants received a daily maintenance dose of 200 mg along with Pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression, until an unacceptable toxicity occurred that required treatment withdrawal or withdrawal of consent or until 106 weeks had passed.</description>
