      The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of atrial fibrillation (AF) and its treatment&#xD;
      in relation to thromboembolic events (stroke, and transient ischemic attacks) and&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Incidence and timing of intracranial complications (stroke,TIA, bleedings) in relation to&#xD;
      diagnosis and anticoagulation treatment of AF during the study period; comparison of&#xD;
      complications between those with and without anticoagulation treatment according to CHADSVASc&#xD;
      score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effect of anticoagulation pauses and INR level on stroke and bleeding risk; strokes&#xD;
           within 30 days after anticoagulation pause and the prevalence of stroke and intracranila&#xD;
           bleeding in relation to INR level &lt; 2, 2-3 and &gt;3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trauma as a risk factor for intracranial bleeding: percentage and risk factors for&#xD;
           intracranial bleeding with or without trauma. Type of preceding trauma and type of&#xD;
           intracranial bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The time relation between diagnosis of AF and type of intracranial complications: Kaplan&#xD;
           Meier analysis of thrombotic (Stroke/TIA) and intracranial bleeding complications after&#xD;
           1st diagnosis of AF in patients with and without anticoagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The risk of stroke and intracranial bleeding in relation to CHADSVASc score, HAS-BLED&#xD;
           score and anticoagulation/antithrombotic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prognosis of stroke and intracranial bleeding: 30-day mortality after stroke and&#xD;
           intracerebral bleeding in patients with and without anticoagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Factors related to underuse of anticoagulation treatment. Data on reasons for not&#xD;
           starting or stopping aticoagulation in those with indication of oral anticoagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Operations and procedure as risk factor for stroke: Frequency and type of operations&#xD;
           performed &lt; 30 days before stroke. Data on length of perioperative pause in&#xD;
           anticoagulation and use of bridging therapy and timiing of stroke are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardioversions as a risk factor for stroke: Frequency of stroke and TIA &lt; 30 days after&#xD;
           cardioversion in relation to use of anticoagulation and CHADSVASc score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The risk of stroke and intracranial bleeding in relation to type of AF (permanent,&#xD;
           persistent, paroxysmal) and concomitant carotid disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated Enrollment: 6000 patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Approximately 20% of stroke is caused by atrial fibrillation (AF) and 1% of patients with AF&#xD;
      suffer from intracranial hemorrhage. Thus, the net benefit of AF management is the key factor&#xD;
      in choosing the successful treatment (pharmacological and interventional).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this retrospective Finnish multicenter study the investigators collect data on patients&#xD;
      with intracranial thromboembolic events or intracranial hemorrhage and AF during the study&#xD;
      period. All such patients ≥18 years of age are identified and relevant clinical details are&#xD;
      retrospectively gathered from the hospital records of the participating hospitals into an&#xD;
      internet-based CRF. The total study period is from 2003 to 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All case records are reviewed using standardized data collection protocol to get information&#xD;
      on baseline characteristics and medication of the patients, management of the patients before&#xD;
      and during the index complication and during a 30-day follow-up after each complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of atrial fibrillation is based 12-lead electrocardiography according to the&#xD;
      standard criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke is documented clinically and confirmed by computerized tomography or magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging to be caused by cerebral infarction. Diagnosis of transient ischemic&#xD;
      attacks are based on clinical diagnosis by neurologist when stroke is not confirmed by&#xD;
      imaging. After completion of manual registration of data, a computer-based cross-checking of&#xD;
      strokes is performed from discharge register data of the included patients to ensure the&#xD;
      complete coverage of all events. Diagnosis of inctracranial bleedings are based on patient&#xD;
      record and classified as subdural, subarachnoidal and intracerebral and possible preceding&#xD;
      trauma is registered. Outcome measures are classified by study neurologist when necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antigoagulation treatment, INR levels during the index complication, possible pauses in&#xD;
      treatment and their casues are registered togethr with information on antiplatelet&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
