      This study will evaluate a new blood collection and filtration system that is intended to be&#xD;
      used to collect, filter, separate and store red blood cells and, separately, plasma. The new&#xD;
      blood collection and filtration system will be compared to an already-approved and currently&#xD;
      used system. Further, this study will evaluate new processing conditions relative to the&#xD;
      individual components of the collection and filtration system. All study participants will&#xD;
      donate two units of whole blood with individual units being donated at least 56 days apart.&#xD;
      One unit of whole blood will be donated with the new system, and the other unit will be&#xD;
      collected with the already-approved system. A subset of the donors (approximately 24 of the&#xD;
      120 participants) will have a small quantity of their red blood cells injected back into&#xD;
      their body 42-days after they were donated in order to evaluate how well the red blood cells&#xD;
      survive. Blood and blood products from all donors will be analyzed the day of collection and&#xD;
      after storage (plasma after at least 30 days of storage and red blood cells after exactly 42&#xD;
      days of storage).&#xD;

      In vitro and in vivo performance of SOLX® RBCs produced with the modified SOLX® System will&#xD;
      be used to demonstrate the acceptability of both the proposed product modification and&#xD;
      expanded indications. To accomplish this, the study will require a total of 120 evaluable&#xD;
      donors completing the study. Enrolled donors will be assigned to either of two study arms.&#xD;
      Each study arm will entail a randomized, paired, 2-x-2 crossover design where every study&#xD;
      donor (n = 60 evaluable study donors who complete the study per arm) will donate a total of&#xD;
      two whole blood units with individual units being donated at least 56 days (8 weeks) apart.&#xD;
      One unit will be collected with the investigational product (IP) and the other unit will be&#xD;
      collected with the control product (CP). The order in which the IP and the CP will be used to&#xD;
      collect, filter and store the whole blood and appropriate blood products (within the context&#xD;
      of the crossover design) will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the two study arms will evaluate outcomes resulting from different storage,&#xD;
      filtration and processing conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1 will entail holding whole blood units at 20-24°C after collection for ≥ 20 hours&#xD;
           (IP) or ≥ 6 hours (CP) prior to initiating room temperature filtration. Following room&#xD;
           temperature centrifugation and subsequent separation, SOLX® PRBC will be placed at 1-6°C&#xD;
           and plasma placed at ≤ -18°C within 24 hours (IP) or within 8 hour (CP) of collection.&#xD;
           The first donation will occur with product indicated per randomization and the second&#xD;
           donation will occur with product alternate to the randomization. Arm 1 will further&#xD;
           entail an in vivo double-radiolabelled autologous RBC recovery substudy (n = 20-24,&#xD;
           paired IP and CP data will be collected) and an evaluation of pre- and post-rejuvenation&#xD;
           PRBC 2,3-DPG levels (all IP and CP units). The in vivo substudy and rejuvenation&#xD;
           evaluation is limited to only Arm 1 and is not included in Arm 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2 will entail holding whole blood units at 1-6°C after collection for ≥ 66 hours&#xD;
           (both IP and CP) prior to initiating cold filtration. Following refrigerated&#xD;
           centrifugation and subsequent separation, SOLX® PRBCs will be placed at 1-6°C within 72&#xD;
           hours of collection (both IP and CP). Plasma will not be evaluated for this arm and will&#xD;
           be discarded. The first donation will occur with product indicated per randomization and&#xD;
           the second donation will occur with product alternate to the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each study arm that does not meet the protocol-defined in vitro acceptance criteria for&#xD;
      exactly 1 unit, an additional 71 evaluable donors will be enrolled, thus increasing the&#xD;
      number of evaluable enrolled donors completing the respective study arm to 131 donors. Only&#xD;
      those acceptance criteria endpoints that were not met within their respective study arm will&#xD;
      be evaluated and neither matched/paired crossover controls nor in vivo RBC recovery (Arm 1 In&#xD;
      vivo substudy) will be evaluated. If all protocol defined in vitro acceptance criteria are&#xD;
      met or &gt; 1 subject does not meet the protocol defined in vitro acceptance criteria relative&#xD;
      to a specific study arm, then no enrollment will occur relative to the same study arm.&#xD;
