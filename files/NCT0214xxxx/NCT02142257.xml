      The purpose of this study is to compare Gastric Bypass and AspireAssist Aspiration Therapy&#xD;
      over 5 years of treatment with regards to weight loss, quality of life, complications,&#xD;
      adverse events, and health economics.&#xD;

      Overweight and obesity is increasing rapidly in Sweden and is the greatest threat to future&#xD;
      public health. Obesity, defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) as a body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2, is an intractable disease in healthcare today.&#xD;
      Obesity results in reduced life expectancy and increased morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight reduction by lifestyle changes or with different pharmacological preparations have in&#xD;
      many studies not made lasting long term results. Obesity surgery has so far been the only way&#xD;
      to achieve permanent weight loss. During the 1980s, restrictive procedures were performed,&#xD;
      e.g., vertical banded gastro-plasty (VBG) with good but unfortunately transient effect. Later&#xD;
      developed, is the now prevalent gastric bypass procedure (GBP) which today uses the keyhole&#xD;
      technique and causes combined restrictive and mal-absorptive changes in gastrointestinal&#xD;
      anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GBP is currently the standard method in clinical practice for the surgical treatment of&#xD;
      morbid obesity (i.e., BMI over 35). GBP is a procedure that is not reversible, which entail&#xD;
      certain pre - and postoperative risks. GBP quickly brings a sharp reduction in weight and&#xD;
      also regression of diabetes mellitus type 2. Unfortunately, the surgery cause lifelong&#xD;
      mal-absorption and requirements of vitamin and mineral supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swedish Obese Subjects study (SOS) that emanated from Gothenburg was the first controlled&#xD;
      intervention study of overweight individuals. Approximately 4000 patients were included, half&#xD;
      of which were surgical, the other half were treated optimally, but without surgery. The&#xD;
      patients have been followed for 10-20 years. Total mortality was 24% lower in the surgical&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new alternative approach to obesity surgery, AspireAssist™ Aspiration Therapy System (CE&#xD;
      Marked), comes from the United States and in this method the individual empties out digesta&#xD;
      from the stomach. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has been used internationally&#xD;
      since the early 1980s for nutrition therapy for stroke or cancer. In a gastroscopy a tube is&#xD;
      placed between the stomach and abdominal wall and nutrition administered via tube directly&#xD;
      into the stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspiration treatment with AspireAssist™ empties food from the stomach after every meal to&#xD;
      lose weight. Using a valve mechanism and associated tubing set and water reservoir the&#xD;
      individual empties out digesta in the toilet 20 minutes after each meal and loses&#xD;
      approximately 30% of the caloric intake in the diet. A 1 -year study in Karlskrona, Sweden,&#xD;
      has shown a significant reduction in weight, almost 40% Excess Weight Loss (% EWL) reduction&#xD;
      and median weight reduction of 16.5 kg after 6 months. For GBP the weight reduction of 1 year&#xD;
      is in the order of 70-85 %. During 1 year of treatment with AspireAssist™ there were no&#xD;
      serious complications or problems with the body's electrolyte balance noted either at the&#xD;
      surgery or during follow-up. The advantage of this method is that it is completely reversible&#xD;
      and the individual who does not wish to continue aspiration may have the tube into the&#xD;
      stomach removed. GBP results in most of the stomach becoming disconnected and not accessible&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of, for example, ulcers, bleeding, tumors or gall stones. AspireAssist™&#xD;
      does not have any lasting changes in the anatomy and thus will not lead to the potential for&#xD;
      internal hernia that GBP unfortunately can cause. Wound infection occurs in approximately 9 %&#xD;
      of cases when PEG tubes are placed in patients with cancer or stroke. Wound infections are,&#xD;
      in most cases, treatable with antibiotics in tablet form and are very rarely considered to be&#xD;
      a serious complication. Antibiotics are routinely given in conjunction with PEG insertion.&#xD;
      Very unusual complication is leakage associated with insertion of the PEG and the method has&#xD;
      been reported to have a risk of about 2 % during PEG insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the individual to get help to change their habits and their lifestyle, cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy (CBT) is included in the treatment concept for AspireAssist™. CBT program&#xD;
      runs for six months and includes both group meetings and individual conversations and&#xD;
      individual assignments between meetings. Group meetings will cover the following themes:&#xD;
      motivation, vision workshop, self-esteem, thought management, stress, learn to eat&#xD;
      consciously, prevent and manage relapse. The program uses no calorie reducing methods since&#xD;
      there is no scientific evidence that these provide permanent results but are based on CBT.&#xD;
      The program is enhanced with awareness and mental training, which are methods that have shown&#xD;
      good results in stress-related conditions. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in one&#xD;
      study has been shown to change brain activity of the participants so that the activity was&#xD;
      shifted from the areas in the frontal lobe that is active during stress, anxiety and&#xD;
      depression to areas that regulate peace, joy and curiosity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization in clinical trial (RCT) had been the best way to implement such a comparative&#xD;
      study. But AspireAssist™ method is aimed at patients who do not want or dare to be operated&#xD;
      with Gastric Bypass Procedure (GBP) and therefore fails to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore recruit patients from the clinic's waiting list of accepted and planned the GBP&#xD;
      and the other group comes from the existing waiting list for Aspire method to treat obesity.&#xD;
      This group includes only those patients who expressed clearly that they are not willing or&#xD;
      dare to be operated with GBP, but instead wishes to receive treatment with Aspire method for&#xD;
      their morbid obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are now newer statistical methods to compare two or more groups in an observational&#xD;
      study in a good and statistically significant manner and Stata version 13 can handle it well&#xD;
      by matching the so-called covariates (e.g., in our study may be covariates following&#xD;
      variables at baseline: age, gender, preoperative weight, BMI, concomitant disease such as&#xD;
      diabetes). Patients were matched and then the comparison is done between the matched groups.&#xD;
      Calculation of treatment effects , including so-called propensity score exploitation has&#xD;
      already been used in a comparative study between GBP and other bariatric surgery for obesity&#xD;
      where neither has been able to randomize patients (Carlin et al Annals of Surgery, Vol. 257,&#xD;
      Number 5, May 2013: 791-7)&#xD;
