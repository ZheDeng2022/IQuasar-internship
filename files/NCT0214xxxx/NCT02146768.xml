      A. INTENT AND PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimizing procedural and patient outcomes relies heavily on tomographic imaging data&#xD;
      guidance for patients being evaluated for trans-catheter aortic valve replacement or&#xD;
      implantation (TAVR) by providing accurate information of the aortic valve apparatus (aortic&#xD;
      annulus and its pertinent neighboring structures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aortic valve annulus is a dynamic complex elliptical or ovoid 3D entity that is also&#xD;
      subject to constant shape deformation across the cardiac cycle in addition to being&#xD;
      influenced by the thoracic and intra-thoracic anatomy or variations. Given this inherent&#xD;
      nature of the aortic valve annulus, electrocardiographic gated cardiac computed tomographic&#xD;
      angiography (CCTA), a robust dynamic 3-dimensional imaging modality, is now widely accepted&#xD;
      as the &quot;gold-standard&quot; for evaluating the aortic valve apparatus (AVA). To maximize the&#xD;
      information obtained by CT, imaging needs to be performed with intravenous contrast&#xD;
      injection.2 CCTA requires administration of iodinated contrast. The volume of iodinated&#xD;
      contrast medium is of concern in many patients because candidates for TAVR frequently have&#xD;
      impaired renal function.2 Contrast reduction and adherence to protocols for prevention of&#xD;
      contrast-induced nephropathy is recommended.2 For access planning via the ilio-femoral route,&#xD;
      some groups have reported direct aortic injection with extremely low volumes of contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduction of contrast volumes for CCTA of the AVA can be achieved by using lower flow rates&#xD;
      than for coronary CT angiography. Although 5 mL/s is typically recommended for coronary&#xD;
      imaging, 3 mL/s may sometimes be sufficient for imaging patients in the workup for TAVR.2&#xD;
      Though suggested, these CCTA lower flow rates have not been systematically performed and&#xD;
      validated in a population being evaluated for candidacy for TAVR. And as recommended by&#xD;
      guidelines, a standard bolus of 80 mL to 120 mL of low-osmolar iodinated contrast is usually&#xD;
      necessary for optimal TAVR CCTA scanning.1 In these patients, reducing the dose of iodinated&#xD;
      contrast at the time of CCTA acquisition in an attempt to minimize renal injury, and at the&#xD;
      same time being able to accurately assess the aortic annulus apparatus (AVA) will be of&#xD;
      paramount importance. Some reduction of contrast nephropathy can be accomplished by&#xD;
      minimizing contrast volume and the use of iso-osmolar or low-osmolar contrast agents. It has&#xD;
      been suggested that the contrast volume threshold can be estimated by using the ratio of&#xD;
      contrast volume to creatinine clearance. Nephrotoxicity is more likely when the contrast&#xD;
      volume/creatinine clearance ratio exceeds 3.7:1.12 And using this, 3.7 x eGFR (estimated&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate) can be set as the maximal contrast dose for an imaging test or&#xD;
      invasive procedure.12 14 CCTA acquisition methods Images were acquired with a Brilliance&#xD;
      64-slice CT scanner (Philips Healthcare, Andover, Massachusetts, USA). As per the&#xD;
      recommendations on radiation protection in cardiovascular CT by the Society of Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Computed Tomography (SCCT), a tube potential of 100 kV will be considered for patients&#xD;
      weighing &lt;90 kg or with a body mass index (BMI) &lt;30; whereas a tube potential of 120 kV will&#xD;
      be considered for patients weighing &gt;90 kg and with a BMI &gt;30. It will be adjusted, based on&#xD;
      each individual patient's size, to the lowest setting that guarantees acceptable image noise&#xD;
      for a suitable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to perform analysis.15 The patients' eGFR was&#xD;
      first calculated using the MDRD (modification of disease in renal diet) GFR formula. The&#xD;
      maximal allowable contrast dose for the CCTA was calculated using 3.7 x [(patient's BSA/1.73)&#xD;
      x MDRD-eGFR].14 Next, the dose of contrast chosen for the CCTA was &lt; 50% of the maximal&#xD;
      allowable contrast dose. The MDRD formula can underestimate the GFR by about 6.2% in patients&#xD;
      with chronic kidney disease and by about 29% in healthy individuals, making this an extremely&#xD;
      suitable conservative approach for calculating the contrast dosing, with a tendency only to&#xD;
      underdose and never to overdose the contrast. With our extensive experience in doing this, we&#xD;
      have decreased the total contrast dose for CCTA of the AVA to 45 ml with satisfactory image&#xD;
      quality and SNR for post-processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two separate acquisitions (ECG-synchronized for the aortic root and non-gated for the aorta&#xD;
      and peripheral vessels) may be preferable to an ECG-synchronized acquisition of the entire&#xD;
      volume to reduce the amount of contrast agent.2 A total contrast dose of 45 ml is essential&#xD;
      for ECG-synchronized CCTA that utilizes a 64-multislice CT scanner (MSCT) in order to obtain&#xD;
      satisfactory image quality and SNR of the aortic root. Depending on the remaining amount of&#xD;
      allowable contrast, a decision was then made to perform a non-gated CT of the aorta and&#xD;
      peripheral vessels either with no contrast or a low-dose-contrast protocol that we have in&#xD;
      place for selectively enhancing the ilio-femoral arterial regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DICOM data will be post-processed by a workstation capable of advanced image processing,&#xD;
      manipulation and optimal multi-planar reformatting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. CLINICAL HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-dose-contrast CCTA can effectively and safely assess the aortic valve apparatus, and&#xD;
      effectively direct the trans-catheter heart valve (THV) size selection by providing accurate&#xD;
      annulus sizing, and provide adequate pre-procedural risk-stratification guidance for&#xD;
      TAVR/TAVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed investigation is a retrospective cross-sectional study assessing image quality&#xD;
      and safety from a renal standpoint between low-dose-contrast CCTA and&#xD;
      traditional-dose-contrast, and effectiveness of low-dose-contrast CCTA in analyzing the&#xD;
      complex dynamic 3-pronged aortic annulus geometry pre-procedurally in TAVR to improve&#xD;
      procedural and patient outcomes. The study cohort will comprise 150 consecutive patients (75&#xD;
      patients who received low-dose contrast matched by body mass index with 75 patients who&#xD;
      received traditional dose contrast) seen at THHBP between January 1, 2011 and June 30, 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bland and Altman plot ratios method comparison will be utilized and the graphs displaying&#xD;
      a scatter diagram of the ratios plotted against the averages of the SNR of ascending aorta&#xD;
      (SNR-AA) obtained with the two different acquisitions (comparing image quality) will be&#xD;
      generated. A generalized propensity score (to adjust for pre-operative clinical and&#xD;
      non-clinical factors) approach accounting for the matching will be used to account for&#xD;
      possible confounding of the association between low and traditional dose groups and annulus&#xD;
      area, annulus perimeter, and maximum and minimum annulus diameter measurements. Moreover,&#xD;
      adjusted (by the propensity score) Kappa tests, specificity, and sensitivity will be used to&#xD;
      assess agreement between low and traditional dose groups. The outcomes are: CT guided&#xD;
      successful TAVR deployment; unsuccessful TAVR deployment (moderate-severe paravalvular leak,&#xD;
      rupture, valve embolization, mortality); acute renal failure will be defined as a reduction&#xD;
      (pre vs post procedure) in renal function as defined by the RIFLE criteria, occurring will be&#xD;
      used to assess differences between the study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study cohort of 50 patients enables the detection of a minimum absolute difference of 3% in&#xD;
      the primary outcome incidence (power&gt;80) assuming Î±=0.05, two-sided test.&#xD;

      study of 150 consecutive patients &gt; 18 years of age (75 patients who received low-dose&#xD;
      contrast matched by body mass index with 75 patients who received traditional dose contrast)&#xD;
      seen at THHBP between January 1, 2011 and June 30, 2013. Patients with MDRD eGFR &lt; 25 will be&#xD;
      excluded. The cutoff of 25 was chosen as the maximal allowable dose of contrast for eGFR of&#xD;
      25 would be about 90 ml (3.7 x eGFR of 25), and half of that maximal allowable contrast would&#xD;
      be 45 ml (the minimum we require to obtain a CCTA with acceptable SNR for post-processing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B4. Risks There are no risks to subjects as this is a retrospective trial.&#xD;
