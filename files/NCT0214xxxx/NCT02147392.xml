      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A protein called translocator protein may play a role in brain inflammation. Sometimes it&#xD;
      is present at higher levels in the lungs than in the brain. Researchers want to see if a drug&#xD;
      called [11C]ER176 can provide an image of this protein in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the ability of a drug to image a protein, and test how it is distributed in the&#xD;
      body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy adults over age 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a PET scan of the brain using [11C]ER176. It will be injected&#xD;
           through an intravenous tube into 1-2 arm veins. A tube may also be put into an artery at&#xD;
           the wrist or elbow. Some participants will also have a lung scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the PET, participants will lie on a bed that slides in and out of a doughnut-shaped&#xD;
           scanner. A plastic mask will be molded to their face and head. They may be wrapped with&#xD;
           restraining sheets. The scan will last about 120 minutes. Blood may be taken during the&#xD;
           scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine will be taken before and after the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During another visit, participants will have an MRI scan of the brain. Participants will&#xD;
           lie on a table that slides in and out of a metal cylinder. A strong magnetic field and&#xD;
           radio waves will take pictures of the brain. The scanner makes loud knocking noises.&#xD;
           Participants will be given earplugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants will have only a whole-body PET scan using [11C]ER176.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is highly expressed in activated microglia and reactive&#xD;
      astrocytes in brain, and it may, thereby, be a useful biomarker of neuroinflammation. We&#xD;
      developed [(11)C]PBR28 as a positron emission tomographic (PET) radioligand to bind to TSPO&#xD;
      and measure its density. Although [(11)C]PBR28 has high in vivo specific signal, it is very&#xD;
      sensitive to the high and low affinity states of TSPO, which are caused by the rs6971 single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the fourth exon of the TSPO gene resulting in a&#xD;
      nonconservative alanine-to-threonine substitution in position 147 of the encoded TSPO&#xD;
      protein. This co-dominant mutation yields three genetic groups: HH, HL, and LL, where H is&#xD;
      the high-affinity form and L is the low affinity form. The frequency of the L allele is&#xD;
      approximately 30%; thus, the frequency of the LL homozygote is approximately 9%. The affinity&#xD;
      of PBR28 to H and L forms differs about 50 fold; thus, LL carriers provide no measureable&#xD;
      signal in brain from [(11)C]PBR28. We recently developed a new TSPO ligand ER176, the&#xD;
      affinity of which differs by only 1.2 fold and therefore LL carriers should provide&#xD;
      measureable brain uptake. The purpose of this study is to assess the potential of&#xD;
      [(11)C]ER176 to image TSPO in brain, characterize its binding sensitivity in lung of healthy&#xD;
      subjects from all three genetic groups, and to do whole-body imaging for biodistribution and&#xD;
      estimation of radiation dosimetry in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present protocol will use a new PET ligand [(11)C]ER176 to 1) perform an initial&#xD;
      whole-body scan after [(11)C]ER176 injection in a single healthy volunteer to confirm&#xD;
      wide-spread distribution of radioactivity to different body organs (Phase 0); 2) perform&#xD;
      kinetic brain scans in healthy volunteers of 3 different genotypes, with about half of these&#xD;
      volunteers undergoing lung scans in the same session (Phase 1), and; 3) perform whole-body&#xD;
      imaging in healthy volunteers (Phase 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the relative robustness of absolute quantitation of TSPO in the brain&#xD;
      of healthy subjects, using an arterial input function and pharmacokinetic modeling. In&#xD;
      addition, lung imaging will provide in vivo binding sensitivity of [(11)C]ER176 to TSPO&#xD;
      genotype. Furthermore, the whole-body imaging would estimate the radiation-absorbed doses for&#xD;
      future use of [(11)C]ER176 in clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will select up to 36 healthy adult female and male volunteers (age 18 and older) of 3&#xD;
      different TSPO genotypes for brain imaging, and up to 11 additional healthy volunteers for&#xD;
      whole body dosimetry analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      For absolute quantification of TSPO, up to 36 healthy controls (up to 12 each of three TSPO&#xD;
      genotypes) will have brain PET imaging using [(11)C]ER176 and these subjects will have the&#xD;
      arterial line and a brain MRI scan. In about half of those subjects from each genotype group,&#xD;
      lungs will be scanned in the same session. For radiation dosimetry of [(11)C]ER176, up to 11&#xD;
      subjects will have whole-body PET imaging. These subjects will not have arterial line and MRI&#xD;
      scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures are: (a) To assess absolute quantitation of TSPO with&#xD;
      [(11)C]ER176, we will determine the identifiability and time stability of distribution volume&#xD;
      in the brain calculated with compartmental modeling. The difference in mean distribution&#xD;
      volumes among subjects with different genotypes would be used to evaluate the genotype&#xD;
      sensitivity of [(11)C]ER176. (b) To assess whole-body biodistribution and dosimetry of&#xD;
      [(11)C]ER176 we will use the organ time-activity curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary outcome measure, we will examine the effect of polymorphism on [(11)C]ER176&#xD;
      binding in lungs because lungs have much higher density of TSPO and may be more effective to&#xD;
      show whether ER176 is sensitive to the SNP.&#xD;
