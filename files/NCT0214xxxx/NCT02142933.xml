  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. At the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, a simplified screening for group B&#xD;
           streptococci (GBS) of vagina and perineum has been performed since several years.&#xD;
           Reliable detection of GBS is critical to prevent GBS transmission during delivery with&#xD;
           antimicrobial prophylaxis. Transmission of GBS to the neonate may otherwise lead to&#xD;
           severe infection and complications in the neonate. Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
           Prevention (CDC) and other international organizations recommend a vaginal and&#xD;
           additional rectal swab.We therefore aim to test this simplified screening against the&#xD;
           international gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Antibiotic resistant bacteria may reside in the genital tract of an expected mother and&#xD;
           may be transmitted to the new-born during delivery. In case of infection of the pregnant&#xD;
           woman or the neonate, application of standard antimicrobial treatment will&#xD;
           insufficiently cover these extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria.&#xD;
           Therefore, colonization with ESBL in pregnancy needs to be known to potentially deliver&#xD;
           adequate antimicrobial treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transmission of GBS under delivery leads in 1/1000 of live births to severe sepsis in the&#xD;
      neonate and may have serious sequelae including death. Most of the cases concern early onset&#xD;
      sepsis which occurs in the first three to seven days after birth. Several randomized studies&#xD;
      showed that antibiotic prophylaxis during delivery reduces the risk of early onset sepsis in&#xD;
      the neonate in 85%, whereas late onset sepsis was not affected. Accurate screening including&#xD;
      appropriate culture methods are critical for the wealth of the newborn and the decision&#xD;
      regarding application of antibiotic prophylaxis to the mother. In this study we compare a&#xD;
      simplified test algorithm taking swabs from the vagina and the perineum only versus a&#xD;
      combined vaginal and rectal swab for GBS culture which is the current gold standard of&#xD;
      diagnosis as the culture yield for GBS increases substantially when samples are taken from&#xD;
      both the lower vagina and the rectum compared to swabbing the vagina or endocervix only.&#xD;
      There is certain reluctance for performing a rectal swab as it has been associated with&#xD;
      discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to demonstrate that this simplified vagino-perineal swab leads to a similar&#xD;
      GBS detection rate as compared to the gold standard comprising of a combined vaginal and&#xD;
      rectal swab. We further aim to systematically assess the degree of discomfort with the rectal&#xD;
      swab and compare the costs when applying those different methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally we aim to determine the prevalence and risk factors of community acquired ESBL&#xD;
      by further processing the swabs in the appropriate culture media and filling in a&#xD;
      standardized questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan a prospective cohort study with inclusion of 450 pregnant women who attend the&#xD;
      outpatient obstetric clinic for routine control in the third trimester.&#xD;
