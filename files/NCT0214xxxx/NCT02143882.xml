  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Department of Health has recently announced the implementation of annual vaccination for&#xD;
      all those aged 18 years and under, with live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), which is&#xD;
      delivered as a nasal spray. This study seeks primarily to measure antibody responses to the&#xD;
      LAIV vaccination over three subsequent years and will involve six blood samples, six dried&#xD;
      blood spots (taken from the end of the blood sample needle) and six oral fluid samples -&#xD;
      before and three weeks after each vaccination each year. These samples will allow us to&#xD;
      assess how the immune system responds to the vaccinations in terms of the antibodies that are&#xD;
      present.&#xD;

      The Department of Health has recently announced the implementation of annual vaccination for&#xD;
      all those aged 18 years and under, with live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), which is&#xD;
      delivered as a nasal spray. The programme will begin in the influenza season, from September&#xD;
      2013, with children aged 24 years of age, and older children being included from the&#xD;
      influenza season of 2014. Therefore this study seeks primarily to measure antibody responses&#xD;
      to the LAIV vaccination over three subsequent years and will involve six blood samples, six&#xD;
      dried blood spots (taken from the end of the blood sample needle) and six oral fluid samples&#xD;
      - before and three weeks after each vaccination each year. These samples will allow us to&#xD;
      assess how the immune system responds to the vaccinations in terms of the antibodies that are&#xD;
      present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will specifically recruit children in previous receipt of Pandemrix, a pandemic&#xD;
      influenza vaccine, and those naïve to pandemic influenza vaccination, which will allow the&#xD;
      comparison of responses to LAIV between these groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size required to answer the primary objective of the study is 200 evaluable&#xD;
      children per group. As the study will be conducted over three years the recruitment target&#xD;
      will be 500 children across the two groups to allow for the expected attrition of numbers&#xD;
      over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also be assessing how well the vaccines are tolerated and each&#xD;
      participant will therefore be asked to complete a health diary for the week following&#xD;
      vaccination. They will be asked to record any symptoms, which the investigators will elicit&#xD;
      in line with the information in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) as well as any&#xD;
      illnesses or visits to their GP or hospital.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent/legal guardian gives written informed consent for participation of their child&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male or female aged 4 years (+364 days) to 8 years (+364 days) on the day of&#xD;
                  consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documented prior receipt of Pandemrix, or no evidence in the medical notes of&#xD;
                  never having had pandemic influenza vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute exclusion criteria. The participant may not enter the study if ANY of the&#xD;
             following apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
        From Fluenz Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients (e.g. gelatin; see&#xD;
             appendix 1), to gentamicin (a possible trace residue), to eggs or to egg proteins&#xD;
             (e.g. ovalbumin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children and adolescents who are clinically immunodeficient due to conditions or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy such as: acute and chronic leukaemias; lymphoma; symptomatic&#xD;
             HIV infection; cellular immune deficiencies; and highdose corticosteroids. FLUENZ is&#xD;
             not contraindicated for use in individuals with asymptomatic HIV infection; or&#xD;
             individuals who are receiving topical/inhaled corticosteroids or lowdose systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids or those receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy, e.g. for&#xD;
             adrenal insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age receiving salicylate therapy&#xD;
             because of the association of Reye's syndrome with salicylates and wildtype influenza&#xD;
             infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study specific exclusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any contraindication to vaccination as specified in the &quot;Green Book&quot;Immunisation&#xD;
             against Infectious Disease, HMSO.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  known bleeding diathesis (or any condition that may be associated with a prolonged&#xD;
             bleeding time).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other significant condition or circumstance which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, may either put the participant at risk because of participation in the&#xD;
             study, or may influence the result of the study, or the participant's ability to&#xD;
             participate in the study. *Temporary Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        From the SPC:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • The concurrent use of FLUENZ with antiviral agents that are active against influenza A&#xD;
        and/or B viruses has not been evaluated. However, based upon the potential for influenza&#xD;
        antiviral agents to reduce the effectiveness of FLUENZ, it is recommended not to administer&#xD;
        the vaccine until 48 hours after the cessation of influenza antiviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Administration of influenza antiviral agents within two weeks of vaccination may affect the&#xD;
        response of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because of this information in the SPC, should any child be given these medications the&#xD;
        administration of LAIV would be delayed as specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study specific:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fever (sublingual temperature ≥ 38°C)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received any blood or blood products within the past 12 weeks.&#xD;
