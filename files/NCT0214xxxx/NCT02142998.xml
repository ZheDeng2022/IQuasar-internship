  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has become a significant health problem in Canada. It is known to be a risk factor&#xD;
      for many diseases, including Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). When medical efforts to&#xD;
      lose weight fail, patients often consider bariatric surgical procedures as the next step. The&#xD;
      two most common bariatric procedures performed are Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) and&#xD;
      Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG). The gold standard for diagnosing GERD is Esophageal pH&#xD;
      monitoring, as it is the most objective method to document the reflux, assess the severity&#xD;
      and monitor the response to treatment of the disease. In the last few years LSG has gained in&#xD;
      popularity due to its simplicity and short operative time. Currently the comparison between&#xD;
      bariatric surgery and GERD symptoms is very one sided. There are significant numbers of&#xD;
      studies with conclusive results that state that LRYGB has a positive effect on GERD symptoms,&#xD;
      however there is little evidence that states the same about LSG. This means that the&#xD;
      relationship between LSG and GERD is inconclusive. An objective evaluation of GERD using 24&#xD;
      hour pH monitoring and validated CRFs at different follow up time points will contribute&#xD;
      greatly to our understanding of what this relationship might be.&#xD;

    <description>The study is performed with the patient fasting for a minimum of 6 hours. A single channel or dual channel (15 cm spacing) pH probe is inserted trans nasally. The pH sensor, or distal pH sensor in the case of 2 channel testing, is positioned 5 cm above the proximal margin of the LES, as determined by esophageal manometric testing. pH-Z ambulatory monitor (Given Imaging Digitrapper) is used for data acquisition and the data analyzed with pH Analysis Program (Given Imaging AccuView). The number of reflux events, defined as a drop in esophageal pH readings below 4.0, is recorded and the percentage of time with esophageal acid exposure is analyzed using defined protocols and accepted normal values.</description>

    <description>A high resolution esophageal manometry catheter is used for testing and inserted Trans nasally. The patient is given 10 liquid swallows (5mL of water), at intervals of approximately 30 seconds. The catheter (Sierra Scientific/Given Imaging) has 36 sensors, each one averaging pressures from 12 circumferential positions. This gives a total of 432 data points. The sensors are placed 1 cm apart, spanning a length of 35 cm. The catheter simultaneously records pressure readings from the esophagus, sphincter regions (UES and LES), pharynx and stomach without the need for a station pull-through technique. Results are reported according to defined protocols and accepted normal values.</description>
