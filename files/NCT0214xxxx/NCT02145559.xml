    <textblock>
      Given the role of mTOR signaling and probable synergistic activity of combining sirolimus and&#xD;
      metformin in patients with advanced solid tumors, the investigators hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The combination of metformin plus sirolimus will result in reduction of p4EBP1, p70S6K&#xD;
           and pAKT more than sirolimus alone in peripheral blood T cells (PBTC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The combination of metformin plus sirolimus will result in decreased levels of serum&#xD;
           biomarkers including fasting insulin, C-peptide, glucose, triglycerides, LDH, IGF-1,&#xD;
           IGF-1R, IGF-BP and leptin, but an increase in adiponectin in peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Expression of active forms of AMPK, mTOR, PI3K, PTEN loss, AKT, LKB1, P62, LC3, and/or&#xD;
           ULK1 in the tumor tissue (original pathology) will be predictive of response to&#xD;
           combination therapy. This will be an exploratory hypothesis for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sirolimus induced toxicity, especially hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia, will be&#xD;
           mitigated by combining sirolimus with metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Metformin plus sirolimus will have promising anti-cancer activity and this activity will&#xD;
           correlate with decreases in the above biomarkers. This will be an exploratory hypothesis&#xD;
           for this study.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a descriptive study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic markers of dual sirolimus and&#xD;
      metformin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. To compare the change in the pharmacodynamic biomarker p70S6K in peripheral blood T cells&#xD;
      with the combination of metformin XR and sirolimus to that with sirolimus alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. To compare the changes in pharmacodynamic biomarkers p4EBP1 and pAKT in peripheral blood T&#xD;
      cells with the combination of metformin XR and sirolimus to those with sirolimus alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. To assess the tolerability of the combination of metformin XR plus sirolimus at the&#xD;
      selected doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. To compare fasting serum glucose and triglycerides on sirolimus before and after the&#xD;
      addition of metformin XR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an open-label, randomized study in which all eligible patients with&#xD;
      histologically-confirmed advanced solid tumors will be started on sirolimus (3 mg daily)&#xD;
      alone for the first 7 days (lead-in period); cycle 1, days 1-8. Before starting the sirolimus&#xD;
      the investigators will obtain previous pathology (if available) and collect blood lymphocytes&#xD;
      for baseline testing of biomarkers as is shown in study calendar. The pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      biomarkers will be collected again on cycle 1, day 8 to assess the effect of sirolimus alone&#xD;
      on these biomarkers. In the previous study, the effect of sirolimus on p70S6K was observed&#xD;
      within 48 hours of the first dose9. On day 8, patients will be randomized 1:1 to metformin XR&#xD;
      (500 mg daily with the evening meal) or no metformin for two weeks (through day 21). On day&#xD;
      15, patients randomized to metformin XR will have their dose increased to 1000 mg daily if&#xD;
      there is no grade ≥ 2 toxicity due to metformin XR. Patients who develop grade 2 toxicity due&#xD;
      to metformin will be maintained on metformin XR 500 mg daily for the rest of the study, while&#xD;
      patients who develop &gt; grade 2 toxicity will be taken off study. A repeat biomarkers&#xD;
      evaluation will be done on cycle 1, day 22 to assess the effect of adding metformin on these&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic biomarkers. From day 22 onwards, all patients will be on combination of&#xD;
      sirolimus and metformin. Patients who were initially not randomized to metformin XR will&#xD;
      begin taking it at 500 mg daily with an evening meal and titrated up to 1000 mg daily after&#xD;
      one week, as above. Each cycle will be 4 weeks. CT scans will be obtained after every 2&#xD;
      cycles to assess the response by RECIST version 1.140. Metformin will be temporarily held on&#xD;
      the day of CT scan and resumed 48 hours after CT scan. This is due to increased risk of&#xD;
      lactic acidosis with iodinated contrast agent and is a standard procedure for contrast&#xD;
      enhanced CT scan at the University of Chicago.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Creatinine &lt; 1.4 mg/dl for females or &lt; 1.5 mg/dl for males.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prior treatment with mTOR inhibitors will be allowed as long as the patient did not&#xD;

          9. Patients taking substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of CYP3A4 (See Appendix C) should&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior treatment with an mTOR inhibitor (including sirolimus) is allowed; however,&#xD;
             patients with ≥ grade 3 toxicities with an mTOR inhibitor are excluded.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Serious underlying medical (including acute decompensated congestive heart failure) or&#xD;
             psychiatric illnesses that would, in the opinion of the treating physician,&#xD;
             substantially increase the risk for complications related to treatment. Similarly, any&#xD;
             unstable medical condition that, in the opinion of the treating physician or study&#xD;
             investigators, would interfere with the study objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnancy or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Major surgery within 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Concurrent use of any proton pump inhibitors, as these limit the absorption of&#xD;
             metformin30,41.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of lactic acidosis as per prior medical records or provided by the patient.&#xD;

         10. Metabolic acidosis, acute or chronic. Acidosis will be defined a blood pH &lt; 7.35.&#xD;
             Acidosis will be suspected if serum bicarbonate is &lt; 22 mEq/L. In such cases, venous&#xD;
             blood pH would be checked to confirm or exclude acidosis.&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Participants who are already on treatment with metformin, except when metformin can be&#xD;
             held for 4 weeks prior to the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of ongoing alcohol abuse or binge drinking. Alcohol abuse will be defined as a&#xD;
             pattern of drinking that results in harm to one's health, interpersonal relationships,&#xD;
             and ability to work. Binge drinking will be defined as at least one episode of&#xD;
             consuming more than five units in men and four units in women during the previous&#xD;
             month. One unit of alcohol can generally said to be a half pint of beer, a single&#xD;
             measure (shot glass) of a spirit or a small glass of table wine.&#xD;
