  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background to main study question: Cardiac complications are a common cause of morbidity&#xD;
      after non-cardiac surgery. Patients with perioperative myocardial injury (both MI, and lower&#xD;
      levels of cardiac troponin elevation) experience higher short-term and long-term mortality.&#xD;
      They are also at substantially increased risk of additional cardiac and non-cardiac&#xD;
      complications. It is therefore plausible that myocardial injury adversely affects quality of&#xD;
      life. This study will compare postoperative health-related quality of life of patients who&#xD;
      did or did not experience perioperative myocardial injury (defined by troponin-I &gt; 0.07ng/ml)&#xD;
      after non-cardiac surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Pilot prospective cohort study (n = 300). Population: Consecutive patients&#xD;
      undergoing non-cardiac, non-transplant surgery at UHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background to secondary study questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinically based risk stratification tools used in non-cardiac surgery (e.g., Revised&#xD;
           Cardiac Risk Index) are of moderate utility and assign patients only to broad risk&#xD;
           categories. This study will examine the usefulness of pre-operative biomarkers (BNP,&#xD;
           HbA1c, and others) in supporting cardiac risk stratification and will address the&#xD;
           question: Is there a set of preoperative criteria that can accurately inform the&#xD;
           decision to monitor troponin postoperatively?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intra-operative physiological derangement measured with the Surgical Apgar Score&#xD;
           correlates with morbidity and mortality 3-months postoperatively. This study will&#xD;
           examine the relationship between the Surgical Apgar Score; continuous non-invasively&#xD;
           monitored intraoperative metrics of hemoglobin concentration and occult hypovolemia&#xD;
           (Pleth Variability Index) with the Masimo Radical-7 Pulse Co-Oximeter; and the primary&#xD;
           and secondary outcomes. This aspect of the study will address the question: Can readily&#xD;
           available intraoperative physiological data inform the decision to monitor troponin&#xD;
           postoperatively?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quality of Recovery-40 Score evaluates (in the recovery room and at 24 hours&#xD;
           postoperatively) the patient's subjective experience of their recovery from surgery.&#xD;
           This metric is correlated with quality of life 3-months postop. This study will evaluate&#xD;
           correlation between Quality of Recovery-15 Score, a valid and more efficient means of&#xD;
           measuring recovery, and the primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Approximately 2/3 of patients who have postoperative myocardial injury are asymptomatic&#xD;
           and have no ECG changes. Diagnosis of MI requires biomarker elevation (Troponin &gt;&#xD;
           0.3ng/ml) plus clinical or ECG or imaging evidence of myocardial injury. Of the latter 3&#xD;
           criteria, 2 are often absent. In selected patients, this study will use trans-thoracic&#xD;
           echocardiography, CT coronary angiography, and cardiac MRI to improve diagnostic yield&#xD;
           and define those diagnostic modalities that are most useful in the postoperative&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative myocardial injury may negatively impact health-related quality of life.&#xD;
      Affected patients may experience higher levels of postoperative dependency. This possibility&#xD;
      has implications for patient rehabilitation, provincial and personal healthcare costs, as&#xD;
      well as patients' physical, emotional and mental well-being and relationships. The public&#xD;
      health dimension of this problem could therefore be significant. In addition, an incomplete&#xD;
      understanding exists of how individual patient cardiac risk factors, in combination with the&#xD;
      perioperative environment, result in myocardial injury. The diagnostic investigations that&#xD;
      are most useful in this setting have not yet been clearly defined. Patients who fail to be&#xD;
      rescued after experiencing postoperative complications (as distinct from failure to avoid&#xD;
      experiencing the complication in the first instance) plays a central role in postoperative&#xD;
      mortality. Early recognition of such patients is therefore crucial. By prospectively&#xD;
      observing a cohort of high-risk surgical patients, this study will provide insight into how&#xD;
      these factors interact. This will allow us to better characterize the potential predictors&#xD;
      and features of postoperative myocardial injury. We hope that our findings will aid in the&#xD;
      identification of patient characteristics associated with increased risks of postoperative&#xD;
      myocardial injury, thus helping to direct diagnosis, early treatment and rescue. This study&#xD;
      will thus potentially yield important data that will positively impact future patient care&#xD;
      and the rational use of healthcare resources.&#xD;
