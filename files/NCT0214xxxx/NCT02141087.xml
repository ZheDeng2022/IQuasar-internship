        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Clinical and radiographic diagnosis of IPF including the presence of usual&#xD;
             interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern or possible UIP pattern on historical HRCT (ATS&#xD;
             2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. %FVC ≥ 50% and %DLCO ≥ 30% based either on historical pulmonary function tests&#xD;
             obtained in the 30 days prior to screening or on tests obtained during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Able to understand the importance of adherence to program treatment (pirfenidone)&#xD;
             and protocol, and willing to follow all program requirements, including the&#xD;
             concomitant medication restrictions, throughout the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Able to understand and sign a written informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A patient who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from the program:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Is receiving an investigational agent (defined as any drug that has not been approved&#xD;
             for marketing for any indication in the US); prior use of pirfenidone is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has received fluvoxamine therapy ≤ 28 days prior to the first dose of program&#xD;
             treatment (pirfenidone) in PIPF-031, or is unable or unwilling to avoid fluvoxamine&#xD;
             for the duration of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has any known contraindication for the use of pirfenidone, specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the drug product excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Severe hepatic impairment including end stage liver disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Severe renal impairment (CrCl &lt; 30 mL/min) including end stage renal disease&#xD;
                  requiring dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of cigarette smoking within 3 months prior to the completion of screening or&#xD;
             is unwilling to avoid tobacco products throughout program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known explanation for interstitial lung disease other than IPF, including but not&#xD;
             limited to radiation, drug toxicity, sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,&#xD;
             bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
             infection, viral hepatitis, and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of clinically significant environmental exposure known to cause pulmonary&#xD;
             fibrosis (PF), including but not limited to drugs (such as amiodarone), asbestos,&#xD;
             beryllium, radiation, and domestic birds.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnancy or lactation. Women of childbearing capacity are required to have a negative&#xD;
             serum pregnancy test before treatment and must agree to maintain highly effective&#xD;
             contraception by practicing abstinence or by using at least two methods of birth&#xD;
             control from the date of consent through the end of participation in the program. If&#xD;
             abstinence is not practiced, one of the two methods of birth control should be a&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptive (e.g., oral contraceptive and a spermicide).&#xD;
