      As a function of the growing population of older adults, an estimated 3.48 million total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty (TKA) procedures will be performed annually in the U.S. by 2030. Despite the&#xD;
      near-universal success of this surgery in mitigating chronic knee pain, TKA is not successful&#xD;
      in restoring long-term physical function in older adults, primarily because of quadriceps&#xD;
      muscle atrophy, which explains 77% of the strength deficits. Overall, strength and functional&#xD;
      mobility in TKA patients is 30-50% below age-matched healthy controls. Functional tasks such&#xD;
      as stair-climbing remain a clinical problem for 75% of patients following TKA. Muscle atrophy&#xD;
      occurs in both operative and non-operative legs, and is essentially permanent for older&#xD;
      patients because of their impaired ability to increase muscle mass. The purpose of this&#xD;
      clinical research is to determine the effects of essential amino acid (EAA) supplementation&#xD;
      on muscle mass, strength, and functional mobility following TKA in older adults. Based on&#xD;
      strong preliminary data, the investigators hypothesize that twice-daily ingestion of 23 g of&#xD;
      EAA for 1 wk before through 6 wk after TKA will increase basal rates of muscle protein&#xD;
      synthesis via inactivation of catabolic signaling, and up-regulation of anabolic and&#xD;
      cyto-protective proteins. The investigators further hypothesize that short-term atrophy&#xD;
      prevention and accelerated return of functional mobility will lead to longer-term structural&#xD;
      and functional adaptations, and improved quality of life in older TKA patients vs. Placebo.&#xD;
      Identifying the mechanisms up-regulated by EAA treatment that preserve muscle volume and&#xD;
      mobility will have a major impact on rehabilitation science. This study will accomplish two&#xD;
      specific aims: (1) determine if EAA elevates basal rates of muscle protein synthesis by&#xD;
      up-regulating anabolic pathways and cyto-protective proteins, and inactivating catabolic&#xD;
      pathways in the short term vs. Placebo and (2) determine if short-term prevention of atrophy,&#xD;
      weakness, and functional mobility leads to positive changes in muscle cell structure and&#xD;
      function, and improved quality of life in the longer term vs. Placebo. This work is&#xD;
      significant because it advances knowledge of the molecular and cellular changes occurring&#xD;
      during muscle atrophy (Placebo) and atrophy prevention (EAA) in a clinical setting using a&#xD;
      treatment that is broadly applicable, is well tolerated, and can be implemented immediately.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigative team has completed recent studies showing that essential amino acid (EAA)&#xD;
      supplementation attenuates quadriceps atrophy and accelerates the return of functional&#xD;
      mobility following TKA. For patients on EAA, quadriceps atrophy was only -6% and -3% in the&#xD;
      operative and non-operative quadriceps, respectively, 6 wks after TKA, but -18% and -10%,&#xD;
      respectively, in patients on Placebo, a threefold difference. Of clinical relevance, the&#xD;
      patients on EAA were able to maintain strength and demonstrated an accelerated return of&#xD;
      functional mobility vs. Placebo 6 wks post-TKA. Positive changes at the cellular level are&#xD;
      likely responsible for the reduction in muscle loss and preservation of strength, and to&#xD;
      explain the acceleration of the return of functional mobility. As such, we hypothesize that&#xD;
      twice-daily ingestion of 23 g of EAA from 1 wk before to 6 wks after TKA will increase basal&#xD;
      rates of muscle protein synthesis via inactivation of catabolic signaling (FoxO3a), and&#xD;
      up-regulation of anabolic and cyto-protective proteins. We also propose that short-term&#xD;
      atrophy prevention and accelerated return of functional mobility will translate into&#xD;
      long-term (6 mo and 1 yr post-TKA) structural and functional adaptations, leading to improved&#xD;
      quality of life in TKA patients with EAA supplementation vs. Placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a two-arm parallel design to determine the effect of EAA supplementation&#xD;
      on post-TKA muscle cell structure and function, and quality of life in the shorter term (6&#xD;
      months post-TKA) and long term (1 yr post-TKA) vs. Placebo. Subjects will be 80 older male&#xD;
      and female adults having primary TKA at the Slocum Center for Orthopedics and Sports&#xD;
      Medicine, Eugene, Oregon. Slocum study staff will pre-screen/identify potential subjects for&#xD;
      recruitment based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible patients will be invited to join&#xD;
      the study. After the completion of informed consent procedures, participants will be assigned&#xD;
      a unique patient identification number, and randomly assigned to either EAA or Placebo on a&#xD;
      1:1 allocation ratio, with blinding of treatment condition to subject and research&#xD;
      staff/statisticians collecting data. Twice-daily ingestion of 23 g of supplement will begin 7&#xD;
      days prior to TKA and end at 6 wks post. EAA subjects will receive EAA and Placebo subjects&#xD;
      will receive the non-essential amino acid Alinine. Subjects will document compliance with the&#xD;
      supplement protocol in a log book and will return empty vials. Subjects will be followed for&#xD;
      1 yr.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key research questions are: (a) Does EAA prevent shorter-term (6 wks post-TKA) bilateral&#xD;
      muscle atrophy, preserve quadriceps strength, and accelerate the return of functional&#xD;
      mobility vs. Placebo? (b) Are there shorter-term sex differences on outcome measures? (c)&#xD;
      Will EAA increase longer-term (6 mo post-TKA) quadriceps strength and functional mobility vs.&#xD;
      Placebo? (d) Does EAA improve long-term (1 yr post-TKA) functional mobility and measures of&#xD;
      quality of life vs. Placebo? (e) Are there long-term sex differences in functional mobility&#xD;
      or measures of quality of life? Assessment points will be at 6 wks, 4 wks, and 1 wk prior to&#xD;
      surgery, and 1 wk, 2 wks, 6 wks, 6 mos, and 1 yr post-TKA. At different assessment points, we&#xD;
      will collect demographic, medical (e.g., length of hospital stay, tourniquet use),&#xD;
      physiological (e.g., muscle biopsy, MRI, DEXA, strength; blood tests), pharmacologic,&#xD;
      functional mobility, physical activity (accelerometer), psychometric (e.g., quality of life;&#xD;
      Veterans RAND 12-item Health Survey [VR-12]), food intake (3-day diary), physical therapy,&#xD;
      and perceived pain data. The following schedule of assessments will be followed: no more than&#xD;
      6 mo pre-TKA (enrollment and screening), 6 wks pre-TKA (screening, surveys, DEXA scan, MRI&#xD;
      test, physical activity and food recording), 4 weeks pre-TKA (blood draw, strength and&#xD;
      functional mobility testing, muscle and fat biopsy); 1 wk pre-TKA and in hospital (physical&#xD;
      activity and food recording); 1 wk post-TKA (physical activity and food recording); 2 wks&#xD;
      post-TKA (blood draw, physical activity and food recording); 6 wks post-TKA (blood draw, MRI&#xD;
      test, strength and functional mobility testing, physical activity and food recording, muscle&#xD;
      and fat biopsy); 3 mos post-TKA (surveys, strength and functional mobility testing, physical&#xD;
      activity and food recording); 6 mos post-TKA (surveys, DEXA scan, MRI test, strength and&#xD;
      functional mobility testing, physical activity and food recording, muscle and fat biopsy),&#xD;
      and 1 yr (surveys, DEXA scan, MRI test, strength and functional mobility testing, physical&#xD;
      activity and food recording, muscle and fat biopsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from a variety of sources, including surveys, electronic medical&#xD;
      records, medical and functional tests, and staff reports. Data will be entered and&#xD;
      double-verified in password-protected spreadsheets sand databases stored behind a firewall.&#xD;
      Any electronic medical records data captured will use secure data transfer and&#xD;
      HIPAA-compliant protocols approved by the University of Oregon IRB. Staff reports will be&#xD;
      forwarded directly to project data managers. All personal data will be identified by numbers&#xD;
      rather than names. Interim reports of project results will be made to the Data and Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analyses indicated that a sample size of 80 subjects would be sufficient to detect&#xD;
      anticipated effects on primary outcomes: operative leg quadriceps volume (MRI), non-operative&#xD;
      leg quadriceps volume (MRI), isometric strength, Get Up And Go test, stair climb up test,&#xD;
      stair climb down test, and six-minute walk test. The mean effect size across these outcomes,&#xD;
      based on baseline- to 6-week percent change in pilot data) was d = 1.01, reflecting large&#xD;
      effects. For a sample size of 30/group, this study can detect ESs of d &gt; .79 with 85% power,&#xD;
      and the minimally detectable ES drops to 0.68 or 0.52 with pretest covariates of r = .50 or&#xD;
      .75. Every effort will be made to reduce attrition and obtain data on all participants at all&#xD;
      assessment points. However, attrition is expected. Because this study will have power to&#xD;
      detect anticipated physiological and functional effects with 30 subjects per condition, we&#xD;
      will enroll 80 total subjects (40/condition) to account for possible attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EAA intervention is designed to attenuate muscle loss, improve functional outcomes, and&#xD;
      enhance quality of life. Data analyses will focus on shorter-term, longer-term results, and&#xD;
      change over time. Preliminary analyses will employ descriptive statistics to understand the&#xD;
      nature of the data and ensure that data distributions are appropriate for the statistical&#xD;
      tests employed. Chi-square tests and analyses of variance, as appropriate, will be conducted&#xD;
      to evaluate the equivalence of continuing participants vs. dropouts on demographic, medical&#xD;
      history, and recent levels of dependent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct random coefficients analysis (RCA) to model muscle and functional mobility&#xD;
      across time, as well as covariates that could affect outcomes, such as age, sex, physical&#xD;
      activity, and dietary intake. RCA models trajectories from assessments nested within&#xD;
      subjects; test of condition are represented by the interaction between a time factor and&#xD;
      treatment condition. The RCA avoids the many pitfalls associated with traditional repeated&#xD;
      measures ANOVA: It adjusts for within-individual dependence or autocorrelation in the data,&#xD;
      can model nonlinear growth, does not require fixed spacing among assessments, and&#xD;
      accommodates missing values over time. By using any available data across time, the RCA will&#xD;
      limit the effects of missing data, reducing bias and increasing power. Based on our&#xD;
      preliminary data, we estimate that we will be able to collect &gt;92% of all data points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected study outcomes are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. With successful completion of this research, we expect to demonstrate that EAA prevents&#xD;
           muscle atrophy bilaterally, as our preliminary data suggest. To date, it is not known if&#xD;
           EAA can prevent atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We expect to show that atrophy prevention will lead to strength gains and accelerated&#xD;
           return of functional mobility. We further expect to show that EAA may have positive&#xD;
           effects on central activation deficits, as our preliminary data suggest that strength is&#xD;
           increased by 6 wks with EAA. To date, it is not known if preserving muscle following TKA&#xD;
           will increase strength and augment the return of functional mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. We expect to document that EAA will increase muscle cell size (CSA) bilaterally, in the&#xD;
           vastus lateralis of the operative and non-operative quadriceps. It is not known if&#xD;
           atrophy prevention and early return of functional mobility will stimulate positive gains&#xD;
           in muscle cell structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. We expect to demonstrate that EAA increases mitochondrial mass bilaterally and increases&#xD;
           mitochondrial respiration at rest. By sampling from the non-operative (control leg) and&#xD;
           operative leg, we expect to show that EAA normalizes mitochondrial function over time (6&#xD;
           mo and/or 1 yr post-TKA). It is not known if early gains in functional mobility will&#xD;
           positively impact muscle cell function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. We expect to show that quality of life (as measured by instruments such as VR-12) will&#xD;
           be significantly increased with EAA. It is not known to what extent the above positive&#xD;
           gains will have on longer-term (6 mo and 1 yr) quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect each of the above to stimulate and be transformative. EAA supplements are&#xD;
      inexpensive ($800/patient or $16/day), are well tolerated, and can be implemented&#xD;
      immediately.&#xD;
