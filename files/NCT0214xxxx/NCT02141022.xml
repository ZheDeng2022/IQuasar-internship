  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the efficacy of computer-based cognitive exercises as a means of&#xD;
      cognitive remediation in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) who are beginning the disease&#xD;
      modifying pharmacotherapy Gileyna.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gilenya represents the most recent advance in MS disease-modification therapy (DMT) and shows&#xD;
      promise for neuroprotection, a feature relevant to the progressive neurologic damage&#xD;
      associated with the disease. Cognitive impairment accompanies MS in 40-60% of cases and when&#xD;
      present, additional symptomatic treatment combined with DMT is required. To date no&#xD;
      symptomatic pharmacologic therapy has shown a consistent benefit on MS associated cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction. However, non-pharmacologic approaches show promise. With recent technical and&#xD;
      scientific advances, cognitive training is rapidly evolving to become the most effective&#xD;
      intervention for the cognitive impairments associated with a wide range of neurological&#xD;
      conditions. However, these training programs have not yet been studied in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized open-label clinical pilot trial to compare a plasticity-based&#xD;
      and adaptive cognitive remediation (PACR) program to an active control (ordinary computer&#xD;
      games) in 20 adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) starting Gilenya therapy. Primary outcome&#xD;
      measures will be used as preliminary indicators of effect, with improvements on program&#xD;
      task-related measures and changes in cognitive measures. Secondary outcome measures will&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of the use of these programs in patients with MS, as indicated by&#xD;
      compliance and patient-reported experience.&#xD;

    <description>PACR Program Use: To use PACR, the participant navigates to the PACR study web site. The participant then logs into the PACR (using a study provided screen name and study identification number). A game-like experience begins, where the participant is presented with games in a set order. Each game consists of targeted exercises that contain the core science stimuli and tasks. The scheduling mechanism ensures that a participant progresses through the exercises in a defined order, generally moving from more simple (early sensory processing) exercises to more complex (multimodal, cognitive control) exercises over the course of the three-month experience.</description>

    <description>Active Control Program Use (Ordinary Computer Games): The active control program is composed of 13 ordinary computer games matched to the PACR condition overall. This condition is designed to be a face-valid approach to cognitive remediation. The control condition is also designed to account for nonspecific treatment effects, including placebo response, interactions with research personnel, and experience with computers and computer-related activities, and any halo or expectation effect on study assessments.</description>
