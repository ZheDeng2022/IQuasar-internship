      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1. Verify whether the intake of LibramedR is able to induce a better endocrine and&#xD;
      metabolic profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2. Verify whether treatment with LibramedR for 60 days produces a better glycaemic&#xD;
      profile after oral glucose load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be recruited 80 obese children for phase 1 and 40 obese children for phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment with placebo or LibramedR with a double blind&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol phase 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each child will arrive at the UOC at 8 a.m., in fasting. A blood sample will be taken. Then&#xD;
      patients will be given two LibramedR tablets or placebo. After 20 minutes they will be given&#xD;
      a mixed meal (equal to 15 kcal per kg of lean body mass). Blood samples will then be taken at&#xD;
      30-minute intervals for the first two hours and 60 minutes for the following two hours, for&#xD;
      the determination of metabolites and hormones for a total of 4 hours. The level of satiety&#xD;
      will be quantified through a visual analog scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of the OGTT performed in recruitment phase, children will be divided&#xD;
      into two groups: group A, children with blood glucose 2 hours after oral load higher than the&#xD;
      median and group B, children with blood glucose 2 hours after oral load below the median.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children of group A will be randomly assigned to LibramedR treatment or placebo for 60&#xD;
      days, after which they will repeat Anthropometric measurements, bioelectrical impedance, OGTT&#xD;
      and blood chemistry. They will also repeat dietary and sport anamnesis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 60 days, the children of both groups will receive the same dietary treatment&#xD;
      consisting of a low-calorie and balanced diet, and recommendations to practice more sport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 15 days a research assistant will contact the families to reinforce treatment&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 LibramedR intake should cause a lower increase in postprandial blood glucose,&#xD;
      insulin, triglycerides and a greater decrease in ghrelin levels compared to placebo&#xD;
      treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 The treatment with LibramedR should be associated with a decrease in blood glucose&#xD;
      and insulin secretion after OGTT compared to placebo treatment.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postprandial phase has a fundamental role in metabolic regulation. In fact, being exposed&#xD;
      to high levels of substrates such as glucose and fatty acids after food intake tends to&#xD;
      increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. This is even more relevant in reference to the&#xD;
      amount of hours in which the subject is in postprandial condition and therefore exposed to&#xD;
      high concentrated substrates. Food intake, moreover, regulates gastrointestinal secretion of&#xD;
      hormones which help balance between hunger and satiety, by regulating nutrients supply and&#xD;
      peripheral substrate consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An obese subject, due to excessive body fat and of its accumulation, presents high insulin,&#xD;
      glucose and triglyceride blood levels, and blood pressure which increase the risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Since the body is for most of the time in postprandial phase,&#xD;
      substrate and hormone containment a few hours after food intake helps limit exposition to&#xD;
      cardiovascular risks and potential metabolic and vascular damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On equal food and energy intake, a meal's composition has great influence over postprandial&#xD;
      and hormonal metabolic profiles. A high lipid/carbohydrate ratio meal, for instance, produces&#xD;
      higher postprandial triglycerides and GLP-1 secretion, and lower glucose and insulin levels&#xD;
      than an isocaloric, isoproteic meal with low lipid/carbohydrate ratio. The intake of&#xD;
      polysaccharides macromolecules produces an endoluminal gel that reduces and delays the&#xD;
      absorption of intestinal nutrients, especially glucose and lipids. The intake of soluble&#xD;
      fibre is associated to a better glycaemic profile and postprandial lipemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, it is not known whether the intake of macromolecules such as Policaptil Gel&#xD;
      RetardR polysaccharides (LibramedR) before the meal affects the metabolic response (substrate&#xD;
      oxidation, hormonal and circulating nutrients variation) and the satiating effect compared to&#xD;
      the same meal after taking placebo, and could therefore help to reduce postprandial&#xD;
      cardiovascular risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1. Verify whether the intake of LibramedR is able to induce a better endocrine (lower&#xD;
      blood insulin and ghrelin postprandial levels) and metabolic (decreasing postprandial&#xD;
      glycaemia, fatty acids and triglycerides) profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2. Verify whether treatment with LibramedR for 60 days produces a better glycaemic&#xD;
      profile after oral glucose load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard clinical practice at the UOC of Diabetology, Clinical Nutrition and Obesity in&#xD;
      Children Pediatrics, ULSS 20 Verona for obese children, consists in the medical examination&#xD;
      with assessment of the stage of pubertal development, anthropometric measurements (height,&#xD;
      weight, waist circumference), bioimpedance analysis of body composition (TanitaR), dietary&#xD;
      anamnesis (food diary) and sport anamnesis (hours per day of video exposure and hours per&#xD;
      week of sport). On the next day, the patient performs an oral glucose load curve (OGTT), a&#xD;
      blood chemistry sampling for the determination of the lipid profile and ALT. These practices,&#xD;
      which are common clinical procedures, are not part the present project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this group of patients with these clinical and biochemical characteristics, will be&#xD;
      recruited for this study 80 children for phase 1 and 40 children for phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 Inclusion criteria: age (10 + 2 years), ethnicity (Caucasians), obesity (BMI&gt; cut-off&#xD;
      of BMI for age and gender indicative of obesity, defined by the International Obesity Task&#xD;
      Force), acceptance to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: birth defects, genetic disorders, chronic diseases, obesity secondary to&#xD;
      chronic intake of drugs or endocrine causes or genetic therapy for obesity already in&#xD;
      progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 Inclusion criteria: age (10 + 2 years), ethnicity (Caucasians), obesity, acceptance&#xD;
      to take part in the study, blood glucose levels 2 hours after oral glucose tolerance test&#xD;
      (performed prior to recruitment) above the median of reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: birth defects, genetic disorders, chronic diseases, obesity secondary to&#xD;
      chronic intake of drugs or endocrine causes or genetic therapy for obesity already in&#xD;
      progress, blood glucose 2 hours after an oral glucose load below the median of reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment with placebo or LibramedR with a double blind&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol phase 1 Each child will arrive at the UOC at 8 a.m., in fasting since 9&#xD;
      p.m. the previous evening. A blood sample will be taken with a needle cannula on the&#xD;
      antecubital vein. Then patients will be given two LibramedR tablets or placebo. After another&#xD;
      20 minutes they will be given a mixed meal to be consumed within 20 minutes. Blood samples&#xD;
      will then be taken at 30-minute intervals for the first two hours and 60 minutes for the&#xD;
      following two hours, for the determination of metabolites and hormones for a total of 4 hours&#xD;
      (baseline + 6 blood samples).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample meal The child will have a mixed meal equal to 15 kcal per kg of lean body mass, in&#xD;
      order to standardize the intake according to their metabolically active mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meal composition: bread, cooked ham, ice cream (stracciatella), water, cheese&#xD;
      (PhiladelphiaR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      % of total energy: protein 12.2% carbohydrate 52.6%, lipid 35,2%, fiber 8% (caloric density&#xD;
      will be equal to 1.4 kcal/g).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective appetite The level of satiety will be quantified through a visual analog scale&#xD;
      simplified for use with children at 30-minute intervals for the first two hours and 60&#xD;
      minutes for the following two hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol phase 2 Based on the results of the OGTT performed in recruitment&#xD;
      phase, children will be divided into two groups: group A, children with blood glucose 2 hours&#xD;
      after oral load higher than the median (lower glucose tolerance) and group B, children with&#xD;
      blood glucose 2 hours after oral load below the median (greater glucose tolerance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children with a lower glucose tolerance will be randomly assigned to LibramedR treatment&#xD;
      or placebo for 60 days (two tablets daily), after which they will repeat Anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements, bioelectrical impedance, OGTT and blood chemistry (lipid profile, ALT and&#xD;
      HbA1c). They will also repeat dietary and sport anamnesis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 60 days, the children of both groups will receive the same dietary treatment&#xD;
      consisting of a low-calorie (less than 30% of the energy requirements estimated by sex, age&#xD;
      and height) and balanced (protein = 15%, carbohydrates = 55%, lipids = 30%) diet, and&#xD;
      recommendations to change their sedentary lifestyle and practice more sport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 15 days a research assistant will contact the families to reinforce treatment&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculating sample size phase 1 The sample size was calculated to detect a difference of at&#xD;
      least 300 mg / dl * 240 min. AUC glucose measured between the zero and 240 minutes after&#xD;
      taking the test between the groups that received LibramedR before the meal and the one that&#xD;
      took placebo, with 85% power and 5% alpha error. The mean and standard deviation of the&#xD;
      glucose AUC group who received placebo were obtained from a previous study carried out by our&#xD;
      group (C Maffeis et al. vs. A High-Fat. in Moderate-fat Meal in Obese Boys: Nutrient Balance,&#xD;
      Appetite, and Gastrointestinal Hormone Changes, Obesity 2010; 18 (3) :449-55). The average&#xD;
      value of the group taking LibramedR was 8% lower than the placebo group, while the standard&#xD;
      deviation was supposedly equal to that of the group who took placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculating sample size phase 2 The sample size was calculated to detect a difference of 2100&#xD;
      mg / dl * min. of glucose AUC measured between 0 and 120 minutes after an oral glucose load&#xD;
      in the group treated with LibramedR and the placebo group, with 90% power and 5% alpha error.&#xD;
      The mean and standard deviation of the AUC glucose placebo arm were taken from our internal&#xD;
      database of 100 patients who performed a glucose tolerance curve and the arm's standard&#xD;
      deviation with LibramedR was supposedly equal to that of the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis phase 1 The mean values of the physical, biochemical and metabolic&#xD;
      variables and area under the curve (AUC) of metabolites and hormones of children who have&#xD;
      taken LibramedR will be compared with Student's t test for two-tailed unpaired data with&#xD;
      those children who have taken the placebo, or with non-parametric test, if specified.&#xD;
      Postprandial metabolic and hormonal parameter changes in the two groups will be compared with&#xD;
      ANOVA repeated measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SPSS 21.0 software will be used to perform the analysis. The level of significance of the&#xD;
      test will be set at p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis phase 2 In each group, average physical, biochemical and metabolic&#xD;
      variables and area under the curve (AUC) glucose and insulin values at recruitment (baseline)&#xD;
      will be compared with follow-up values, with Student's t tests for paired data, or&#xD;
      non-parametric tests, if specified. The comparison between the delta of the variables&#xD;
      measured at baseline and follow-up for the group treated with LibramedR and the placebo group&#xD;
      will be performed with Student's t test with two queues for unpaired data or with&#xD;
      non-parametric test, if specified. Hormonal and metabolic parameters change during afterload&#xD;
      of glucose in the two groups will be compared with ANOVA for repeated measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The software SPSS 21.0 will be used to perform the analysis. The level of significance of the&#xD;
      test will be set at p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol phase 1 LibramedR intake should cause a lower increase in postprandial blood&#xD;
      glucose, insulin, triglycerides and a greater decrease in ghrelin levels compared to placebo&#xD;
      treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol phase 2 The treatment with LibramedR should be associated with a decrease in blood&#xD;
      glucose and insulin secretion after OGTT compared to placebo treatment.&#xD;
