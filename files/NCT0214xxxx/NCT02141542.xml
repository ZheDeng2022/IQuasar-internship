      This is an open label, phase I trial, testing the combination of Tremelimumab and MEDI3617 in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic melanoma.&#xD;

      Description Patients who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial to&#xD;
      receive tremelimumab and MEDI3617.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening procedures confirm participation in the research study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be given a study drug-dosing calendar for each treatment cycle. The&#xD;
      investigators are looking for the highest dose of the combination of study drugs that can be&#xD;
      administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have&#xD;
      melanoma, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of&#xD;
      the study drug. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who have been&#xD;
      enrolled in the study prior and how well the dose was tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
