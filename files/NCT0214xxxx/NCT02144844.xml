      The hypotheses were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1. Women at low-moderate risk for APD at T1 (baseline EPDS scores of 5-9) in the cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral intervention (CBI) group will maintain low-moderate risk status and have&#xD;
      significantly fewer APD symptoms at T2 and T3 than women at low-moderate risk for APD in the&#xD;
      (TAU) control group (as measured by percent of participants with EPDS scores &lt;9 at T2 and T3&#xD;
      and mean score changes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Women at high risk for APD at T1 (baseline EPDS scores â‰¥10) in the CBI group will have a&#xD;
      significantly greater reduction in APD symptoms at T2 and T3 than women at high risk for APD&#xD;
      in the TAU control group (as measured by percent of participants with EPDS scores &lt;10 at T2&#xD;
      and T3 and mean score changes).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We collected data using Netbooks computers pre-programmed with Qualtrics survey forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline (T1), post intervention (T2) and 1-month follow-up (T3), participants were&#xD;
      administered the EPDS and the BDI-II and the Dolphin MINI neuropsychiatric Interview version&#xD;
      6. A similar time frame was used for the TAU group. Paired T-tests were used to determine&#xD;
      mean change in EPDS scores (primary analysis) and BDI-II scores (secondary analysis) within&#xD;
      each of the CBI and TAU groups at T2 and T3. A T-test measured differences in EPDS and BDI-II&#xD;
      scores for the same time periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The sample size was based on the PI's pilot intervention study. Using a conservative&#xD;
           estimate of 500 eligible women from both sites per year at a 42% depression risk rate&#xD;
           (moderate and high), and a 46% enrollment rate, it will be possible to accrue 97&#xD;
           subjects per year at risk for APD (moderate and high risk) or 193 subjects over the&#xD;
           first 24 months of the study. Using the recruitment, retention, and eligibility patterns&#xD;
           from the previous study, a total study sample of 124 subjects, 62 in the IP-CBI group&#xD;
           and 62 in the TAU control group, allows for a 20% (24) drop-out rate and achieve the&#xD;
           goal of 50 women in the IP-CBI and 50 women in the TAU control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We planned to determine if there were significant differences in EPDS baseline scores in&#xD;
           the CBI and TAU groups for the full sample and for the CBI and TAU groups stratified by&#xD;
           high or low-moderate risk for antepartum depression.&#xD;
