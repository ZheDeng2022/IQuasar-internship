      Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by the compression of median nerve at the wrist where it&#xD;
      passes through a narrow space called carpal tunnel formed by the wrist bones, ligaments and&#xD;
      tendons. The common symptoms include numbness and pain over the areas supplied by the median&#xD;
      nerve namely the thumb, the index finger, the middle finger and the outer part of the ring&#xD;
      finger. There can be loss of sensation, weakness or muscle atrophy in severe cases. The&#xD;
      functions of the affected hands may be greatly impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carpal tunnel syndrome is very common. It can lead to significant economic impact both to the&#xD;
      affected individual and the society either by the direct treatment cost and indirectly from&#xD;
      the working ability loss. Despite the vast burden, there is no consensus regarding its&#xD;
      treatment so far. Surgery is generally effective and often reserved for severe cases. There&#xD;
      are many nonsurgical treatment options. Local steroid injection and wrist splinting are among&#xD;
      the commonest and with more evidence. Local steroid injection into the carpal tunnel can&#xD;
      reduce the inflammation and swelling. Wrist splinting can maintain the wrist at its neutral&#xD;
      position where the pressure at the carpal tunnel is the least. However, there are only very&#xD;
      few studies comparing these two treatments directly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complaining of finger numbness who have been confirmed to have carpal tunnel&#xD;
      syndrome by nerve conduction test are invited to participate in the study. The patients who&#xD;
      agreed to be recruited are asked about their basic informations and the details of the carpal&#xD;
      tunnel syndrome symptoms. Their hands will be examined. They are asked to fill in a&#xD;
      questionnaire specific for assessing the symptom severity and the functional status of&#xD;
      patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. They will then be assigned to one of the two treatment&#xD;
      groups randomly and receive the respective treatment. They need to come back for follow-up at&#xD;
      one month and to fill in the questionnaire again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is local steroid injection is more effective than wrist splinting in&#xD;
      treating carpal tunnel syndrome.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is caused by the pressure and consequent compression on the&#xD;
      median nerve within a confined anatomical area at the wrist referred to as the carpal tunnel.&#xD;
      It is very common and has an important socio-economic impact. The prevalence of CTS in the UK&#xD;
      is 7-16%. Its incidence has been estimated at 88-125 per 100,000 in USA. Economic&#xD;
      consequences include the direct financial implications of treatment and the indirect cost of&#xD;
      absenteeism from the workplace. The median number of days away from work for CTS is among the&#xD;
      highest at 27 days. In the US in 1995, between 400,000 and 500,000 patients underwent&#xD;
      surgical decompression. This equates to an economic cost of in excess of $2 billion. CTS and&#xD;
      hearing loss was found to account for more morbidity, measured by cases and working days&#xD;
      lost, than any other illness in the US working population. CTS may also occur as a work-&#xD;
      related disorder leading to compensation claims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the vast burden of the disease, there is no consensus regarding its best management.&#xD;
      Surgical treatment is generally preferred in severe cases of CTS. A Cochrane review&#xD;
      investigating surgical treatment of CTS showed surgical treatment relieves symptoms&#xD;
      significantly better than splinting, but no conclusion could be drawn in people with mild&#xD;
      symptoms and if surgical treatment is better than steroid injection. On the other hand,&#xD;
      surgical treatment is relatively costly and carries risks of significant complications that&#xD;
      may last several months and give rise to further work absence. In addition, the waiting time&#xD;
      for surgery is usually long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For non-surgical interventions many modalities have been trialed but only a few have shown&#xD;
      discernable benefits. Local steroid injection and wrist splinting are among the most popular&#xD;
      options. They are commonly employed in mild to moderate cases of CTS. For severe cases, they&#xD;
      can also offer relief of complaints during the waiting period for surgery or when there are&#xD;
      contra-indications for surgery. Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials have&#xD;
      concluded that local steroid injection provides greater clinical improvement at one month&#xD;
      compared with placebo and that there is weak evidence that a splint worn at night is more&#xD;
      effective than no treatment in the short term. However, the number of studies that compare&#xD;
      the two methods is limited, and they are mostly either retrospective in design or prospective&#xD;
      but non-randomized. Two randomized controlled trials comparing local steroid injection and&#xD;
      splinting found respectively that local steroid injection does not significantly improve&#xD;
      clinical outcome compared to anti-inflammatory drugs and splinting and that injections of&#xD;
      steroids are ineffective. However, the conclusions of these two studies are limited either by&#xD;
      a small sample size or the lack of a validated outcome measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to conduct a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy of&#xD;
      local steroid injection and splinting in patients with CTS using the Boston Carpal Tunnel&#xD;
      Questionnaire as outcome measure with a 4-week follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attending the medical clinic of a local hospital (Kwong Wah Hospital) complaining of&#xD;
      finger or hand numbness are referred to the electro-neuro-diagnostic unit for nerve&#xD;
      conduction test. Consecutive patients with clinical and electrophysiological features of CTS&#xD;
      are invited to participate in the study. Clinical features are pain, paresthesia or weakness&#xD;
      in the median nerve distribution for at least 3 months. The neurodiagnostic criteria are&#xD;
      based on the American Academy of Neurology summary statement, which further classifies the&#xD;
      abnormalities as follows: (1) mild abnormality, i.e., abnormal comparative tests or prolonged&#xD;
      median distal sensory latency (DSL &gt; 3.5 ms) but normal median distal motor latency (DML);&#xD;
      (2) moderate abnormality, i.e., prolonged median DSL and DML (â©¾4.2 ms); and (3) severe&#xD;
      abnormality, i.e., absence of median sensory nerve action potential and prolonged median DML&#xD;
      or absent compound muscle action potentials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are excluded if they have any recognized causes of CTS including inflammatory&#xD;
      arthritis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, renal failure, polyneuropathy and history of&#xD;
      significant local trauma. Other exclusion criteria include age younger than 18 years,&#xD;
      previous treatment of CTS and pregnancy. Patients with motor impairment or thenar muscle&#xD;
      atrophy are also excluded and they will be referred to the Orthopedic unit for assessment of&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential participants are informed of the objectives and procedures of this study, as&#xD;
      well as the possible complications. The patients who have given informed consent are&#xD;
      interviewed by a single investigator within 4 weeks of the NCV. Their demographical data&#xD;
      including age, gender and body mass index (BMI) are recorded. The duration of the symptoms,&#xD;
      medical comorbidities and employment status are documented. Examination of the hand is&#xD;
      performed by the same investigator focusing on the sensory loss at the tips of digits 1, 2,&#xD;
      3, or the medial side of digit 4, and weakness or atrophy of the abductor pollicis brevis or&#xD;
      opponens pollicis. Sensation is assessed using pinpricks. Sensory and motor function is&#xD;
      recorded to be either normal or impaired. In patients with bilateral CTS, the most&#xD;
      symptomatic hand will be included. In case both hands are equally symptomatic, the dominant&#xD;
      hand will be included. Recruited patients are asked to complete the Boston Carpal Tunnel&#xD;
      Questionnaire (BCTQ). They will then be allocated to one of the two treatment arms according&#xD;
      to the randomization procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups using sequentially numbered&#xD;
      opaque sealed envelopes (SNOSE). Allocation concealment is maintained before the&#xD;
      randomization procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local injection of steroid is performed by the same investigator after the randomization.&#xD;
      Using a sterile technique, 20mg depomedrol premixed with lidnocaine is injected using a&#xD;
      25-gauge x 5/8&quot; needle. The needle is inserted medially to the palmaris longus tendon at the&#xD;
      distal palmar crease in the wrist at an angle of 45-degree to the forearm. The steroid is&#xD;
      injected at approximately 1cm below the skin. The needle will be repositioned if there is any&#xD;
      resistance to injection, or any pain or paraesthesia in the median nerve territory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minor complications of steroid injection include local pain, bleeding, skin depigmentation,&#xD;
      skin atrophy and digital ischemia. Concerns that nerve or tendon injury may result from&#xD;
      steroid injection appear to be unfounded. In 28 studies of local steroid injection treatment&#xD;
      involving 1981 hands in total there have been no reported instances of such injury,&#xD;
      suggesting that the risk is very low. There is a small risk of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, the hands of the patients in the splinting group are splinted in neutral&#xD;
      position with standard cotton-polyester splint. Patients are encouraged to use the splints&#xD;
      during nighttime whenever possible for 1 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential side effects of splinting include discomfort due to the local pressure and&#xD;
      allergic response to the splint material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is clinical improvement at one month. The Boston Carpal Tunnel&#xD;
      Questionnaire (BCTQ) is used as the measure assessing clinical response. It is a&#xD;
      self-administered disease-specific questionnaire for assessing severity of symptoms and&#xD;
      functional status based on two scales. The symptom severity scale (SSS) is comprised of 11&#xD;
      questions, and the functional status scale (FSS) is comprised of 8 questions. The assessment&#xD;
      of each question is on a scale of 1-5 points, in which 1 indicates no symptom, and 5&#xD;
      indicates severe symptoms. Each scale generates a final score (sum of individual scores&#xD;
      divided by number of items) which ranges from 1 to 5. The evidence base of the psychometric&#xD;
      properties indicates that the BCTQ is a valid, reliable, responsive and acceptable instrument&#xD;
      and should be included as a primary outcome measures in CTS intervention trials. The&#xD;
      questionnaire has Chinese validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are interviewed at one month after randomization. They are asked to complete the&#xD;
      BCTQ and rate the satisfaction of treatment each time. Duration of sick leave for employed&#xD;
      patients, concomitant use of analgesics, and adverse effects are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As all participants have symptoms of CTS and will receive valid active treatments, they&#xD;
      should be motivated and compliant to the protocol. They are encouraged to report to the PI&#xD;
      should there be any problems occurred regarding the splints or any adverse effects developed&#xD;
      in both treatment groups. Appropriate actions will be taken or advices given by the PI. The&#xD;
      subjects in the splinting group are instructed to mark each night that they have worn the&#xD;
      splints on a calendar. Subjects who missed the scheduled follow-up will be contacted and&#xD;
      encouraged to attend the re-scheduled follow-up as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies, the minimum clinically important difference is 0.74 for the BCTQ.&#xD;
      With 90% statistical power, 5% significance level, and two-sided statistical tests, and&#xD;
      assuming a standard deviation of 0.8 for the BCTQ score the study can detect a true&#xD;
      difference of at least 0.74 point on the BCTQ between the two intervention groups when 50&#xD;
      patients are randomized. Version 20.0 of the SPSS statistical package is used. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics are presented as frequencies, means with standard deviation or medians with ranges&#xD;
      as appropriate. Baseline parameters of patient between two treatment groups are compared by&#xD;
      chi-square test for categorical variables, Student's t test for continuous variables with&#xD;
      normal distribution or Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric continuous variables. BCTQ&#xD;
      scores before treatment and at the one, four and twelve weeks after treatment are compared&#xD;
      with paired samples t test. Differences of the BCTQ scores between the two treatment groups&#xD;
      were investigated with independent samples t test. For multi-variate analysis, multiple&#xD;
      linear regression is used to compute the differences of outcome measures between the two&#xD;
      treatment groups, and within the groups before and after the respective treatments with&#xD;
      adjustment for baseline variables. Results are considered statistically significant if the P&#xD;
      value is less than 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial has been approved by the local ethics committee (Kowloon West Cluster Ethical&#xD;
      Committee). The trial will be conducted in full compliance with the Helsinki Declaration and&#xD;
      the Guideline for Good Clinical Practice of the International Conference on Harmonisation of&#xD;
      Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.&#xD;
