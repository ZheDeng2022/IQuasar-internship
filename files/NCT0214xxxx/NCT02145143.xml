  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, a drug called&#xD;
      vemurafenib, either alone or combined with another treatment called radioactive iodine, has&#xD;
      on the patient and thyroid cancer. It is not known if vemurafenib works against thyroid&#xD;
      cancer. This study will test in a small number of patients if it can be used with radioactive&#xD;
      iodine to treat thyroid cancers. This type of study is called a pilot study. If the results&#xD;
      are positive, a larger study with more patients may be done to further test this treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will have lesional dosimetry with 124I PET/CT performed to quantify the baseline iodine avidity of index metastatic lesion(s). Patients will then receive vemurafenib (960 mg orally BID) for about 4 weeks, after which a second 124I PET/CT will be performed. For patients in whom the second 124I PET/CT demonstrates that &gt; or = 2000 cGy can be achieved in at least one tumor with &lt; 300 mCi of 131I, Thyrogen-stimulated standard dosimetry &amp; therapeutic 131I will be performed/administered concurrently with vemurafenib. The drug will then be discontinued &amp; tumor assessments will be conducted with serial radiologic scan(s) &amp; thyroglobulins (scans will be performed at baseline, before 131I, 3-4 months following 131I, &amp; 6 months after 131I). Patients whose tumors fail to demonstrate adequate iodine incorporation following vemurafenib to warrant 131I therapy, the study drug will be discontinued, a final tumor assessment will be performed, &amp; the patient will be taken off the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed thyroid carcinoma of&#xD;
             follicular origin (including papillary, follicular, or poorly differentiated subtypes&#xD;
             and their respective variants).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmation in a CLIA certified laboratory or in an FDA-approved assay that one of&#xD;
             the patient's thyroid tumors (primary tumor, recurrent tumor, or metastasis) possesses&#xD;
             a BRAF mutation at V600.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for&#xD;
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥ 20 mm with conventional&#xD;
             techniques or as ≥ 10 mm with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. See Section&#xD;
             11 for the evaluation of measurable disease. Tumors in previously irradiated fields&#xD;
             may be considered measureable if there is evidence of tumor progression after&#xD;
             radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  RAI-refractory disease on structural imaging, defined as any one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A metastatic lesion that is not radioiodine-avid on a diagnostic radioiodine scan&#xD;
                  performed up to 2 years prior to enrollment in the current study, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A radioiodine-avid metastatic lesion which remained stable in size or progressed&#xD;
                  despite radioiodine treatment 6 months or more prior to entry in the study. There&#xD;
                  are no size limitations for the index lesion used to satisfy this entry&#xD;
                  criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. The presence of at least one fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avid lesion with a SUVmax ≥&#xD;
                  5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No recent treatment for thyroid cancer as defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. No prior 131I therapy is allowed &lt; 6 months prior to initiation of therapy on&#xD;
                  this protocol. A diagnostic study using &lt; 10 mCi of 131I is not considered 131I&#xD;
                  therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. No external beam radiation therapy &lt; 4 weeks prior to initiation of therapy on&#xD;
                  this protocol. (Previous treatment with radiation for any indication is allowed&#xD;
                  if the investigator judges that the previous radiation does not significantly&#xD;
                  compromise patient safety on this protocol.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. No chemotherapy or targeted therapy (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitor) is allowed&#xD;
                  &lt; 4 weeks prior to the initiation of therapy on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (or Karnofsky ≥60%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to swallow and retain orally-administered medication and does not have any&#xD;
             clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such&#xD;
             as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All prior treatment-related toxicities must be CTCAE v4.0 grade ≤ 1 (except alopecia).&#xD;
             Grade 2 prior treatment related toxicities may be allowed after discussion with the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5x109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2x institutional&#xD;
             ULN unless it is related to the primary disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL OR calculated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault formula) ≥&#xD;
             50 mL/min OR 24-hour urine creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to starting the study premenopausal women.&#xD;
             Women of non-childbearing potential may be included without pregnancy test if they are&#xD;
             either surgically sterile or have been postmenopausal for ≥ 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fertile men and women must use an effective method of contraception during treatment&#xD;
             and for at least 6 months after completion of treatment as directed by their&#xD;
             physician. Effective methods of contraception are defined as those which result in a&#xD;
             low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly&#xD;
             (for example implants, injectables, combined oral contraception or intra-uterine&#xD;
             devices). At the discretion of the Investigator, acceptable methods of contraception&#xD;
             may include total abstinence in cases where the lifestyle of the patient ensures&#xD;
             compliance. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
             postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must agree to undergo two research biopsies of a malignant lesion. Patients&#xD;
             may be exempt from biopsy if 1) the investigator or person performing the biopsy&#xD;
             judges that no tumor is accessible for biopsy, 2) the investigator or person&#xD;
             performing the biopsy feels that the biopsy poses too great of a risk to the patient,&#xD;
             or 3) the patient's platelet count is &lt;100,000/mcl or he/she can not be safely removed&#xD;
             from anti-coagulation therapy (if the anti-coagulation therapy needs to be temporarily&#xD;
             held for the biopsy procedure). If the only tumor accessible for biopsy is also the&#xD;
             only lesion that can be used for RECIST v1.1 response evaluation, then the patient may&#xD;
             be exempt from biopsy. The goal will be to have a minimum of 3 patients undergo one or&#xD;
             both of these research biopsies. Accrual may be limited only to subjects whose tumor&#xD;
             is safely accessible for biopsy to ensure the accrual goal for research biopsies&#xD;
             described above is met (e.g., if 7 of 10 patients are accrued without any biopsies&#xD;
             having been obtained, then all subsequent subjects who are registered must qualify for&#xD;
             attempted research biopsy in order to be enrolled.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of archival tumor tissue from the thyroid cancer primary or metastasis (a&#xD;
             tissue block or a minimum of 30 unstained slides would be required. Patients with less&#xD;
             archival tissue available may still be eligible for the study after discussion with&#xD;
             the MSK Principal Investigator.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies within the last 3 years. Exception:&#xD;
             Patients who have been disease-free for 3 years, patients with a history of completely&#xD;
             resected non-melanoma skin cancer, and/or patients with indolent secondary&#xD;
             malignancies, are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of other investigational drugs within 28 days preceding the first dose of&#xD;
             vemurafenib during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastases or spinal cord&#xD;
             compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs&#xD;
             chemically related to vemurafenib or thyrotropin alpha (Thyrogen).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or evidence of cardiovascular risk including any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corrected QT (QTc) interval ≥ 450 msec at baseline or history of congenital long QT&#xD;
             syndrome or uncorrectable electrolyte abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or evidence of current, clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias&#xD;
             (exception: patients with controlled atrial fibrillation for &gt; 30 days prior to the&#xD;
             initiation of therapy on this protocol are eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of acute coronary syndromes (specifically, myocardial infarction and unstable&#xD;
             angina), severe/unstable angina, coronary angioplasty, or stenting within 6 months&#xD;
             prior to the initiation of therapy on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of symptomatic congestive heart failure within 6 months prior to the&#xD;
             initiation of therapy on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cerebrovascular attack or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior&#xD;
             to the initiation of therapy on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant, lactating, or breast feeding women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to follow a low iodine diet or requiring medication with high content&#xD;
             in iodide (amiodarone).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received iodinated intravenous contrast as part of a radiographic&#xD;
             procedure within 3 months of study registration. Those that have had iodinated&#xD;
             intravenous contrast within this time frame may still be eligible if a urinary iodine&#xD;
             analysis reveals that the excess iodine has been adequately cleared after the last&#xD;
             intravenous contrast administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with study and follow-up procedures.&#xD;
