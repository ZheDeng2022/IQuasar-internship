    <textblock>
      Female sex workers (FSWs) in India are at high risk of HIV infection, and while correct and&#xD;
      consistent condom use is an effective means of preventing HIV transmission, many FSWs have&#xD;
      difficulty insisting on their use. Alternative HIV prevention options are needed for FSWs who&#xD;
      are unable to correctly and consistently use condoms with their clients or regular partners.&#xD;
      Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be an important tool to fill this critical&#xD;
      prevention gap, and a demonstration project is required to assess the impact and feasibility&#xD;
      of the use of PrEP as an HIV prevention intervention among most at risk FSWs in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project will take place at two sites in India and will assess the use of a risk&#xD;
      assessment tool to identify FSWs who would most benefit from PrEP, collect information about&#xD;
      the reasons why FSWs choose to accept or decline PrEP, evaluate two different PrEP delivery&#xD;
      strategies (weekly clinic pick-up or home delivery by peer educators every second day),&#xD;
      monitor adherence to and discontinuation of PrEP, and evaluate unintended consequences of the&#xD;
      use of PrEP in these communities (e.g. reduction of condom use, drug side effects or adverse&#xD;
      events, social harms or resistance). To ensure the safety of study participants, a community&#xD;
      advisory board will be set up and will meet regularly to inform study staff of any concerns&#xD;
      that the community may have related to the study, so that the study staff can respond in a&#xD;
      timely manner. A data safety and monitoring board will also be established to monitor&#xD;
      participant safety.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This PrEP demonstration study is designed to assess the feasibility and impact of delivering&#xD;
      PrEP in addition to the existing package of HIV prevention interventions available to female&#xD;
      sex workers in India. The study aims to: 1) identify female sex workers in need of HIV&#xD;
      prevention and willing to take PrEP; 2) evaluate sustained uptake and adherence to oral PrEP;&#xD;
      3) assess safe delivery of PrEP; and 4) demonstrate effective delivery of PrEP within the&#xD;
      context of the National Program of Targeted Interventions. The study will be implemented in&#xD;
      two regions and among two typologies of female sex workers in India: brothel-based FSWs in&#xD;
      Kolkata and FSWs operating from different settings in Mysore and Mandya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome 1: Identification of female sex workers in need of HIV prevention and willing to take&#xD;
      oral PrEP For optimal delivery with limited resources, it is critical to provide HIV&#xD;
      prevention strategies such as PrEP to populations at greatest risk of infection. Female sex&#xD;
      workers are an important population for HIV prevention in India, prioritized as a &quot;core high&#xD;
      risk group&quot; for targeted interventions by the India National AIDS Control Organization (NACO)&#xD;
      (NACO 2013 annual report). In particular, some FSWs report inconsistent condom use and have&#xD;
      unmet needs for HIV prevention (Ramesh, 2010; Reza-Paul, 2008). For example, these women may&#xD;
      be less empowered or able to consistently demand condom use by their clients or may wish to&#xD;
      become pregnant. PrEP has the potential to be an additional, more acceptable and effective&#xD;
      HIV prevention method for female sex workers who have difficulty using condoms consistently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes the development and use of a risk screening tool to identify female sex&#xD;
      workers who are most vulnerable to HIV. This tool will guide recruitment into the&#xD;
      demonstration study and could later assist health providers in deciding who will benefit most&#xD;
      from PrEP for HIV prevention. In addition, this study will assess the proportion of FSWs&#xD;
      identified by the risk screening tool who are willing to take PrEP. Quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative evaluations will identify factors related to the decision to initiate PrEP as&#xD;
      well as reasons why FSWs decline PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome 2: Sustained uptake and adherence to oral PrEP among female sex workers Similar to&#xD;
      all medications, sustained uptake and adherence to PrEP is fundamental for efficacy in&#xD;
      preventing HIV acquisition. In the four clinical trials of oral PrEP that demonstrated&#xD;
      efficacy, study participants with high adherence had the greatest protection from HIV (Baeten&#xD;
      2012, Choopanya 2013, Grant 2010, Thigpen 2012). Likewise, across PrEP trials, there was a&#xD;
      clear relationship between higher efficacy and a greater proportion of participants with&#xD;
      study drug detectable in their blood. Two randomized clinical trials of daily oral PrEP among&#xD;
      heterosexual women in Africa found no efficacy for HIV prevention; poor adherence to PrEP&#xD;
      most likely explains these results (Marrazzo 2013, Van Damme 2012). For example, drug level&#xD;
      testing in the FEM-PrEP Study found that less than 40% of a random sample of HIV negative&#xD;
      women in the PrEP arm of the study had detectable levels of PrEP in their blood (Van Damme&#xD;
      2012). Analyses of high-risk subgroups of study participants in the Partners PrEP Study found&#xD;
      PrEP efficacy estimates ranged from 64 to 84%, showing consistently high efficacy of PrEP in&#xD;
      preventing HIV across various higher risk groups, including women (Murnane 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary community awareness campaigns for PrEP among female sex workers in Kolkata found&#xD;
      high interest in PrEP - approximately 80% reported willingness to take daily, oral PrEP. Sex&#xD;
      workers in Mysore-Mandya are engaged in series of consultations where information related to&#xD;
      PrEP as a tool for combination prevention is being discussed and questions or concerns&#xD;
      related to PrEP addressed. In both places, initial observations show that there are some sex&#xD;
      workers (e.g. those who are on long time contracts, those with overnight clients where&#xD;
      sometimes the number of clients are not disclosed, those who want to be pregnant, and those&#xD;
      who do not use condoms with their regular partners) expressed interest in being part of the&#xD;
      demonstration project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This PrEP demonstration study will assess the acceptability and feasibility of two approaches&#xD;
      to PrEP delivery: 1) peer educator delivery every other day; or 2) weekly clinic pick-up.&#xD;
      Study staff will measure PrEP initiation, adherence and discontinuation. They will record&#xD;
      these events in participant records, and quarterly visits will be used to assess adherence&#xD;
      through biological tests and questionnaires. PrEP will be delivered as part of a package of&#xD;
      HIV prevention services, and therefore use of other prevention strategies, such as condom&#xD;
      use, will also be monitored. The full package of prevention services will continue to be&#xD;
      provided to FSWs with the support of India's national government and in accordance with&#xD;
      national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on drug adherence and condom use will be collected through various means. An&#xD;
      ethnographic study will be designed to understand factors that may promote or impede&#xD;
      adherence to PrEP, as well as changes in risk behaviour (reduction in condom use). In&#xD;
      addition to this, peer educators will use a pictorial tool to document these items (e.g.,&#xD;
      frequency and patterns of sexual activity, condom use, and PrEP use). The study will also&#xD;
      include a biological measure of PrEP adherence through the assessment of drug-levels in the&#xD;
      blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular counselling about HIV prevention and PrEP will be provided to study participants to&#xD;
      promote adherence. In a sub-sample of study participants, an electronic adherence monitoring&#xD;
      device to measure and promote adherence, Helping Hands, will be tested (De Blaser 2010). The&#xD;
      Helping Hands device is complimented by a web platform that illustrates patient-specific data&#xD;
      to monitor dosing history and adherence patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome 3: Oral HIV PrEP as part of a combined prevention package delivered safely for female&#xD;
      sex workers Four randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that daily, oral PrEP is safe&#xD;
      for HIV-uninfected women in a wide range of settings; these antiretrovirals have been proven&#xD;
      safe for HIV-infected women for many years of use. The most common side effects of FTC/TDF&#xD;
      are minor and short-lived (i.e. first several weeks). This study will provide evidence for&#xD;
      the safe delivery of oral PrEP to female sex workers in brothel and street-based settings in&#xD;
      India. Quarterly clinic visits will assess physical health, side effects, adverse events and&#xD;
      any other social harms or concerns with PrEP use. This study will invest in continuous&#xD;
      engagement with communities of female sex workers according to good participatory practice&#xD;
      guidelines to provide correct information about PrEP, keep communities continuously engaged,&#xD;
      and maintain adherence to PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A community advisory board (CAB) and a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be set&#xD;
      up. The CAB will meet monthly and on an as needed basis. It will inform study staff of any&#xD;
      concerns that the community may have related to the study, so that the study staff can&#xD;
      respond in a timely manner. The CAB members will be close to the community and will be able&#xD;
      to respond to community concerns by calling meetings to address issues in a timely manner.&#xD;
      The DSMB will be set up to ensure that the rights of the study participants are safeguarded&#xD;
      in a transparent fashion, and to monitor their safety by scrutinizing any adverse events. The&#xD;
      DSMB will also help to respond to concerns raised by the CAB. The DSMB will include an&#xD;
      ethicist, a human rights lawyer, representatives from University of Manitoba, WHO and UNAIDS,&#xD;
      representatives from the global network of sex workers, and a statistician. In addition,&#xD;
      ongoing qualitative research and monitoring by research staff, as well as outreach by peer&#xD;
      educators, will attempt to identify any community resistance, rumours or actual harms, and&#xD;
      respond in an appropriate manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome 4: Effective delivery of oral HIV PrEP demonstrated in context of National Program of&#xD;
      Targeted Interventions This study proposes to deliver PrEP within the context of the National&#xD;
      Program of Targeted Interventions in order to demonstrate that PrEP is feasible in &quot;real&#xD;
      world&quot; settings. DMSC and Ashodaya currently implement targeted intervention programs for&#xD;
      female sex workers in Kolkata and Mysore/Mandya, respectively. These programs provide&#xD;
      outreach by peer educators and outreach workers, clinic services (e.g. HIV testing and&#xD;
      counseling, STI screening and treatment), and referrals for HIV care and treatment for&#xD;
      brothel- and street-based FSWs. This study will evaluate the addition of PrEP to this&#xD;
      existing service delivery model. It will also show willingness of participants to enroll in a&#xD;
      demonstration study and to use oral PrEP without reimbursements or incentives for&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study findings can inform national and local government's decision to adopt PrEP as a new HIV&#xD;
      prevention strategy. Development of HIV prevention packages, provider training, quality&#xD;
      management and service delivery guidelines in line with national systems will provide&#xD;
      guidance for real life implementation of PrEP, and also contribute to the larger goal of&#xD;
      providing standards for the delivery of HIV prevention interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Mitigation Identification of willing participants: The development of a tool to&#xD;
      correctly identify those FSWs at continued risk of HIV infection does not ensure that those&#xD;
      women will be willing to take PrEP. Though initial interest in PrEP is strong in Sonagachi&#xD;
      among FSWs in general, women at highest risk may be different. A feasibility study to&#xD;
      identify levels of awareness about PrEP, perceptions and misconceptions about PrEP, and&#xD;
      optimum ways to present PrEP accurately to identify those women at greatest need with&#xD;
      greatest interest in using PrEP is about to begin in Mysore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research ethics: All study materials will be submitted for approval by the institutional&#xD;
      review boards of Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC) Ethical Committee, the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) Ethics Review Committee (ERC), the University of Manitoba (UM) Health&#xD;
      Research Ethics Board (HREB), and by the Indian Council on Medical Research (ICMR) through&#xD;
      the Health Ministry's Screening Committee (HMSC). The procedures, risks, and benefits of&#xD;
      study participation will be explained to all potential study participants and informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from those who are willing to participate prior to their&#xD;
      participation in the study. The project will follow all guidelines for human subjects&#xD;
      research as mandated by the Government of India, as this is the location of the proposed&#xD;
      project. In addition to this, a Data Safety and Monitoring Board will be established at&#xD;
      Ashodaya to monitor the safety of participants and the scientific integrity of the study&#xD;
      across all study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community advisory board (CAB): A community advisory board will be set up in each study site,&#xD;
      and will meet regularly to inform study staff and the DSMB of any concerns that the community&#xD;
      may have related to the study, so that the study staff can respond in a timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB): A DSMB will be established to ensure that the rights&#xD;
      of all study participants from each site, Ashodaya and DMSC, are safeguarded, and to monitor&#xD;
      their safety by scrutinizing any adverse events. They will also respond to concerns raised by&#xD;
      the CABs from each site. The DSMB will include an ethicist, a human rights lawyer,&#xD;
      representatives from the University of Manitoba, WHO and UNAIDS, representatives from the&#xD;
      global network of sex workers, and a statistician.&#xD;
