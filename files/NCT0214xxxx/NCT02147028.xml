    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether sparing the hippocampi during whole brain&#xD;
      radiotherapy following neurosurgery or stereotactic radiosurgery in patients with brain&#xD;
      metastases from a systemic tumour helps preserve brain function.&#xD;

             doses,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease specific graded prognostic assessment (DS-GPA) score ≤ 1.0 for any of the&#xD;
