    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is a major public health problem in our country. Among the causes of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases are High Blood Pressure (HBP) and Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (DM2) is associated with a twofold risk of cardiovascular disease, and endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction is an early marker of vascular complications. There is evidence of action of&#xD;
      glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) on endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle. Vildagliptin&#xD;
      is a drug used in the treatment of DM2 able to prolong the activity of GLP-1, improving&#xD;
      glycemic control and endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To evaluate the effect of vildagliptin on endothelial function in patients with&#xD;
      DM2 and hypertension using the Endo-PAT 2000 device.&#xD;

      Material and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Population Subjects will be selected according these inclusion criteria: aged above 35&#xD;
           years, history of type 2 diabetes and mild hypertension (blood pressure &lt; 160 X 100&#xD;
           mmHg) no longer than 15 years, body mass index &lt; 35 Kg/m2, and glycated hemoglobin&#xD;
           (HbA1c) between 7,0 e 10,5%. Exclusion criteria are: smoking within the last six months,&#xD;
           pregnancy or breastfeeding; creatinine clearance &lt; 45 ml/min/m2 (MDRD); use of NPH&#xD;
           (neutral protamine Hagedorn) or/and regular insulin, pioglitazone, GLP-1 receptor&#xD;
           agonist, DPP-4 inhibitor or acarbose; a serum alanine aminotransferase or aspartate&#xD;
           aminotransferase level of more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range;&#xD;
           subjects with ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, other atherosclerotic&#xD;
           disease, cancer, or heart failure in functional classes II, III and IV; stress test with&#xD;
           typical chest pain or with ST segment depression ≥ 1 mm, with horizontal or descendent&#xD;
           and duration of 0.08 seconds after the J point; use of 3 or more anti hypertensive&#xD;
           drugs, which characterizes a resistance hypertension; intolerance to metformin, and&#xD;
           inability to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Sample size To calculate the number of patients we used the site:&#xD;
           www.lei.dante.br-pesquisa. The sample will be composed of 25 patients in each arm. The&#xD;
           number of patients per group necessary to detect a difference in reactive hyperemia&#xD;
           index (RHI) of 0.3 with a power of 80% is 25 patients. And with a two-tailed t test at&#xD;
           the 5% level it was calculated to be 21, with SD of 0.35 for the difference in RHI. The&#xD;
           RHI improvement by 0.3 was based on previous study and a drop out rate of 20% was&#xD;
           considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fifty diabetic and hypertensive patients will be randomized at first visit, submitted to&#xD;
           endothelial function testing by the Endo-PAT 2000 device, and divided into 2 groups:&#xD;
           group 1 will receive vildagliptin (100 mg/day, divided in 2 times) added-on to metformin&#xD;
           (500 to 2550 mg/day, according to glycemic control) and group 2 will receive&#xD;
           glibenclamide (5 to 20 mg/day, according to glycemic control) added-on to metformin.&#xD;
           Blood samples will be collected after 12-hour overnight fast at screening visit and 12&#xD;
           weeks after treatment with vildagliptin (group 1) and glibenclamide (group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           At screening, renin angiotensin system blockers will be added for all subjects, and&#xD;
           other antihypertensive drugs will be maintained. All patients will give informed consent&#xD;
           after the study be approved by the local Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Blood Pressure The blood pressure (BP) measurement technique will be made according&#xD;
           VI Brazilian Guidelines to Hypertension Treatment: 1) measurements were taken with a&#xD;
           recently calibrated aneroid sphygmomanometer known to be accurate; 2) the cuff was&#xD;
           placed so that the lower edge was 3 cm above the elbow crease and the bladder was&#xD;
           centered over the brachial artery; 3) a standard bladder was used (12-13 cm long and 35&#xD;
           cm wide), but a larger and a smaller bladder were available for thicker and thinner&#xD;
           arms, respectively; 4) the arm was bare and supported with the blood pressure cuff&#xD;
           positioned at heart level; 5) the mean of three BP measurements taken in the sitting&#xD;
           position after 5 to 10 minutes of rest was used; 6) phase I and V (disappearance)&#xD;
           Korotkoff sounds were used to identify systolic and diastolic BP, respectively; 7) the&#xD;
           pressure was increased rapidly to 30 mmHg above the level at which the radial pulse was&#xD;
           extinguished; 8) a cuff deflation rate of 2 mmHg per beat was used; 9) a minimum of&#xD;
           1-minute intervals were recommended between readings to avoid venous congestion; 10) BP&#xD;
           was measured in both arms to detect possible differences due to peripheral vascular&#xD;
           disease; in this case, the higher value was taken as the reference one. Hypertension is&#xD;
           defined as systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg or current use of&#xD;
           anti-hypertensive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Anthropometric Measure Weight and height will be measured by anthropometric scale&#xD;
           and body mass index (BMI) will obtained by the formula: BMI = weight (Kg) / (height in&#xD;
           meters)2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4 Randomisation A computer-generated randomisation list will be delivered by the&#xD;
           Research Center of the glibenclamide/vildagliptin group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Laboratory Blood sample will be drawn after 12 hours fast to measure triglycerides,&#xD;
           total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol, glycemia, serum creatinine, ultrasensitive&#xD;
           reactive C protein (RCP), Alanine aminotransferase and HbA1c. Microalbuminuria also will&#xD;
           be evaluated. Diabetic subjects will be identified by history of diabetes with dietetic&#xD;
           treatment for diabetes or in use of hypoglycemic drugs. Subjects will be considered&#xD;
           diabetic after 2 fasting glucose more than 125 mg/dl, according with National Diabetes&#xD;
           Data Group. Serum cholesterol will be evaluated according Brazilian Guideline of&#xD;
           Dyslipidemia. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) will be calculated by the&#xD;
           Friedewald formula for triglycerides (TG) levels below 400 mg/dL ( LDLc = TC - HDLc -&#xD;
           TG/5 (para TG &lt; 400 mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Total Cholesterol (TC); high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treadmill test At screening visit all selected subjects will be submitted for coronary&#xD;
           disease evaluation by stress test. Subjects with stress test with typical chest pain or&#xD;
           with ST segment depression ≥ 1 mm, with horizontal or descendent and duration of 0.08&#xD;
           seconds after the J point will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Endothelium function Pulse amplitude tonometry (Endo-PAT 2000; Itamar Medical, Caesarea,&#xD;
           Israel) is a peripheral endothelium function test, a non-invasive determination of&#xD;
           digital endothelium function. This test will be performed following a light breakfast in&#xD;
           the morning after 20 min rest and with the patient in a supine position. The PAT device&#xD;
           is placed on the tip of each index finger and comprises a pneumatic pletysmography that&#xD;
           applies a uniform pressure to the surface of the distal finger, allowing measurement of&#xD;
           pulse volume changes. The inflation pressure of the digital device is electronically set&#xD;
           to 10 mmHg below diastolic blood pressure or 70 mmHg. The PAT signal is recorded at&#xD;
           baseline and following 5 min arterial occlusion using a inflatable cuff, while the&#xD;
           contralateral arm serves as a control. The blood pressure cuff is inflated to 60 mmHg&#xD;
           higher than systolic pressure or at least 200 mmHg for 5 min. Lack of residual&#xD;
           pulsatility is monitored throughout the occlusion period. The post-occlusive hyperemia&#xD;
           stimulates endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, causing an increase in digital pulse&#xD;
           amplitude. Pulse amplitude is recorded electronically in both fingers and analysed by a&#xD;
           computerised, automated algorithm (Itamar Medical). The change from the baseline&#xD;
           measurement is expressed as the reactive hyperemia index (RHI), which in part reflects&#xD;
           vasodilator function of the digital microcirculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will be instructed to fast starting the night before testing and to refrain&#xD;
           from ingesting alcohol or caffeine. Room temperature will be maintained at all time&#xD;
           during the study between 21º C and 24° C; restrictive clothing that could interfere with&#xD;
           blood flow to the arms, watches or rings or other jewellery on the hands will be&#xD;
           removed. The patient will be comfortably seated or allowed to lie down in the study room&#xD;
           for at least 15 min to reach a relaxed cardiovascular steady-state.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The subjects for the study will be submitted to the endothelium function test at first&#xD;
           visit and 12 weeks after treatment. Endothelial dysfunction is defined as 2.34±0.33 less&#xD;
           than 2 standard deviations (SD) of 20 healthy asymptomatic control individuals without&#xD;
           history of cardiovascular disease and without major risk factors, corresponding to RHI ≤&#xD;
           1,6837.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Central Arterial Pressure The applanation tonometry from the radial artery is a&#xD;
           non-invasive method assessing arterial stiffness, which is predictive of vascular&#xD;
           disease. A portion of the artery pressure wave travelling towards the extremities is&#xD;
           reflected back from peripheral impedance points. In healthy individuals, the reflected&#xD;
           wave returns to the aorta during diastole. When arteries become stiff, the transit time&#xD;
           for de incident and reflected waves is reduced. Thus, the reflected wave returns to the&#xD;
           aorta during systole of the same cardiac cycle augmenting the central blood pressures.&#xD;
           This augmenting of central pressure can be quantified by augmentation index (AIx). AIx&#xD;
           has been associated with cardiovascular risk, predicts the presence or absence of&#xD;
           coronary artery disease40. Higher values of AIx indicate increased wave reflection from&#xD;
           periphery or earlier return of the reflected wave as a result of increased pulse&#xD;
           velocity, which can be contributed to an increased arterial stiffness. In young healthy&#xD;
           individuals, the systolic arterial pressure (aortic) is about 20 mmHg less than the&#xD;
           peripheral systolic pressure (brachial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The applanation tonometry from the radial artery will be performed in the randomised subjects&#xD;
      at the first visit and 12 weeks after the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The continuous variables will be analyzed using the Student's t-test and&#xD;
      analysis of variance (ANOVA). Data will be presented as mean ± 1 SD for continuous variables&#xD;
      and as frequencies for categorical variables. The chi-squared test will be utilized for the&#xD;
      comparative study between the groups in use of vildagliptin with those in use of&#xD;
      glibenclamide. Logistical regression will be performed for associations with statistical&#xD;
      significance. An alpha error of 5% was considered acceptable giving significance with&#xD;
      p-value&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacovigilance requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any serious adverse events will be reported to the Ethics Committee of the FAMERP within 24&#xD;
      hours of the occurrence. All serious adverse events will also be reported to Novartis Drug&#xD;
      Safety &amp; Epidemiology (DS&amp;E) within 24 hours of the investigator (or designee) being aware of&#xD;
      the serious adverse event. Specific definitions of adverse events, and serious adverse&#xD;
      events, are outlined below, along with reporting criteria required by Novartis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AE) Information about all AEs, whether volunteered by the patient, discovered&#xD;
      by investigator questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or&#xD;
      other means, will be collected and recorded on an Adverse Event Case Report Form and will be&#xD;
      followed up as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An AE is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occurring after starting study&#xD;
      treatment, even if the event is not considered to be treatment-related. Study treatment&#xD;
      includes the study medication under evaluation, and any reference or placebo drug (or&#xD;
      therapy) given during any phase of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study treatment will only be considered&#xD;
      adverse events if they worsen after starting study treatment (any procedures specified in the&#xD;
      protocol). Adverse events (but not serious adverse events) occurring before starting study&#xD;
      treatment but after signing the informed consent form will be recorded on the Medical&#xD;
      History/Current Medical Conditions Case Report Form. Abnormal laboratory values or test&#xD;
      results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are&#xD;
      considered clinically significant or require therapy, and are recorded on the Adverse Events&#xD;
      Case Report Form under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As far as possible, each adverse event will also be described by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. its duration (start and end dates),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the severity grade (mild, moderate, severe),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. its relationship to the study drug (suspected / not suspected),&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the action(s) taken.&#xD;
