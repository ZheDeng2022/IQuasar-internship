  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of liraglutide on the memory and&#xD;
      attention of people with insulin resistance. Liraglutide is a medication that makes the body&#xD;
      more sensitive to insulin, and therefore may allow it to manage sugar more effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are looking specifically at a region of the brain that is associated with&#xD;
      memory and attention, called the hippocampus, in order to see whether treatment this&#xD;
      treatment will change performance on memory and attention tasks. The investigators are also&#xD;
      taking an MRI of the brain to see whether there are changes to the size and shape of the&#xD;
      hippocampus after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects in this study will be 50-70 years old and have pre- diabetes. Half of all&#xD;
      subjects will have a family history of dementia, while the other half will not.&#xD;

      Data from this study will be used to measure changes in hippocampal morphology, functional&#xD;
      alterations in the hippocampus during a paired associative memory task, functional&#xD;
      connectivity during rest, and neuropsychological performance on hippocampally-mediated&#xD;
      cognitive tasks, following double-blind treatment with liraglutide and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Subjects receive liraglutide will show significant differences in&#xD;
      hippocampal morphology, functional activation and connectivity, and neuropsychological&#xD;
      performance, compared to subjects receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: To test for potential interactions between modifiable (IR/prediabetes) and&#xD;
      non-modifiable (FamHxAD, APOE 4) risk factors with respect to morphological, functional, and&#xD;
      neuropshchological changes during double-blind liraglutide treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be explained to the participant and informed consent obtained. Participant&#xD;
      will also be asked whether or not they consent to being videotaped during the study, and if&#xD;
      they do, parts of their study participation may be videotaped for staff training purposes.&#xD;
      Participants will continue any current psychiatric medication(s) or psychotherapy during the&#xD;
      duration of the study (eg. no changes will be made to currently received treatments).&#xD;
      Psychiatric Assessment - This will consist of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Interview(MINI), the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), and the Mini Mental&#xD;
      Status Examination (MMSE). The MINI interview takes approximately 20-30 minutes depending on&#xD;
      the individual presentation and has screening and skip-out questions that allow for rapid&#xD;
      assessment of psychiatric history, current or in remission, to ensure screen-out for&#xD;
      psychiatric exclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HDRS-17 will be used to screen out current depression, as characterized by a score of &gt;&#xD;
      8. Administration of the HDRS will be repeated during and at the end of double-blind&#xD;
      treatment. The MMSE, a brief measure of cognitive functioning that assesses arithmetic,&#xD;
      memory and orientation, will screen out current cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Examination and Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A general physical examination will be conducted at baseline and at the end of treatment.&#xD;
      Vital signs (e.g. blood pressure, pulse, temperature, body weight) will be assessed at each&#xD;
      in-person study visit. Individual energy (in kilocalories) expenditure per day will be&#xD;
      assessed using self-report questionnaires (Stanford 7-Day Physical Activity Recall Scale and&#xD;
      the Food Frequency Questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, subjects will complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Memory Function&#xD;
      Questionnaire (to assess subjective cognitive complaints) baseline and final visit, as well&#xD;
      as report on the frequency of any alcohol or nicotine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of this information will be used to adjust for differences in the experimental variables&#xD;
      between the two experimental groups both at baseline and over the course of double-blind&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): After an overnight fast, subjects will be given a oral&#xD;
      glucose challenge, wherein plasma glucose concentrations will be measured at baseline,&#xD;
      T30min, T60min, T90min, and T120min after 75gm oral glucose load. Individuals with fasting&#xD;
      glucose of 100-125 mg/dl and/or a 2-hour glucose of 140-199 mg/dL and less than 200 mg/dL&#xD;
      will be eligible for study enrollment. OGTT will be repeated at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Cortisol Swabs: The participants will be asked to take oral cortisol measures for 3 days&#xD;
      at waking, 30 minutes after waking and at 9pm. These measures will be taken at baseline and&#xD;
      final follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotyping for APOE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject consents to the collection of a buffy coat sample, this will be done during&#xD;
      the collection of blood for the blood screening tests. The amount of blood required for the&#xD;
      buffy coat sample is approximately 2-3 teaspoons. The subject will have the right to withdraw&#xD;
      consent for this test now or at any time and this will not affect his or her ability to&#xD;
      participate in the research study. The sample will be stored in a minus 80 freezer for as&#xD;
      long as, but not limited to 5 years. We will not use this sample for any other purpose&#xD;
      without the subject's specific permission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic analysis will be conducted by experienced laboratory technicians under the&#xD;
      supervision of Dr. Joachim Hallmayer. Blood for genotyping (approximately 6ccs) will be drawn&#xD;
      at the time of eligibility screening, after informed consent. Genotype results will not be&#xD;
      released to participants. Blood samples will be labeled with a unique subject identifier&#xD;
      known only to the PI's research staff. Genotyping for APOE will be the primary genetic&#xD;
      analysis and will be performed according to the restriction isotyping protocol of Hixson and&#xD;
      Vernier. Two observers blind to clinical status of the individuals will carry out assignment&#xD;
      of genotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structural and Functional MRI: Scans will be acquired on a 3.0T GE magnet at baseline and&#xD;
      upon 12-week follow-up at the Stanford Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging&#xD;
      (CNI). Both structural and functional brain imaging will be conducted, and total scan time&#xD;
      will be 1 hour. All scans will be examined by a neuroradiologist to detect the presence of&#xD;
      unanticipated structural lesions, including tumors, infarcts, and other abnormalities or&#xD;
      signs of vascular injury. Data from subjects with abnormalities will be excluded from further&#xD;
      analysis and they will be contacted and referred for a clinical scan. We expect less than 10%&#xD;
      of scans to be excluded on this basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Testing: Cognitive testing will be conducted on all subjects at baseline and at&#xD;
      12-week follow-up. The battery includes measures that we expect to be sensitive to subtle&#xD;
      changes in cognitive function, as well as instruments that appear to have value in&#xD;
      prospectively identifying individuals at risk for cognitive decline and/or dementia.&#xD;
      Specifically, measures of working memory, memory recall, verbal fluency, executive function,&#xD;
      and motor function will be used to detect early functional cognitive changes commonly seen in&#xD;
      MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following battery of tests will take approximately 90 minutes (at both baseline and&#xD;
      12-week follow-up) to complete and will be administered during the afternoon to avoid diurnal&#xD;
      effects: Auditory Consonant Trigrams; Benton Visual Retention Test 5th Edition, Boston Naming&#xD;
      Test, Buschke-Fuld Selective Reminding Test, Delis Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS),&#xD;
      Color-Word subtest, DKEFS Tower Test, DKEFS Trail Making Test, DKEFS Verbal Fluency subtest,&#xD;
      Purdue Pegboard, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, Taylor Complex Figure Task, Wechsler&#xD;
      Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-3rd Edition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-Blind Intervention: Following completion of the baseline assessments, volunteers will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to one of two 12- week interventions; double-blind placebo injection or&#xD;
      liraglutide for 12 weeks. Subjects will be started on a subcutaneous morning dose of 0.6 mg,&#xD;
      and this will be titrated to 1.2 mg after one week, and then titrated to 1.8 mg after one&#xD;
      week and they will remain on this dose for the duration of the study (see Table 1). Subjects&#xD;
      will be thoroughly instructed on how to self-administer the subcutaneous injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any subject who cannot tolerate the highest dose, 1.8 mg due to side effects will be allowed&#xD;
      to return to the 1.2 mg for the duration of the study. This dosing schedule is based on&#xD;
      evidence that even the lowest dose has been shown to improve glycemic control in patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes, whereas the higher amounts have been used in studies in which estimates&#xD;
      have been made of both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have weekly phone visits with the clinical research coordinator during the&#xD;
      first month, and then every two weeks for the remainder of the intervention. These calls will&#xD;
      include an adverse events assessment. This assessment will be provided to the study's&#xD;
      investigator and endocrinologist, Dr. Sun Kim, in order to determine patient dose. We will&#xD;
      follow up on dose changes with patients within 48 hours to discuss these changes with them.&#xD;
      Dr. Kim will meet with the patient if additional follow up on dosing is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 12 weeks of treatment, all baseline evaluations will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anyone dropped from the study will not be replaced. All subjects will be unblinded upon&#xD;
      completion of treatment or drop-out from the study. Open label treatment will not be offered.&#xD;
