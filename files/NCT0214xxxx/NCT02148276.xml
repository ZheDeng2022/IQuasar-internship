    <textblock>
      This two-phased project will develop a comprehensive, audio computer assisted&#xD;
      self-administered interview social harm questionnaire (ACASI-SHQ) that will allow researchers&#xD;
      to more easily identify and monitor social harms experienced by substance abusers&#xD;
      participating in HIV-related trials. The ACASI-SHQ will (1) reduce the likelihood of socially&#xD;
      desirable responding, (2) include items with high levels of specificity to increase the&#xD;
      likelihood of identifying social harms (construct validity), and (3) utilize a self-interview&#xD;
      format that will increase the likelihood of its adoption by HIV researchers. The&#xD;
      investigators will then evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary utility and&#xD;
      construct validity in an ongoing HIV-related trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most clinical trials do not regularly monitor for negative social harms experienced by&#xD;
      participants in any systematic way. Participation in HIV trials often places participants at&#xD;
      a heightened risk of oppression, discrimination, and victimization. These risks may be&#xD;
      compounded when participants are substance abusers. Although foreseen risks are generally&#xD;
      outlined in the consent form and monitored throughout the study, many social harms are&#xD;
      unforeseen and, consequently, are not discussed or monitored. Without systematic monitoring,&#xD;
      the majority of social harms likely go undetected. Recognizing the high level of social harm&#xD;
      that may arise as a result of participation in HIV vaccine trials, several National Institute&#xD;
      of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)-sponsored groups began to incorporate general&#xD;
      assessments to measure the social impact of research participation in HIV vaccine trials.&#xD;
      Although this has provided a preliminary model for monitoring social harms in clinical&#xD;
      research, the assessments have several shortcomings that limit their reliability, validity,&#xD;
      and utility. In general, they are administered in an interview format that may be cumbersome&#xD;
      to the research team. Furthermore, participants may feel uncomfortable or reluctant to report&#xD;
      social harms directly to the interviewer, resulting in inaccuracies or underreporting of&#xD;
      negative events. Interview items generally address large classes of behavior rather than&#xD;
      specific behaviors, reducing the sensitivity and construct validity of the assessments, and&#xD;
      questions used across agencies are not standardized. Finally, these assessments do not&#xD;
      include harms specific to substance use, a major risk factor for HIV/AIDS transmission. The&#xD;
      two-phased project aims to improve the collection of social harms among HIV trial&#xD;
      participants by developing a comprehensive, audio computer assisted self-administered&#xD;
      interview social harm questionnaire (ACASI-SHQ) that will allow researchers to more easily&#xD;
      identify and monitor social harms experienced by substance abusers participating in HIV&#xD;
      trials. The proposed study will proceed in two phases. In Phase 1, the investigators will&#xD;
      develop the ACASI Social Harm Questionnaire (SHQ). In Phase 2, the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      a controlled study to evaluate its acceptability, feasibility, and utility and construct&#xD;
      validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase 1 the investigators will first conduct a systematic literature review to&#xD;
      identify existing tools that researchers currently use to measure social harm or impact&#xD;
      experienced by research participants. In addition, the investigators will survey 100&#xD;
      researchers who are currently conducting National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded&#xD;
      HIV-related trials involving substance abusers. The sample will be randomly selected from a&#xD;
      pool of researchers meeting this criterion identified through the NIH RePORTER database. The&#xD;
      brief telephone survey will include questions about methods used to collect data on social&#xD;
      harm including specific questions asked, mode of administration, frequency of assessment,&#xD;
      perceived ease of data collection, and concerns related to the assessment. During this phase&#xD;
      the investigators will also conduct a focus group with 10 former research participants to&#xD;
      gather information about their experiences and perceptions of social harm in HIV-related&#xD;
      research trials. The research team in collaboration with a multidisciplinary panel of experts&#xD;
      will draft a beta-version of the SHQ content and format. The expert panel will also assist in&#xD;
      identifying an optimal trial in which to test the finalized instrument in the second phase of&#xD;
      the study. Finally, the investigators will conduct a protocol analysis of the beta-version&#xD;
      through interviews with 20 individuals who are currently enrolled in an ongoing National&#xD;
      Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA)-funded HIV prevention trial being conducted by the&#xD;
      investigators. This is intended to ensure that items are correctly and similarly understood&#xD;
      by subjects, and to provide insight into better methods of phrasing or structuring questions&#xD;
      and response options to properly convey their meaning. Upon completion of the protocol&#xD;
      analysis, the revised instrument will be finalized by the investigators, programmed into the&#xD;
      ACASI format, beta-tested by the research team, and critically reviewed by our expert panel&#xD;
      before the final programming of the ACASI-SHQ is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase 2, we will conduct a pilot study to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and&#xD;
      utility and construct validity of the ACASI-SHQ. Individuals consenting to the host study&#xD;
      will be offered the opportunity to participate in the pilot study, and they will receive a&#xD;
      manualized written informed consent procedure. We will enroll a total of 80 individuals into&#xD;
      the pilot study. All participants will complete two measures of social harm at monthly&#xD;
      research appointments for a three month period. The social harms assessments will be (1) the&#xD;
      ACASI-SHQ that was developed in Phase 1 and (2) the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) Social&#xD;
      Impact Assessment. At each appointment, the order in which the instruments are delivered will&#xD;
      be counterbalanced to control for carryover effects. At the end of Phase 2, host study&#xD;
      research team will complete the ACASI-SHQ Feasibility and Acceptability Questionnaire.&#xD;
      Additionally, the PI and Co-I will conduct a focus group with the research team to collect&#xD;
      qualitative data on the feasibility, acceptability, and perceived benefits of the ACASI-SHQ&#xD;
      and information to guide its future implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment, study design, conditions, arms, interventions, and eligibility criteria&#xD;
      sections of this record reflect the involvement of the 80 participants who will participate&#xD;
      in Phase 2 pilot testing of the ACASI-SHQ.&#xD;

        We anticipate that the sample will be representative of the populations in our ongoing&#xD;
        trials of clients with substance use disorders and of the substance abuse treatment&#xD;
        population, which is approximately 70% male, 60% African-American, 35% Caucasian, and 30%&#xD;
        Hispanic. This distribution is similar to the gender and racial distributions of publicly&#xD;
        funded drug abuse treatment patients in Philadelphia and other large cities located in&#xD;
        Mid-Atlantic States.&#xD;
