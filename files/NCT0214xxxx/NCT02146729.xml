  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients presenting with Type A and Type B1, B2 thoracolumbar fractures, there is a lack&#xD;
      of evidence demonstrating similar outcomes between patients treated with percutaneous pedicle&#xD;
      screws and those treated openly. It has been demonstrated that percutaneous pedicle screw&#xD;
      fixation has fared well for patients in the short term; however, it is unclear whether the&#xD;
      outcomes are equivalent or inferior/superior compared to open treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors seek to establish a high-level evidence base to determine clinical patient&#xD;
      outcomes, radiographic outcomes, as well as cost-effectiveness data in comparing&#xD;
      thoracolumbar burst fracture patients treated with percutaneous pedicle screws, open&#xD;
      treatment, and brace treatment. Additionally, the authors seek to establish data relating to&#xD;
      patient occupational data, complications, and need for further surgery (revision/removal of&#xD;
      hardware), as well as short-term variables relating to hospital visit (length of stay,&#xD;
      estimated blood loss, time under fluoroscopy).&#xD;
