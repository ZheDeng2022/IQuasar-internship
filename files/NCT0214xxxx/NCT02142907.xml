  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a general radiation oncology practice, breast cancer typically comprises approximately 25%&#xD;
      of the total patient caseload.1 Surgery is the primary modality of treatment. Radical&#xD;
      mastectomy remained the mainstay of surgical therapy into the 1970s. Breast-conserving&#xD;
      surgery followed by radiation therapy to the intact breast is an established standard of care&#xD;
      for the majority of women with early stage invasive breast cancer. Recommended techniques for&#xD;
      breast-conservation treatment are local excision of the primary tumor, preferably with clear&#xD;
      margins, axillary lymph node dissection, and breast irradiation (45 to 50 Gy), usually with a&#xD;
      boost (10 to 20 Gy, depending on tumor size and status of the surgical margins).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the two boost regimen 10Gy/5#/1 week with 16Gy/8#/1.5&#xD;
      weeks in post lumpectomy patients of early stage breast cancer, following whole breast&#xD;
      irradiation (WBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 50 patients, (25 in each arm) of early stage post lumpectomy breast&#xD;
      cancer patients. Each patient will be treated by WBI followed by tumor bed boost with either&#xD;
      electron beam therapy or 3D CRT. The primary end point of the study will be assessment of&#xD;
      acute and late radiation toxicities, cosmetic score analysis and local control between two&#xD;
      schedules. Secondary end points will be recurrence-free survival.&#xD;

      Patients to be included in this study will be pre-operatively staged according to American&#xD;
      Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition, International Union against cancer ( which uses&#xD;
      TNM staging ) as stage I , stage II of breast carcinoma. Fifty patients of histologically&#xD;
      proven post lumpectomy cases of carcinoma breast suitable for whole breast radiotherapy will&#xD;
      be enrolled in this study. Patients would be evaluated at the Department of Radiotherapy&#xD;
      PGIMER, Chandigarh by doing a thorough clinical examination followed by routine&#xD;
      investigations which will include hemogram, liver function tests, kidney function tests,&#xD;
      chest X-ray. Patients will be treated by standard rectangular tangential field radiotherapy&#xD;
      to whole breast. CT based planning will be done for photons boost and electron beam therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Unicentric primary breast cancer with invasive ductal histology. 2. Stage T1, T2, N0, N1,&#xD;
      M0 Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tumor histology with invasive or in situ lobular carcinoma or pure ductal carcinoma in&#xD;
           situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Skin involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. History of prior primary malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. History of prior irradiation to chest&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Procedure Fifty patients (25 in each&#xD;
           arm) scheduled for whole breast radiotherapy after lumpectomy will be included in this&#xD;
           study. An informed written consent in prescribed proforma for all patients will be taken&#xD;
           for performing planning CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to radiotherapy planning, breast conserving surgery in the form of lumpectomy will be&#xD;
      carried out in the department of surgery under general anaesthesia. Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited 2-3 weeks after lumpectomy. A planning CT scan will be made for each patient. The&#xD;
      patients will be positioned on a breast board with sternum parallel to the table, and the&#xD;
      ipsilateral arm abducted above the head. Before the CT scan skin marks would be placed to&#xD;
      enable the patient repositioning during treatment. Radioopaque markers will be placed to&#xD;
      locate the whole breast and lumpectomy cavity on CT images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be scanned from level of larynx to the level of upper abdomen, including both&#xD;
      lungs with a scan thickness and index of 5mm. The CT scan will include the complete left and&#xD;
      right lung, both breasts and the heart. Then CT images will be transferred to the treatment&#xD;
      planning system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gross tumor volume (GTV) will be defined by lumpectomy cavity contoured on each CT slice.&#xD;
      The clinical target volume (CTV) will consist of GTV uniformly expanded in three dimensions&#xD;
      by 1cm; however the volume will be constrained to lie 5mm within external contour and up&#xD;
      against the pectoralis major muscles. The planning target volume (PTV) will be calculated&#xD;
      from the CTV using uniform three dimensional expansion of 0.5 cm. The ipsilateral whole&#xD;
      breast will be defined to lie within the radioopaque markers and as deep as the anterior&#xD;
      chest wall muscles. The cranial extent of heart will include the infundibulum of right&#xD;
      ventricle, the right atrium and right auricle but exclude the pulmonary trunk, ascending&#xD;
      aorta and superior vena cava. The lowest external contour of heart will be the caudal border&#xD;
      of mediastinum. The pericardium should be excluded from the heart volume. Both lungs will be&#xD;
      contoured. The contralateral breast will be contoured as the breast parenchyma is visible on&#xD;
      CT images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After contouring the target volumes and organs at risk (OAR), standard whole breast&#xD;
      rectangular field plans, 3D-CRT boost and electron boost plans will be generated. Dose&#xD;
      prescribed would be 40 Gy/16#/3 weeks for whole breast rectangular plans and a boost of 10&#xD;
      Gy/5#/1week in arm A and 16Gy/8#/1.5weeks in Arm B. Plans will be evaluated both&#xD;
      quantitatively (analyzing dose volume histograms) and qualitatively (by visually inspecting&#xD;
      isodose curves). Plans will be inspected for conformity and doses delivered to target and&#xD;
      organs at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First follow up will be after 1 month of treatment, subsequently every 2 months till 6&#xD;
      months, 3 monthly till 1 year and 4 monthly till 3 years. Patient will be examined clinically&#xD;
      for acute effects, cosmetic outcome and LRR. Required investigation will be done if&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of toxicity will be done as per RTOG scores AND LENT SOMA scale SKIN Grade0 Grade1&#xD;
      Grade2 Grade3 Grade4 Toxicity No change over baseline Follicular, faint or dull erythema/&#xD;

      Statistical analysis The principle end point of the study will be an analysis of acute and&#xD;
      late radiation toxicities,cosmetic score analysis and local control between two boost arms.&#xD;
      Skin, subcutaneous toxicity and cosmetic assessment will be done before treatment and then in&#xD;
      regular follow up of the study. Chi-square test will be used to compare radiation toxicity&#xD;
      parameters. Descriptive statistics including mean and standard deviation will be obtained for&#xD;
      all variables. A student t-test will be used to compare the dosimetric parameters. p values&#xD;
      of &lt;0.05 will be taken as significant. All tests would be performed using SPSS (Statistical&#xD;
      Package for the Social Sciences) v.12.0.&#xD;
