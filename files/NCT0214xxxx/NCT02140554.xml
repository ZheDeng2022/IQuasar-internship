    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open label, multi-site, single dose, Phase 1/2 study in&#xD;
      approximately 50 adults and adolescents with severe SCD. The study will evaluate&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (HSCT) using bb1111 (also known as LentiGlobin&#xD;
      BB305 Drug Product for SCD).&#xD;

      Subject participation for this study will be 2 years post-transplant. Subjects who enroll in&#xD;
      this study will be asked to participate in a subsequent long-term follow up study that will&#xD;
      monitor the safety and efficacy of the treatment they receive for an additional 13 years for&#xD;
      a total of 15 years post-drug product infusion.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be ≥12 and ≤50 of age at time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of sickle cell disease (SCD), with either βS/βS or βS/β0 or βS/β+ genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have severe SCD. i.e., in the setting of appropriate supportive care measures for SCD&#xD;
             (e.g.,pain management plan) have experienced at least 4 severe VOEs in the 24 months&#xD;
             prior to informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For the purposes of this study, a severe VOE is defined as an event with no medically&#xD;
             determined cause other than a vaso-occlusion, requiring a ≥ 24-hour hospital or&#xD;
             Emergency Room (ER) observation unit visit or at least 2 visits to a day unit or ER&#xD;
             over 72 hours with both visits requiring intravenous treatment. Exception: priapism&#xD;
             does not require hospital admission but does require a medical facility visit; 4&#xD;
             priapism episodes that require a visit to a medical facility (without inpatient&#xD;
             admission) are sufficient to meet criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 60 (≥16 years of age) or a Lansky performance status&#xD;
             of ≥60 (&lt;16 years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have either experienced hydroxyurea (HU) failure at any point in the past or must have&#xD;
             intolerance to HU (defined as patient being unable to continue to take HU per PI&#xD;
             judgement).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have been treated and followed for at least the past 24 months prior to Informed&#xD;
             Consent in medical center(s) that maintained detailed records on SCD history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Positive for presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2),&#xD;
             hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C (HCV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinically significant and active bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Inadequate bone marrow function, as defined by an absolute neutrophil count of &lt;&#xD;
             1000/µL (&lt; 500/µL for subjects on HU treatment) or a platelet count &lt; 120,000/µL&#xD;
             (without hypersplenism).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any history of severe cerebral vasculopathy: defined by overt or hemorrhagic stroke;&#xD;
             abnormal transcranial Doppler [≥200 cm/sec] needing chronic transfusion; or occlusion&#xD;
             or stenosis in the polygon of Willis; or presence of Moyamoya disease. Subjects with&#xD;
             radiologic evidence of silent infarction in the absence of any of the above criteria&#xD;
             would still be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Advanced liver disease, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Persistent aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, or direct bilirubin&#xD;
                  value &gt;3× the upper limit of normal (ULN), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Baseline prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time &gt;1.5× ULN, suspected of&#xD;
                  arising from liver disease, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the liver demonstrating clear evidence of&#xD;
                  cirrhosis, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. MRI findings suggestive of active hepatitis, significant fibrosis, inconclusive&#xD;
                  evidence of cirrhosis, or liver iron concentration ≥15 mg/g require follow-up&#xD;
                  liver biopsy in subjects ≥18 years of age. In subjects &lt;18 years of age, these&#xD;
                  MRI findings are exclusionary, unless in the opinion of the Investigator, a liver&#xD;
                  biopsy could provide additional data to confirm eligibility and would be safe to&#xD;
                  perform. If a liver biopsy is performed based on MRI findings, any evidence of&#xD;
                  cirrhosis, bridging fibrosis, or significant active hepatitis will be&#xD;
                  exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any contraindications to the use of plerixafor during the mobilization of&#xD;
             hematopoietic stem cells and any contraindications to the use of busulfan and any&#xD;
             other medicinal products required during the myeloablative conditioning, including&#xD;
             hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any prior or current malignancy or immunodeficiency disorder, except previously&#xD;
             treated, non-life threatening, cured tumors such as squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Prior receipt of an allogeneic transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Immediate family member with a known or suspected Familial Cancer Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Diagnosis of significant psychiatric disorder of the subject that, in the&#xD;
             Investigator's judgment, could seriously impede the ability to participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Pregnancy or breastfeeding in a postpartum female or absence of adequate contraception&#xD;
             for fertile subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational drug within 30 days of&#xD;
             Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Prior receipt of gene therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients needing curative anticoagulation therapy during the period of conditioning&#xD;
             through platelet engraftment (patients on prophylactic doses of anticoagulants are&#xD;
             eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Unable to receive RBC transfusion.&#xD;
