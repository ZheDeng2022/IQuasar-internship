      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Sometimes people with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, can have new or worsening symptoms&#xD;
      soon after starting HIV medications. Often these symptoms are caused by immune reconstitution&#xD;
      inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Researchers want to study why and how people develop IRIS and&#xD;
      how best to prevent and treat it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn the causes and effects of IRIS,and how to best manage it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults 18 and older with HIV and low CD4 counts,, about to start HIV medicines; or those&#xD;
      already taking HIV medicines with symptoms thought to be related to IRIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants not on ART will have screening blood tests for CD4 count, HIV viral load&#xD;
           and genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the screening blood tests and before starting HIV medicines., participants will&#xD;
           return for more than 1 visit for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  review of medical history&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical and eye exams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood, urine, and tuberculosis (TB) tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  electrocardiogram (EKG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  chest x-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  apheresis: a blood drawing procedure where blood is removed from a vein, white blood&#xD;
           cells are separated and collected, and the rest of the blood is returned to the person&#xD;
           using another vein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  - PET scan - a procedure where a small amount of radioactive material is injected in a&#xD;
           vein. The participant then lies on a table that slides into a scanner which takes images&#xD;
           of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lymph node biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stool collection by swab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After completion of the above, HIV medicines will be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up visits will be at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after starting ART, then every 12&#xD;
           weeks. Some of the tests above may be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants already on HIV medicines who may have IRIS will be screened over a 4 week&#xD;
           time period to see if they really are experiencing IRIS. The screening process will&#xD;
           include all of the items listed above. Follow-up visits will be at Weeks, 4, 8, 12 and&#xD;
           then every 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will last 1 year for both groups but may be extended to 2 years (3 additional&#xD;
           appointments) for some participants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in HIV infection represents a paradoxical,&#xD;
      frequently inflammatory, immune response after initiation of antiretroviral (ART) therapy.&#xD;
      The immunopathogenesis of IRIS remains elusive partially due to a lack of tissue sampling and&#xD;
      a lack of detailed screening, including imaging, for subclinical opportunistic infections in&#xD;
      many studies. Most pathogenesis studies to date have been performed in peripheral blood with&#xD;
      a few notable exceptions of cryptococcal IRIS studies in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
      samples were obtained and evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 2-arm natural history study intended to evaluate the incidence, predictors and&#xD;
      pathogenic mechanisms of IRIS in HIV-1 infected adults (age &gt;18 years). An ART naive arm will&#xD;
      enroll 140 patients who are ART-na(SqrRoot) ve with CD4+ T cell counts &lt;100 cells/mm^3. These&#xD;
      participants will initiate ART according to the clinical standard of care. Any opportunistic&#xD;
      infections (OIs) or AIDS-defining illnesses identified prior to, during screening or at any&#xD;
      point during the study, will also be treated according to standard of care. The IRIS arm will&#xD;
      enroll 60 participants who are ART-treated and meet criteria suspicious for IRIS, with any&#xD;
      CD4+ T cell count. The ART naive arm will be followed for 48 weeks, with an optional&#xD;
      extension up to week 96. The IRIS arm will be followed for 48 weeks after enrollment if the&#xD;
      IRIS event is confirmed, also with an optional extension up to week 96. In both arms,&#xD;
      subjects must have adequate venous access and will undergo collection of whole blood by&#xD;
      phlebotomy, leukapheresis, lymph node biopsy, and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (FDG-PET/CT) at designated study visits.&#xD;

             therapy (ART). Patients with limited (no more than 2-3 weeks) recent use of potent&#xD;

             weeks.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Willingness to allow storage of blood or tissue samples for future research&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Willingness at time of screening to undergo study procedures (phlebotomy, apheresis,&#xD;

               -  In the event of an estimated reversible inability to consent, patients may enroll&#xD;
                  via a legally authorized representative (DPA) if they have the ability to assign&#xD;
                  a DPA. For these participants, baseline lymph node biopsy will not be performed&#xD;
                  however the week 4-8 lymph node biopsy may be performed if the participant&#xD;
                  regains the capacity to consent prior to that time.&#xD;

             effects of antiretroviral therapy itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
             V. The infectious/inflammatory condition must be attributable to a specific pathogen&#xD;

                  using a legally authorized representative (DPA) if they have the ability to&#xD;
                  assign a DPA. lymph node biopsy will not be performed in these occasions.&#xD;

             chemotherapy initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. An inability to consent that is estimated by the study team to be irreversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of significant medical non-adherence which would, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, interfere with study participation&#xD;
