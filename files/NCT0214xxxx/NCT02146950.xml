  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate whether LCS12 is associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      unintended pregnancy compared to Mirena and to copper IUDs. The objective is to assess among&#xD;
      new users the risks of certain events (e.g. contraceptive failure rate, ectopic pregnancy,&#xD;
      uterine perforation, and PID) associated with the use of LCS12 compared with the established&#xD;
      hormonal IUD Mirena, and compared with established copper IUDs during standard clinical&#xD;
      practice. In addition, drug utilization patterns will be described.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine contraceptive methods, such as Mirena and copper IUDs, have a high contraceptive&#xD;
      efficacy. LCS12 is a new intrauterine system which, like Mirena, contains levonorgestrel&#xD;
      (LNG), but the T-body dimensions and insertion tube diameter of LCS12 are smaller.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because there is a lack of comparative data between LCS12 and other intrauterine&#xD;
      contraceptives, it is unclear whether there are differences in contraceptive failure rates&#xD;
      between LCS12 and either Mirena or copper IUDs. In addition, any transcervical procedure,&#xD;
      including the insertion of an intrauterine device, is potentially associated with the risk of&#xD;
      infection/inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EURAS-LCS12 is a prospective, controlled, non-interventional, active surveillance cohort&#xD;
      study with three user cohorts: LCS12, Mirena and copper IUDs. Study participants will be&#xD;
      recruited by a network of health care professionals and will be followed up through active&#xD;
      surveillance to collect information regarding the outcomes of interest and major safety&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All self-reported clinical outcomes of interest will be validated by health care&#xD;
      professionals. The primary endpoint is unintended pregnancy. Secondary endpoints are ectopic&#xD;
      pregnancy, uterine perforation, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Amendment (Approved by PRAC on September 29, 2016):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the contraceptive failure risk of Jaydess,&#xD;
      Mirena, and copper IUD use in a study population that is representative of the real users of&#xD;
      the individual IUDs. Interim analysis showed a high proportion of IUD users in the age group&#xD;
      &gt;= 40 years of age. Given the fact that the age distribution remains considerably skewed, and&#xD;
      that the Pearl Index is influenced by the age of participants, the independent Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring and Advisory Council decided to suggest to narrow the study inclusion criteria,&#xD;
      i.e. an age restriction to &lt;40 years old at study entry was suggested for the remaining&#xD;
      recruitment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses regarding unintended pregnancies (including ectopic pregnancies) will be&#xD;
      conducted using the complete cohorts (i.e. including study participants aged 40 years and&#xD;
      older). In addition, these analyses will be done including only women in the age group below&#xD;
      40 years. Further age-stratified analyses of these outcomes are also planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Amendment (Approved by PRAC in February, 2018):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, due to concerns regarding the influence of the use of hormonal IUDs on&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric disorders, the PRAC requested to investigate the baseline risk as well as&#xD;
      the risk under exposure of IUDs within the EURAS-LCS12 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline questionnaire will capture information on the history of anxiety, panic attacks,&#xD;
      mood swings/depression, persistant difficulties with sleeping and restlessness (further on&#xD;
      referred to as &quot;neuropsychiatric complaints&quot;) for all newly recruited users after ethical&#xD;
      approval of the revised questionnaire. Neuropsychiatric complaints that occur under exposure&#xD;
      to an IUD reported by the study participant during the follow-up will be validated with the&#xD;
      treating physician, if applicable, in the same manner as other outcomes of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the study will be also conducted in Spain and Italy to be able to fulfil study&#xD;
      goal in time, as the recruitment of Jaydess users is lower than expected due to the recent&#xD;
      launch of another hormonal IUS (Kyleena) which is licensed for contraception for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study amendment (Approved by PRAC in October 2019):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the course of the study, another hormonal IUD ( 'Kyleena') was launched in 2017 which has&#xD;
      the same dimensions as LCS12, but a higher LNG content, and is approved for use up to 5&#xD;
      years. The initial LNG release rates are approximately 14 µg/24h for LCS12, 20 µg/24h for&#xD;
      Mirena and 17.5 µg/24h for Kyleena. New users of Kyleena were continuously enrolled in the&#xD;
      study since the market introduction and are categorized as 'other hormonal IUD'. However,&#xD;
      with increasing usage of Kyleena and enrolment into the EURAS-LCS12 study, the Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring and Advisory Council endorsed inclusion of Kyleena as an official cohort to the&#xD;
      study to better understand current routine clinical practice. As comparative data on&#xD;
      contraceptive failure between Kyleena and Mirena based on routine clinical practice are not&#xD;
      available at present, the comparison of contraceptive failure rates between Kyleena and&#xD;
      Mirena / copper IUDs was added as an additional secondary outcome to the EURAS-LCS12 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the liscensed duration of use for Kyleena is 5 years, two additional follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaires will be sent to eligible users of Kyleena, Mirena and copper IUDs to assess&#xD;
      the complete life-cylce of the products.&#xD;
