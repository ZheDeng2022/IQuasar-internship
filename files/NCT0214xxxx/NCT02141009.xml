      Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an important health problem with significant morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality and cost. The most identified pathogen in CAP is Streptococcus pneumoniae. This was&#xD;
      also the causative agent most frequently found in the Ovidius and Triple-P study, two&#xD;
      consecutive clinical trials initiated by the St. Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein. Diagnosis of&#xD;
      pneumococcal pneumonia can be based on positive blood cultures, sputum cultures, urine&#xD;
      antigen testing or a serotype specific antibody response. When pneumococcal pneumonia is&#xD;
      diagnosed by a positive culture, a matching serotype specific antibody response is expected.&#xD;
      However not all patients in the Ovidius and Triple-P study with a culture proven pneumococcal&#xD;
      pneumonia showed an antibody response against the infecting pneumococcal serotype. Patients&#xD;
      who survived pneumococcal pneumonia are considered as a high-risk population for pneumococcal&#xD;
      disease in the future. Possibly these patients have an impaired immune response against S.&#xD;
      pneumoniae. In this study, pneumococcal vaccination of patients with S. pneumoniae CAP in the&#xD;
      past enables investigating their immune response after vaccination compared to patients with&#xD;
      CAP due another causative agent. Furthermore this study provides information to determine if&#xD;
      there is a difference in vaccination response between pneumococcal pneumonia patients who had&#xD;
      a culture matching serotype specific antibody response and between pneumococcal pneumonia&#xD;
      patients who failed to elicit this response previously. Possibly these latter patients had a&#xD;
      temporarily low titre due to the infection but another explanation is that there might be a&#xD;
      structurally impaired immune response against S. pneumoniae or certain serotypes.&#xD;

      1. Introduction &amp; rationale Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an important health&#xD;
           problem with significant morbidity, mortality and cost. It is one of the main causes of&#xD;
           disease and death worldwide and causes the most deaths by infection in the United&#xD;
           States. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most commonly identified pathogen in CAP.(1)&#xD;
&#xD;
           S. pneumoniae is a gram-positive, alpha haemolytic bacterium that is surrounded by an&#xD;
           external polysaccharide capsule. There is a difference in composition of this capsule&#xD;
           between the 92 different serotypes of S. pneumoniae. Each serotype differs in virulence&#xD;
           and prevalence. The external polysaccharide capsule is the main trigger for the specific&#xD;
           antibody response and is the basis for pneumococcal vaccines. As it is impossible to&#xD;
           develop a vaccine that protects children, immune compromised adults and older adults to&#xD;
           all serotypes, the vaccines are based on the most common and virulent serotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nowadays a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Prevnar 13 (PCV13), is used widely&#xD;
           to vaccinate children. This vaccine contains the seven serotypes present in PCV7 (4, 6B,&#xD;
           9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F) plus the emerging serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F and 19A.(2) In the&#xD;
           Netherlands however the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Synflorix (PCV10), is&#xD;
           still used to vaccinate children in the national infant vaccination.(3)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Van Mens et al investigated the contribution of S. pneumoniae in CAP by measuring&#xD;
           serologic responses in patients who were hospitalized due to CAP in the Ovidius and&#xD;
           Triple P study, two consecutive clinical trials initiated by the St Antonius Hospital&#xD;
           Nieuwegein. This analysis showed a much higher proportion of patients with pneumococcal&#xD;
           pneumonia than was diagnosed by conventional methods alone (i.e. blood cultures, sputum&#xD;
           cultures or urine antigen tests). Interestingly some patients with a culture proven&#xD;
           pneumococcal pneumonia did not show a serotype specific antibody response to the&#xD;
           infecting serotype.(4) Possibly these patients had a temporarily low titre due to the&#xD;
           infection but another explanation is that there might be a structurally impaired immune&#xD;
           response against S. pneumoniae or certain serotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Borrow et al vaccinated 107 children with PCV7 after invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD)&#xD;
           following a routine infant immunization schedule. Pneumococcal serotype specific&#xD;
           antibody measurements were performed and showed failure to respond to the infecting&#xD;
           serotype in 8 children, even though these children received 2 or more doses of PCV. Two&#xD;
           children failed to respond to a serotype different than the infecting serotype.(5)&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this study the humoral and cellular immune response after vaccination with Prevnar 13&#xD;
           will be measured in patients who have had CAP with S. pneumoniae. The patients will be&#xD;
           recruited from the Ovidius and Triple-P study, two consecutive clinical trials initiated&#xD;
           by the St. Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein.(6,7) Patients who survived pneumococcal&#xD;
           pneumonia are considered as a high-risk population for pneumococcal disease in the&#xD;
           future.(8) Possibly these patients have less response to pneumococcal vaccination&#xD;
           because of an impaired immune response against S. pneumoniae. Special interest goes to&#xD;
           vaccination responses in the subgroup of pneumococcal pneumonia patients without a&#xD;
           culture matching specific antibody response in order to investigate if this reflects the&#xD;
           failure to elicit an immune response during pneumonia found by Van Mens et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ To investigate antibody response after pneumococcal vaccination in patients with&#xD;
           community acquired pneumococcal pneumonia compared to pneumonia patients with another&#xD;
           pathogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To investigate antibody response after pneumococcal vaccination in patients with&#xD;
                community acquired pneumococcal pneumonia who failed to elicit a specific antibody&#xD;
                response.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To investigate the cellular immune responses after pneumococcal vaccination in&#xD;
                patients with community acquired pneumococcal pneumonia in the past compared to&#xD;
                pneumonia patients with another pathogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To investigate quality of life by the RAND-36 score in patients with community&#xD;
                acquired pneumococcal pneumonia compared to pneumonia patients with another&#xD;
                pathogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To investigate the long-term mortality after community acquired pneumococcal&#xD;
                pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design The design is a prospective cohort study in which response to pneumococcal&#xD;
           vaccination and immune function after CAP with S. pneumoniae will be investigated.&#xD;
           Patients who were included in the Ovidius or Triple-P study and diagnosed with&#xD;
           pneumococcal pneumonia (with cultures, urine antigen test or serology) will be included.&#xD;
           The control group will consist of patients who were included in the Ovidius or Triple-P&#xD;
           study and diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia with another pathogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Working plan All patients and controls will receive vaccination with Prevnar 13. During&#xD;
           this visit information about the medical history, medication usage and daily status will&#xD;
           be obtained. Patients are also asked to fill-in a quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
           (RAND-36; section F Questionnaires). Sera will be obtained before vaccination and three&#xD;
           - four weeks after vaccination to determine antibody response against different&#xD;
           serotypes of S. pneumoniae. The study will end with the last visit of the last patient;&#xD;
           the duration of the study will be approximately 2 months (dependent on the moment of&#xD;
           inclusion of the patient).&#xD;
