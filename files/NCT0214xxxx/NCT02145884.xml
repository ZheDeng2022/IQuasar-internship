  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan to conduct a study, to see how safe and effective timolol maleate 0.5% gel-forming&#xD;
      solution is for infantile hemangiomas (IH) and the response of hemangiomas to timolol maleate&#xD;
      0.5% . Our hypothesis is that timolol will inhibit and possibly reverse growth of appropriate&#xD;
      infantile hemangiomas.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be assigned to open label timolol maleate 0.5%. Parents will be instructed to&#xD;
      place 1 to 2 drops twice a day in the center of the hemangioma. Subjects are expected to use&#xD;
      the study drug as directed every day for a 4 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and every 4 weeks thereafter for a&#xD;
      total of 5 months. Physical exam, photographs to compare size and color intensity, and a&#xD;
      scale of improvement will be completed at each visit. Parents will complete a quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding their child's hemangioma and its impact on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have evidence of worsening would be removed from the study and transferred to&#xD;
      the clinic for evaluation and treatment.&#xD;
