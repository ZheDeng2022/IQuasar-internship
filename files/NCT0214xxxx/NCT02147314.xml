  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This evaluation will evaluate a new system from YOFiMeter, known as YOFiLife Blood Glucose&#xD;
      Monitoring System with YOFiMeter glucometer. YOFiLife includes a web- based data system known&#xD;
      as the Web Portal and smart phone apps for the iPhone and Android. The new YOFiMeter is&#xD;
      similar to other glucometers with the exception of built in test cassettes, lancet cassettes&#xD;
      with enhanced communications and data reviewing options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation will also collect data from a YSI 2300 Stat Plus Glucose Analyzer reference&#xD;
      glucometer. The YSI 2300 Stat Plus Glucose Analyzer will be used as the &quot;gold&quot; standard with&#xD;
      all results compared to the YSI results.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single evaluation to assess both the Yofimeter system accuracy in the hands of the&#xD;
      intended users, as well as other aspects to support lay use, such as labeling assessment and&#xD;
      usability. The company is presenting diabetics who monitor their blood glucose with new&#xD;
      technological innovations aimed at improving their daily lives (e.g., a unique blood glucose&#xD;
      monitor, Web Portal applications and &quot;smart phone&quot; applications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject selected for the comparison evaluation will perform their own fingerstick and&#xD;
      test on their subject device following device instructions. A trained technician will perform&#xD;
      a fingerstick on the subject immediately after and perform the test on the same device.&#xD;
      Separate results will be recorded by subject and technician. A trained technician will take&#xD;
      another blood sample, within as short of a time as practicable, for a glucose assay on the&#xD;
      YSI 2300 Stat Plus Glucose Analyzer.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Is the subject willing to have fingersticks for blood glucose determination?&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Does the subject show an ability and willingness to follow directions of the&#xD;
             Investigator and staff?&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Is the subject 18 years of age or older?&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Does the subject demonstrate a lack of compliance as determined by the Principal or&#xD;
             Lead Site Investigator and/or staff?&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Is the subject currently participating in another clinical study of an investigational&#xD;
             device or drug?&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Is the subject unwilling or unable to provide concurrent blood glucose level&#xD;
