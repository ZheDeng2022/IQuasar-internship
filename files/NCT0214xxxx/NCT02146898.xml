  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to study the impact of patient positioning on the changes in blood&#xD;
      pressure after spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery. The investigators hypothesized that&#xD;
      the changes in blood pressure relate to the speed with which the spinal medication rises. By&#xD;
      slowing the rise of spinal anesthesia, the investigators believe that the incidence and&#xD;
      severity of hypotension might be reduced.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia is the most commonly used anesthetic for cesarean delivery. In part, this&#xD;
      is due to the ease of administration, reliability and low rates of adverse effects.&#xD;
      Additionally, the avoidance of general anesthesia allows the parturient to participate in the&#xD;
      birth experience, despite being in surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although hyperbaric local anesthetic solutions have a remarkable record of safety, their use&#xD;
      is not totally without risk. The side effects of spinal anesthesia are well described, but&#xD;
      most notably include hypotension (low blood pressure). Spinal hypotension is primarily due to&#xD;
      the vasodilatory effects of local anesthetics, and would occur in virtually all women if not&#xD;
      prevented or treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of hypotension in both the literature and in clinical practice ranges from 30%&#xD;
      to 50% of all patients. Recent literature using a continuous, non-invasive blood pressure&#xD;
      monitor suggests that hypotension occurs with greater frequency and may be associated with a&#xD;
      higher incidence of adverse effects to either mother or fetus. The incidence and degree of&#xD;
      hypotension have been associated with fetal acidosis, which is a sign of either poor&#xD;
      perfusion of the placental bed, or increased metabolism due to the blood pressure&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most effective treatment for spinal hypotension is uterine displacement using a hip&#xD;
      wedge; the use of a hip wedge after spinal anesthesia is a standard of care. Other treatment,&#xD;
      including fluid administration of either crystalloid or colloid, are either partially&#xD;
      effective, clinical impractical, or result in administering large doses of medications that&#xD;
      may have negative effects on the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidural anesthesia is associated with a reduction in the incidence and severity of&#xD;
      hypotension compared with spinal anesthesia. This is believed to be due to the slower onset&#xD;
      of sympathetic blockade with epidural anesthesia; this slow onset allows the physiologic&#xD;
      compensation to changes in blood pressure. Unfortunately, the slower onset and lower&#xD;
      reliability of epidural anesthesia prevents routine use in clinical practice for cesarean&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the position patients are in during spinal placement might&#xD;
      play a role in the severity of maternal hypotension. Interestingly, very few studies have&#xD;
      investigated this posibility. Gori, et al. (1) studied influence of seated versus lateral&#xD;
      positioning for spinal placement in Cesarean section. They found no significant differences&#xD;
      in onset times, Bromage score for motor block, recovery dynamics, and use of ephedrine in two&#xD;
      different positions; however, they did not compare the incidence and severity of spinal&#xD;
      hypotension. Yun, et al. (2) found that the severity and duration of hypotension were greater&#xD;
      when hyperbaric bupivacaine and fentanyl were induced in the sitting position compared to&#xD;
      lateral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of notice, in all these studies, the authors focused on the immediate positions when the&#xD;
      spinal mediation was injected; none has examined the effect of positioning after injection&#xD;
      during phase when spinal anesthesia is rising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Density differences between intrathecal injectate and CSF may explain the observed postural&#xD;
      differences in extent of sensory block. Thus, the height of spinal anesthesia blockade could&#xD;
      be affected by patient positioning during and after spinal injection. A small incline in&#xD;
      positioning immediately after spinal injection may slow the rise of spinal blockade without&#xD;
      affecting the duration of spinal anesthesia. In the current protocol, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that by slowing the rise of spinal anesthesia, the investigators might reduce the&#xD;
      severity of hypotension.&#xD;
