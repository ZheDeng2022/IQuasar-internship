      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the activity and safety of adoptive therapy using ex vivo expanded memory T&#xD;
      cells that are enriched and genetically-modified to express a CD19-specific, hinge optimized,&#xD;
      CD28-costimulatory chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) as well as a truncated human EGFR (Arm 1:&#xD;
      CD19R(EQ)28zeta/truncated human EGFR [EGFRt]+ central memory T cells [TCM]; Arm 2:&#xD;
      CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ naive and memory T cells [TN/NEM]) shortly following a lymphodepleting&#xD;
      preparative regimen for adults with poor prognosis CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the Phase II recommended dose (RP2D). III. To expand the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) dose to better describe the activity and safety of this dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To study additional antitumor activity endpoints of CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ TCM and&#xD;
      CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ TN/NEM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL JANUARY 2019): Patients receive lymphodepleting regimen per treating&#xD;
      physician's discretion 3-14 days before the T-cell infusion. Patients receive&#xD;
      CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cells IV over 15 minutes on day 0.&#xD;
      Patients who have evidence of disease, whose tumor(s) continue to express the appropriate&#xD;
      antigen target may receive an optional second infusion of&#xD;
      CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cells after 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive lymphodepleting regimen per treating physician's discretion 3-14&#xD;
      days before the T-cell infusion. Patients receive CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing&#xD;
      Tn/nem-enriched T cells IV over 15 minutes on day 0. Patients who have evidence of disease,&#xD;
      whose tumor(s) continue to express the appropriate antigen target may receive an optional&#xD;
      second infusion of CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/nem-enriched T cells after 28&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours, weekly for 1&#xD;
      month, monthly for 1 year, and then yearly for at least 15 years.&#xD;
