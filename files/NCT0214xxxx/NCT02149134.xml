  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cow's milk protein allergy is defined as an immunological reaction to one or more milk&#xD;
      proteins. A variety of symptoms can be suggestive for cow's milk protein allergy . Cow's milk&#xD;
      protein allergy is suspected clinically in 5-15% of infants, while most estimates of&#xD;
      prevalence of cow's milk protein allergy vary from only 2 to 5 %. Confusion regarding cow's&#xD;
      milk protein allergy prevalence is often due to differences in study populations, study&#xD;
      design and a lack of defined diagnostic criteria. The importance of defined diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria needs to be emphasised. It precludes infants from an unnecessary diet and avoids&#xD;
      delay in diagnosis, which can lead to malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two clinical types of cow's milk protein allergy: the immediate and the delayed&#xD;
      type. The immediate type usually presents within minutes after the ingestion of cow's milk&#xD;
      protein with urticaria, angio-oedema, vomiting or an acute flare of atopic dermatitis and is&#xD;
      present in slightly more than half of the patients with cow's milk protein allergy. Delayed&#xD;
      reactions such as atopic dermatitis or gastrointestinal symptoms like proctocolitis or&#xD;
      enteropathy usually present after hours or days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunologically, cow's milk protein allergy can be IgE or non-IgE mediated. IgE mediated&#xD;
      reactions are often of the immediate type. Non-IgE mediated reactions are often cell mediated&#xD;
      or mixed cell and IgE mediated and are more difficult to prove by specific testing. The&#xD;
      immunological reaction differentiates cow's milk protein allergy from other milk induced&#xD;
      pathology such as lactose intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of symptoms can be suggestive for cow's milk protein allergy although none of them&#xD;
      is diagnostic. A good medical history remains the cornerstone for the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of cow's milk protein allergy is the dietary elimination of cow's milk&#xD;
      proteins. In non-breastfed infants and children less than 2 years of age, a substitute&#xD;
      formula is mandatory as prescribed by several international scientific societies. Extensively&#xD;
      hydrolyzed formulas are used as therapeutic formulas. An extensively hydrolysed formula is&#xD;
      often a whey or casein based formula in which the protein has been chopped up in smaller&#xD;
      pieces that are less allergenic. Because of high cross-reactivity (up to 80%) and nutritional&#xD;
      inadequacy, the use of any other animal milk or soy-based formula is precluded.The infant&#xD;
      should be maintained on an elimination diet until the child is between 9-12 months of age or&#xD;
      at least for 6 months, whichever occurs first. In most cases, symptoms will improve&#xD;
      substantially within 2-4 weeks if diagnosis is correct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to consensus in literature, a therapeutic formula is a formula tolerated by at&#xD;
      least 90% (with 95% confidence) of cow's milk protein allergy infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the investigators study is to show the efficacy, tolerance and nutritional&#xD;
      adequacy of a newly developed thickened extensively hydrolyzed formula in infants with a&#xD;
      proven cow's milk protein allergy. In all included patients, cow's milk protein allergy will&#xD;
      have been diagnosed based on a double blind placebo controlled food challenge, considered as&#xD;
      golden standard in cow's milk protein allergy diagnosis. To evaluate efficacy of the formula,&#xD;
      the formula has to be tolerated by at least 90% (with 95% confidence) of cow's milk protein&#xD;
      allergy infants following literature consensus. A symptom diary will be filled out for this&#xD;
      purpose by the patients' parents or legal guardians and the patient will be followed&#xD;
      clinically by his doctor several times during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional adequacy of the formula will be evaluated clinically by following growth and&#xD;
      weight several times during the study period and by comparing it to the standard WHO growth&#xD;
      curves, based on breastfed infants.&#xD;
