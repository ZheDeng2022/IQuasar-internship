    <textblock>
      Regional anesthesia techniques, with administration of local anesthetics for neuraxial or&#xD;
      peripheral route are now playing a central role in modern anesthesia and in particular in the&#xD;
      control of postoperative pain. There are many review and meta-analyzes suggesting that a good&#xD;
      pain control, and specifically loco regional analgesia, may improve the outcome of patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control of acute post-operative pain is not the only challenge to be paid by&#xD;
      anesthesiologists, because there is still much to be understood in relation to persistent&#xD;
      post-surgical pain (PPP), and about the degree of influence that regional anesthesia plays in&#xD;
      complete long-term functional recovery of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the pathophysiological perspective there is not a precise definition of the mechanisms&#xD;
      and risk factors that determine the onset of the persistent pain after surgery, but, more in&#xD;
      general, it seems to be related to a malfunction of the mechanism of secondary hyperalgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthesia could play a key role, as the main determinant of chronic pain is acute&#xD;
      post-operative pain. The techniques of regional anesthesia exert a powerful block at the&#xD;
      peripheral level, potentially preventing the progression of central pain and the persistence&#xD;
      of stimuli that can reach the central nervous system. In addition, during surgery, these&#xD;
      techniques can reduce the metabolic alterations and the triggering mechanisms of local and&#xD;
      systemic pro-inflammatory mediators' release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few perspective studies exist about the influence of regional anesthesia on long-term outcome&#xD;
      and persistent pain after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the investigators study is to assess in a prospective fashion the role of&#xD;
      regional anesthesia/analgesia technique in preventing (or not) persistence pain occurrence&#xD;
      after surgical interventions which are mostly associated to pain persistence, and understand&#xD;
      if regional anesthesia provides advantages in other post-surgical outcomes.&#xD;
