  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa is a chronic mental health condition characterized by maladaptive food&#xD;
      consumption (i.e., hypophagia) and distorted body image. There is substantial evidence of a&#xD;
      phenotypic overlap between anorexia nervosa and anxiety disorders, as well as data suggesting&#xD;
      the two share a common genetic pathway. Despite these findings, little research has examined&#xD;
      fear conditioning among individuals with anorexia nervosa, and no research has examined&#xD;
      whether individuals with anorexia nervosa have a propensity to overgeneralize conditioned&#xD;
      fear stimuli, one of the more robust fear-conditioning markers of anxiety disorders. The&#xD;
      current study assesses generalization of conditioned fear with fear-potentiated startle: the&#xD;
      cross-species enhancement of the startle reflex when an organism is in a state of fear.&#xD;
      Animal data, as well as an emerging literature in humans, tightly links fear-potentiated&#xD;
      startle to the amygdala-based fear circuit. Thus, evidence of overgeneralized&#xD;
      fear-potentiated startle in anorexia nervosa would link this eating disorder to&#xD;
      hypersensitivity of the fear circuit and could inform the development of novel pharmacologic&#xD;
      and psychological treatments for anorexia nervosa based on treatment models used in the&#xD;
      anxiety disorders literature.&#xD;

      The overarching objective of the current proposal is to examine the feasibility of applying a&#xD;
      generalization of conditioned fear-potentiated startle paradigm, which has been used&#xD;
      successfully to measure the sensitivity of fear networks in anxiety disorders, to adults with&#xD;
      anorexia nervosa. The specific aim will be to examine whether conditioned-fear generalization&#xD;
      gradients in anorexia nervosa participants differ from those in healthy controls. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that anorexia nervosa participants will display stronger generalization as&#xD;
      indicated by less quadratic generalization gradients (i.e., a more gradual decline in&#xD;
      conditioned fear as the generalization stimuli deviate from the conditioned fearful stimuli),&#xD;
      which is indicative of a heightened sensitivity, or lower thresholds of activation, in the&#xD;
      fear circuit (i.e., less danger information necessary to trigger the fear).&#xD;
