  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been known that the blood pressure lowering effect of angiotensin receptor antagonists&#xD;
      (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is impaired in patients on high&#xD;
      sodium intake. There was an enhanced blood pressure lowering effect of ACE inhibitor when&#xD;
      sodium intake was restricted or diuretics were added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason is partially explained by sodium sensitivity or low rennin activity in high sodium&#xD;
      intake. However, the exact mechanism of sodium intake dependency is not clearly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study, an ARB, candesartan was revealed to have sodium intake dependency, showing&#xD;
      lower plasma concentration when subjects were on high sodium intake compared to on low sodium&#xD;
      intake. However, plasma concentration of another ARB, valsartan and an ACE inhibitor ramipril&#xD;
      was not changed depending on the sodium intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strongly suggested mechanism is the involvement of transporter P-glycoprotein (Pg-P). the&#xD;
      function and expression of Pg-P are modified by genetic polymorphism of multidrug resistance&#xD;
      1 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the transport mechanism of Fimasartan from gut is not fully understood, it has been&#xD;
      known that the multidrug resistance 1 is not involved. Thus, the pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic property of fimasartan is expected not to be affected by the status of sodium&#xD;
      intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed to investigate whether the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      property of fimasartan is changed depending on the sodium intake.&#xD;

      The study design is a two-diet, two-period, two-sequence, randomized, open label and&#xD;
      cross-over with 1-week diet-washout and 2-weeks drug-washout interval. The participants&#xD;
      (n=16) are randomly assigned to either of 7 days of low sodium (50 mmol/day) or high sodium&#xD;
      diet (300 mol) after hospitalization. After completion of 7-days of first period, all&#xD;
      participants are discharge and recommended to eat usual diet. After 1-week of diet washout,&#xD;
      all participants are hospitalized for second period. The compliance of diet is determined by&#xD;
      measurement of 24-hour urine sodium excretion. The 24-hour urine sodium excretion should be &lt;&#xD;
      100 mmol/24-hour in the low sodium diet period and &gt; 200 mmol/24-hour in high sodium diet&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the morning of 7th day of each period (high sodium or low sodium diet period), all&#xD;
      participants receive 60 mg of fimasartan in the fasting state. Blood samples for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study are drawn for 24-hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detailed measures are as followings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. High- and low-sodium intake&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. One of high- or low sodium intake for 7 days during each period&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Low sodium intake : 50 mmol/day by diet&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. High sodium intake: 50 mmol/day by diet + 250 mmol/day by salt tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 24 hour excreted amount of sodium in urine to determine the compliance for the high- and&#xD;
           low-sodium intake&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 24 hour excreted amount of sodium in urine for low sodium intake &lt; 100 mmol&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 24 hour excreted amount of sodium in urine for high sodium intake &gt; 200 mmol&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures and pulse rate in sitting position and body&#xD;
           temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood chemistry and complete blood count&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Measure at the morning of first day after overnight fasting&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. white blood cell count, red blood count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet, Calcium,&#xD;
                sodium, potassium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid,&#xD;
                cholesterol, albumin, total bilirubin, AST, ALT, blood urea nitrogen&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Urinalysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. potential of hydrogen, protein, bilirubin, glucose, urobilinogen, ketone, nitrite,&#xD;
           blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pharmacokinetic blood sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Plasma samples for fimasartan concentration&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Pharmacodynamic blood sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Plasma samples for renin activity&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Serum samples for aldosterone concentration&#xD;
