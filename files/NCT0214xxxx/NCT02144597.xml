  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Losing weight before undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery may reduce liver fat&#xD;
      content and size thereby improving surgical outcomes. This study aims to investigate whether&#xD;
      a 2-week or 6-week pre-operative liquid formula low-calorie diet (LCD) reduces liver fat&#xD;
      further than a conventional food diet prior to RYGB using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the 2-week and 6-week liquid formula LCD will reduce liver fat further&#xD;
      than the conventional food pre-operative diet.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The morbidly obese subjects (BMI higher then 40 kg/m2) were randomised and assessed at&#xD;
      baseline (week 0). After 2 weeks on a low-calorie diet (LCD), participants underwent either&#xD;
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or continued with a LCD for 4 weeks.The participants will&#xD;
      reassess at week 6.&#xD;

    <description>Complexity of surgery will be assessed by the surgeon at the time of surgery (either after 2 weeks for the Control group and 2-week LCD group or after 6 weeks for the 6-week LCD group) The complexity of the surgery was assessed through a score on a complexity scale based on questionnaires previously published by Anders Thorell&quot;s and David Edholm&quot;s groups (Edholm et al., 2011, Van Nieuwenhove et al., 2011). The scores (1-5) for 7 variables: exposure, bleeding, difficulty in dissection, difficulty in reconstruction, surgical judgment, technical demand and psychological stress were combined into a complexity of surgery score with a minimum of 7 (very little complexity) and a maximum of 35 (very high complexity).</description>

The scores (1-5) for 7 variables: exposure, bleeding, difficulty in dissection, difficulty in reconstruction, surgical judgment, technical demand and psychological stress were combined into a complexity of surgery score with a minimum of 7 (very little complexity) and a maximum of 35 (very high complexity).</description>
