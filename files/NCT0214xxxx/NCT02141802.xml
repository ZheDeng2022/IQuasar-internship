  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with cerebral palsy commonly use standing frames to position them to help prevent&#xD;
      contracture and deformity and to help their function. There is a lack of evidence to support&#xD;
      the correct dosage of standing frame use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to pilot a randomised controlled trial of the clinical effects of&#xD;
      doubling the duration of standing, using standing frames, in young children who are unable to&#xD;
      walk, who have cerebral palsy or developmental delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will determine whether it is feasable to carry out a multi-centred trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives will be to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. presence of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. recruitment and drop out rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. compliance with the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. feasibility of the randomisation and minimisation process&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. the proportion of the outcome measures taken&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. effect size estimate&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. required study costs&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. effectiveness of blinding procedure&#xD;

      Thirty non-ambulant children with cerebral palsy will be randomised into one of two groups&#xD;
      that either (a) maintains the child's current standing frame program- the control group&#xD;
      (n=15) (b) doubles the standing time- the intervention group (n=15). Outcome measures will be&#xD;
      taken at baseline and at 6 monthly intervals by a blinded assessor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research process and flow Families who are willing to participate in the study will be&#xD;
      provided with a diary sheet that will allow them to record over a baseline 2 week period how&#xD;
      frequently their child stood and in what position. The diary sheet will be available in word&#xD;
      or hard copy format. An e mail/ stamped addressed envelope will be provided to return the&#xD;
      diary at the end of 2 weeks. Participants will be reminded via text/ phone / e mail&#xD;
      (depending on their preferred method of communication) after 1 week if they have not returned&#xD;
      their diary sheets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On receipt of the diary sheets participants will be randomized into an intervention or&#xD;
      control group (see below). A therapist will explain the group allocation to the families at&#xD;
      their home or their local CDC. The trial will run for 12 months with the outcome measures&#xD;
      being taken by an assessor blinded to group allocation. The primary outcome measure (hip&#xD;
      migration percentage) will be taken at 0 and 12 months so as to fit in with practice across&#xD;
      the South West and not to increase x ray exposure. The secondary outcome measures will be&#xD;
      taken at baseline, 6 and 12 months. The final RCT will involve a 3 yr follow-up phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size We aim to recruit 15 people per group. An audit of CDC records suggests that&#xD;
      there are between 5-6 eligible participants over a 12 month recruitment period. With 8 main&#xD;
      recruitment centres this would result in 40-48 potential participants and a required&#xD;
      recruitment rate of 75-63%. An on-going study looking at walking in children with older&#xD;
      children with CP at Plymouth University suggests that this recruitment rate is feasible.&#xD;
      Determining the actual recruitment rate in this particular patient population and the&#xD;
      feasibility of using multiple centres across one region is one objective of the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty children with Cerebral Palsy (age 1-12 yrs; GMFCS III-V) will be recruited from South&#xD;
      West based services. Participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control&#xD;
      using a web-based system. A minimisation algorithm will be used to ensure balance between the&#xD;
      groups on the basis of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age (&lt;6 yrs Vs &gt;6 yrs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional ability (GMFCS=III or IVs GMFCS =V)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline standing time (&lt;30 mins Vs &gt;30 mins)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention All participants will already be performing a standing regime as prescribed by&#xD;
      their treating therapist. The study design and group allocation will be explained by the&#xD;
      research assistant (RA1) either at the local CDC or at the participants' home. The control&#xD;
      group will continue their usual standing-frame based regime. The intervention group will&#xD;
      double their daily standing-frame time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups a guidance sheet will be provided about how to progress their standing time&#xD;
      for the duration of the trial by 10%/month up to a maximum of 1 hr/day in the control group&#xD;
      and 2 hr/day in the intervention group. Following PPI advice the guidance will be&#xD;
      personalised to include photos of how to set their child up in their own standing frame and&#xD;
      the correct position of supportive straps / correct posture to adopt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research assistant will visit both groups at the start of the trial and every 3 months.&#xD;
      At each visit they will (a) check the position the child adopts in the standing frame (b)&#xD;
      check footwear and splints for use and fit (c) check the progression of treatment (d) check&#xD;
      and record any changes to their additional care routine by the treating therapist. Feedback&#xD;
      about problems in footwear / splinting will be passed onto the child's treating therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure will be taken at baseline (0 months) and at 12&#xD;
      months. This fits in with routine practice cross all centres in the South West although some&#xD;
      centres take additional x-rays at 6 months. All other measures will be taken at 0, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months. Outcomes will be measured by an assessor blinded to the group allocation.&#xD;
