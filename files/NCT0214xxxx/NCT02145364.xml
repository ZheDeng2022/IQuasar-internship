    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-site trial to be conducted at 2 clinical sites. Up to 20&#xD;
      subjects will receive study treatments. Following study treatments, follow-up visits will&#xD;
      occur at 60, 90 and 180 days from each subject's last study treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with moderate to severe atrophic acne scars will be enrolled. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      up to three dual-depth treatments to the cheek and temple areas impacted by acne scars,&#xD;
      treating the number of treatment squares necessary to cover the area of scarring. Each&#xD;
      treatment square will receive 30 lines per transducer depth for a total of 60 lines per&#xD;
      treatment square. Three treatments 30 days apart will be required.&#xD;
