  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This partially randomized phase I trial studies the side effects and how well sequential&#xD;
      dosing of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)/platelet derived growth factor&#xD;
      receptor (PDGFR) dual kinase inhibitor X-82 and docetaxel works in treating patients with&#xD;
      solid tumors. VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving VEGFR/PDGFR&#xD;
      dual kinase inhibitor X-82 and docetaxel one at a time instead of concurrently may work in&#xD;
      treating patients with solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intermittent X-82 (VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor X-82) when administered in a 2 week on, 1 week off schedule (Cycle #1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intermittent X-82 administered in combination&#xD;
      with docetaxel every 3 weeks (Cycle #2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the change in vascular parameters using 3'Deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine (FLT)&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) to X-82 alone (Cycle #1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the change in vascular parameters using FLT PET/CT to X-82 in combination&#xD;
      with docetaxel (Cycle #2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST) 1.1 of intermittent X-82 with docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure the change in plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels with&#xD;
      changes on FLT PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure changes in X-82 pharmacokinetics with changes on FLT PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sequential X-82 with docetaxel in disease&#xD;
      sub-populations. (Dose expansion cohort) II. To evaluate the objective response rate of&#xD;
      sequential X-82 with docetaxel in these disease sub-populations. (Dose expansion cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive high dose VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 orally (PO) once&#xD;
      daily (QD) on days 2-15. Beginning course 2, patients also receive docetaxel intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive low dose VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 PO QD on days 2-15&#xD;
      and docetaxel IV as in Arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPANSION COHORT: Patients receive VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 as in Arm I and&#xD;
      docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
