    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of raptor/rictor-mammalian target&#xD;
      of rapamycin (mTOR) (TORC1/2) inhibitor MLN0128 when given in combination with bevacizumab in&#xD;
      treating patients with glioblastoma, a type of brain tumor, or a solid tumor that has spread&#xD;
      and not responded to standard treatment. TORC1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;
      Bevacizumab may also stop the progression of tumors by blocking the growth of new blood&#xD;
      vessels necessary for tumor growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of daily&#xD;
      oral MLN0128 (TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128) when administered with bevacizumab in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors including recurrent glioblastoma (GBM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of the combination of MLN0128 and&#xD;
      bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of the combination of MLN0128 and&#xD;
      bevacizumab, as determined by response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess tolerability throughout study therapy with MLN0128 and bevacizumab, including&#xD;
      beyond the MTD interval with the following measures of cumulative treatment-related&#xD;
      toxicities: frequency of toxicities leading to missed doses or delays; percentage of cycles&#xD;
      given or not within 7 days of their scheduled times; percentage of actual planned dosage&#xD;
      administration; percentage of patients that discontinue study drugs due to treatment related&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration of MLN0128 in combination with bevacizumab&#xD;
      in patients with recurrent GBM by evaluating the plasma and CSF concentrations of MLN0128 in&#xD;
      the absence and presence of bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To perform archival tumor analysis for markers of dysregulated cell signaling that may&#xD;
      predict response to mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor therapy such as&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (expression by immunohistochemistry [IHC] and&#xD;
      amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH]), phosphatase and tensin homolog&#xD;
      (PTEN) (expression by IHC and deletion by FISH), phosphorylated (p)-protein kinase B (AKT),&#xD;
      p-ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), p-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding&#xD;
      protein 1 (4EBP), p-mTOR and p-mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (Erk) in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To analyze select phosphorylated proteins (ERK, AKT, mTOR, 4EBP1, glycogen synthase&#xD;
      kinase 3-beta [GSK3beta], ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70kDa, polypeptide 2 [p70S6K], rS6)&#xD;
      from tumor biopsies obtained at baseline and after treatment with MLN0128 from endometrial&#xD;
      and ovarian cancer patients enrolled in stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To analyze circulating plasma levels of angiogenic growth factors before, during and&#xD;
      after treatment with MLN0128 and bevacizumab V. To perform genetic mutation analysis and&#xD;
      proteomic analysis of tissue from biopsies of endometrial and ovarian cancer patients&#xD;
      including analysis of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), v-raf murine sarcoma&#xD;
      viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic&#xD;
      subunit alpha (PIK3CA), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1) and PTEN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MLN0128.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive TORC1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and bevacizumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then annually&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a histologically/cytologically confirmed diagnosis of recurrent&#xD;
             glioblastoma or an advanced solid tumor in which bevacizumab has shown benefit in&#xD;
             specific disease population and for which standard or curative measures do not exist&#xD;
             or are no longer effective&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable or evaluable disease as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
             Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for non-GBM tumors and by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology&#xD;
             (RANO) criteria for GBM&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For stage 1 (all patients) and dose expansion (stage 2) endometrial and ovarian cancer&#xD;
             cohorts, participants are allowed following unlimited prior therapy; for stage 2 GBM&#xD;
             participants, no more than 2 prior relapses are allowed; for these patients, relapse&#xD;
             is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e. radiation +/- chemo if that&#xD;
             was used as initial therapy) or a subsequent therapy; the intent therefore is that GBM&#xD;
             patients enrolling onto stage 2 had no more than 3 prior therapies (initial and&#xD;
             treatment for 2 relapses); if the patient had a surgical resection for relapsed&#xD;
             disease and no anti-cancer therapy was instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the patient&#xD;
             undergoes another surgical resection, this is considered to constitute 1 relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: for participants who had prior therapy for a low-grade glioma, the surgical&#xD;
                  diagnosis of glioblastoma will be considered the first relapse; therefore, these&#xD;
                  participants may have had more than 3 prior therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from clinically significant toxicity of prior therapy to&#xD;
             grade =&lt; 1 or pre-treatment baseline; the following intervals from previous treatments&#xD;
             are required prior to day 1 of study therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  12 weeks from the completion of radiation for recurrent GBM unless there is&#xD;
                  surgical diagnosis of recurrence or a new lesion that was not previously radiated&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  6 weeks from a nitrosourea chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  3 weeks from a non-nitrosourea chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  4 weeks from an investigational agent (not Food and Drug Administration [FDA]&#xD;
                  approved) (or 5 half lives, whichever is shorter)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  2 weeks from administration of a non-cytotoxic, FDA-approved agent (e.g.,&#xD;
                  erlotinib, hydroxychloroquine, etc.) (or 5 half lives, whichever is shorter)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 9.0 g/dL&#xD;

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase&#xD;
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])&#xD;
             =&lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (=&lt; 5 x upper limit of normal [ULN] if&#xD;
             liver metastases are present)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 50&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine level above institutional normal based&#xD;
             either on Cockroft-Gault estimate or based on urine collection (12 or 24 hour)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metabolic: fasting serum glucose (=&lt; 130 mg/dL) and fasting triglycerides =&lt; 300 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, the&#xD;
             duration of study participation and 6 months after completion of MLN 0128 or&#xD;
             bevacizumab administration; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
