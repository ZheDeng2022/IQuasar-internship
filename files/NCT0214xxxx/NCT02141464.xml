  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ivacaftor is a novel, FDA approved new therapy that addresses Cystic fibrosis transmembrane&#xD;
      conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunctions in subjects with Cystic fibrosis (CF) and &quot;gating&#xD;
      mutations&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to determine the mechanism(s) for weight gain in participants whom&#xD;
      Ivacaftor treatment was initiated based on clinical indications by CF Care Team. This&#xD;
      longitudinal study will assess in detail energy expenditure, weight gain, body composition,&#xD;
      and lung function in 24 subjects ≥6 years old with CF with a gating mutation before treatment&#xD;
      and after three months treatment with Ivacaftor. All subjects will be seen at the Children's&#xD;
      Hospital of Philadelphia's Clinical Translational Research Center.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF&#xD;
      transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel. Most CF mutations either&#xD;
      reduce the number of CFTR channels at the cell surface (synthesis or processing mutations) or&#xD;
      impair channel function (gating or conductance mutations). Ivacaftor (Kalydeco, VX-770) is a&#xD;
      novel, FDA approved new therapy that addresses CFTR dysfunctions in subjects with CF and&#xD;
      &quot;gating mutations&quot;, specifically; it potentiates CFTR channel function. For mutations like&#xD;
      G551D that permit CFTR expression at the cell membrane but compromise its activity, Ivacaftor&#xD;
      increases the probability that the channel is open and active. In previous randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo controlled trials, Ivacaftor treatment resulted in clinically&#xD;
      significantly improvements in pulmonary function, weight and body mass index (BMI), and&#xD;
      significant decreases in sweat chloride reflective of increased CFTR activity. The&#xD;
      improvements in lung function and weight occurred over the first 8 weeks of treatment,&#xD;
      plateaued and were sustained over the 48 weeks of the trial. The mechanism for the rapid and&#xD;
      sustained weight gain is not known. Several mechanisms are considered in this proposal which&#xD;
      may result in improved energy balance and energy utilization, and weight gain. These include&#xD;
      decreased resting energy expenditure, increased energy and fat absorption from the gut,&#xD;
      improved pancreatic enzyme and pH secretion, and increased energy intake. Improvements in&#xD;
      weight and BMI status are expected to result from this improvement in energy balance and&#xD;
      utilization, with potential beneficial effects on muscle mass and function and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
