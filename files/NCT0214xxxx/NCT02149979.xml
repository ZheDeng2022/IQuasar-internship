    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using Temperature&#xD;
      Controlled Laser Soldering System for soft tissue bonding.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin incisions can be closed by a variety of method which create temporary approximation of&#xD;
      the wound edges until natural healing process ensue and reach a phase, where it is closed and&#xD;
      can sustain the daily tensile forces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wound closure devices include sutures, staples, tapes, tissue adhesives. The Applied&#xD;
      Physics group at the Tel Aviv University has developed a Temperature Controlled CO2 Laser&#xD;
      Soldering system for soft tissue bonding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This system includes features that make laser soldering suitable for clinical use. The&#xD;
      Temperature Controlled Laser Soldering System is composed of CO2 fiberoptic laser device,&#xD;
      Infrared fiber-optic radiometer, a computerized temperature control program, propriety grip&#xD;
      device (Clamps) and concentrated Human Albumin as a soldering agent.&#xD;

    <description>This study had a prospective within-subject design. Patients allocated to laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure were enrolled. After the completion of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgical procedure, 4 trocar port sites were randomly either sutured or laser soldered by employing the temperature-controlled laser soldering system.</description>
