      A new hand held pocket echo device (GE Vscan) has now become available to clinicians, with&#xD;
      limited data available comparing the effectiveness of this device as a screening tool when&#xD;
      compared to traditional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are evaluating the effectiveness of this hand-held echo (HHE) device in&#xD;
      detecting cardiac pathology in a both an inpatient and outpatient clinical setting as&#xD;
      compared to a comprehensive TTE evaluation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A new hand held pocket echo device (GE Vscan) has now become available to clinicians, with&#xD;
      limited data available comparing the effectiveness of this device as a screening tool when&#xD;
      compared to TTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are evaluating the effectiveness of this HHE device in detecting cardiac pathology in a&#xD;
      both an inpatient and outpatient clinical setting as compared to a comprehensive TTE&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study compares the images from the two modalities with regards to multiple parameters&#xD;
      typically evaluated by traditional TTE. This would include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ejection fraction: estimates how well the heart is squeezing/functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Segmental wall motion abnormalities: if one wall of the heart is not moving well, this&#xD;
           suggests that part of the heart is not getting enough blood supply and could represent a&#xD;
           blockage in a blood vessel supplying the heart or in other terms a heart attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension: allows us to see if the heart is dilated&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inferior vena cava size: the size of this great vein can help estimate if patient has&#xD;
           too much fluid in their vascular bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Aortic valve pathology: whether or not there is thickening of the valve or impairment of&#xD;
           it's opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Mitral valve pathology: whether or not the valve is significantly thickened or with&#xD;
           impaired closing and opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Pericardial effusion: excessive fluid in the sack around the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The images obtained on the HHE will be evaluated by two experienced echocardiographers as&#xD;
      well as two cardiology fellows who have obtained training in image acquisition and&#xD;
      interpretation. The readers of the HHE images are blinded to the TTE results, and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparison of these individual parameters on HHE and TTE allows us to validate this new,&#xD;
      convenient screening tool in detecting cardiac pathology.&#xD;

          1. All subjects with an order for a routine transthoracic echocardiogram based on&#xD;
             clinical indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Vscan images will be obtained to evaluate multiple parameters (noted on research&#xD;
             summary).&#xD;
&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who had a limited transthoracic echocardiography (i.e limited views)&#xD;
