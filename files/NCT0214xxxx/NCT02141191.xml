      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether a single overnight, eight-hour&#xD;
      administration of a 7% NaCl solution delivered by the Parion Sciences transnasal Pulmonary&#xD;
      Aerosol Delivery (tPAD) device has a significant effect on mucociliary clearance in subjects&#xD;
      with cystic fibrosis, as compared to no treatment. This study will be conducted at the&#xD;
      University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) lung disease is caused by dehydration of airway secretions that leads to&#xD;
      mucus adhesion, infection and airways inflammation. A simple means to restore hydration to CF&#xD;
      airway surfaces is to inhale hypertonic (3-7% NaCl) saline, which osmotically draws water&#xD;
      onto the airway surface. Rehydration of the lubricant layer of the airway surface liquid&#xD;
      facilitates mucociliary clearance (MCC) and therefore the removal of inhaled infectious&#xD;
      agents. Recent studies have described (1) the short term (two weeks) beneficial effects of&#xD;
      inhaled hypertonic saline (HS) four times daily on pulmonary function, MCC, and quality of&#xD;
      life and (2) the long term (one year) benefits of inhaled HS twice daily on lung function and&#xD;
      pulmonary exacerbation frequency. Consequently, inhaled HS is now used by ~55% of patients&#xD;
      with CF nationwide. Due to the large number of medications that CF patients use on a daily&#xD;
      basis in conjunction with airway clearance techniques, there is a high treatment burden that&#xD;
      results in decreased quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and leading CF clinicians support the idea that the use&#xD;
      of hypertonic saline is now a standard of care. The investigators believe the use of a&#xD;
      specialized transnasal Pulmonary Aerosol Delivery (tPAD) device for administration of HS will&#xD;
      improve on that standard of care by reducing the treatment burden during CF patients' waking&#xD;
      hours, ensuring greater compliance and potentially improving the efficacy and tolerability of&#xD;
      inhaled HS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous deposition study with the tPAD, in six healthy adult subjects, demonstrated ~38%&#xD;
      of the 7% HS aerosol emitted from the nasal cannula is deposited in the adult lungs, with no&#xD;
      acute safety or tolerability issues (Parion Sciences Protocol PS-D100-102; Scott Donaldson,&#xD;
      PI). This deposition efficiency matched that of the Pari LC Star used via the oral route,&#xD;
      which was used as a standard of practice comparator. However, 7% HS nebulization by the tPAD&#xD;
      resulted in a more peripheral deposition of the aerosol than the Pari LC Star comparator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, it has been shown that administration of 5 mL of 7% HS QID by the Pari LC Star&#xD;
      leads to a significant improvement in the lung function in CF patients. The investigators&#xD;
      estimate that this dosing regimen deposits ~400 mg of NaCl per day but requires four ~18&#xD;
      minute administrations (deposition rate = 5.8 mg/min). Although HS is generally well&#xD;
      tolerated in the CF population, intolerance does occur and is largely related to the rate of&#xD;
      NaCl delivery to the oropharynx and airway surfaces. As nebulizer devices capable of&#xD;
      administering aerosols through a nasal cannula are not currently available, Parion Sciences&#xD;
      has designed a customized nebulizer spacer that entrains the aerosol from an approved and&#xD;
      marketed Aerogen Aeroneb Pro vibrating mesh nebulizer into a nasal cannula without&#xD;
      significant &quot;rain out&quot; or dripping from the cannula. The tPAD system being utilized has an&#xD;
      output rate of ~50 ul/min, and so emits ~3.5 mg/min of NaCl and deposits ~1.3 mg/min in the&#xD;
      lung (38% deposition efficiency). If used overnight for 8 hours, the investigators estimate&#xD;
      that 640 mg NaCl will be deposited in the lung. Therefore, the investigators project that&#xD;
      this novel administration system has the capacity to deliver approximately 50% greater mass&#xD;
      of NaCl to the lung when used overnight, compared to 4 times a day treatment with a standard&#xD;
      oral nebulizer, thereby potentially increasing efficacy. However, because the lung deposition&#xD;
      rate is less than 25% that of the standard oral nebulizer, the investigators anticipate that&#xD;
      the tPAD will also be better tolerated and will eliminate the need for daytime HS treatments.&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will explore the safety, tolerability and effect on&#xD;
      mucociliary and absorptive clearance rates of a 7% HS solution administered continuously&#xD;
      overnight via the transnasal route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tPAD is a non-significant risk device which is composed of a 510K approved Aerogen&#xD;
      Aeroneb Pro vibrating mesh nebulizer with a custom nebulization chamber that allows for&#xD;
      connection of a standard nasal cannula. Protocol PS-D201 is funded by NIH Grant&#xD;
      2R44HL110502-02 &quot;Hypertonic Saline for Cystic Fibrosis&quot;.&#xD;
