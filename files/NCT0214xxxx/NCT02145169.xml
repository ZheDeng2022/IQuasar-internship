    <textblock>
      To describe the safety and efficacy of nitrous oxide during ketamine administration for the&#xD;
      prevention of emergence reaction during Emergency Department procedural sedation and&#xD;
      analgesia in adults. Drugs such as fentanyl, midazolam, and propofol are widely used in&#xD;
      emergency departments for procedural sedation and analgesia because they have a rapid onset&#xD;
      and short duration of action. Unfortunately, all of these agents may cause respiratory&#xD;
      depression, particularly when combined with other sedative agents, administered in large&#xD;
      doses, or given to patients with underlying respiratory diseases. Nitrous oxide use during&#xD;
      ketamine administration may be an ideal combination for the prevention of emergence reaction&#xD;
      in adults sedated in the ED. Like ketamine, nitrous oxide has an excellent cardio-respiratory&#xD;
      profile as well as some analgesic and anxiolytic qualities. The anxiety and pain surrounding&#xD;
      procedural sedation is not limited to the procedure itself, but the elapsed time from the&#xD;
      time the patient enters the ED to the time spent in preparation for the procedure can be&#xD;
      significant and lead to increased anxiety, which may exacerbate emergence reactions in&#xD;
      adults. Using nitrous oxide before ketamine administration may mitigate this. While midazolam&#xD;
      has shown efficacy in reducing emergence reactions in adults sedated with ketamine, the&#xD;
      investigators believe that inhaled nitrous oxide may be equivalent to midazolam, with a&#xD;
      better cardio-respiratory profile.&#xD;

      Drugs such as fentanyl, midazolam, and propofol are widely used in emergency departments for&#xD;
      procedural sedation and analgesia because they have a rapid onset and short duration of&#xD;
      action. Unfortunately, all of these agents may cause respiratory depression, particularly&#xD;
      when combined with other sedative agents, administered in large doses, or given to patients&#xD;
      with underlying respiratory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine hydrochloride is a phencyclidine derivative that causes dissociation between the&#xD;
      cortical and limbic systems preventing the higher centers from perceiving visual, auditory,&#xD;
      or painful stimuli. It possesses a rapid onset and short duration of action and produces&#xD;
      profound sedation and analgesia. Ketamine is also a non-competitive NMDA antagonist, which&#xD;
      complements NO. However, laryngeal reflexes are maintained and respiratory depression is&#xD;
      rare. These properties have made ketamine a very popular agent for procedural sedation and&#xD;
      analgesia in pediatric emergency department patients . Unfortunately, when given to adult&#xD;
      patients, it frequently causes emergence anxiety, nightmares, hallucinations, and delirium.&#xD;
      These emergence reactions have limited the use of ketamine in adults. The incidence of these&#xD;
      reactions is about 7-10% in children. Emergence reactions may be a product of the state in&#xD;
      which the patient becomes disassociated . Therefore, if the patient is more relaxed prior to&#xD;
      ketamine administration through the adjunct use of NO, adverse emergence reactions may be&#xD;
      reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of agents including diazepam, lorazepam, fentanyl, droperidol, and others have been&#xD;
      used with varying success to reduce or prevent emergence reactions associated with ketamine&#xD;
      use. Diazepam and lorazepam have been the most successful, but their use may prolong recovery&#xD;
      time, making them less desirable in the emergency department setting. Midazolam has been&#xD;
      shown to lower the rate of emergence reaction when used concurrently with ketamine in adults.&#xD;
      However, like all benzodiazepines, there is a small risk of respiratory depression and&#xD;
      hypoxia with the use of midazolam, which could lead to an adverse respiratory event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled nitrous oxide may be an ideal adjunct to the prevention of emergence reaction in&#xD;
      adults being treated with ketamine. Nitrous oxide is a colorless gas that diffuses rapidly&#xD;
      across the pulmonary alveoli providing analgesia and anxiolysis with minimal sedative&#xD;
      effects, rapid induction, and emergence. Nitrous oxide is a weak sedative agent with the&#xD;
      potential for significant analgesic effects. Noncompetitive antagonist activity at the NMDA&#xD;
      receptor along with activation of opioid receptors contributes to its anesthetic mechanism.&#xD;
      There are rare adverse events, most often cited as case reports of chronic or acute toxicity&#xD;
      causing myeloneuropathies and polyneuropathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitrous oxide has been used in general anesthesia for over 2 centuries, but its use outside&#xD;
      of the operating room began when Tunstall introduced the nitrous oxide/oxygen mixture as an&#xD;
      analgesic agent during labor. Since this inception, the nitrous oxide/oxygen mixture has been&#xD;
      used readily in the fields of dentistry, gastrointestinal procedures, and children's&#xD;
      procedural sedation. Nitrous oxide is often administrated via continuous flow or on-demand at&#xD;
      a concentration of 50-70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some early data describing a favorable adverse event profile with nitrous oxide as a&#xD;
      single agent in adults. Hennequin et al. demonstrated support for the efficacy of nitrous&#xD;
      oxide with no major adverse cardio respiratory events. Although approximately 10% of&#xD;
      participants received mild gastrointestinal and behavioral side effects (e.g. agitation).&#xD;
      Greater than 90% of the study participants stated they would receive nitrous oxide again. In&#xD;
      a large prospective trial, Babl et al. found there to be only 2 patients out of 655 who&#xD;
      suffered serious adverse events (i.e., chest pain and oxygen desaturation). Both patients had&#xD;
      been administered 70% nitrous oxide compared to the more conservative 50% concentration.&#xD;
      Additionally, there was an increased incidence of minor adverse events (i.e., emesis and&#xD;
      agitation) with the higher concentration of nitrous oxide. Kariman et al. compared nitrous&#xD;
      oxide versus parental fentanyl as an analgesic after long bone fracture and found similar&#xD;
      pain scores and a more rapid decrease in the pain score in the nitrous oxide group when&#xD;
      compared with the opiate group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitrous oxide has been shown to be a safe and effective agent for procedural sedation in&#xD;
      children, including work that has combined opiates and benzodiazepines with nitrous&#xD;
      continuously. Burton et al. conducted a small, randomized controlled trial studying the&#xD;
      effectiveness of nitrous oxide on anxiety scores in children during laceration repairs. They&#xD;
      found a significant decrease in the group that used nitrous oxide compared to the placebo&#xD;
      group. This finding was further validated by Luhmann et al. with 50% continuous flow nitrous&#xD;
      oxide resulting in less distress and anxiety as well as increased patient satisfaction&#xD;
      compared to midazolam or topical anesthetic agents. The study also showed that the main&#xD;
      adverse event associated with nitrous oxide was nausea and vomiting, whereas midazolam group&#xD;
      had significant ataxia and dizziness. There was no demonstrable advantage of the combination&#xD;
      of midazolam and nitrous oxide in regard to patient satisfaction versus nitrous oxide alone,&#xD;
      but there was an increase in adverse events when midazolam was included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study performed by Evans et al. demonstrated that the pain and memory of the procedure&#xD;
      between children receiving either nitrous oxide versus children receiving intramuscular&#xD;
      meperidine in combination with promethazine for fracture reduction was similar, but there was&#xD;
      increased satisfaction and decreased length of stay in the nitrous oxide group. Seith et al.&#xD;
      demonstrated that the addition of intranasal fentanyl to nitrous oxide in children resulted&#xD;
      in deeper levels of sedation when compared to nitrous oxide alone; however, there were no&#xD;
      serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitrous oxide use during ketamine administration may be an ideal combination for the&#xD;
      prevention of emergence reaction in adults sedated in the ED. Like ketamine, nitrous oxide&#xD;
      has an excellent cardio-respiratory profile as well as some analgesic and anxiolytic&#xD;
      qualities. The anxiety and pain surrounding procedural sedation is not limited to the&#xD;
      procedure itself, but the elapsed time from the time the patient enters the ED to the time&#xD;
      spent in preparation for the procedure can be significant and lead to increased anxiety,&#xD;
      which may exacerbate emergence reactions in adults. Using nitrous oxide before ketamine&#xD;
      administration may mitigate this. While midazolam has shown efficacy in reducing emergence&#xD;
      reactions in adults sedated with ketamine, we believe that inhaled nitrous oxide may be&#xD;
      equivalent to midazolam, with a better cardio-respiratory profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this is a novel concept, we believe that a pilot study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of 50/50 nitrous oxide/oxygen administration with adult ketamine administration is&#xD;
      warranted.&#xD;
