      TITLE: Clinical tolerance of a live, attenuated influenza vaccine (FluMist®) in the context&#xD;
      of influenza immunization in a population of egg-allergic children: A pilot project. Protocol&#xD;
      #: FluMist240713.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Canada, the flu vaccine is indicated for all children between 6 and 23 months of age.&#xD;
           Epidemiologic and clinical studies have demonstrated that these children have a higher&#xD;
           risk of complication and a higher rate of hospitalisation due to influenza. Trivalent&#xD;
           inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV), which are administered intramuscularly, have long&#xD;
           been used for preventative vaccination in this population. FluMist® is a live attenuated&#xD;
           influenza vaccine (LAIV) administrated intranasally, which has been approved for use in&#xD;
           Canada since 2010[1 ]. Besides avoiding the inconvenience and the anxiety related to&#xD;
           intramuscular vaccines, FluMist® offers a better protection against influenza than the&#xD;
           TIV. The Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends the&#xD;
           preferential use of LAIV over TIV for influenza immunization in children 24 months old&#xD;
           and over. Furthermore, LAIV use is favoured for children with chronic disease and those&#xD;
           suffering from non-severe asthma [ 2].&#xD;
&#xD;
           The influenza vaccine is manufactured using chicken egg embryos and as such, contains&#xD;
           minimal residual quantities of ovalbumin (egg protein). In patients with an egg allergy,&#xD;
           numerous clinical studies have demonstrated that its administration is safe with very&#xD;
           little risk of anaphylactic reaction. Therefore, egg allergy is no longer a&#xD;
           contra-indication to receiving TIV and these patients can now receive this vaccine&#xD;
           without further precautions in CLSCs and doctors' offices[3 ,4 ]. There are no studies&#xD;
           on the safety of LAIV administration in egg-allergic patients. As egg-allergic patients&#xD;
           often have other atopic related comorbidities such as asthma, the increased protection&#xD;
           against influenza which can be achieved with LAIV is desirable. The egg protein content&#xD;
           in LAIV is comparable to that in TIV and its administration is intranasal rather than&#xD;
           systemic. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that LAIV administration in&#xD;
           egg-allergic patients is as safe as TIV administration in this same population. Yet,&#xD;
           before recommending LAIV in egg-allergic patients, a study on its safety in this&#xD;
           population is essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Use of eggs in the production of influenza vaccines&#xD;
&#xD;
           Because viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, vaccines against viruses must be&#xD;
           produced using human or animal cells. Influenza vaccines currently used in Canada are&#xD;
           produced by allowing the virus to multiply in chicken egg embryos. Despite rigorous&#xD;
           purification processes, these vaccines, including Flumist®, still contain low residual&#xD;
           quantities of ovalbumin (egg protein). The quantity of residual ovalbumin differs, at&#xD;
           times significantly, between the different commercial influenza vaccines available in&#xD;
           Canada, but also between different lots of the same vaccine [3]. While manufacturers&#xD;
           have to assure that the influenza vaccines destined for the Canadian market do not&#xD;
           contain more than 0.24 µg/dose of residual ovalbumin[ ], they are not required to&#xD;
           divulge the final quantity. For this reason, a theoretical risk of anaphylaxis or&#xD;
           hypersensitivity still exists in egg-allergic patients. However, the real risk of an&#xD;
           anaphylactic reaction after an intramuscular influenza vaccination in an egg-allergic&#xD;
           patent is quite low[1].&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Prevalence and clinical presentation of egg allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
           Egg allergy is one of the most common food allergies[6]. Studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
           1 to 2% of young children could be allergic to eggs, which represents approximately 800&#xD;
           children in the 12 to 23 month age group in Quebec[7 ,8]. This allergy is often&#xD;
           diagnosed around 18 months of age, when egg is introduced into the child's diet. Almost&#xD;
           half of egg-allergic children are identified around 10 months of age[9 ,10 ]. We&#xD;
           estimate that this allergy will have completely disappeared by the age of 5 in 66% of&#xD;
           allergic children and 7 years of age in by 75%[11 ,12 ]. In the last decades, the&#xD;
           duration of egg hypersensitivity seems to have increased until late childhood and&#xD;
           sometimes into adolescence[13 ]. Persistent egg allergy into adulthood is rare.&#xD;
           Persistent egg allergy essentially remains a paediatric issue. We can, therefore,&#xD;
           estimate that in Quebec, there are over 3000 egg-allergic children between 1 and 9 years&#xD;
           of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The clinical presentation of egg allergy varies significantly. The signs and symptoms of&#xD;
           IgE mediated allergic reactions can touch many systems and can have variable intensity,&#xD;
           ranging from mild to severe. Symptoms can occur within a few minutes to several hours&#xD;
           after ingestion of an egg-containing product, but the majority of allergic reactions&#xD;
           occur within 30 minutes of contact[9]. The incidence of severe allergic reactions&#xD;
           (anaphylaxis) to eggs is rare. We estimate that 7 to 10% of all declared anaphylactic&#xD;
           reactions are due to egg protein[14 ].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SAFETY OF VACCINES IN EGG-ALLERGIC PATIENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Safety of the influenza vaccine in egg-allergic patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1976, an outbreak of porcine H1N1 influenza A was observed in American army recruitment&#xD;
      camps in Fort Dix, New Jersey. Despite this outbreak being relatively limited to recruitment&#xD;
      camps, American health authorities implemented, in the general population, a massive&#xD;
      vaccination campaign against this influenza strain. Before being abruptly stopped because of&#xD;
      an increase in the number of cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, over 48 million people had&#xD;
      been vaccinations against this disease. Jointly to the mass vaccination campaign, the CDC had&#xD;
      implemented a national surveillance program for post-vaccination side effects and had only 11&#xD;
      cases of post vaccination anaphylaxis registered. None of these cases occurred in&#xD;
      egg-allergic patients. However, we are unaware of the number of people vaccinated who had an&#xD;
      egg allergy, which limits the scope of the observed results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies completed thereafter in egg-allergic children tended to demonstrate that this vaccine&#xD;
      could safely be administered. A review of the literature of 27 studies prior to 2012 (table&#xD;
      1) consisting of 4172 egg-allergic patients vaccinated with TVI was published by our&#xD;
      group[3]. Amongst these patients, no cases of severe allergic reactions were observed. The&#xD;
      most common observed allergic reactions were mild (local erythema, local or distal urticaria,&#xD;
      mildly wheezy breathing), though 1 patient did present generalized urticaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since then, some other studies on this subject have been published. More specifically, the&#xD;
      study by Greemhawt et al[15 ] demonstrated via retrospective and prospective cohorts, the&#xD;
      safety of single dose TIV vaccination in severely egg-allergic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, a multicenter study conducted by our group over 5 influenza vaccine seasons&#xD;
      permitted a better estimate of the risk of allergic reaction. Four hundred and fifty-seven&#xD;
      doses of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine were administered to 367 patients of which&#xD;
      132 (153 doses) reported a severe allergic reaction to eggs[4]. Four patient reported&#xD;
      possible mild reactions secondary to previous influenza vaccines (1 urticaria, 2 vomiting and&#xD;
      1 eczema), but no severe allergic reactions were observed during the study. Thirteen patients&#xD;
      developed mild allergic appearing symptoms in the 24 hours following vaccine administration&#xD;
      but none of the 367 patients developed an anaphylactic reaction. Using a 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval (Clopper-Pearson exact CI), the obtained results of this study allowed us to&#xD;
      estimate a risk of anaphylaxis between 0 and 0.08% (0 to 1 on 1250 doses) for global&#xD;
      population of egg-allergic patients and between 0 to 0.62% (0 to 1 on 161 doses) for patients&#xD;
      with history of severe allergic reaction to eggs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this study, the Quebec immunisation protocol (PIQ) was amended and now permits the&#xD;
      administration of the influenza vaccine in egg-allergic patients in a single dose and in&#xD;
      usual vaccination centers. Since these changes were implemented in the PIQ, no cases of&#xD;
      anaphylaxis or death have been reported in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Safety of LAIV (Flumist®)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two formulations of FluMist® have been studied worldwide: a frozen (0.5ml/dose) and a&#xD;
      refrigerated (0.2ml/dose). These 2 formulations are produced from the same viral strains and&#xD;
      have a comparable degree of clinical efficacy. However, only the refrigerated (0.2ml/dose)&#xD;
      formulation is authorised for use in Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FluMist® is composed of attenuated viruses which cannot replicate at the temperature of the&#xD;
      nasal mucosa. The most often reported side effects are nasal congestion and rhinorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since people receiving this vaccine can excrete the virus in their nasal secretions in the&#xD;
      days following vaccination, it is recommended to avoid this vaccine in immunocompromised&#xD;
      patients and healthcare workers who are in contact with immunocompromised patients.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is recommended to avoid this vaccine in patients with severe asthma (defined&#xD;
      as an individual on oral corticosteroid therapy or on high dose inhaled corticosteroids or an&#xD;
      individual with wheezing on auscultation) (see section 3.4) and egg-allergic patients (see&#xD;
      section 3.3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Safety of LAIV (Flumist®) in egg-allergic patients: risk associated with a potential&#xD;
      allergen administered intranasally&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the quantity of residual ovalbumine was measured by independent laboratories, only very&#xD;
      low quantities were found, ranging between 0.00013 to 0.0017 µg per 0.2ml dose. The quantity&#xD;
      of egg protein found in the intranasal vaccine is therefore, similar to that found in the&#xD;
      TVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the different mode of administration between the TIV and the LAIV (intramuscular versus&#xD;
      intranasal), it is important to underline the potentially different absorption of ovalbumin&#xD;
      and its impact on the risk of an allergic reaction. Some studies have analyzed the absorption&#xD;
      and the physiologic response when a food allergen is administered intranasally. More&#xD;
      specifically, Clark et al[16 ] used the method of intranasal peanut provocation in allergic&#xD;
      patients to evaluate the thermographic changes in nasal temperature. In their double-blinded&#xD;
      provocation study, 10 µg of sterilized peanut extract was used for a nasal provocation and&#xD;
      among the 16 patients, none presented systemic symptoms. Taking into account that the&#xD;
      quantity of ovalbumin in LAIV is usually less than 0.24 µg per dose[1], and that the&#xD;
      theoretic dose of food allergen is 40 times higher in the Clark et al study, the risk of an&#xD;
      allergic reaction associated with the administration of LAIV in a egg-allergic population&#xD;
      seems very low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, when the systemic absorption of intranasally administered medications is compared&#xD;
      to their oral form, it is much less important[17 ]. Ratner et al[18 ] demonstrated that the&#xD;
      absorption of beclomethasone was approximately four times less than when administered&#xD;
      intranasally. The quantity of ovalbumine which will truly be absorbed is probably&#xD;
      significantly less than 0.24 µg contained in the LAIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Safety of Flumist® in asthmatic patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike American recommendations which suggest to avoid LAIV in all asthmatic patients[19 ],&#xD;
      the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) of the Public Health Agency of Canada&#xD;
      (PHAC) recommends this vaccine in asthmatic patients except those with severe asthma defined&#xD;
      as asthmatic individuals on oral corticosteroids or on high dose inhaled corticosteroids or&#xD;
      asthmatic individuals with wheezing on auscultation[4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike American recommendations, Health Canada recommendations are based on more recent&#xD;
      studies. Many studies have demonstrated the efficacy and the safety of using LAIV in a&#xD;
      population of moderately to severely but stable asthmatic individuals. In 2003, Flemming et&#xD;
      al[20 ] demonstrated in 2000 asthmatic children and adolescents a better efficacy of LAIV as&#xD;
      well as an asthma exacerbation rate similar to TIV. Furthermore, Redding et al[21 ] studied&#xD;
      the safety of LAVI in 1997 with 48 patients between 9 to 17 years old with moderate to severe&#xD;
      but stable asthma. The percentage of change in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) evaluated up&#xD;
      until the fifth day was similar between the vaccinated and the placebo group (0.2% versus&#xD;
      0.4%, p=0.78).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 Intradermic testing with the flu vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intradermic testing with the flu vaccine does not detect egg-allergic patients who are at&#xD;
      greater risk of developing an allergic reaction after administration of the flu vaccine.&#xD;
      Therefore, its use in not recommended[22 ].&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. AIM&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is verify the clinical tolerance of the inactivated, attenuated flu&#xD;
      vaccine (Flumist®) in an egg-allergic population. More specifically, we will estimate the&#xD;
      risk of severe allergic reactions in the 24 hours following vaccination with Flumist® in&#xD;
      egg-allergic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Population :&#xD;
&#xD;

      4.1.1.1 Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children between 2 and 17 years of age with a confirmed egg allergy and for whom the flu&#xD;
      vaccine is indicated because they are considered at high risk or because they desire&#xD;
      protection against the flu virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.1.2 Confirmation of an egg allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmation of an egg allergy requires a set of criteria which vary depending on whether or&#xD;
      not they have ever eaten eggs.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             6. Weakness or altered level of consciousness&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. All other reactions requiring administration of epinephrine&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. confirmation of the allergy by one of the following methods within 6 months of the&#xD;
           reaction:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. a positive egg skin prick test (diameter of induration &gt; 3 mm more than the&#xD;
                negative control (saline) read 10 to 15 minutes after the procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. a specific egg IgE level &gt;0.35 kIU/L&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.1.4 In patients never having consumed eggs or egg containing products or with an&#xD;
      uncertain clinical history of reaction to eggs, the diagnosis must be confirmed by the&#xD;
      following 2 methods in the 6 months following the reaction:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a positive egg skin pric test and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a specific egg IgE level measured by ImmunoCAP of: &gt; 2kIU/L in children less than 2&#xD;
           years old or &gt; 7kIU/L in children 2 years old and over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.1.5 Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      We could not vaccinate patients with the following conditions. However, some of these&#xD;
      conditions can be temporary as they are reversible. Therefore, vaccination must be done at a&#xD;
      moment when the situation has improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. poorly controlled asthma on the day of vaccination defined by the presence of wheezy&#xD;
           breathing and/or cough at the time of vaccination or wheezing on auscultation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. severe asthma defined as an individual on oral corticosteroids or on high dose inhaled&#xD;
           corticosteroids;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the presence of an urticarial rash on physical exam;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the use of antihistamines (first or second generation) 3 to 7 days (respectively) before&#xD;
           vaccination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. the presence of a moderate to severe acute illness (with for example, fever,&#xD;
           irritability, inconsolable crying, lethargy, abnormal fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea,&#xD;
           pallor, cyanosis or diaphoresis);&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. immunocompromised patients and healthcare workers in contact with immunocompromised&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.2 Control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 individuals without a history of egg allergy, never having received the intranasal flu&#xD;
      vaccine will be recruited. These control subjects will be recruited in a manner to allow a&#xD;
      similar age distribution to the allergic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.2.1 Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children between 2 and 17 years of age without a history of egg allergy and for whom there is&#xD;
      an indication for the flu vaccine because they are considered at risk for complications or&#xD;
      because they desire a protection against the flu virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.2.2 Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      They are the same as in the case group. See section 4.1.1.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.3 Identification of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergic patients will be contacted starting in October to inform them of this project. This&#xD;
      will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Known allergic patients who will be contacted by their allergists themselves;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients of pediatricians and general practitioners who have been informed of the&#xD;
           project and who will have been referred;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The department of allergy and immunology will sent to known egg-allergic patients a&#xD;
           letter informing them of the project and inviting them to take an appointment at the&#xD;
           clinic. These patients will be identified by, among other things, lists of positive egg&#xD;
           specific IgE levels done in the last 24 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. As needed, an ad for the project, in written media or electronically, could be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls will be recruited at the allergy clinic at Ste-Justine hospital. These patients may&#xD;
      be followed for allergies but will not have an egg allergy. Controls may also be recruited by&#xD;
      ads in social media or by other services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Clinical procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the vaccination day, participants will have to follow the procedure below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A research nurse will explain to the parents of the participants what is to be expected&#xD;
           in the context of this project. She will ask the patients to read the consent form for&#xD;
           the project. She will mention that there will be a follow-up by telephone 24 hours after&#xD;
           the vaccination to ask about the clinical status of the child. Those who accept will&#xD;
           have to sign the consent form. If they do not accept, they will be vaccinated using TIV&#xD;
           according to the current recommendation of Quebec public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the context of the clinical approach of our service, parents will fill out an&#xD;
           auto-administered questionnaire on the clinical history of their child's egg allergy.&#xD;
           This questionnaire will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. The allergist will&#xD;
           verify the answers with the parents and will proceed to examine the child including an&#xD;
           examination of the skin and pulmonary auscultation at most 30 minutes prior to&#xD;
           vaccination. For the control subjects, the physical exam will also be done by the&#xD;
           allergist in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For children with an egg allergy, a clinical revaluation (skin prick test and egg&#xD;
           specific IgE levels by ImmunoCap) will be done if the latest values are more than 6&#xD;
           months old or if they are not adequately documented. This test will take approximately&#xD;
           15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The vaccine used will be the live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) i.e Flumist® by&#xD;
           AstraZeneca. As the egg allergen (ovalbumin) content in LAIV is comparable to the&#xD;
           intramuscularly administered vaccine and that the risk of allergic reaction with TIV has&#xD;
           been shown to be very low when administered in a single dose, the intranasal vaccine&#xD;
           Flumist® will be administered by the nurse or doctor in a single dose of 0.2ml&#xD;
           intranasally, as recommended by the manufacturer. This vaccination will be followed by a&#xD;
           60 minute observation period. We will examine the child 60 minutes after vaccination and&#xD;
           at any time if the child, parent or personnel suspects an allergic reaction or adverse&#xD;
           effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The wait time after the vaccination will occur in the waiting room of the allergy clinic&#xD;
           under the supervision of a nurse. We will ask the parents and the child to inform the&#xD;
           doctor or the nurse if they observe any of the following manifestations: erythema,&#xD;
           pruritis, rash, sneezing, rhinorrhea, tearing, nasal congestion, voice change, cough,&#xD;
           difficulty breathing, noisy breathing, pallor, weakness, vomiting or diarrhea. We will&#xD;
           ask them to also advise the members of the research team of any other reactions or&#xD;
           concerning states.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Before leaving, parents will be questioned on the presence of allergic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If a reaction occurs, it will be treated based on the allergist or supervision doctor&#xD;
           decision. The allergy clinic where vaccination will occur is equipped with the necessary&#xD;
           material to treat an allergic reaction i.e. epinephrine, oral and injectable&#xD;
           diphenhydramine, inhaled salbutamol, oral and intravenous corticosteroids and oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Telephone follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
           All parents will receive an emergency phone number to contact in case of allergic&#xD;
           reaction within the 24 hours following vaccination. This will be the contact information&#xD;
           of the principal investigator of the project, Dr Anne Des Roches, or the allergist on&#xD;
           call if she is absent. Moreover, the phone number will also be provided to the&#xD;
           telephonists of Ste-Justine Hospital who can call Dr Des Roches or the allergist on&#xD;
           call. She (or he) will evaluate the patient for a biphasic reaction or for a delayed&#xD;
           reaction or could have the patient come to the allergy clinic or refer the patient to&#xD;
           the emergency department according to the situation. Parents will be advised to contact&#xD;
           emergency services first if there is a severe delayed reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Parents will be called the following day to enquire about the presence of any allergic&#xD;
           manifestation that could have appeared in the 24 hours following vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2.1 Second dose&#xD;
&#xD;
           Children between 2 and 8 years of age, who have never received a trivalent seasonal flu&#xD;
           vaccine and who have tolerated the first dose, will be invited to a second appointment&#xD;
           to receive a booster dose, 1 month later. The second dose will be followed by on&#xD;
           observation period of 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
           As this is a pilot project, we aim to recruit of 100 egg-allergic patients and 100&#xD;
           control patients. According to the results, a multicentre study on a large number of&#xD;
           egg-allergic patients could be done at a later time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4 Primary outcome and statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary outcome will be the presence of anaphylactic reactions following flu&#xD;
           vaccination with LAIV. An anaphylactic reaction will be defined according to the&#xD;
           Brighton Collaboration criteria, an international organization that standardises the&#xD;
           criteria defining vaccine side effects[23].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary outcomes will be the presence of all allergic manifestations as described in&#xD;
           section 4.1.1.3 within the 24 hours following flu vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will compare the proportion of patients and control presenting allergic symptoms&#xD;
           using the exact Fisher test. We will estimate the risk of anaphylaxis and its 95%&#xD;
           confidence interval using the Clopper-Pearson exact method.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5 Schedule and surveillance of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study will be conducted over a period of 6 months, i.e. from October 2013 to March&#xD;
           2014, which corresponds to the flu vaccination period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An analysis of the data pertaining to anaphylactic reaction will be compiled regularly&#xD;
           by the study's principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will cease if one of the following situations occurs during the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  if a child develops fatal or almost fatal reaction;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  if more than 2% of children develop reactions requiring epinephrine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
                5. Risks and benefits of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
           For egg-allergic patients who desire the flu vaccine, the risk of participation in this&#xD;
           study is the risk of developing an allergic reaction following Flumist® vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although nasal congestion, rhinorrhea and cough are the most common reported side&#xD;
           effects in patients receiving this vaccine, if an allergic reaction occurs, it could&#xD;
           manifest as more important nasal symptoms (congestion, rhinorrhea, pruritis, sneezing,&#xD;
           edema), as well as oral symptoms or systemic symptoms, accompanied by pruritis,&#xD;
           urticaria, wheezy breathing or, in severe cases, hypotension, throat swelling or&#xD;
           tightness and/or difficulty breathing. An allergic reaction can also present as nausea,&#xD;
           abdominal pain and/or sudden vomiting. Patients will be monitored closely during the&#xD;
           whole procedure, as well as in the hour following it for the onset of these symptoms. If&#xD;
           need be, they will be seen by the study doctor who will evaluate the need for&#xD;
           antihistamines, epinephrine, corticosteroids or who will institute specialized&#xD;
           techniques to maintain vital functions. The risk of a severe reaction is probably very&#xD;
           low considering the low egg content in the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the control group, there is no additional medical risk to participating in this&#xD;
           study, as they will be receiving the seasonal flu vaccine in the same manner that they&#xD;
           would if they were not participating in the study and no supplemental procedure will be&#xD;
           necessary except for an observation period of 60 minutes, a follow-up telephone call 24&#xD;
           hours after vaccination and a short medical questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aside from a more stringent observation for reactions to the vaccine, controls will not&#xD;
           encounter any direct benefits to their participation in this study. For the case&#xD;
           participants, the intranasal flu vaccine will allow them to obtain a better protection&#xD;
           against the seasonal flu vaccine than received with TIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Furthermore, if the results obtained confirm the safety of FluMist® in egg-allergic&#xD;
           patients, this will allow reassurance of healthcare professional of the safety of&#xD;
           vaccination in egg-allergic patients. More long term, this will allow egg-allergic&#xD;
           patients to receive the LAIV rather than being limited to TIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6. Medications under investigation The FluMist® vaccine made by AstraZeneca will be&#xD;
           provided and routed to Ste-Justine Hospital by the National Institute of Public Health&#xD;
           under the specific storage conditions set by the manufacturer. The vaccines will be&#xD;
           under the conditions required by the manufacturer in the Ste-Justine research center,&#xD;
           under the responsibility of the principal investigator. The Ste-Justine research center&#xD;
           is equipped with a refrigerator with temperature control monitors, allowing for&#xD;
           verification of all changes in temperature which can then be reported to the principal&#xD;
           investigator. Vaccines will be stored in a safe and secure environment. Information&#xD;
           pertaining to the arrival of the vaccines, the doses administered and the return or&#xD;
           destruction (if warranted) of the vaccines will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7. Protection of data&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data compiled from this study will be anonymized and entered into an Excel database.&#xD;
           The database will be kept on a Ste-Justine computer which can only be accessed by the&#xD;
           research team. The computer is username and password protected and is situated in a&#xD;
           locked office.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8. Adverse reactions to medication report In this study, Canadian regulations will apply&#xD;
           for the reporting of serious adverse effects. For medications used in the context of&#xD;
           clinical trials in Canada, only serious and unexpected adverse effects must be rapidly&#xD;
           reported to Health Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serious but expected adverse effects and serious therapeutic incidents observed during&#xD;
           the clinical trial but not considered secondary to the product in question, whether they&#xD;
           are expected or not, do not require expedited reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A report will be completed in the following cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - in the 15 days following the moment when the situation if known, if the effect is not&#xD;
           fatal but puts the patient's life in danger;&#xD;
&#xD;
           - as soon as possible in the 7 days following the moment when the situation if known, if&#xD;
           death occurs or if the effect can put the patient's life in danger;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  in the 8 days following the notification of Health Canada of adverse effects, a&#xD;
                detailed report containing an estimation of the importance of the repercussions and&#xD;
                findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each case of adverse effects subject to expedited declaration will undergo a distinct&#xD;
           declaration consisting of the all the elements required in Health Canada guidelines/ICH&#xD;
           E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data pertaining to the harmlessness of a medication will be communicated in an ongoing&#xD;
           process to the research ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
           9. Surveillance of data security committee&#xD;
&#xD;
           A committee to monitor the security of the collected data shall be formed by&#xD;
           professionals who are not implicated in the elaboration of this protocol. The&#xD;
           regulations set out by Health Canada shall be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary responsibilities of this committee shall be the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Periodic meetings (approximately every 2 months or more if necessary) to evaluate&#xD;
                the study results in respect to security, the management of the study and the&#xD;
                progress of recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To elaborate recommendations on the continuation, modification or cessation of the&#xD;
                study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To evaluation compiled serious adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           10. Ethics Parents who do not wish to sign the consent form can get their children&#xD;
           vaccinated with TIV according to the regular clinical protocol as recommended by Quebec&#xD;
           public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The information and consent forms will explain to the control group that they must&#xD;
           remain in the clinic for a longer period of time after vaccination then would be&#xD;
           normally required (60 versus 15 minutes) and that they will have to fill out a short&#xD;
           medical questionnaire as well as receive a follow-up phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The safety of patients will be assured by providing vaccination in a center equipped&#xD;
           with all the necessary material and personnel to rapidly respond to an anaphylactic&#xD;
           reaction, rapid access to an emergency department and close observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Questionnaire will only identified by number and only this number will be used in the&#xD;
           database to ensure confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           11. Schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
