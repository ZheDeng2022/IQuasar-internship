    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of navitoclax when given&#xD;
      together with sorafenib tosylate in treating patients with solid tumors that have returned&#xD;
      (relapsed) or do not respond to treatment (refractory). Navitoclax and sorafenib tosylate may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of navitoclax and&#xD;
      sorafenib tosylate (sorafenib) in patients with advanced solid tumors. (Dose escalation&#xD;
      cohort) II. To better characterize the toxicity profile of the combination of navitoclax and&#xD;
      sorafenib. (Dose expansion cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify any activity of this treatment combination in patients with metastatic cancer.&#xD;
      (Dose escalation cohort) II. To seek preliminary evidence of activity of this treatment&#xD;
      combination in patients with hepatoma. (Dose expansion cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether the combination of navitoclax and sorafenib induces apoptosis that&#xD;
      can be detected by peripheral blood biomarker analysis. (Dose escalation cohort) II. To&#xD;
      assess peripheral blood biomarkers and pharmacokinetics in a more homogenous population.&#xD;
      (Dose expansion cohort) III. To determine whether treatment is associated with Mcl-1 down&#xD;
      regulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). (Dose&#xD;
      expansion cohort) IV. To assess in a preliminary fashion whether pretreatment tumor cell&#xD;
      levels of Mcl-1 predict response to this regimen through serial biopsies. (Dose expansion&#xD;
      cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of navitoclax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive navitoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 (days 1-28 cycle of 1&#xD;
      only) and sorafenib tosylate PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 21 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Will be defined as the dose level below the lowest dose that induces dose-limiting toxicity in at least one-third of patients (at least 2 of a maximum of 6 new patients) per National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.) 4.0.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be graded per NCI CTCAE v. 4.0. The number and severity of all adverse events (overall, by dose-level, and by tumor group) will be tabulated and summarized in this patient population. The grade 3+ adverse events will also be described and summarized in a similar fashion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline version 1.1. Response will be summarized by simple descriptive summary statistics delineating complete and partial responses as well as stable and progressive disease. The waterfall plot may be used to display best tumor response. Exploratory analysis of the relationship between response and other clinical endpoints may be performed.</description>

    <measure>Changes in levels of cleaved cytokeratin 18 (expansion cohort only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day -7 up to day 8</time_frame>
    <description>To assess changes in each antigen, dot plots will be constructed with H-score on the Y axis and pre-or post-treatment status on the X axis, looking for patterns of change that emerge. To assess whether changes occur predominantly in one direction, a sign test will be applied.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in hepatoma Mcl-1 expression level in tumor tissue (expansion cohort only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between pretreatment Mcl-1 expression and clinical response will be examined in a post hoc and exploratory fashion. To assess the relationship between Mcl-1 and response the H score (0-300) vs. response will be graphed. Chi-squared tests will be used to assess significance of relationships between these dichotomous variables and response. In addition, associations between molecular markers and time-to-event variables (progression-free-survival [PFS]) will be illustrated graphically using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests in an exploratory fashion.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cleaved and total CK18 levels in serum</measure>
    <time_frame>Day -7 to up to day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Will be summarized descriptively and plotted along time by dose levels and as a whole. The changes of the serum levels of cleaved and total CK18 at each time point against pre-treatment baseline will be correlated with toxicity and clinical endpoints. The relationships between cleaved and total CK18, caspase 3 and cytochrome c at various time points and dose levels will be explored in longitudinal data analysis. Tissue expression of Mcl-1 will be correlated with serum levels of cleaved and total CK18 at different time points and clinical toxicity and tumor response.</description>

             voriconazole, posaconazole, nefazodone, and clarithromycin are prohibited; NOTE:&#xD;
             moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be used with caution; navitoclax is a moderate&#xD;
             inhibitor of CYP2C8 and a strong inhibitor of CYP2C9; caution should be exercised when&#xD;
             dosing navitoclax concurrently with CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 substrates; common CYP2C8&#xD;
             substrates include paclitaxel, statins and repaglinide; CYP2C9 substrates include&#xD;
             celecoxib, phenytoin and warfarin; when possible, investigators should switch to&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of strong CYP3A4/5 inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin,&#xD;
             and St. John's wort are prohibited&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate&#xD;
                  contraception; NOTE: should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
                  while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
                  treating physician immediately; the effects of navitoclax on the developing human&#xD;
                  fetus are unknown; for this reason and because other therapeutic agents used in&#xD;
                  this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men&#xD;
                  must agree to use adequate contraception using one of the methods listed below&#xD;
                  prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and up to 90 days&#xD;
                  following completion of therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Total abstinence from sexual intercourse (minimum one complete menstrual&#xD;
                       cycle prior to study drug administration)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Hormonal contraceptives (oral, parenteral, transdermal or vaginal ring) for&#xD;
                       at least 3 months prior to study drug administration; if the subject is&#xD;
                       currently using a hormonal contraceptive, she should also use a barrier&#xD;
                       method during this study and for 1 month after study completion&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Double-barrier method: male condom plus diaphragm or vaginal cap with&#xD;
