      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the induction of immune responses against CV9104&#xD;
      administered by conventional intradermal injection or with a needle-free intradermal&#xD;
      injection device and to assess the safety and tolerability of CV9104 administered by&#xD;
      conventional intradermal injection versus injection with a needle-free intradermal injection&#xD;
      device versus no injection.&#xD;

      This study is the second clinical trial of the RNActive® vaccine. It is composed of 6&#xD;
      RNActive® drug product components, coding for 6 antigens that are overexpressed in PCA&#xD;
      compared to healthy tissue. Each of the 6 prostate specific antigens that are encoded by&#xD;
      CV9104 are capable of inducing adaptive immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Needle-free injection systems, like the Tropis® device for i.d. injection, overcome the&#xD;
      disadvantages related to needle- and syringe-based i.d. injections. Tropis® is currently used&#xD;
      in different vaccine clinical trials around the world. The use of Tropis® for i.d. delivery&#xD;
      of CV9104 has been approved by BfArM.&#xD;
