      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      omeprazole in combination with domperidone in GERD treatment for subsequent efficient&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy of GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the trial To assess the efficacy of omeprazole in combination with domperidone&#xD;
      regarding change of incidence and severity of clinical symptoms of GERD during 8 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment To compare the efficacy of omeprazole in combination with domperidone regarding&#xD;
      change of incidence and severity of clinical symptoms of GERD during 8 weeks of treatment To&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of omeprazole in combination with domperidone regarding change of&#xD;
      incidence and severity of endoscopic symptoms of GERD during 8 weeks of treatment To compare&#xD;
      the efficacy of omeprazole in combination with domperidone regarding change of incidence and&#xD;
      severity of endoscopic symptoms of GERD during 8 weeks of treatment To determine the&#xD;
      efficiency and advantages of one GERD therapy considering efficacy, safety, and individual&#xD;
      variance of patients' reactions&#xD;

      Study design . Primary and secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • reduced incidence and severity of heartburn after 8 weeks of treatment with Omez-DSR&#xD;
      preparation in comparison with OMEZ preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduced severity of heartburn estimated against visual analog scale after 8 weeks of&#xD;
           treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of events of heartburn after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  proportion of patients with completely jugulated heartburn at the 4th and 8th weeks of&#xD;
           treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of days without heartburn after 4 weeks of treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  proportion of patients with resolved esophagitis after 8 weeks of treatment in subjects&#xD;
           with esophagitis at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of adverse events in the group of patients who received at least one dose of&#xD;
           the medicinal product after randomization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of serious adverse events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of severe adverse events;&#xD;

&#xD;
      13.3. Phases of the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening - preliminary selection of subjects according to clinical criteria; signing of&#xD;
           informed consent; prescription and conduction of screening procedures; decision on&#xD;
           inclusion/exclusion of subject from the trial on the grounds of the results of screening&#xD;
           procedures according to inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomization - random distribution of subjects included into the trial into two groups:&#xD;
           group 1 - treatment with tested Omez-DSR preparation, group 2 - treatment with the&#xD;
           comparator Omez.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treatment - patients receive either Omez-DSR preparation or Omez preparation in the&#xD;
           prescribed regimen according to the randomization number. Treatment shall be ambulatory;&#xD;
           patients shall visit research center through specified periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After the end of treatment patients shall return to their usual lifestyle, but they are&#xD;
           monitored to assess the efficacy of the therapy conducted and to record adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of measures allowing reducing the bias factor Randomization Randomization at&#xD;
      phase 2 shall be performed using the WinPepi statistical program, option Masking Partial&#xD;
      masking shall be used. Assessment of endoscopic examination at week 8 of treatment shall be&#xD;
      blinded; the specialist conducting endoscopy shall not know which therapy was used.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis shall be performed after coding of subjects; and during analysis it&#xD;
      shall not be known which of the groups is receiving Omez-DSR, and which one - Omez.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of treatment Medical preparations authorized in the Republic of Belarus shall be&#xD;
      used in the trial: Omez-DSR and Omez.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage Dosage shall be performed in accordance with label recommendations of Omez-DSR and&#xD;
      Omez preparations. Dose of Omez shall be 2 capsules/day (40 mg of omeprazole). Dose of&#xD;
      Omez-DSR shall be 2 capsules/day (40 mg of omeprazole and 60 mg of domperidone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen Medicinal preparations shall be prescribed after randomization. Group 1 or OM-DP: the&#xD;
      subjects from this group shall be supplied the preparation enough for 8 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
      Group 2 or OM: the subjects shall be supplied the preparation enough for 8 weeks.&#xD;
