  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lower back pain (CLBP) is a significant health care issue in the United States and&#xD;
      the world. CLBP contributes to decreased quality of life, decreased function and increased&#xD;
      utilization of health care resources. The causes of CLBP tend to be multi-factorial.&#xD;
      Arthropathy of the lumbar facet joints is thought to be a common etiology (15-45%).&#xD;
      Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) of the medial branch nerve of the facet joint is a&#xD;
      well-established treatment modality used to decrease facet joint pains. However, a wide range&#xD;
      of temperature is being used (70-90 degrees Celsius). In addition, the optimal temperature&#xD;
      that provides the best patient outcomes with the least side effects is not well established&#xD;
      in the pain management literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine if lumbar facets medial branches RFA at 90 degrees Celsius provides&#xD;
      more overall pain relief (i.e., percent of improvement), when compared to ablation at 80&#xD;
      degrees Celsius with no additional adverse events. Furthermore, ablation of the lumbar facets&#xD;
      nerve supply at 90 degrees Celsius will provide better improvement in the functionality&#xD;
      level, general mood and quality of life as measured by VAS ( Visual Analog Scale) pain score,&#xD;
      Pain Disability Index (PDI), McGill Pain questioner scores and Beck Inventory (BI) scores as&#xD;
      those receiving the ablation at 80 degrees Celsius. Also, it is associated with less opioid&#xD;
      consumption, no additional unwanted adverse events and/or complications along with less need&#xD;
      to repeat RFA procedure over one year period.&#xD;
