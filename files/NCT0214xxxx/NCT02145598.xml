  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, blinded, 2-arm phase IIb trial that will compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Lenalidomide maintenance after Bortezomib/Melphalan/Prednison (VMP)&#xD;
      induction to VMP without maintenance (Placebo). In addition the trial will assess the&#xD;
      treatment of Revlimid/low dose Dexamethasone (Rd) as Salvage after VMP without sufficient&#xD;
      response (less than PR) in an observational arm. Key eligibility criteria include patients&#xD;
      with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and who are 65 years of age or older or are not&#xD;
      candidates for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Patients with&#xD;
      poor performance status or serious coexistent medical conditions will be excluded from this&#xD;
      study. After registration all patients receive 6 cycles VMP (modified according to Mateos et&#xD;
      al.). Patients who receive at least a PR and completed VMP can be randomized to either&#xD;
      Lenalidomide 10 mg/d continuously maintenance or to placebo. Randomization will be stratified&#xD;
      according to the quality of response after VMP induction (PR vs. VGPR + stringent complete&#xD;
      remission [sCR] + CR). Patients that are not able to complete VMP due to toxicity but reached&#xD;
      at least a PR after a minimum of four cycles of therapy should immediately proceed to&#xD;
      randomization. Blinded phase continues until progression or end of study. After unblinding,&#xD;
      patients who received placebo should be treated with Rd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that do not reach PR after induction with VMP or are progressive during treatment&#xD;
      with VMP should not be randomized, but switched to the observation arm and treated with Rd&#xD;
      immediately. The study treatment ends with the confirmed progression on maintenance treatment&#xD;
      (Lenalidomide or placebo) for patients that reached PR with induction treatment, or with the&#xD;
      confirmed progression on second-line therapy with Revlimid® and Dexamethasone for patients&#xD;
      that did not reach PR on induction treatment. All patients will be followed up every 3 months&#xD;
      after end of study treatment, until end of study. The study ends two years after Last Patient&#xD;
      In (i.e. randomization for maintenance) if sufficient events for the primary endpoint were&#xD;
      received, but not later than 8 years after trial initiation (whatever comes first).&#xD;

      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Estimate the gain in progression-free survival (PFS) by maintenance with Lenalidomide after&#xD;
      induction with VMP in elderly patients or patients unfit for highdose chemotherapy in&#xD;
      comparison with placebo after VMP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare response rates of VMP and Lenalidomide maintenance versus VMP and placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare overall survival probabilities between patients treated with Lenalidomide&#xD;
           maintenance and patients without maintenance treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the safety of VMP and Lenalidomide maintenance versus VMP and placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the QoL of VMP and Lenalidomide maintenance versus VMP and placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and efficacy of Rd for poor responders on VMP&#xD;

&#xD;
                         -  Intrauterine device (IUD)**&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Progesterone only hormonal contraceptive (birth control pills,&#xD;
                            injections, implants)*&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Tubal ligation&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Partner's vasectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Additional effective methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Male condom (partner)&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Diaphragm&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Cervical Cap&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  (*)Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with&#xD;
                  multiple myeloma taking Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone, combined oral&#xD;
                  contraceptive pills are not recommended. If a patient is currently using combined&#xD;
                  oral contraception she should switch to one of the effective method listed above.&#xD;
                  The risk of venous thromboembolism continues for 4 to 6 weeks after discontinuing&#xD;
                  combined oral contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be&#xD;
                  reduced during co-treatment with Dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  (**)Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated&#xD;
                  with an increased risk of infection at the time of insertion and irregular&#xD;
                  vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered particularly in&#xD;
                  patients with neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Be informed about and understand the potential consequences of pregnancy and the&#xD;
                  need to notify her study doctor immediately if there is a risk of pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agree to have two medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity&#xD;
                  of 25 mIU/ml (milli-International Units per milliliter) prior to starting&#xD;
                  Lenalidomide. The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10 to 14 days&#xD;
                  prior to the start Lenalidomide and the second pregnancy test must be performed&#xD;
                  within 24 hours prior to the start of Lenalidomide. The patient will receive&#xD;
                  Lenalidomide only after the study doctor has verified that the results of these&#xD;
                  pregnancy tests are negative. She must understand the need to commence the study&#xD;
                  treatment as soon as study drug is dispensed following the second negative&#xD;
                  pregnancy test. This requirement also applies to FCBP who practice complete and&#xD;
                  continued abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must understand the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing in the&#xD;
                  frequency as follows: FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have&#xD;
                  pregnancy tests weekly for the first 28 days of study participation and then&#xD;
                  every 28 days while on study, at study discontinuation, and at day 28 following&#xD;
                  study drug discontinuation. If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy&#xD;
                  testing must occur weekly for the first 28 days and then every 14 days while on&#xD;
                  study, at study discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28 following study drug&#xD;
                  discontinuation. This requirement also applies to FCBP who practice complete and&#xD;
                  continued abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and&#xD;
                  for at least 28 days after study drug discontinuation.&#xD;
