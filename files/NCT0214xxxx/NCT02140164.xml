      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some people with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) have macular edema (swelling) in the central&#xD;
      retina. This can cause decreased central vision. The cause of macular edema is unknown, but&#xD;
      may involve inflammation. The drug minocycline might help prevent inflammation and therefore&#xD;
      might help treat macular edema and improve central visual function .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if minocycline helps people with RP and macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People 12 years and older with RP who have macular edema in at least on eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical and eye disease history. They will have an&#xD;
           eye exam and blood tests. One eye with macular edema will be the study eye. If both eyes&#xD;
           are affected, one will be designated the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will visit the clinic at least 9 times over at least 14 months. The first 3&#xD;
           study visits will be monthly, then every 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will start taking minocycline after visit 3. They will take 1 pill twice&#xD;
           daily for at least 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will keep a medicine diary and bring it to each visit with their pill&#xD;
           bottle and unused pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit, participants will have some or all of the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  eye and thyroid exams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood and pregnancy tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  microperimetry: participants will press a button when they see a light on a computer&#xD;
           screen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  visual field measurement: participants will look at spots on a white screen to test side&#xD;
           vision&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  electroretinogram: A person will be dark adapted by sitting in the dark for 30 minutes.&#xD;
           After the placement of numbing eye drops, special contact lenses will be placed . The&#xD;
           participant will watch flashing lights and recordings will be made.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a broad category of genetically heterogeneous diseases involving&#xD;
      progressive visual loss by a constriction of visual field and loss of night vision. In up to&#xD;
      one-third of patients, the peripheral vision loss can be compounded by central visual acuity&#xD;
      loss from the development of cystic macular changes. While RP is a genetic disease, the&#xD;
      etiology of progressive cell death, including that of associated cystoid macular edema (CME),&#xD;
      is not completely understood. Inflammatory processes involving the activation of resident&#xD;
      immune cells of the retina called microglia have been hypothesized to contribute. Minocycline&#xD;
      inhibits the activation of microglia, decreasing the production of inflammatory factors&#xD;
      implicated in RP progression. The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and&#xD;
      possible efficacy of oral minocycline in participants with CME and RP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five participants, ages 12 and older, with unilateral or bilateral CME associated with RP&#xD;
      will be enrolled initially. However, up to an additional five participants may be enrolled to&#xD;
      replace participants who may withdraw from the study prior to reaching the Month 6 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot, single-center, uncontrolled, open-label, prospective, Phase 1/2 clinical&#xD;
      trial to evaluate minocycline as a potential treatment for CME secondary to RP. A&#xD;
      pre-treatment phase lasting two months will be instituted prior to investigational product&#xD;
      (IP) initiation to assess the anatomical variability of CME as well as variability of other&#xD;
      measurable parameters as part of the natural history of the disease. Participants will&#xD;
      receive an oral dose of 100 mg (or appropriate weight adjusted pediatric dose) of minocycline&#xD;
      twice daily for 12 months. There will be a common termination date, which will take place&#xD;
      when the last recruited participant has received 12 months of IP. Participants who were&#xD;
      recruited in the earlier part of the study will continue taking IP and be followed every two&#xD;
      months until the common termination date. At each visit, participants will have visual acuity&#xD;
      measured and will undergo optical coherence tomography (OCT) testing to measure retinal&#xD;
      thickness. Measures of central visual field sensitivity full-field electroretinograms (ERG)&#xD;
      and microperimetry (MP-1) will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the change in CME based on OCT measurements in the study eye at 6&#xD;
      months compared to pre-treatment values. Secondary outcomes include changes in OCT thickness,&#xD;
      changes in amplitude of photopic and scotopic responses on ERG testing, changes in&#xD;
      microperimetry, and changes in visual field as measured by HVF 30-2 visual field testing at 6&#xD;
      months and 12 months compared to pre-treatment values, as well as CME changes on OCT at 12&#xD;
      months compared to pre-treatment values. Pre-treatment measurements will be analyzed to&#xD;
      measure the natural variability of the CME as well as to measure the variability of the&#xD;
      functional testing. Safety outcomes will include the number and severity of adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs). Ocular safety outcomes will be indicated by changes in visual acuity, ocular surface&#xD;
      changes, intraocular inflammation and any other ocular changes not consistent with the&#xD;
      natural progression of RP.&#xD;
