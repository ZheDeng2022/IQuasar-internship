  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An effective vaccine against malaria is urgently needed to combat the scourge of this&#xD;
      disease. Before candidate vaccines can be tested in endemic countries, they are first tested&#xD;
      in human volunteers in so-called Controlled Human Malaria Infections (CHMI's). Ideally, a&#xD;
      candidate vaccine should be tested against multiple strains of malaria, representative of the&#xD;
      disease's global distribution. Recently we compared, for the first time, infections with the&#xD;
      novel malaria strains NF135 and NF166 to those with the broadly-used and well-characterised&#xD;
      strain NF54.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to optimise the course of infections with these novel&#xD;
      strains by determining the minimum number of infectious bites necessary to reliably induce a&#xD;
      malaria infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria remains responsible for an intolerable burden of morbidity&#xD;
      worldwide and an effective vaccine is sorely needed to aid control efforts. Before candidate&#xD;
      malaria vaccines can enter full-scale (phase IIb) field trials in endemic areas, they must&#xD;
      first be tested under controlled circumstances in (phase IIa) Controlled Human Malaria&#xD;
      Infection (CHMI) studies. Since Pf isolates display a wide genetic diversity across the&#xD;
      globe, phase IIa challenge infections should be conducted with both homologous and&#xD;
      heterologous strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1998 a highly successful Controlled Human Malaria Infection model at the UMC St&#xD;
      Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, has been employed both to test candidate vaccines and to&#xD;
      answer fundamental questions about pathophysiological and immunological mechanisms during&#xD;
      early Pf infection in human volunteers. To date largely the NF54 strain of P. falciparum has&#xD;
      been used in this Nijmegen model, with which extensive experience has meanwhile been&#xD;
      acquired. In order to increase the portfolio of Pf strains available for future phase IIa&#xD;
      studies, we recently compared NF54 to the novel candidate strains NF135.C10 and NF166.C8 with&#xD;
      regards to parasitological, clinical and immunological characteristics during a Controlled&#xD;
      Human Malaria Infection (TIP3 study, NCT01627951). The pre-patent period in all NF135- and&#xD;
      NF166-infected subjects was markedly shorter than in NF54-infected subjects, following the&#xD;
      bites of 5 infected mosquitoes on each subject. The current study will therefore assess&#xD;
      whether NF135 and NF166 infections can still reliably be induced with fewer than 5 infected&#xD;
      bites per subject. This will envisionably increase the tolerability of NF135 and NF166&#xD;
      infections and render their dynamics more similar to those of NF54 infections, for better&#xD;
      comparison in future heterologous challenge studies.&#xD;
