  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to describe the use of Remote Patient Management (RPM) systems&#xD;
      equipped with sensors for the measurement of weight and blood pressure in an Italian health&#xD;
      care setting, verifying their efficacy and efficiency for the remote management of heart&#xD;
      failure patients with implantable defibrillators. Moreover, their ease of use and acceptance&#xD;
      by physician and patient will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on positive outcomes from numerous randomized, controlled trials, the current European&#xD;
      Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines and current American guidelines for the management of&#xD;
      chronic heart failure include the implantable defibrillators as a standard of care in&#xD;
      selected chronic heart failure patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart failure patients with implantable defibrillators often visit the hospital for&#xD;
      unscheduled examinations, placing a great burden on healthcare providers. Device&#xD;
      manufacturers offer a technology for remote defibrillator monitoring with the purpose of&#xD;
      allowing physicians to remotely access patients' data and reducing unnecessary routine and&#xD;
      interim visits. The Evolution of Management Strategies of Heart Failure Patients With&#xD;
      Implantable Defibrillators (EVOLVO) study was a multicenter randomized trial designed to&#xD;
      assess whether remote management can reduce emergency healthcare use in heart failure&#xD;
      patients implanted with defibrillators endowed with specific diagnostic features compared&#xD;
      with standard management consisting of scheduled in-office visits and patient response to&#xD;
      audible alerts. Over 16 months, the rate of emergency department or urgent in-office visits&#xD;
      for heart failure, arrhythmias, or device-related events decreased by 35% and total&#xD;
      healthcare visits were 21% less frequent with remote monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study confirmed that remote management of heart failure patients implanted with&#xD;
      defibrillators allows timely notification of potentially critical situations. Moreover, it&#xD;
      has the effect of shifting healthcare visits from the emergency department to the clinic and&#xD;
      increasing the appropriateness of in-office visits, thereby reducing costs and the burden on&#xD;
      the healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonetheless, in the EVOLVO study these findings were obtained with defibrillators equipped&#xD;
      with specific diagnostic and alerting capabilities, and thus they cannot be fully extended to&#xD;
      different technologies. In particular, defibrillators were equipped with these alert&#xD;
      capability for the detection of possible fluid accumulation and decompensation, and these&#xD;
      alerts accounted for the majority of endpoints recorded during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That alert was shown to be associated with a relatively high rate of false positive&#xD;
      detections , and the Diagnostic Outcome Trial in Heart Failure (DOT-HF) recently showed an&#xD;
      increased number of hospital admissions among patients with the audible alert enabled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative systems of RPM (Remote Patient Management) allow recording of the body weight and&#xD;
      blood pressure for the management of heart failure. Continuous monitoring of these variables&#xD;
      is a fundamental element of the programs of patient monitoring and patient education&#xD;
      recommended by the guidelines for the treatment of heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the daily measure of body weight and pressure is present in most telemedicine&#xD;
      programs described in the literature , , clinical evidence obtained specifically in the&#xD;
      population of patients referred to the implantable defibrillator therapy is scarce. The large&#xD;
      observational study ALTITUDE has suggested the possibility of a better prognosis of patients&#xD;
      managed via RPM, in particular if provided with sensors for the measurement of weight and&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
