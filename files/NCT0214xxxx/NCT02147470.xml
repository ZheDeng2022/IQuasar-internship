  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients and has a one month survival rate of 50% and a 3 month survival rate of 20%. The&#xD;
      leading theory behind HRS is selective vasoconstriction of renal vasculature in the setting&#xD;
      of decreased systemic vascular resistance. Patients with liver cirrhosis suffer from a large&#xD;
      degree of third spacing in the form of peripheral edema and ascites. In addition treatment&#xD;
      with multiple drugs, including diuretics puts these patients at higher risks of prerenal AKI&#xD;
      and ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). AKI occurring due to HRS, prerenal AKI and&#xD;
      ischemic or nephrotoxic ATN have different pathophysiologic mechanisms and are treated&#xD;
      differently with significantly different outcomes. While renal perfusion is expected to be&#xD;
      reduced in HRS and prerenal AKI, it is normal or increased in ATN. Prerenal AKI has the most&#xD;
      favorable prognosis among these pathologies and treatment simply consists of volume expansion&#xD;
      with blood, albumin, crystalloids or colloids. In clinical practice vasoactive agents such as&#xD;
      midodrine and octreotide are used to increase the tone of splanchnic vessels and to improve&#xD;
      renal perfusion. These interventions would not affect renal function in cases with ATN.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the diagnostic criteria proposed by the International Club for Ascites (ICA)&#xD;
      for HRS are not specific and do not always exclude patients with other forms of acute kidney&#xD;
      injury. Therefore, availability of a simple diagnostic tool for measurement of renal blood&#xD;
      flow (RBF) at the bedside would be of great value in management of cases with cirrhosis of&#xD;
      the liver presenting with acute reduction in kidney function. However, currently, there are&#xD;
      no practical and simple tools available for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast enhanced ultrasonography (CEU) involves the intravenous injection of gas-filled&#xD;
      microbubbles to enhance the ultrasound image of the organs and mainly to assess tissue&#xD;
      vascularity and blood flow. We and others have used CEU to assess changes in RBF in response&#xD;
      to physiologic stimuli and therapeutic interventions. Here we propose a prospective, pilot&#xD;
      diagnostic study to validate the use of CEU, in assessing RBF in cirrhotic patients with AKI,&#xD;
      and to assess the utility of CEU to differentiate between causes of AKI in cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that CEU will show arteriolar vasoconstriction and decreased blood flow in&#xD;
      the renal cortex in patients with HRS which would not change in response to volume expansion.&#xD;
      On the contrary, patients with prerenal AKI will have reduced RBF which will increase after&#xD;
      volume expansion. Finally, those with ATN will not have a reduced RBF at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll 25 patients with liver cirrhosis and acute kidney injury who are admitted&#xD;
      to the University of Virginia hospital into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CEU will be performed on all subjects to measure baseline RBF. CEU will be repeated in all&#xD;
      subjects within 24 hours after volume expansion with at least 1gm/kg of albumin (up to 100&#xD;
      gm/day) to assess a potential change. Hourly urine output and serum creatinine will be&#xD;
      monitored for potential renal response to the volume expansion as part of clinical care. For&#xD;
      the subgroup of subjects who receive treatment with combination therapy with albumin,&#xD;
      midodrine, and octreotide (AMO) RBF assessment with CEU will be repeated after at least 48&#xD;
      hours of receiving this combination. Renal response will be assessed by monitoring urine&#xD;
      output and serum creatinine monitored as part of clinical care. All subjects will have&#xD;
      measurements of fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) and urea (FEUrea) and urine microscopy&#xD;
      as a part of their routine clinical care (work up of AKI). The results of these tests and the&#xD;
      response to volume expansion will be used to categorize subjects into three categories of AKI&#xD;
      (HRS, prerenal AKI, ATN). Correlations between RBF and its changes between different&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions and renal diagnosis will be tested in this study.&#xD;
