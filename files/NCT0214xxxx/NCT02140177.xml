      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death for U.S. adults. Medically ill people are at an&#xD;
      increased risk of suicide. Most people who have killed themselves went to a healthcare&#xD;
      provider within 3 months of their death. More and more, hospitals are being asked to assess&#xD;
      people for signs of suicide risk so that they can get the help they need. If nurses and&#xD;
      doctors can find out who is at risk they can make sure these people get help in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The asQ em (Ask Suicide-Screening Questions to Everyone in Medical Settings) is a brief&#xD;
      questionnaire. It was created to detect suicidal thoughts and behaviors in hospitalized&#xD;
      people. Researchers would like to further develop this tool and figure out which are the best&#xD;
      questions to ask patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the best questions for healthcare providers to ask people with medical&#xD;
      illnesses to see if they are having suicidal thoughts or planning to hurt themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - NIH Clinical Center patients over age 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked questions about how they have been feeling in the past few&#xD;
           weeks. They will be asked questions about depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and&#xD;
           behaviors. They also will be asked some background questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will take approximately 15 to 30 minutes to answer the questions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In 2010, the Joint Commission (JC) issued a Sentinel Event Alert highlighting the need to&#xD;
      detect suicide risk in all non-behavioral patients in medical settings. Detecting suicide&#xD;
      risk among medical patients is important because this population is at elevated risk for&#xD;
      suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and because for many of these patients, a medical visit is&#xD;
      their only portal into mental health services. Of note, the vast majority of people who die&#xD;
      by suicide visit a medical setting, such as an inpatient oncology unit, more frequently than&#xD;
      a psychiatric setting in the months leading up to their death. Thus, the inpatient medical&#xD;
      setting is an important stakeholder in decreasing suicide-related morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Physicians and nurses working in non-mental health settings require tools to guide them in&#xD;
      recognizing patients at risk. Nonetheless, there are currently no suicide screening&#xD;
      instruments designed specifically for assessing suicide risk in an adult inpatient medical&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2012, our study team conducted a Quality Improvement Project (QIP) at the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health Clinical Center (NIH CC) which demonstrated that the asQ em (Ask&#xD;
      Suicide-Screening Questions to Everyone in Medical Settings), a brief instrument piloted to&#xD;
      detect suicidal thoughts and behaviors among adult medical inpatients, was both feasible to&#xD;
      administer and acceptable to both patients and staff. Extending this work, the aim of this&#xD;
      current study is to further develop and psychometrically validate the asQ em among adult&#xD;
      medical inpatients. While most inpatients will not be at imminent risk for suicide, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that the asQ em will identify a number of patients who screen positive for&#xD;
      suicide risk on a longer gold standard instrument, and that they are thus not only at risk&#xD;
      for suicidal behavior in the future, but are also experiencing significant emotional distress&#xD;
      and therefore warrant further mental health evaluation and recommendations for follow-up&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a prospective, cross-sectional multisite study with patients enrolled from&#xD;
      the NIH CC, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Rhode Island Hospital, and John&#xD;
      Peter SmithHospital. The total planned sample size will be 810 (180 from WRNMMC, 180 from&#xD;
      RIH, 200 from JPS, and 250 from NIH CC). We will administer several short measures of suicide&#xD;
      risk: the 20 asQ em candidate items; a criterion standard Adult Suicidal Ideation&#xD;
      Questionnaire (ASIQ); two questions which assess for suicidal behavior from a second&#xD;
      criterion standard, the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSI); a brief depression screen, the&#xD;
      Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9); and an exploratory variable questionnaire, to all&#xD;
      eligible inpatients aged 18 years and older. The ultimate goal of this project is the&#xD;
      development of a validated risk of suicide screening instrument that can be administered&#xD;
      rapidly by non-mental health clinicians to medical inpatients and in turn, connecting those&#xD;
      in need with mental health services. Additionally, we hope to pilot the Suicide Implicit&#xD;
      Association Test (S-IAT) in a subsample of recruited patients. The S-IAT is a brief computer&#xD;
      task which measures a person s implicit association between self and either life or death .&#xD;
      We expect to demonstrate that the S-IAT is feasible to administer in the inpatient medical&#xD;
      setting thereby providing a potential alternative to self-report questionnaires for assessing&#xD;
      patients thoughts about death or suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future studies will focus on examining the practical implications of nurses administering the&#xD;
      asQ em as standard of care during the admission process on a medical inpatient unit and&#xD;
      validating the asQ em in non-English speaking patients, addressing a critical gap in suicide&#xD;
      prevention research. In addition, examining the long-term clinical impact of screening&#xD;
      general medical patients for suicide risk with the asQ em and linking those in need with&#xD;
      mental health services and/or other interventions will be important next steps.&#xD;

        This is a prospective, cross-sectional multisite study. We will enroll adult patients, ages&#xD;
        18 years and older, admitted to identified inpatient medical units during designated data&#xD;
        collections days. Patients will be recruited at the NIH CC as well as Walter Reed National&#xD;
        Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), Rhode Island Hospital (RIH), and John Peter Smith&#xD;
        Hospital (JPS).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All adult medical inpatients, ages 18 and older, who are admitted to selected medical units&#xD;
        during data collection weeks will be approached for enrollment. Patients will be included&#xD;
        if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. they are admitted as an inpatient on the designated medical units;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. they are 18 and older;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. they are capable of providing consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5) they have not previously been enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. they are medically or cognitively unable to participate in the screening or assessment&#xD;
             (e.g., sustained altered level of consciousness, psychosis, hostile behavior,&#xD;
             unremitting distress, intubation, persistent vomiting, severe pain, acute or worsening&#xD;
             medical acuity);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. they have been already enrolled during a previous visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. they are unwilling to provide consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. the patient is non-English speaking (because ASIQ has not been validated in languages&#xD;
             other than English).&#xD;
