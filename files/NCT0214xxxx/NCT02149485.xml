  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 1995, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) has been performed in The Netherlands for&#xD;
      couples at high risk for transmitting severe or lethal genetic conditions or who have&#xD;
      experienced multiple miscarriages due to chromosomal translocations. Approximately 260&#xD;
      children have been born after PGD in The Netherlands. Follow-up data on children born after&#xD;
      PGD are scarce. Long-term studies on PGD children have not been conducted in The Netherlands.&#xD;
      Results of studies in other countries on 2-year old PGD children are reassuring. These&#xD;
      children and their parents have normal scores on relevant parameters such as general health,&#xD;
      cognitive and socioemotional development, parent-child interaction and parental stress.&#xD;
      Studies of good methodological quality of older children have not yet been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Long-term follow-up of children who have been born after PGD in The Netherlands.&#xD;
      The primary aim is to assess the safety of PGD with regard to the health and development of&#xD;
      the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A cohort study. Study population: 5- and 8 year old children born after PGD in&#xD;
      The Netherlands for various indications and their parents. Control groups consist of 5 and&#xD;
      8-year old naturally conceived (NC) children of parents who have considered PGD treatment and&#xD;
      5 and 8-year old children born after in vitro fertilisation/intracytoplasmatic sperm&#xD;
      injection (IVF/ICSI), and the parents of the two latter groups of children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parents are asked to fill out questionnaires on their own and their child's medical history.&#xD;
      A physical examination of the children will be performed, a swab for collection of buccal&#xD;
      cells for (future) DNA methylation analysis will be taken and their cognitive and&#xD;
      socioemotional development will be assessed. In the 8 years old children cardiovascular&#xD;
      status will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters: general health, cognitive and socioemotional development, parent-child&#xD;
      interaction and parental stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study procedure consists of filling out questionnaires by parents and a one-time visit to&#xD;
      the hospital. No invasive interventions will be performed, except 1 tube of blood in the 8&#xD;
      year old group. The risks associated with the study procedure are very small. The results&#xD;
      provide more information about the risks of PGD to prospective parents who are considering&#xD;
      PGD and to healthcare providers involved in PGD treatment.&#xD;
