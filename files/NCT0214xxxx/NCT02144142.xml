    <textblock>
      Unlike healthy control skin, the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is frequently&#xD;
      colonized by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), putting these patients at increased risk of&#xD;
      S. aureus skin infections. In addition, research in the investigator's lab has shown that&#xD;
      these patients have fewer protective Staphylococcal species such as Staphylococcus&#xD;
      epidermidis (S. epidermidis) that are known to produce antimicrobial peptides that play a&#xD;
      role in protecting the skin from invading pathogens. In this study, the study team will&#xD;
      attempt to decrease S. aureus colonization and increase colonization by protective Staph&#xD;
      species in AD patients by first culturing the bacteria on subjects' lesional AD skin. The&#xD;
      study team will selectively grow the subject's protective Staph colonies and place them into&#xD;
      a moisturizer. The first part of the study will determine the half-life of the&#xD;
      bacteria-containing moisturizer. The bacteria-containing moisturizer will be applied to a&#xD;
      subject's arm, and the subject will return at four different time points over the next three&#xD;
      days for skin swabs of the arm that will be used to determine the amount and type of bacteria&#xD;
      on the arm at those time points. In the second part of the study, the subject will apply&#xD;
      moisturizer containing his own antimicrobial bacteria to one of his arms for a total of 6&#xD;
      times at a frequency determined by the half-life, which will be computed at the end of the&#xD;
      first part of this experiment. The subject will return prior to the 7th application time&#xD;
      point for skin swabs of the arm to ensure that there are still viable bacteria from the&#xD;
      moisturizer present on the arm. In the third part of the study, each subject will receive&#xD;
      both moisturizer as well as moisturizer plus his own antimicrobial bacteria. The subject will&#xD;
      apply the moisturizer to one arm and the moisturizer plus bacteria to the other arm daily for&#xD;
      a total of 15 days. Subjects will return to the clinic every 5 days for skin swabs and&#xD;
      clinical evaluations. If the moisturizer containing bacteria is able to decrease the S.&#xD;
      aureus colonization on subject's arms, the study team hypothesizes that subjects will have&#xD;
      improvement of their AD symptoms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as three experiments in accordance with the three aims of the&#xD;
      study. Participants will consent to all three of the study experiments separately, as each&#xD;
      experiment will have a different consent form. While individual subjects are able to&#xD;
      participate in all three sub-studies if they are eligible for all three, there is no&#xD;
      requirement for subjects to participate in more than one of the sub-studies. A total of 10&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled in Experiments 1 and 2, and approximately 14 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in Experiment 3. Given that only approximately 75-80% of AD patients are colonized&#xD;
      by S. aureus, we expect to screen closer to 18-20 subjects to fulfill the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Subjects that withdraw from the study will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 1: Determination of the stability of transplanted bacteria on the skin surface&#xD;
      over time&#xD;
&#xD;
      This first portion of the study (Experiment 1) will consist of 7 office visits (Screening,&#xD;
      Culture, Treatment, and 3 Follow-up visits) and one phone call to relay eligibility&#xD;
      information. All office visits will occur at the UCSD Dermatology Clinic. The exact&#xD;
      procedures for each visit are discussed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit (Visit 1, Day 0) Prior to beginning any study procedures, subjects will first&#xD;
      be asked to review and sign the informed consent form. After obtaining informed consent, the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed. A brief medical history and physical exam will&#xD;
      be performed in helping to assess whether the subject meets the required criteria for the&#xD;
      study. Female subjects of child-bearing potential will take a urine pregnancy test in our&#xD;
      office to ensure that they are not pregnant. Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will then have a skin swab performed on the lesional atopic dermatitis skin in one&#xD;
      of their antecubital fossae (Kong et al, 2012 showed that AD subjects colonized by S. aureus&#xD;
      have resident S. aureus bacteria throughout their skin surface, therefore we expect one swab&#xD;
      to be sufficient), as well as a nasal culture swab to detect the presence of S. aureus in the&#xD;
      nares. This will conclude the screening visit. The total time for this visit will be&#xD;
      approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria due to the application or use of&#xD;
      prohibited medications within the timeframe noted will be considered screen-failures. Skin&#xD;
      swabs of these patients will not be performed. These subjects may return for another&#xD;
      screening visit after completing the necessary wash-out period (7 days for topical&#xD;
      medications, 28 days for oral medications) if they are interested in doing so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone (Day 3 +/- 1) Subjects will be notified via telephone within 3 business days whether or&#xD;
      not their skin and nasal swabs grew S. aureus. Subjects with a skin culture positive for&#xD;
      methicillin sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) will be enrolled in the study. A culture visit&#xD;
      appointment will be schedule for these participants. Subjects will be excluded if they have&#xD;
      any of the following: a negative S. aureus skin culture or a skin culture positive for&#xD;
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The total phone conversation should take&#xD;
      approximately 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Culture Visit (Day 7 +/- 4) Eligible subjects will return for a culture visit within&#xD;
      approximately a week of their screening visit. During this visit we will take four (4)&#xD;
      culture swabs from the subject's non-lesional (no AD) skin on their upper arms. These culture&#xD;
      swabs will be placed in tryptic soy broth (TSB) until processed in the lab, where they will&#xD;
      be used to grow the subject's antimicrobial peptide-producing Staph species to use for the&#xD;
      autologous microbiome transplant. Subjects will also receive a bar of Dove moisturizing soap,&#xD;
      which they will be instructed to use whenever they shower until after the follow-up visit is&#xD;
      complete. Subjects with a positive S. aureus nasal culture at the screening visit (Visit 1)&#xD;
      will also receive a tube of mupirocin ointment. They will be instructed on the application of&#xD;
      mupirocin to the anterior nares bilaterally twice a day starting 5 days prior to their&#xD;
      treatment visit. The total visit will take approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Visit (Day 28 +/- 7) Eligible subjects with + S. aureus screening cultures will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study and instructed to return to the clinic approximately 28 days after&#xD;
      their screening visit. This 3-week waiting period will allow laboratory staff to grow and&#xD;
      prepare the subject's endogenous AMP-producing bacteria to be mixed with Cetaphil for&#xD;
      application at the treatment visit. To simulate real-life scenarios as much as possible, the&#xD;
      subject will be allowed to continue their usual activities during this study, including&#xD;
      bathing, showering, and exercising. This visit will begin by reviewing the subject's interim&#xD;
      medical history, including medication history to ensure that he/she did not use any topical&#xD;
      AD treatments on their arms within 7 days or oral AD treatments within 28 days of this visit.&#xD;
      For subjects who had a S. aureus (+) nasal culture at screening visit, a repeat nasal culture&#xD;
      will be performed. For all subjects, a focused physical exam will then be performed of the&#xD;
      subject's bilateral arms to ensure that there is no evidence of cracks, breaks or infections&#xD;
      of the skin on the arms. Next we will pre-treat both of the arms with a regimen of washing&#xD;
      with Dial liquid antibacterial soap, followed by wiping the arm with sterile gauze soaked&#xD;
      with 70%, then 80% alcohol. Once the alcohol has dried, a thin coat of the subject's&#xD;
      individualized AMT cream will then be applied to each arm by the gloved hands of a study&#xD;
      coordinator. Five minutes after applying the cream, a quantitative washing will be performed&#xD;
      on eczematous skin of one antecubital fossae, as well as on a non-lesional area of skin on&#xD;
      the same arm. For each wash, a sterile stainless steel cylinder with an approximate area of&#xD;
      3.5 cm2 will be held firmly to the skin surface, and 2.5 mL of a sterile stripping fluid&#xD;
      (SSFN) will be carefully instilled into the cylinder. The skin will then be massaged for 60&#xD;
      seconds using a sterile rubber policeman. The SSFN will be aspirated with a pipette and&#xD;
      transferred to a sterile test tube. This entire process will be repeated a second time at the&#xD;
      same site and the fluid pooled together. The pooled fluid will be analyzed in the lab via&#xD;
      colony counting methods to determine the number of viable bacteria colonies on the skin&#xD;
      surface. A skin swab of both lesional and non-lesional skin will then be taken. This will&#xD;
      conclude the treatment visit. We expect this visit to take approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits During follow-up visits, each subject will return to the clinic for a&#xD;
      quantitative wash of their lesional and non-lesional skin and a skin swab of their lesional&#xD;
      and non-lesional skin. The 10 enrolled subjects will be divided into two groups, and each&#xD;
      group will return for follow-up at different time points. The first five patients to enroll&#xD;
      will be assigned to the first group, which will return for follow-up at the following time&#xD;
      points: 1, 4, 8 and 24-hours after the transplant. The next five patients to enroll will be&#xD;
      assigned to the second group, and will return for follow-up at these time points: 1, 2, 4 and&#xD;
      7 days after the transplant. The quantitative wash at the final follow-up time point will&#xD;
      conclude the study for that participant. Each follow-up visit will take approximately 20&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The average survival of the transplanted Staph species on both lesional and non-lesional skin&#xD;
      will be plotted for each time point. From this data we will be able to calculate the rate of&#xD;
      decline of the bacteria after being transplanted, which will provide us with the bacteria's&#xD;
      half-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 2: To establish the steady-state abundance of autologous microbiome transplant&#xD;
      cream application necessary to achieve a density of transplanted bacteria similar to the&#xD;
      average concentration of microbes on normal skin, approximately 105/cm2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 2 will consist of 4 office visits (Screening, Culture, Treatment, and Follow-up),&#xD;
      as well as one phone call to relay eligibility information. All office visits will occur at&#xD;
      the UCSD Dermatology Clinic. Subjects who are participating in both Experiment 1 and 2 must&#xD;
      wait at least a period of time equivalent to 10 half-lives of the AMT cream before beginning&#xD;
      the study procedures of Experiment 2. The Screening, Phone Call, and Culture Visits for&#xD;
      Experiment 3 are the same as for Experiment 1. The Treatment Visit and Follow-Up Visits&#xD;
      differ slightly from those in Experiment 1 and will be described below, with changes&#xD;
      underlined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Visit (Day 28 +/- 7) Eligible subjects with + S. aureus screening cultures will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study and instructed to return to the clinic approximately 28 days after&#xD;
      their screening visit for the treatment visit. This 3-week waiting period between the culture&#xD;
      and treatment visits will allow laboratory staff to grow and prepare the subject's endogenous&#xD;
      AMP-producing bacteria to be mixed with Cetaphil for application at the treatment visit. To&#xD;
      simulate real-life scenarios as much as possible, the subject will be allowed to continue&#xD;
      their usual activities during this study, including bathing, showering, and exercising. This&#xD;
      visit will begin by reviewing the subject's interim medical history, including medication&#xD;
      history to ensure that he/she did not use any topical AD treatments on their arms within 7&#xD;
      days or oral AD treatments within 28 days of this visit. For subjects who had a S. aureus (+)&#xD;
      nasal culture at screening visit, a repeat nasal culture will be performed. For all subjects,&#xD;
      a focused physical exam will then be performed of the subject's bilateral arms to ensure that&#xD;
      there is no evidence of cracks, breaks or infections of the skin on the arms. Next we will&#xD;
      pre-treat one arm with a regimen of washing with Dial liquid antibacterial soap, followed by&#xD;
      wiping the arm with 70% followed by 80% alcohol using sterile gauze. Once the alcohol has&#xD;
      dried, a thin coat of the subject's individualized AMT cream will then be applied to one of&#xD;
      the subject's arms by the gloved hands of a study coordinator. Five minutes later, a&#xD;
      quantitative washing will be performed on eczematous skin of the antecubital fossae of the&#xD;
      arm treated with the AMT cream, as well as on an area of non-lesional skin on this same arm.&#xD;
      For each wash, a sterile stainless steel cylinder with an approximate area of 3.5 cm2 will be&#xD;
      held firmly to the skin surface, and 2.5 mL of a sterile stripping fluid (SSFN) will be&#xD;
      carefully instilled into the cylinder. The skin will then be massaged for 60 seconds using a&#xD;
      sterile rubber policeman. The SSFN will be aspirated with a pipette and transferred to a&#xD;
      sterile test tube. This entire process will be repeated a second time and the fluid pooled&#xD;
      together. The pooled fluid will be analyzed in the lab via PCR to determine how many and what&#xD;
      type of bacteria are present. A skin swab of lesional and non-lesional skin will also be&#xD;
      completed. Subjects will then be given single-use aliquots of their own AMT cream and gloves&#xD;
      to take home with them. They will be instructed to apply one of the aliquots to the same arm&#xD;
      it was applied to during the treatment visit at a dosing interval determined based on the&#xD;
      half-life calculated from the results of Experiment 1 for a total of 6 doses (the dose&#xD;
      schedule predicted to achieve steady state). They will be instructed to wash their hands and&#xD;
      put on gloves prior to each application of the cream. This will conclude the treatment visit.&#xD;
      We expect this visit to take approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visit (To occur at the time of the 7th application of the AMT cream) During the&#xD;
      follow-up visit, subjects will return to the clinic for a quantitative wash of their lesional&#xD;
      and non-lesional skin to determine the abundance of S. aureus at this visit. A skin swab of&#xD;
      lesional and non-lesional skin will also be performed. This visit will conclude Experiment 2.&#xD;
      It will last approximately 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional considerations: In this experiment, our goal is to establish the steady-state&#xD;
      abundance of AMT using a bacterial density similar to the average concentration of microbes&#xD;
      on normal skin, approximately 105/cm2. Using the results of Experiment 1, we can estimate the&#xD;
      half-life of the bacteria on subject skin surface. It is possible that the AMT cream&#xD;
      half-life as determined in Experiment 1 will be short, possibly even as short as a few hours.&#xD;
      If the AMT cream does show a rapid loss of transplanted bacteria such that it is impractical&#xD;
      to further increase the frequency of application of the AMT (assumed as greater than TID),&#xD;
      and the dose of the AMT cannot be practically increased from standard 108 bacteria/gm,&#xD;
      applied at 10 gm/m2, the subject will apply the maximal practical dose (109 bacteria/gm at&#xD;
      40gm/m2 ) at the maximal practical frequency (TID), and we will do this for one week to&#xD;
      determine how many bacteria are present after this treatment approach. Although this is not&#xD;
      likely from the data of Costello et al. in 2009, we want to have this back-up plan in place&#xD;
      to allow the study to move forward. Although these results would not represent a&#xD;
      steady-state, the data would be sufficient to enable design of a subsequent clinical trial or&#xD;
      to conclude that a long term application approach is not worth further analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 3: To measure the steady-state abundance of S. aureus on participant's skin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 3 will consist of 6 office visits (Screening, Culture, Treatment, and 3 Follow-up&#xD;
      visits), as well as one phone call to relay eligibility information. All office visits will&#xD;
      occur at the UCSD Dermatology Clinic. Subjects who have participated in Experiment 2 must&#xD;
      wait at least a period of time equivalent to 10 half-lives of the AMT cream before beginning&#xD;
      the study procedures of Experiment 3. The Screening, Phone Call, and Culture Visits for&#xD;
      Experiment 3 are the same as for Experiment 1. The Treatment Visit and Follow-Up Visits&#xD;
      differ slightly from those in Experiment 1 and will be described below, with changes&#xD;
      underlined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Visit (Day 28 +/- 7) Eligible subjects with + S. aureus screening cultures will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study and instructed to return to the clinic approximately 28 days after&#xD;
      their screening visit. This 3-week waiting period will allow laboratory staff to grow and&#xD;
      prepare the subject's endogenous AMP-producing bacteria to be mixed with Cetaphil for&#xD;
      application at the treatment visit. AMP-producing bacteria will also be screened to ensure&#xD;
      that it is not pathogenic. To simulate real-life scenarios as much as possible, the subject&#xD;
      will be allowed to continue their usual activities during this study, including bathing,&#xD;
      showering, and exercising. This visit will begin by reviewing the subject's interim medical&#xD;
      history, including medication history to ensure that he/she did not use any topical AD&#xD;
      treatments on their arms within 7 days or oral AD treatments within 28 days of this visit.&#xD;
      For subjects who had a S. aureus (+) nasal culture at screening visit, a repeat nasal culture&#xD;
      will be performed. For all subjects, a focused physical exam will then be performed of the&#xD;
      subject's bilateral arms to ensure that there is no evidence of cracks, breaks or infections&#xD;
      of the skin on the arms. The localized SCORAD and Eczema Severity Scale will be completed on&#xD;
      each antecubital fossa. A TEWL meter will then be used to measure the TEWL of each&#xD;
      antecubital fossa. Next we will pre-treat both arms with a regimen of washing with Dial&#xD;
      liquid antibacterial soap, followed by wiping the arms with 70%, then 80% alcohol. Once the&#xD;
      alcohol has dried, a thin coat of the subject's individualized AMT cream will then be applied&#xD;
      to one arm by the gloved hands of a study coordinator, and Cetaphil lotion alone to the other&#xD;
      arm. The two creams will be labeled as either 'Right' or 'Left' to allow the study to be&#xD;
      conducted in a double-blind manner (both the subject and the clinical&#xD;
      investigator/coordinator will be blinded as to which arm received which treatment). Five&#xD;
      minutes later, a quantitative washing will be performed on eczematous skin of both&#xD;
      antecubital fossae as well as on an area of non-lesional skin of both arms. For each wash, a&#xD;
      sterile stainless steel cylinder with an approximate area of 3.5 cm2 will be held firmly to&#xD;
      the skin surface, and 2.5 mL of a sterile stripping fluid (SSFN) will be carefully instilled&#xD;
      into the cylinder. The skin will then be massaged for 60 seconds using a sterile rubber&#xD;
      policeman. The SSFN will be aspirated with a pipette and transferred to a sterile test tube.&#xD;
      This entire process will be repeated a second time and the fluid pooled together. The pooled&#xD;
      fluid will be analyzed in the lab via colony counting methods to determine the amount of&#xD;
      viable bacteria on the skin at this time point. Skin swabs of lesional and non-lesional skin&#xD;
      of both arms will also be taken to determine what type and the abundance of each bacteria&#xD;
      present on the skin. The subject will then receive single-use aliquots of his individualized&#xD;
      AMT cream and Cetaphil lotion alone, as well as gloves, and instructed to apply one aliquot&#xD;
      to its assigned arm at the dosing interval determined in Experiment 1 (but not to exceed&#xD;
      TID). All aliquots will be labeled with either 'Left' or 'Right' depending on which arm they&#xD;
      should be applied to based on whether the aliquot is of control Cetaphil lotion or the AMT&#xD;
      cream. Since the two products are identical in appearance and consistency, subjects should&#xD;
      not be able to distinguish between the two products. All subjects will be instructed to wash&#xD;
      their hands and put on clean gloves before each aliquot application. This will conclude the&#xD;
      treatment visit. We expect this visit to take approximately 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits 1, 2 and 3 (Days 33 +/- 2 days, 38 +/- 2 days, and 43 +/- 2 days&#xD;
      respectively) Subjects will return to the clinic approximately every 5 days after the&#xD;
      treatment visit for a follow-up visit. During this visit, any adverse reactions to the AMT&#xD;
      cream will be recorded. Next, the localized SCORAD and Eczema Severity Scale will be used to&#xD;
      score the severity of the subject's eczema on each of his antecubital fossae. The TEWL of&#xD;
      each antecubital fossa will also be measured. Next, a quantitative wash will be performed on&#xD;
      each arm in the region of the antecubital fossa as well as on an area of non-lesional skin on&#xD;
      each arm. A skin swab of the lesional and non-lesional skin from both arms will then be&#xD;
      performed. The subject will receive freshly prepared single-use aliquots of both the AMT&#xD;
      cream and Cetaphil lotion labeled with either 'Left' or 'Right' depending on which arm the&#xD;
      aliquot should be applied to (for follow-up visits 1 and 2 only). These activities will&#xD;
      conclude the study visit and all study-related procedures. Each follow-up visit should take&#xD;
      approximately 45 minutes.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Presence of lesional atopic dermatitis skin in both antecubital fossae&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive S. aureus colonization based on results of a skin culture taken from one of&#xD;
             their AD-affected antecubital fossae during the screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any topical AD treatments (including topical steroids, topical calcineurin&#xD;

             either screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe AD that would worsen significantly from holding a participant's usual&#xD;
             topical/oral AD medications for the time periods required in the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
             criteria (one week prior to the screening, treatment and follow-up visits for topical&#xD;
             medications and 28 days prior to screening, treatment and follow-up visits and for&#xD;
             oral medications)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have taken a bleach bath within a week prior to screening, or who take&#xD;
             bleach baths during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
