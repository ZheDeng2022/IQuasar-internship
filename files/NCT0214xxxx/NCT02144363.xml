  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation used to support the sick newborn infant is associated with many&#xD;
      complications including the development of chronic lung disease. Limiting prolonged invasive&#xD;
      ventilation remains an important strategy to decrease lung injury and prevent chronic lung&#xD;
      disease. Currently, there is no objective measure available to predict readiness for removal&#xD;
      of the endotracheal tube (&quot;extubation&quot;) and discontinuing mechanical ventilation in this&#xD;
      fragile population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to predict extubation success by evaluating the electrical activity&#xD;
      of the diaphragm (Edi), which provides important information about the &quot;drive&quot; to breathing&#xD;
      coming from the brain and the function of the diaphragm, two essential factors determining&#xD;
      extubation readiness and success.&#xD;

      In this observational study, very low birth weight preterm infants with RDS who require&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation in first 24 hour of life will be recruited. A size appropriate&#xD;
      nasogastric tube with multiple array of electrodes (Edi catheter) will be inserted in each&#xD;
      eligible infant. The average EdI (Edi_avg) will be measured during mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      just before extubation. All infants will be extubated to non-invasive positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation (NIPPV or CPAP) delivered through nasal cannula&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim is to determine whether there is a relationship between Edi_avg before&#xD;
      extubation and the extubation success in a sample of preterm infants with respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (RDS). We hypothesize that Edi-avg of infants with successful extubation&#xD;
      will be significantly different from the infants who fail extubation&#xD;
