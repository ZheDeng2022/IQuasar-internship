  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various preclinical animal studies have shown the potential of stem cells in re-vascularising&#xD;
      ischemic limbs and promoting collateral vessel formation. SVF have the potential to&#xD;
      facilitate the formation of new blood vessels and skeletal muscle. Early pilot clinical&#xD;
      studies indicate that stem-cell transplantation is feasible and may have beneficial effects&#xD;
      in CLI. Injury or inflammation is a prerequisite for the participation of circulating stem&#xD;
      cells to home and differentiate on to this microenvironment. The increased vascular&#xD;
      permeability and expression of adhesion proteins like integrin assist in stem cell homing.&#xD;
      The migratory capacity of stem cells is dependent on natural growth factors such as vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Stromal cell derived factor (SDFI) and stem cell factor&#xD;
      (SCF). The expression of VEGF, SDFI and SCF is highly unregulated in the hypoxic muscular&#xD;
      tissue and is responsible for the recruitment of the stem cells to assist in the repair&#xD;
      mechanism and consequent improvement in limb function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above regenerating potential of SVF, they have several advantages; they&#xD;
      can be easily isolated without further culturing it. Most importantly SVF have shown to have&#xD;
      significantly highest expression of pluripotent markers similar to that of human embryonic&#xD;
      stem cells and yet they are non-tumorogenic and safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSCs are having angiogenic activity and hence may be excellent source to develop&#xD;
      neo-vasculature and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating&#xD;
      Critical Limb Ischemia. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules&#xD;
      involved with cell attachment to neighbouring cells and to the extra cellular matrix19&#xD;
      Adipose derived Stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal Stem Cells has been found in&#xD;
      preclinical studies to be safe and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current Phase I/II study of adipose derived stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells is conducted with the broad objective of establishing safety and efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adipose Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (ADSVF) Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) obtained&#xD;
      from tumescent liposuction. The SVF contains a variety of cells such as pre-adipocytes,&#xD;
      endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, and adult stem cells (ASCs).&#xD;
      In addition, the SVF also contains blood cells from the capillaries supplying the fat cells.&#xD;
      These include erythrocytes or red blood cells, B and T cells, macrophages, monocytes, mast&#xD;
      cells, natural killer (NK) cells, hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells,&#xD;
      to name a few. It also contains growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta&#xD;
      (TGF-β), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), among&#xD;
      others. This is consistent with the secretions of cells in the presence of an extracellular&#xD;
      matrix. The SVF also contains the various proteins present in the adipose tissue&#xD;
      extracellular matrix of which laminin is of interest due to its ability to help in neural&#xD;
      regeneration.Entire procedure for SVF preparation and isolation of SVF cells will be carried&#xD;
      out in cGMP compliance clean room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pure stromal vascular fraction to the tune of 99% will be isolated for this clinical trial&#xD;
      eliminating other unnecessary cells such as RBC and leukocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adipose Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (ADMSC) Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are&#xD;
      present as a rare population of cells in adipose tissue which is almost 30-40% of the&#xD;
      nucleated cells, but they can rapidly grow in culture without losing their stemness. MSCs can&#xD;
      be expanded in vitro ≥ 2 million -fold and retain their ability to differentiate into several&#xD;
      mesenchymal lineages. MSCs have several characteristics such as Ease of isolation, High&#xD;
      expansion potential,Genetic stability,Reproducible attributes from isolate to&#xD;
      isolate,Reproducible characteristics, Compatibility with tissue engineering principles,&#xD;
      Potential to enhance repair in many vital tissues, Uniform dose and Better quality control&#xD;
      and release criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside autologous use MSC can also be used for allogenic therapy. Several studies have used&#xD;
      allo-MSC in vivo and experience suggests that the allo-MSCs are not rejected and many have&#xD;
      positive effects on engraftment.MSC's can be isolated from various tissues, cultured ex vivo,&#xD;
      and expanded many fold.18 Cultured-expanded MSC's appear to represent a homogeneous&#xD;
      population by flow cytometric measures of cell-surface markers. These cell retain the ability&#xD;
      to undergo in vitro differentiation to osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages, even&#xD;
      when clonally expanded.19 Human adipose tissue derived MSCs are capable of differentiating&#xD;
      into endothelial cells in vitro and later form capillary-like structures in semisolid medium&#xD;
      and suggest differentiation potential of MSCs is not restricted to mesodermal lineages but&#xD;
      also transdifferentiation of MSCs into other lineages like endothelial could be realized in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo8 MSCs are known to give rise to limb-bud mesoderm (osteoblasts,&#xD;
      chondrocytes, adipocytes, stroma cells, and skeletal myoblasts) and can also differentiate&#xD;
      into cells of visceral mesoderm (endothelial cells).9 MSCs can facilitate vasculogenesis by&#xD;
      increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. After MSCs are intramyocardially&#xD;
      injected into the infarct zone, local VEGF levels rise, vascular density and regional blood&#xD;
      flow increases, and contractility improves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules&#xD;
      involved with cell attachment to neighboring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This&#xD;
      cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to&#xD;
      mesenchymal tissue.&#xD;
