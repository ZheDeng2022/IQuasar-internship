  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this Phase II trial is to test the NTX-1 Fiber in patients with&#xD;
      constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) and determine if it can reduce symptoms, beneficially&#xD;
      modify gut microbiota composition, and improve gut milieu in these patients. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesis for the Phase II study is that NTX-1 Fiber is better tolerated (i.e&#xD;
      has less side effects) and is more effective than psyllium (the most commonly used fiber in&#xD;
      the US) for symptom improvement and is effective in correcting the abnormal colonic milieu in&#xD;
      those with dysbiosis and low SCFA levels.&#xD;

      The investigators will conduct an 18-week (2-week initial run-in phase, 12-week treatment&#xD;
      phase, and 4-week follow up phase), 2-arm, randomized, double-blind, controlled Phase 2 trial&#xD;
      in 120 subjects with IBS-C. A 2-week run in will be completed in order to ensure the&#xD;
      stability of baseline symptom scores and to ensure that all study subjects have the required&#xD;
      symptom severity to fulfill the inclusion criteria before randomization and beginning the&#xD;
      treatment. The investigators selected a 12-week treatment phase because of the adequacy of&#xD;
      this length of time to clinically see the impact of fiber supplementation (as seen in the&#xD;
      investigators Phase I trial), and because of the 12-week duration requirement of the FDA for&#xD;
      all therapeutic intervention/agents for treatment of IBS. The 4-week follow up phase is to&#xD;
      determine the sustainability of the effects of therapy and to obtain further safety&#xD;
      data.Potential study subjects will be identified though the Rush University Medical Center&#xD;
      (RUMC) clinical databases; advertisements on the RUMC clinical trials and GI websites, RUMC&#xD;
      Facebook and other social media sites; and IRB approved flyers placed in the GI clinic and&#xD;
      throughout the medical center. All potential candidates will be interviewed on the phone by a&#xD;
      clinical coordinator using a structured checklist, at which time the study requirements will&#xD;
      also be explained. Subjects will be asked for food allergies, including artificial sweeteners&#xD;
      such as sucralose and ascelfame K. Subjects will also be informed that the fiber is made out&#xD;
      of corn or psyllium and not other grains. However, it can't be guaranteed that it is free of&#xD;
      other food allergy-related contaminants. Also, subjects will be asked to limit intake of&#xD;
      foods containing more than 3 grams of prebiotics. A list of these foods will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who are eligible and are willing to participate will be invited for the first study&#xD;
      visit. Five visits will be required from each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: After the subject has reviewed and signed the informed consent form, the&#xD;
      investigators will check to see if they are eligible for this study by a physical exam,&#xD;
      questionnaires and a blood test. A physician or their assistant will do a physical exam and&#xD;
      take the subjects vitals (such as height, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Subject Information Form will be an administered questionnaire related to their health,&#xD;
      disease, and their family medical history. They will then have 2Â½ tablespoons of blood drawn&#xD;
      by a certified nurse or medical assistant. They will be reminded in advance to fast 12 hours&#xD;
      prior to their research visit. The blood tests include: CBC, CMP, CRP, TSH, INR, fasting&#xD;
      lipid profile and HbA1c. The subject will be given a 3-day food diary and a 14-day IBS&#xD;
      symptom diary to complete before their next visit. They will also be provided with stool&#xD;
      collection supplies and instructions to take home. When blood test results are available,&#xD;
      those who do not fit the criteria will be called within 7 days after Visit 1 stating that&#xD;
      they are ineligible. Among these blood tests, the fasting lipid profile results will be given&#xD;
      to the subject after their participation in the study and after completion of the study. The&#xD;
      rest of the results will be given to the subject at their next visit. If they continue to be&#xD;
      a candidate in this study based on blood results, the potential subjects will fill out the&#xD;
      3-day food diary, continue to fill out the 14-day IBS symptom diary, and complete the stool&#xD;
      collection the day before or the morning of Visit 2. The subject will be advised to not keep&#xD;
      the stool at room temperature longer than 5 hours. If they anticipate it to be longer than 5&#xD;
      hours before their visit time, then the stool will be kept in the freezer. Both of the&#xD;
      diaries and the stool sample are to be brought to Visit 2, which is 2 weeks after their Visit&#xD;
      1. Visit 1 will be about 3 hours in length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: The subject will give the study coordinator their 3-day food diary, 14-day IBS&#xD;
      symptom diary, and stool sample. They will provide the date of stool collection, as well as&#xD;
      the method of storing the sample. The physician will review their 14-day IBS symptom diary&#xD;
      and confirm their eligibility. If they continue to be eligible, the physician will do a&#xD;
      physical exam and take their vitals (such as weight, waist circumference and blood pressure).&#xD;
      The subject will then be asked to fill out a series of questionnaires relating to their diet&#xD;
      (VioScreen Food Frequency Questionnaire), IBS symptoms (IBS-Quality of Life questionnaire&#xD;
      [IBS-QoL] and IBS Questionnaire by Whorwell and Francis), sleeping/circadian patterns (2 NIH&#xD;
      sleep questionnaires, Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, Lark/Hummingbird/Owl questionnaire,&#xD;
      food timing questionnaire), the Expectancy and Credibility Questionnaire, and the 34-item&#xD;
      tool asking about their GI symptoms and severity. The subject will then be randomized into&#xD;
      one of the two groups. Depending on which group they are randomized to, they will be provided&#xD;
      with a 6-week supply of NTX-1 OR psyllium fiber products in an identical appearing sachet&#xD;
      along with instructions for taking the fiber. They will be provided with a 3-day food diary&#xD;
      and a daily and weekly IBS symptom diary to fill out prior to Visit 3. This visit will be&#xD;
      about 3 hours in length. The next visit will be 6 weeks after Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: The subject will give the study coordinator their 3-day food diary, the daily and&#xD;
      weekly IBS symptom diary, and any excess fiber product. The physician will review their IBS&#xD;
      symptom diary and ensure there are no significant adverse events. The physician will do a&#xD;
      physical exam and take their vitals (such as weight, waist circumference and blood pressure).&#xD;
      The subject will then be asked to fill out a series of questionnaires relating to their IBS&#xD;
      symptoms (IBS-Quality of Life questionnaire (IBS-QoL) and IBS Questionnaire by Whorwell and&#xD;
      Francis), sleeping/circadian patterns (2 NIH sleep questionnaires, Munich Chronotype&#xD;
      Questionnaire, Lark/Hummingbird/Owl questionnaire, food timing questionnaire), the Expectancy&#xD;
      and Credibility Questionnaire, and the 34-item tool asking about their GI symptoms and&#xD;
      severity. Next, they will have 2 tablespoons of blood drawn by a certified nurse or medical&#xD;
      assistant. The following blood tests will be done: CBC, CMP and CRP. The subject will be&#xD;
      reminded in advance to fast 12 hours prior to their research visit. A copy of their blood&#xD;
      test results will be given to them at their next visit. Next, they will be given another&#xD;
      6-week supply of the fiber product, the 3-day food diary, a daily and weekly IBS symptom&#xD;
      diary to fill out prior to Visit 4 and stool collection supplies. They are asked to collect&#xD;
      stool as previously indicated and bring the stool to Visit 4; handling will be identical to&#xD;
      previous visit. This visit will be about 2 hours in length. The next visit will be 6 weeks&#xD;
      after their Visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: The subject will give the study coordinator their 3-day food diary, the daily and&#xD;
      weekly IBS symptom diary, and any excess fiber product. The physician will review their IBS&#xD;
      symptom diary and ensure there are no significant adverse events. The physician will complete&#xD;
      a physical exam and take their vitals (such as weight, waist circumference and blood&#xD;
      pressure). The subject will then be asked to fill out a series of questionnaires relating to&#xD;
      their diet (VioScreen Food Frequency Questionnaire), IBS symptoms (IBS-Quality of Life&#xD;
      questionnaire (IBS-QoL) and IBS Questionnaire by Whorwell and Francis), sleeping/circadian&#xD;
      patterns (2 NIH sleep questionnaires, Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, Lark/Hummingbird/Owl&#xD;
      questionnaire, food timing questionnaire), the Expectancy and Credibility Questionnaire, and&#xD;
      the 34-item tool asking about their GI symptoms and severity. They will then have 2Â½&#xD;
      tablespoons of blood drawn by a certified nurse or medical assistant. Subjects will be&#xD;
      reminded in advance to fast 12 hours prior to their research visit. The blood tests include:&#xD;
      CBC, CMP, CRP, TSH, INR, fasting lipid profile and HbA1c. Among these blood tests, the&#xD;
      fasting lipid profile results will be given to the subject after the completion of the study.&#xD;
      The rest of the results will be given to the subject at their next visit. They will be&#xD;
      provided with a 3-day food diary and a daily and weekly IBS symptom diary to fill out prior&#xD;
      to Visit 5. Visit 4 will be about 3 hours in length. The next visit will be 4 weeks after&#xD;
      their fourth visit, which is the subjects' last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5: The subject will give the study coordinator their 3-day food diary and the daily and&#xD;
      weekly IBS symptom diary. The physician will review their IBS symptom diary and ensure there&#xD;
      are no significant adverse events. The physician will do a physical exam and take their&#xD;
      vitals (such as weight, waist circumference and blood pressure). The subject will then be&#xD;
      asked to fill out questionnaires relating to their IBS symptoms (IBS-Quality of Life&#xD;
      questionnaire (IBS-QoL) and IBS Questionnaire by Whorwell and Francis) and the 34-item tool&#xD;
      asking about their GI symptoms and severity. Next, they will have 2 tablespoons of blood&#xD;
      drawn by a certified nurse or medical assistant. Subjects will have been reminded in advance&#xD;
      to fast 12 hours prior to their research visit. The following blood tests will be done: CBC&#xD;
      and CMP. A copy of their blood test results, including the two fasting lipid profile tests,&#xD;
      will be given to the subject via e-mail or mail. This visit will be about 2 hours in length.&#xD;
