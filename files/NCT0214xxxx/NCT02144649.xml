    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial compares tangerine and red tomato juice in treating&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer undergoing surgery. A diet high in lycopene, a substance found&#xD;
      in tomatoes, may help prevent normal cells from transforming into cancer cells in patients&#xD;
      with prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To conduct a randomized, three-arm pilot clinical trial to determine compliance and safety&#xD;
      of daily consumption of tangerine tomato juice or red tomato juice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To quantify total carotenoids, total lycopene (LYC), cis-LYC, trans-LYC, phytoene,&#xD;
      phytofluene, and lycopene metabolites in plasma and prostate tissue in the three groups of&#xD;
      men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate serum biomarkers related to prostate carcinogenesis, including those&#xD;
      previously impacted by tomato phytochemicals (testosterone, sex hormone-binding protein&#xD;
      [SHBP], insulin-like growth factor [IGF]-I, IGF-binding protein [BP]3, vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor [VEGF], and a panel of anti-inflammatory cytokines) by validated assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate molecular signatures using the 200 gene quantitative Nano-string nCounter&#xD;
      code set (selected genes known to be impacted by dietary components, genes impacted by common&#xD;
      prostate genetic and epigenetic damage, and those regulated by testosterone) and&#xD;
      micro-ribonucleic acid (RNA) nCounter code set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To plot the distribution of carotenoid metabolites across the matrix versus the&#xD;
      epithelium and cancer versus non-cancer areas of the prostate using matrix-assisted laser&#xD;
      desorption ionization (MALDI) imaging of a limited number of samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients consume no tomato juice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients consume two cans of tangerine tomato juice daily until their scheduled&#xD;
      surgery (approximately 4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP III: Patients consume two cans of red tomato juice daily until their scheduled surgery&#xD;
      (approximately 4 weeks).&#xD;
