  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is important that pregnant women eat an adequate amount of protein to ensure healthy&#xD;
      growth and development of the fetus. Amino acids are the building blocks of the body's&#xD;
      protein. Glycine is an amino acid that can be made in the body, but under certain metabolic&#xD;
      circumstances (e.g. pregnancy) the body's needs may be higher and thus glycine must be&#xD;
      obtained from the diet. Currently, it is not known how much glycine may be needed from the&#xD;
      diet during pregnancy. We plan to study dietary glycine requirements in healthy pregnant&#xD;
      women, during early and late gestation. We will do this using a modern, safe and quick&#xD;
      method.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the dietary glycine requirement in healthy pregnant women during mid (20 - 30&#xD;
      weeks) and late (31 - 40 weeks) gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that there is a dietary requirement for glycine during pregnancy due to an&#xD;
      increased metabolic demand. With increased glycine intake we hypothesize to observe an&#xD;
      increase in protein synthesis, as measured by the indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO)&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inadequate protein intake during pregnancy may cause intrauterine growth restriction, which&#xD;
      is associated with increased risk of chronic diseases later in life. Currently, the dietary&#xD;
      intake recommendations for amino acids are greatly based on nitrogen balance studies of&#xD;
      non-pregnant adults. There is little scientific information regarding dietary glycine needs&#xD;
      during different stages of pregnancy, despite empirical evidence indicating gestational&#xD;
      differences in protein metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the current study is to determine the glycine requirement using the&#xD;
      minimally invasive indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) method in healthy pregnant women.&#xD;
      Our second objective is to compare the glycine requirement during mid (20-30 weeks gestation)&#xD;
      and late (31 - 40 weeks gestation) stages of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit a minimum of 18 pregnant women who may take part in 2 study days in both&#xD;
      gestational stages, for a total of 72 study days. Potential participants will meet us for a&#xD;
      preliminary assessment where we will evaluate their eligibility to participate in the study.&#xD;
      The preliminary study will take approximately 1 hr during which we will examine body&#xD;
      composition (bioelectrical impedance, skin-fold measurements, height and weight), resting&#xD;
      energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry), blood glucose (glucometer), and medical history&#xD;
      (questionnaire). Fasted blood glucose above 6.7 mmol/L is indicative of gestational diabetes.&#xD;
      Participants with fasted blood glucose concentrations above 6.7 mmol/L will be referred to&#xD;
      follow-up with their primary health care provider (see letter to physician).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test the participants urine using a dipstick, to assess whether proteinurea is&#xD;
      present. If there is an indication of proteinurea we will refer the participant to their&#xD;
      primary physician (See letter to physician - Urine results).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect a 3 day diet record to determine usual food intake and food preferences.&#xD;
      Based on the 3 day food record we will prescribe a standardized diet two days prior to the&#xD;
      study day to ensure protein intake of 1.5 g/kg/d and energy intake of 1.7 x resting energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each study day, eligible participants will randomly receive 1 of 36 test glycine&#xD;
      intakes during both mid and late pregnancy, ranging from 10 to 100 mg/kg/d. Each subject may&#xD;
      participate in 2 study days between 20-30 weeks gestation and 2 study days between 31 - 40&#xD;
      weeks gestation, for a total of 4 study days. The test glycine intakes will contain a&#xD;
      crystalline L-amino acid mixture based on the composition of egg protein, except for glycine.&#xD;
      The test glycine intake will be administered in an experimental diet, along with enough&#xD;
      non-protein energy to meet 1.7 x resting energy expenditure of each participant. The diet&#xD;
      will be provided as 8 meals, each representing 1/12th of the participant's daily intake&#xD;
      requirement. These meals will be provided over the course of an 8 hour study day. A stable&#xD;
      isotope tracer will be added to the 5th - 8th meal. We will measure the rate of oxidation of&#xD;
      this tracer in expired breath (F13CO2), and flux of this tracer by its enrichment in urine.&#xD;
