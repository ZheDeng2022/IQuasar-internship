      1. Title and stage of study A Phase II Study to Assess Efficacy of Combined Treatment with&#xD;
           Erlotinib (Tarceva) and Silybin-phytosome (Siliphos) in Patients with EGFR mutant lung&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Endpoints Primary Endpoint : tumour response rate Secondary Endpoint : progression-free&#xD;
           survival, overall survival, and safety assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Rationale Even though it is commonly accepted that EGFR TKIs are effective to EGFR&#xD;
           mutation positive lung cancer patients, still remains its resistance issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Silybin which is extract from mugwort bean Thistle and used for hepatoprotective&#xD;
           drug for a long time with very low adverse events in Eastern countries. Recently, there&#xD;
           are some reports regarding its anti-cancer effects through several preclinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The safety of Siliphos which is developed agent from silybin for improving intestinal&#xD;
           absorption was demonstrated in PhaseⅠtrial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recently investigators found out Silybin is effective for blocking EGFR signal in&#xD;
           different mechanism from Erlotinib and it can be expected additional impact with&#xD;
           combination therapy with preclinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our research team can expect to improve Lung cancer treatment if the combination therapy&#xD;
           (Silybin_Erlotinib) improves patients' response and Overall survivor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Treatment method Erlotinib (Tarceva 150 mg/day) and Silybin (Siliphos 1g bid/day) q 4&#xD;
           weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assessment criteria For toxicity assessment, posttreatment recurrence and survival rates&#xD;
           will be investigated based on NCI-CTCAE ver 4.0 and RTOG. Efficacy assessment will be&#xD;
           conducted through measurement of lesions by CT and RECIST criteria. Overall survival&#xD;
           (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and time to tumour progression (TTP) will be&#xD;
           estimated using a Kaplan-Meier analysis. In addition, effect of pre-treatment T790M on&#xD;
           response and PFS will be analyzed.&#xD;

&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignant tumor or metastasis. However,&#xD;
                the patients who are treated for CNS metastasis can be enrolled if their disease is&#xD;
                radiologically stable and asymptomatic. Asymptomatic patients without a history of&#xD;
                CNS metastasis do not need screening.&#xD;

&#xD;
             6. Patients ineligible for the study at the investigator's discretion&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
           Even though it is commonly accepted that EGFR TKIs are effective to EGFR mutation&#xD;
           positive lung cancer patients, still remains its resistance issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Silybin which is extract from mugwort bean Thistle and used for hepatoprotective&#xD;
           drug for a long time with very low adverse events in Eastern countries. Recently, there&#xD;
           are some reports regarding its anti-cancer effects through several preclinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The safety of Siliphos which is developed agent from silybin for improving intestinal&#xD;
           absorption was demonstrated in PhaseⅠtrial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recently investigators found out Silybin is effective for blocking EGFR signal in&#xD;
           different mechanism from Erlotinib and it can be expected additional impact with&#xD;
           combination therapy with preclinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our research team can expect to improve Lung cancer treatment if the combination therapy&#xD;
           (Silybin_Erlotinib) improves patients' response and Overall survivor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Treatment method&#xD;
&#xD;
           Erlotinib (Tarceva 150 mg/day) and Silybin (Siliphos 1g bid/day) q 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assessment criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           For toxicity assessment, posttreatment recurrence and survival rates will be&#xD;
           investigated based on NCI-CTCAE ver 4.0 and RTOG. Efficacy assessment will be conducted&#xD;
           through measurement of lesions by CT and RECIST criteria. Overall survival (OS),&#xD;
           progression-free survival (PFS), and time to tumour progression (TTP) will be estimated&#xD;
           using a Kaplan-Meier analysis. In addition, effect of pre-treatment T790M on response&#xD;
           and PFS will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Statistical method Object response rate (ORR) will be reported with its 2-sided 95%&#xD;
           confidence interval. If the evaluable number of subject is 42 and number of response is&#xD;
           25 or more, this study certainly imply that this treatment has an efficacy worthy of&#xD;
           further investigation, perhaps in a Phase III randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from beginning of treatment until&#xD;
      object disease progression as defined by RECIST or death. Patient who have not progressed or&#xD;
      died at the time of the statistical analysis will be censored at the time of their last&#xD;
      evaluable RECIST assessment. Kaplan-Meier plots of PFS and estimated of median PFS will be&#xD;
      presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from beginning of treatment until death by any&#xD;
      cause. Patient who have not died at the time of the data cut-off, or are lost to follow up&#xD;
      will be censored at the time they were last known to be alive. Kaplan-Meier plots of OS and&#xD;
      estimated of median PFS will be presented.&#xD;
