             clinical trials&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidate for intralesional therapy (ie, disease is appropriate for direct injection&#xD;
             or through the use of ultrasound guidance) defined as one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  for a subject not previously treated with talimogene laherparepvec:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  at least 1 injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal melanoma lesion ≥ 10 mm in&#xD;
             longest diameter, or&#xD;

             mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  for a subject previously treated with talimogene laherparepvec:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For a subject who previously received talimogene laherparepvec in another clinical&#xD;
             trial, subject must have ended treatment for reason(s) other than disease progression&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically active cerebral metastases. Subjects with up to 3 (neurological performance&#xD;
