    <textblock>
      Diarrhea as of today is still a major problem in developing world with high morbidity. Though&#xD;
      mortality in under-5 children has declined over the years, diarrhea was responsible for 2.5&#xD;
      million deaths per year in developing countries. A median of 3.2 episodes of diarrhea in&#xD;
      under-5 children per child-year has been estimated in developing countries. In Bangladesh,&#xD;
      the overall prevalence of diarrhea was estimated to be about 2% for the entire population.&#xD;
      However, a recent survey in 2003 with urban slum mothers indicated that the prevalence of&#xD;
      diarrhea ranged from 0.7-4.1% in six divisional cities with 0.7% in Dhaka slum areas.&#xD;
      Malnutrition remains the major adverse prognostic indicator for diarrhea related morbidity,&#xD;
      which emphasizes importance of nutrition in early management. Repeated episodes of diarrhea&#xD;
      are a frequent cause and consequence of malnutrition. To improve diarrhea situation in&#xD;
      Bangladesh and elsewhere, interventions are directed to reduce mortality and morbidity&#xD;
      through improvement of breast-feeding practices, complementary feeding, sanitation, increase&#xD;
      in measles immunization rates, micronutrient supplementation, and oral rehydration therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-lysine, an essential amino acid, is required for healthy growth, tissue repair and enzyme&#xD;
      production. It is a protein-building block that strengthens and nourishes the structural,&#xD;
      circulatory and immune systems. It is not produced by the body like other essential amino&#xD;
      acids and must be obtained from the diet. Some natural food sources for L-lysine include Lima&#xD;
      beans, kidney beans, potatoes, corn, red meat, fish and milk. The mean requirement of lysine&#xD;
      in healthy human adults is about 30 mg/kg body weight/day or 50 mg/g protein intake. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that lysine therapy improves immune status and is used as a therapeutic agent in&#xD;
      herpes simplex viral infection. A double-blind randomized trial of L-lysine treatment found&#xD;
      it to be an effective agent for significant reduction in occurrence, severity and healing&#xD;
      time for recurrent herpes simplex viral infection. Lysine fortification increased the blood&#xD;
      levels of complement 3 (C3), CD-4 and CD-8 T-cells as compared with controls. These two&#xD;
      studies suggest that supplementation of lysine through food fortification enhances&#xD;
      immunological status. A few recent studies have also shown an effect of lysine on diarrheal&#xD;
      incidence and severity. An experimental model suggested inhibitory effect of L-lysine on&#xD;
      incidence of diarrhea induced by stress and 5-hydroxytryptamine. A community trial among&#xD;
      adults in Syria showed that the period prevalence and mean duration of diarrheal illness were&#xD;
      significantly lower in the female participants who consumed lysine-fortified wheat bread&#xD;
      compared to the control group as well as better immunological parameters such as C3c delta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will observe the impact of a daily dose of 2000 mg supplemental L-lysine&#xD;
      for 6 months on diarrheal illness in an adult population of an urban slum area in Dhaka whose&#xD;
      principal diet is based on cereals such as rice and or wheat. The daily protein and lysine&#xD;
      availability from diets of Bangladeshi population has been calculated to be about 43g and&#xD;
      1883 mg respectively, compared to 113g and 7,598 mg respectively in the USA. This means that&#xD;
      2000 mg daily supplementation of L-lysine would not pose any detrimental effect, as the&#xD;
      combined usual and supplemental intake will still be substantially lower compared to the&#xD;
      intake in USA. However, as expected, the supplemental L-lysine may reduce the incidence and&#xD;
      severity of diarrheal illness through improvement of the nutritional and immunological status&#xD;
      of the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a community-based, double-blind randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial in Mirpur area of Dhaka city. Adults aged 18 to 45 years residing in the catchment area&#xD;
      for at least the last six months will be eligible for the study. A total of 440 subjects (220&#xD;
      females) will be enrolled. The results of the proposed study will contribute to our existing&#xD;
      knowledge of the effect of lysine on incidence and severity of diarrheal illness as well as&#xD;
      on immune status. A positive impact of lysine supplementation on diarrheal illness may lead&#xD;
      to a future strategic approach to the control of diarrhea as a global public health problem.&#xD;
