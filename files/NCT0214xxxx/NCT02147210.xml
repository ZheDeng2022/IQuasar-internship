  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal purpose is the study of the regulation of the expression of ephrin-B1 by&#xD;
      immunofluorescence in kidney biopsies of patients with Chronic transplant glomerulopathy&#xD;
      (CTG) compared to biopsies prior to the CTG, in same patients. Level of fluorescence in CTG&#xD;
      biopsy will be the experimental reference value.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic transplant glomerulopathy (CTG) is a specific lesion of kidney transplantation and a&#xD;
      poor prognostic factor affecting transplant survival. Diagnosis remains only microscopic and&#xD;
      lesions are irreversible. Recent studies prove that there is a strong correlation between CTG&#xD;
      and antibody mediated rejection (AMR) with a possible link with chronic aggression of the&#xD;
      endothelial cell. However, for unknown reason, all AMR does not lead to a CTG. Our recent&#xD;
      data on mice demonstrated that ephrin-B1 is expressed in the glomerular endothelial cells and&#xD;
      knockout mice for the gene encoding ephrin-B1 develop progressively ultrastructural&#xD;
      glomerular lesions close to modifications observed in CTG, as well as proteinuria and chronic&#xD;
      renal failure, suggesting that ephrin B1 could participate to CTG. Moreover, in a preliminary&#xD;
      study on human kidney transplant biopsy we observed decrease in ephrin-B1 immunofluorescence&#xD;
      on glomerulus when CTG, even in low grade. These data, and ultrastructural modifications in&#xD;
      Knock Out (KO) mice suggest that early regulation of kidney expression of ephrin-B1 in the&#xD;
      glomerulus may occur during the process leading to the CTG as antibody-mediated kidney&#xD;
      rejection (AMR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to determinate if ephrin-B1 expression is modified in CTG.&#xD;

        Biopsies from patients corresponding to eligibility criteria (see below) will be selected&#xD;
        from the list of kidney transplant patients followed up in the Toulouse University&#xD;
        Hospital. They will be divided into two groups matched for age, sex and time of kidney&#xD;
        transplantation (n = 30 for each group). Iterative biopsies are conserved in the collection&#xD;
        of tissue samples of the CHU&#xD;
