      We propose to conduct a pilot study that will examine the utility and mechanisms of&#xD;
      Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention in reducing alcohol consumption, relapse rates, and&#xD;
      physiological arousal to stress in adults 21 years of age and older who have met DSM-IV-TR&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence within the past year but have abstained from&#xD;
      drinking for the last thirty days. MBRP is designed to improve one's ability to self-regulate&#xD;
      emotions, thoughts and physical states, thus reducing the need to alleviate associated&#xD;
      discomfort through substance use. Participants assigned to the intervention group will&#xD;
      receive an 8-week training course of MBRP over a period of nine weeks; participants assigned&#xD;
      to the Treatment As Usual (TAU) group will continue treatment as usual, which includes&#xD;
      utilizing their own effective strategies to refrain from alcohol use. All participants will&#xD;
      be assessed for pretreatment severity of psychological abuse/trauma as well as pre and&#xD;
      posttreatment psychosocial functioning (e.g., alcohol consumption, symptoms of depression and&#xD;
      anxiety, emotion regulation/coping). The outcome of treatment will be evaluated using a)&#xD;
      Timeline Followback drinking data and b) self-report ratings of acquisition of MBRP skills&#xD;
      (e.g., state/trait mindfulness, acceptance and awareness, and perceived stress) and&#xD;
      depressive and anxiety symptom severity. We hypothesize that participants who receive MBRP&#xD;
      training will demonstrate greater acceptance and awareness, reduced cravings, and have a&#xD;
      lower likelihood of relapse than participants in the TAU group. It is also expected that MBRP&#xD;
      participants will demonstrate greater improvements on psychological measures of depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, emotion regulation and coping, and show less perceived stress and physiological&#xD;
      arousal to stress compared to TAU participants. Finally, little is known about which types of&#xD;
      individuals are most likely to benefit from MBRP. Thus, secondary analyses will help to&#xD;
      clarify for whom MBRP may be most effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress exposure increases psychological and physiological arousal and can lead to negative&#xD;
      health outcomes. An impaired ability to self-regulate in response to stress contributes to&#xD;
      the development of alcohol use disorders and relapse. Mindfulness, a state of present-focused&#xD;
      attention and awareness, can be systematically learned through meditative practice to improve&#xD;
      self-regulation of emotional, physiological and behavioral responses to stress. Mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation further facilitates a balance of mind and body thereby increasing one's ability to&#xD;
      respond proactively and effectively to daily events. Research evidence suggests a strong&#xD;
      association between mindfulness and positive indicators of well-being which include&#xD;
      reductions in fear, anxiety, anger, and better physiological recovery from stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the importance of self-regulation in the development and progression of alcohol use&#xD;
      disorders and relapse, a new approach to substance use treatment, Mindfulness-Based Relapse&#xD;
      Prevention (MBRP), was developed. Traditionally, MBRP is an eight-week outpatient treatment&#xD;
      program, which integrates core aspects of Relapse Prevention (RP) practices with practices&#xD;
      adapted from Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive&#xD;
      Therapy. The mindfulness practices in MBRP are designed to increase acceptance and tolerance&#xD;
      of negative emotions, thoughts and physical states thus reducing the need to alleviate&#xD;
      associated discomfort through substance use. MBRP also focuses on increasing awareness of&#xD;
      triggers and developing more effective coping behaviors in high-risk situations. Among adults&#xD;
      with substance use disorders, MBRP has been found to lead to significantly lower rates of&#xD;
      substance use, greater decreases in cravings and greater increases in acceptance and acting&#xD;
      with awareness than treatment as usual. MBRP has also been found to facilitate more effective&#xD;
      coping and self-regulation of negative emotions during early abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While research indicates that MBRP is effective in reducing substance use relapse, only&#xD;
      preliminary research has examined the influence of MBRP on the physiological mechanisms&#xD;
      involved in emotion regulation after exposure to stress. Examining these physiological&#xD;
      mechanisms is essential because the central and autonomic nervous systems work together to&#xD;
      coordinate the self-regulation of attention, cognition and emotion when stressful cues are&#xD;
      encountered, such as when a substance dependent individual is exposed to stressful and/or&#xD;
      substance related stimuli. Heart rate variability (HRV) is generally seen as an index of&#xD;
      emotion regulation. High frequency HRV reflects parasympathetic activation of the autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system and the body's ability to exert cognitive control over attention and emotional&#xD;
      responding. Higher levels of HRV are associated with greater emotional and behavioral&#xD;
      flexibility, and tend to be associated with better mental and physical health outcomes. In&#xD;
      contrast, lower levels of HRV are associated with a wide range of medical and psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders, including acute and chronic alcohol ingestion, anxiety and depression. Among&#xD;
      alcohol dependent individuals, mindfulness training has been found to increase HRV and lower&#xD;
      subjective levels of psychological distress in response to stressful cues in the short-term.&#xD;
      The proposed study will be the first to examine the long-term effects of MBRP on HRV and&#xD;
      self-reported psychological/behavioral functioning. The results will provide a better&#xD;
      understanding of the interplay between the psychological and physical mechanisms involved in&#xD;
      relapse and help determine whether MBRP has lasting psychological and physiological benefits.&#xD;
      In other words, assessing both the psychological and physiological effects of MBRP will&#xD;
      provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of how mindfulness aids in promoting&#xD;
      self-regulation and relapse prevention. Finally, little is known about which types of&#xD;
      individuals are most likely to benefit from MBRP. It is necessary to examine individual&#xD;
      characteristics (i.e., baseline levels of HRV, trait mindfulness, substance use, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression) to determine which characteristics are associated with positive treatment&#xD;
      outcomes in both the short and long-term. This knowledge will enable more efficient and&#xD;
      effective delivery of the MBRP treatment.&#xD;
