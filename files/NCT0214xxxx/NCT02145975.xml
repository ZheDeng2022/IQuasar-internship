      severe acute postoperative pain acts faster than its congener (morphine ) for pain relief .&#xD;

      Postoperative pain is a severe problem of high incidence worldwide. According to a systematic&#xD;
      review of the literature by Dolin et al , the incidence of moderate to severe postoperative&#xD;
      pain in 41% of patients were found , and of these , only 23% experienced relief of the same (&#xD;
      1). International Association for Study of Pain defines pain as unpleasant sensory or&#xD;
      emotional experience associated with actual or potential damage , or described in terms of&#xD;
      such damage ( 3). The postoperative pain is not only important for to cause suffering or&#xD;
      unpleasant experience to the patient, but also by involving harmful effects to the body ( 4).&#xD;
      Thus, the secondary stress to pain triggers the release of a series of hormonal mediators and&#xD;
      activation of the sympathetic nervous system in conjunction with surgical trauma and previous&#xD;
      comorbidities of the patient, that cause dysfunction of multiple organ systems , including&#xD;
      the cardiovascular (5, 6) , GI (7-10) and respiratory ( 11,12 ), among others , increasing&#xD;
      the incidence of postoperative complications such as myocardial ischemia , atelectasis (&#xD;
      25-75 % after abdominal surgery) , respiratory infections (pneumonia 1-3 % after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery ) , ileus , deep vein thrombosis and cognitive dysfunction. Thus increases the&#xD;
      morbidity and patient recovery is delayed. (5) Similarly it has been observed that&#xD;
      postoperative pain increases stay in the post anesthesia care unit , readmission for pain&#xD;
      management, and delayed rehabilitation and reintegration of patients to activities of daily&#xD;
      living , with the consequent increase in costs (5) . Considering the above arguments , it is&#xD;
      obvious that timely intervention generates profit problem on multiple levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the management of postoperative pain should include issues ranging from education to&#xD;
      the patient prior to its analgesic plan to late recovery period in the post-anesthesia care&#xD;
      area is crucial. This is because it has been shown that poor control of postoperative pain (&#xD;
      3) in the early hours is associated with higher levels of pain at 48 hours . There is growing&#xD;
      interest in the question of why , despite the availability of different drugs and&#xD;
      technological advances that allow a better understanding of the pathophysiology of pain , has&#xD;
      not been achieved a greater impact on the incidence of this problem ( 13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioids are the most important drugs for postoperative pain control. In the post-anesthesia&#xD;
      care area , especially when faced with a patient with severe or unbearable pain (14,15) , the&#xD;
      analgesic opioid titration is the most effective strategy for controlling postoperative pain&#xD;
      ( 16). The most studied and used today opioid is morphine, which by its pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      characteristics provides an important balance between speed of onset and maintenance of&#xD;
      analgesia ( 17). However, there are other alternatives for analgesic titration , such as&#xD;
      fentanyl , which has favorable pharmacokinetics to have a faster response and thus may&#xD;
      shorten the time needed to decrease pain from severe to mild ( 14,15). There are comparative&#xD;
      studies between fixed-dose fentanyl and morphine in the emergency services and some&#xD;
      preliminary tests in the recovery area (18,19). The most recent of analgesic titration trials&#xD;
      comparing appropriate doses of opioids to patient weight which would improve its efficacy and&#xD;
      safety ( 20). The tests that are known to have used fentanyl and morphine compared fixed-dose&#xD;
      and 10 minute intervals .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fentanyl is a potent opioid, it is theoretically 100 times more potent that morphine and in&#xD;
      severe acute postoperative pain acts faster than its congener (morphine ) for pain relief .&#xD;
      In the literature there is no study that corroborates this theoretical assumption and&#xD;
      proposes to compare which has fewer adverse effects. This drug produces effects similar to&#xD;
      those reported for morphine but less magnitude and has the advantage that during the&#xD;
      postoperative period respiratory depression, antitussive effect , gastrointestinal discomfort&#xD;
      and physical dependence are manifested in a significantly less degree.&#xD;
&#xD;

      by controlled clinical trial of superiority if in adult patients undergoing surgery ,&#xD;
      fentanyl reduces faster qualification time of severe pain to mild pain in the postanesthesia&#xD;
      care unit compared to morphine.&#xD;
