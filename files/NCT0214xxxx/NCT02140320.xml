  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RV1729 is a new medicine being developed for the potential treatment of asthma and smoking&#xD;
      related lung disease (also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - COPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of single doses of RV1729 and repeat doses of RV1729 for up to 28 days.&#xD;
