  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare two arms in a randomized clinical trial of cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      prevention in women with a history of preeclampsia. The first arm will provide postpartum&#xD;
      patients and their clinicians with the American Heart Association's (AHA) Class I Lifestyle&#xD;
      Recommendations for women with a history of preeclampsia. The second arm will additionally&#xD;
      receive access to a customized patient-informed online program with modules on how to achieve&#xD;
      the AHA recommendations for diet, activity and weight management.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team will work with patients via focus groups to develop a novel internet-based&#xD;
      program to provide information and tools for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction for&#xD;
      women who are at increased risk of CVD by virtue of their history of preeclampsia, a common&#xD;
      complication of pregnancy. The American Heart Association has recently issued guidelines that&#xD;
      physicians should include history of the hypertensive pregnancy disorder, preeclampsia, as a&#xD;
      risk factor for CVD. Indeed, research demonstrates that roughly 2 out of 3 women with a&#xD;
      history of preeclampsia will die from CVD. This study will work with patients with prior&#xD;
      preeclampsia and with the Preeclampsia Foundation, a patient- based organization, to create&#xD;
      an online lifestyle modification program ( accessible by computer or smart phone) for women&#xD;
      with recent preeclampsia to reduce CVD risk. The study is a randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      test the program's acceptability, use, and impact on diet, postpartum weight retention,&#xD;
      physical activity, blood pressure, and patient knowledge and self-efficacy to improve health.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Eating Habits Confidence Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months after intervention starts</time_frame>
    <description>The Eating Habits Confidence Survey measures the self-efficacy of a patient to improve their diet. Scores range from 1 (low self-efficacy) to 5 (high self-efficacy). A higher score is a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Exercise Confidence Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months after intervention starts</time_frame>
    <description>The Exercise Confidence Survey measures self-efficacy of patient to increase physical activity Scores range from 1 (low self-efficacy) to 5 (high self-efficacy). A higher score is a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>DASH Online Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months after intervention starts</time_frame>
    <description>The DASH Online Questionnaire is a food frequency questionnaire that prompts recall of daily servings of foods and beverages consumed in the past 30 days. We calculate a DASH score based on daily intake of eight components (fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, whole grains, low-fat dairy, sodium, lean meats and poultry, and sweets). Quintile rankings were summed across components to obtain a summary DASH score for each participant that ranged from 8 to 40. A higher score indicates higher DASH compliance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months after intervention starts</time_frame>
    <description>The Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire is a validated questionnaire for women that includes activities relevant to caring for young children. Our measure ascertained type, duration, and frequency of recreational activity and childcare activity. It also measured inactivity (sedentary behavior), such as reading, using a computer, and watching television. The time spent in each activity is multiplied by its intensity measured in Metabolic Equivalent of Task Value (METS) to yield the average weekly energy expenditure related to that activity. The score ranged from 0 to 113 METS per week.</description>

    <description>The Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire is a validated questionnaire for women that includes activities relevant to caring for young children. Our measure ascertained type, duration, and frequency of recreational activity and childcare activity. It also measured inactivity (sedentary behavior), such as reading, using a computer, and watching TV. The time spent in each inactivity was summed. The hours per week of reported inactivity ranged from 0 to 85.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Knowledge of Cardiovascular Disease Risk</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months after intervention starts</time_frame>
    <description>Adapted from 2012 American Heart Association National Survey of women's knowledge of their cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; adaptation is knowledge of risk with respect to preeclampsia history. The score ranges from 1 (low knowledge) to 4 (high knowledge).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Control Over Cardiovascular Disease Risk</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months after intervention starts</time_frame>
    <description>To assess women's sense of personal control over their health, we adapted Kim and Walker's survey on perception of chronic diabetes risk among women with a history of gestational diabetes, using factor analysis (with varimax rotation) to reduce seven items from the Kim scales to a single factor we named ''Personal Control over Cardiovascular Disease Risk.'' The resulting measure had a Cronbach's alpha of 0.73. The score ranges from 1 (low control) to 4 (high control). High control is a better outcome.</description>

        <title>DASH Online Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The DASH Online Questionnaire is a food frequency questionnaire that prompts recall of daily servings of foods and beverages consumed in the past 30 days. We calculate a DASH score based on daily intake of eight components (fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, whole grains, low-fat dairy, sodium, lean meats and poultry, and sweets). Quintile rankings were summed across components to obtain a summary DASH score for each participant that ranged from 8 to 40. A higher score indicates higher DASH compliance.</description>

        <title>Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire is a validated questionnaire for women that includes activities relevant to caring for young children. Our measure ascertained type, duration, and frequency of recreational activity and childcare activity. It also measured inactivity (sedentary behavior), such as reading, using a computer, and watching television. The time spent in each activity is multiplied by its intensity measured in Metabolic Equivalent of Task Value (METS) to yield the average weekly energy expenditure related to that activity. The score ranged from 0 to 113 METS per week.</description>

        <title>Patient Control Over Cardiovascular Disease Risk</title>
        <description>To assess women's sense of personal control over their health, we adapted Kim and Walker's survey on perception of chronic diabetes risk among women with a history of gestational diabetes, using factor analysis (with varimax rotation) to reduce seven items from the Kim scales to a single factor we named ''Personal Control over Cardiovascular Disease Risk.'' The resulting measure had a Cronbach's alpha of 0.73. The score ranges from 1 (low control) to 4 (high control). High control is a better outcome.</description>
