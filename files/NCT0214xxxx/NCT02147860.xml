  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this proposed research is to determine the safety, feasibility and&#xD;
      efficacy of the Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) controller in day and night closed-loop control in&#xD;
      children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes over multiple days in a diabetes camp setting.&#xD;
      This will be addressed in two parts: 1) An in residence, outpatient study to determine safety&#xD;
      and feasibility of the DiAs during 72 continuous hours of day and night glucose control; and&#xD;
      2) Camp studies planned for the summer of 2014 with randomization to either full closed-loop&#xD;
      or sensor-augmented pump therapy over the duration of 6-7 day diabetes camps.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is an early feasibility study that will test the efficacy of DiAs - a&#xD;
      smart-phone-based system compared to sensor augmented therapy in an outpatient setting.&#xD;
      Twelve study subjects with type 1 diabetes, six each at UVa and Stanford University, who have&#xD;
      experience with insulin pump use at two clinical sites will be recruited. The first six&#xD;
      subjects recruited will be aged 15-18 years and this will follow with recruitment of six&#xD;
      subjects aged 10-14 years. This study is designed to mimic the protocol at camp and will&#xD;
      include a period of light exercise after breakfast and moderate intensity physical activity&#xD;
      after lunch, with group activities such as soccer and volleyball. The duration of the&#xD;
      Outpatient in Residence Study will be 72 hours. The data will be reviewed by the Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) before proceeding to camp studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The camp study will recruit 48 subjects, with type 1 diabetes who have experience with&#xD;
      insulin pump therapy. Initial studies will be conducted at a camp with older participants&#xD;
      aged 15-35 years, with at least 5 of the campers between 15-18 years old. These studies will&#xD;
      be reviewed by the DSMB and, if safe, we will recruit additional children aged 10-14 years of&#xD;
      age. The duration of the Diabetes Camp Studies will be up to 7 days/6 nights.&#xD;

    <description>Each camp participant will be randomized to full day and night CLC or sensor augmented pump therapy for up to 7 days/6 nights.

    <description>With the use of the UVA Artificial Pancreas (DiAs), the study will assess safety and feasibility and are not powered for statistical significance. These studies are intended to train staff on system function and obtain data regarding safe and feasible system use.&#xD;
Camp participants will be randomized to either closed-loop control using the DiAs or sensor-augmented pump therapy only. These studies would generate up to 120 days of closed-loop data and 120 comparable days of open-loop data.</description>

    <description>DiAs is the central component of our system. It is a standard cell phone running on an Android operating system. The cell phone has been changed to prevent from (1) using it as a phone or browser, (2) changing the volume (3) accidentally shutting it off. The cell phone runs an algorithm and is connected to work with the insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor to help keep the blood sugar in a desired range and help avoid hypoglycemia during the night.</description>
