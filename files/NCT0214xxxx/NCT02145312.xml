  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One promising approach to the treatment of cancer is inhibition or modulating the crucial&#xD;
      signal transduction pathway of PI3K-Akt-mTOR. Several PI3K inhibitors are being tested in the&#xD;
      clinical trials for cancer treatment but not for the head and neck cancer yet. BYL719 is an&#xD;
      alpha specific I PI3K inhibitor. It showed significant, concentration dependent cell growth&#xD;
      inhibition and induction of apoptosis. We suggest multicenter single arm phase II study to&#xD;
      determine anti-tumor effects of BYL719 in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN who&#xD;
      failed to prior chemotherapy regimens. Enrollment will be done in 5 or more clinical trial&#xD;
      centers in Korea. Primary objective is to evaluate disease control rate (DCR) at 8 weeks of&#xD;
      BYL719, and the efficacy will be evaluated by the investigators analysis based on RECIST&#xD;
      version 1.1.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate disease control rate (DCR) at 8 weeks of BYL719 administered as therapy for patient with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, comparing with historical control. Efficacy evaluation will be based on RECIST version 1.1. DCR will be expressed percent and 95% confidence interval.</description>
