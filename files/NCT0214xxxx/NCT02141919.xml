    <textblock>
      The goal of this phase II clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of the completely&#xD;
      non-invasive treatment option of stereotactic radiation therapy for the treatment of biopsy&#xD;
      proven and growing small renal tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatment options for primary renal cancer include surgery or ablative techniques-all&#xD;
      are invasive or minimally invasive options. The completely noninvasive treatment option of&#xD;
      stereotactic radiation therapy (SABR), which has become standard of care in many cancer&#xD;
      sites, has not been explored for primary renal cancer. With multiple technological advances,&#xD;
      it is now feasible to safely treat a moving intra-abdominal tumor such as that in a kidney.&#xD;
      This proposed clinical trial evaluates the efficacy of SABR in treating patients with early&#xD;
      renal cancers. Growing renal masses will first be biopsied to confirm the diagnosis of renal&#xD;
      cancer. Patients will then undergo treatment with SABR of 3-5 fractions completing within&#xD;
      three weeks. Treatment response will be evaluated using sequential MRI scans and a second&#xD;
      tumor biopsy one year after treatment. Monitoring of treatment toxicity and kidney function&#xD;
      will also be performed.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  The treating renal mass must be ≤ 5cm. Other renal masses (cysts etc.) of any&#xD;
                  size will not make the subject ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
