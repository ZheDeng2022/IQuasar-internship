  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colloid solution is generally used to maintain intravascular volume. It is reported to impair&#xD;
      blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro more than crystalloid does by prolonging coagulation&#xD;
      time and decreasing clot strength. The formed fibrin clot is more vulnerable for fibrinolysis&#xD;
      in a case of using colloid. Dilution of plasmin in vitro with colloid enhances fibrinolysis&#xD;
      primarily by diminishing α2-antiplasmin-plasmin interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytics that competitively inhibits the activation of&#xD;
      plasminogen, by binding to specific site of both plasminogen and plasmin, a molecule&#xD;
      responsible for the degradation of fibrin, a protein that forms the framework of blood clot.&#xD;
      It is used to treat or prevent excessive blood loss during surgery and in other medical&#xD;
      conditions. Gastrointestinal effect, dizziness, fatigue, headache, hypersensitivity reaction,&#xD;
      or potential risk of thrombosis is reported as the adverse effect of tranexamic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that inhibition of plasmin by tranexamic acid after colloid administration&#xD;
      can improve the colloid-induced clot strength impairment.&#xD;
