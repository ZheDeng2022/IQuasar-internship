      1. Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In recent years, the incidence of infection caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR)&#xD;
           pathogen keeps increasing. The increase of MDR bacterial is a serious challenge for&#xD;
           empirical therapy. Common empirical antibiotic may not cover MDR pathogen and is&#xD;
           inappropriate for patients with infection caused by MDR pathogens, which finally&#xD;
           increases mortality. A number of studies have demonstrated MDR pathogens are related to&#xD;
           excess mortality, longer hospital stays and more treatment cost. Compared to infection&#xD;
           caused by non-MDR pathogens, infection caused by MDR pathogens possesses higher&#xD;
           mortality by 10% to 15%, longer ICU stays by 6 -10 days, and less appropriate empirical&#xD;
           antibiotics by 50%. In addition, studies have shown that the treatment of infection&#xD;
           caused by MDR pathogens is more expensive by $10,000-$50,000 than that by sensitive&#xD;
           pathogens. Monitoring of MDR pathogens may find epidemiological trends, discover new MDR&#xD;
           bacteria, evaluate risk factors and assess the effectiveness of interventions. Data of&#xD;
           MDR pathogens has been available in Europe and the United States, however, is absent in&#xD;
           China. By now, the features of bacterial resistance in different regions, hospitals, or&#xD;
           in certain patients with exposure to antibiotics, still keep uncertainty.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The current study is to enroll continuous MDR isolates and clinical data of the patients&#xD;
           from which the pathogens were isolated. The data may clarify the distribution and&#xD;
           characteristics of MDR pathogens in China, as well as clinical outcome of infection&#xD;
           caused by MDR pathogens, which is essential for management and treatment of infection&#xD;
           caused by MDR pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study center: 10&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Strains MDR gram-negative bacilli isolated from lower respiratory tract, pleural&#xD;
           effusion or blood will be reported to clinician. Confirmation that the isolate is 'real'&#xD;
           pathogen of a certain infection, not colonization or pollution, is needed. Microbiologic&#xD;
           data will be collected, such as result of susceptibility test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Gram-negative bacillus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Resistant to more than 3 kinds of antibacterial agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Repetitive organism isolated from the same center in one patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Judged as colonization or pollution by clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Enrolled into other trial, and the data is not available for the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Microbiologic investigators collect data:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. General data, strain name, source department.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Result of susceptibility test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Clinical data:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The current trial is observational. Clinicians, rather than investigators, will decide&#xD;
           the therapy. Clinical investigators confirm the MDR organism is not pollution or&#xD;
           colonization by both definitions of nosocomial infection and result of semi-quantitative&#xD;
           culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For those eligible strains, corresponding clinical data will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Demographic data. Name, gender, age and date of admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Symptoms and signs, especially those related to infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Laboratory result, such as blood and urine routine, biochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Medical complication, especially those that influence immunity, such as diabetes,&#xD;
                hepatic cirrhosis, malnutrition, malignancy, HIV infection or transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Previous medical therapy, especially late usage of antibiotic, steroids or other&#xD;
                immunosuppressive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Management of infection, including regimen and duration of antibiotic therapy,&#xD;
                prognosis, treatment and total cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Outcome of treatment, including efficacy at the end of antibiotic therapy and&#xD;
                30-day, ICU stay time, total hospital stay, and cost of antibiotic and totaltherapy&#xD;
                cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Continuous MDR gram-negative bacilli and clinical data: 1500 cases. Continuous Non-MDR&#xD;
           gram-negative bacilli and clinical data: 1500 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Mortality and therapy cost of MDR or non-MDR infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Success rate of different antibiotics regimen for treatment of MDR infection.&#xD;
                (Classified as 3rd and 4th cephalosporin,β-lactam and β-lactamase inhibitor&#xD;
                compounds, carbapenems and others, monotherapy or combined therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Risk factors of infection caused by MDR pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Resistant profile of MDR bacilli responsible for infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Therapy cost of MDR or non-MDR infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis is conducted by t-test for continuous variables and chi-square test for&#xD;
      categorical variables. Multivariate regression analysis, Logistic regression model is used to&#xD;
      clarify the independent risk factors of infection and death. All p values are retained until&#xD;
      after the decimal point two, and statistical significance was set at p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
