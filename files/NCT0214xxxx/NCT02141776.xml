  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a significant public health problem. Existing treatment&#xD;
      modalities are not always sufficient to alleviate this disorder. Treatment refractoriness is&#xD;
      a common clinical problem. Transcranial direct current stimulation (t-DCS), a non-invasive&#xD;
      brain stimulation technique, has been shown to be effective in alleviating depressive&#xD;
      symptoms in preliminary studies. There is need to explore the role of t-DCS in&#xD;
      Treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Therefore, the investigators aim to undertake this&#xD;
      exploratory study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the role of left prefrontal cortex anodal t-DCS daily stimulation of 4 weeks (20 week&#xD;
      days) with sham stimulation in alleviating depressive symptoms in patients with TRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Patients who seek treatment in our treatment resistant depression clinic and who&#xD;
      have failed to respond to treatment with two antidepressant medications will be offered to&#xD;
      enroll in this study. The aim is to study 20 patients who meet the Diagnostic and Statistical&#xD;
      Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for MDD between the ages of 21-65&#xD;
      years. Those subjects that receive sham stimulation will be offered to have active t-DCS&#xD;
      stimulation for additional 3 weeks to get any benefit that they may have otherwise missed by&#xD;
      being in the sham stimulation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results and Conclusions: The investigators will compare the mean baseline and end of&#xD;
      treatment Montgomery Asberg depression rating scale between the two groups. The investigators&#xD;
      will compare the change in mean depression scores between the baseline and end of treatment&#xD;
      in those receiving active t-DCS for a total of 7 weeks duration. This study is innovative and&#xD;
      of significance in exploring the role of this novel, easy to administer, safe and cost&#xD;
      effective treatment modality.&#xD;

      Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who score &gt;10 on our intake screening questionnaire, the patient Health&#xD;
           Questionnaire (PHQ-9) will be advised to call to seek participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who seek treatment in our treatment resistant depression clinic will be offered&#xD;
           to enroll in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients who have failed to respond to at least two antidepressants in adequate dosage&#xD;
           for at least 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The aim is to have 20 patients complete the study by enrolling 24 patients and screening&#xD;
           another 26 patients who meet the diagnostic and statistical manual, DSM-IV criteria for&#xD;
           Major depressive disorder, MDD and have failed treatment with at least two&#xD;
           antidepressant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients will be interviewed by investigators to see if they meet the eligibility for&#xD;
           inclusion in the study. The evaluation will consist a medical and psychiatric evaluation&#xD;
           if not done in last one year and a monthly urine pregnancy test for women of child&#xD;
           bearing potential. If the subjects do not meet the eligibility criteria they will&#xD;
           continue to receive routine clinical care or referral for appropriate psychiatric care&#xD;
           within or outside of our clinic/department&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Stimulation parameters: Left prefrontal anodal t-DCS stimulation daily for four weeks.&#xD;
           The stimulation parameters: current 2 mA continuously for 30 minutes. Conductive&#xD;
           electrodes covered by sponge soaked in saline will be used. The current will gradually&#xD;
           be increased to 2mA over 30 seconds to avoid sensation of a flash.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patients will be allotted to receive either active or sham stimulation by using a random&#xD;
           numbers assignment (www.randomizer.org). Co-investigator Dr. Holbert will be doing the&#xD;
           assessments rating the depressive symptoms and he kept blind as to the type of&#xD;
           stimulation received. The same machine will be used to give both active and sham&#xD;
           stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. At the end of four weeks subjects will be offered to stay in open label extension of&#xD;
           this study with active left prefrontal anodal t-DCS for another three weeks to receive&#xD;
           any benefits they may otherwise not receive by being in sham stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Materials: Montgomery Asberg depression rating scale, MADRS, Patient Health&#xD;
           Questionnaire, PHQ-9, Clinical Global Impression(CGI) at baseline and weekly.&#xD;
           Improvement will be considered as 50 % reduction in depressive scores and remission as a&#xD;
           score of less than 9 on MADRS. MADRS is a 10 item examiner rated scale that rates&#xD;
           various depressive signs and symptoms and has been used extensively in research of brain&#xD;
           stimulation techniques.PHQ-9 is a 9 item self-rated questionnaire about depressive&#xD;
           symptoms and has been found reliable in studies of depression in primary care and&#xD;
           psychiatric settings. CGI is a clinician rated impression about treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline: diagnostic interview, evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria, urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test if indicated at baseline and day 31, filling in questionnaires: PHQ-9, MADRS,&#xD;
      CGI Daily: t-DCS stimulation for 30 minutes; patients will be asked about any discomfort/side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days: 7,14,21,28,35,42,49: PHQ-9, MADRS, CGI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators will compare baseline to post treatment depression scores via&#xD;
      a two-sample t-test, comparing active treatment to sham using a two-sided P-value &lt;0.05 to&#xD;
      declare significance. The change in MADRS score (MADRS) will be the primary outcome&#xD;
      variables. Secondary variables will be analyzed similarly in this pilot study. Significant&#xD;
      findings on secondary variables will not be considered as definitive.&#xD;
