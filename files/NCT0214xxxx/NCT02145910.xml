      This phase I trial studies the best dose of vemurafenib when combined with whole brain&#xD;
      radiation therapy (WBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with v-raf murine&#xD;
      sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) mutation-positive melanoma and brain metastases.&#xD;
      Radiation therapy is an effective treatment for patients with brain metastases. Patients with&#xD;
      multiple metastases are typically treated with WBRT. For patients with a few metastases, SRS&#xD;
      alone can be used. Vemurafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Combining radiation treatment with vemurafenib for melanoma&#xD;
      patients with brain metastases may result in improved local control and prolonged survival.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vemurafenib when combined with WBRT or&#xD;
      SRS and determine a recommended phase II dose of vemurafenib to be used with WBRT or SRS in&#xD;
      patients with brain metastases from melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine local control rates of the brain metastases in each arm. II. To determine the&#xD;
      rates of developing of new brain metastases in each arm. III. To determine the response of&#xD;
      extracranial disease. IV. To determine the overall survival rate and progression free&#xD;
      survival rate. V. To determine the safety and tolerability of each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vemurafenib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms&#xD;
      based on the number and size of brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive vemurafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) beginning 3-5 days before the&#xD;
      start of radiation therapy and continuing in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients undergo WBRT once daily (QD) for 10 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients undergo SRS (gamma knife, tomotherapy, cyberknife, or megavoltage linear&#xD;
      accelerator [LINAC] radiation therapy) on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up on weeks 5 or 7, 9 and 13, and&#xD;
      then on months 4, 6, 9, and 12.&#xD;
