      The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of doxorubicin loaded ONCOZENE&#xD;
      microspheres chemoemobilization for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also describe the overall response rates of lesions with&#xD;
      Oncozene-DEB-TACE(Trans-arterial chemoemobilization) per modified RECIST criteria (Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors).&#xD;

    <description>ONCOZENE microspheres are the newly available microspheres for DEB-TACE. It appears (based on the preliminary bench tests) that these microspheres may allow more efficient drug loading, and slow elution and equivalent vascular occlusion(12). In this pilot study, we aim to assess the safety of these microspheres when used for chemoembolization of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.</description>
