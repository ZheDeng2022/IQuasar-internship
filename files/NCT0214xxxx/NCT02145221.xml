    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying music therapy as an incentive and adjunct to a comprehensive&#xD;
      spine surgery rehabilitation-recuperation program. Through the use of music therapy&#xD;
      psychosocial support is motivated by the clinical use of music. The program will investigate&#xD;
      the use of music therapy as an option for managing symptoms associated with spine surgery&#xD;
      recovery. The proposed program will investigate the use of music therapy as an integrative&#xD;
      treatment within Beth Israel's Department of Spine Surgery.This study will investigate the&#xD;
      effects of music therapy in managing spine surgery recuperation and to reduce the intensity&#xD;
      and experience of pain. Outcomes will include: Pain (pain medication dosage and patient&#xD;
      report) using a CAS Color Analysis Scale and the VAS Pain Rating Scale, level of&#xD;
      self-reliance/independence using physical therapy assessment scale, cooperation through&#xD;
      evaluating number of times patient declined/accepted services, length of stay, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction/patient report, level of kinesiophobia using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia&#xD;
      and anxiety/depression using the HADS during the period post-spine surgery.(see attached&#xD;
      scales in Appendix section)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed research will combine traditional medical care with an integrative model of&#xD;
      care; music therapy will be an integrative intervention and we will study the effects of&#xD;
      music therapy interventions, which include: clinical improvisation, rhythm which can enhance&#xD;
      assisted walk and music-assisted physical movement which may encourage patients to experience&#xD;
      a greater tolerance to pain, improving gait, range of motion, endurance, and the ability to&#xD;
      relax, motivation to participate in daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:The primary goals are to assess pain, independence, compliance, length of stay,&#xD;
      patient satisfaction/patient report, level of kinesiophobia and anxiety/depression related to&#xD;
      medical condition during the period post-spine surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the Study:This study will use quantitative and qualitative methodologies. A&#xD;
      randomized control design that will include two groups of patients that will be targeted to&#xD;
      include up to 60 male and female patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group will receive music therapy and standard care and a second group will&#xD;
      serve as a wait-listed control, receiving only standard care. Patients with undergoing ASP,&#xD;
      PSF or A/PSF will be placed with consent randomly into the experimental or control group.&#xD;
      Patients belonging to the experimental group will receive one music therapy session after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, the VAS Pain Rating Scale, the HADS - Hospitalization Anxiety/Depression&#xD;
      Scale, the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, and the Color Analysis Scale will be introduced.&#xD;
      For both groups of patients measurements will be logged before and after the music therapy&#xD;
      session, or no intervention during the same time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Patients will be recruited by the attending doctor, nurse, physical therapist&#xD;
      and/or social worker. Patients in the experimental group will participate in an active&#xD;
      music-listening and active music-making session post-spine surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The music therapy session will last approximately 30 minutes and will encourage patients to&#xD;
      engage in active music-making to release pain, and to reduce anxiety/fear related to surgery&#xD;
      and recuperation. The music therapy sessions will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Warm up: Verbal or musical discourse&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment section: Based upon assessment of patient's needs during the warm up,&#xD;
           treatment options will include the use of live music and either:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tension release/relaxation through entrained music visualization or Incentive-based play&#xD;
           through clinical improvisation or rhythmic drumming&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Closure/Integration (if awake) to reflect upon the session and issues that may have&#xD;
           arisen.&#xD;
