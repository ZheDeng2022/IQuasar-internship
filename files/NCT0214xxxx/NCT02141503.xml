      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Alpha-mannosidosis is a rare inherited disorder. It causes problems in many organs and&#xD;
      tissues of the body. It can occur in children and adults. Because there is no treatment for&#xD;
      this disease, researchers want to find out more about it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn more about Alpha-mannosidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People ages 5-60 with Alpha-mannosidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be recruited from patient support organizations and medical genetics&#xD;
           clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 3 study visits, about once a year. A final evaluation will be&#xD;
           made after 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a medical history and a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples and a urine sample will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cerebrospinal fluid will be collected. A small area of the lower back will be numbed&#xD;
           with medicine. A thin needle will be inserted between the spine bones. About 2&#xD;
           tablespoons of spinal fluid will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) scans will be done at each visit. MRS uses a&#xD;
           strong magnetic field and radio waves to take pictures of chemicals in the brain with a&#xD;
           scanner. The participant will lie on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder.&#xD;
           While in the scanner the participant will hear loud knocking noises. They will get&#xD;
           earplugs or earmuffs to muffle the sound. Medicines might be used to keep the&#xD;
           participant asleep during the MRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a skin biopsy at the first visit only. A small area of the&#xD;
           participant s skin will be numbed. A small circle of skin will be removed with a biopsy&#xD;
           tool.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alpha-mannosidosis (AMD) is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in&#xD;
      the LAMAN gene, which encodes lysosomal alpha-mannosidase and is characterized by&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental delay, mild immune deficiency, facial and skeletal abnormalities, hearing&#xD;
      impairment, intellectual disability, muscle weakness and ataxia. The progression of&#xD;
      neuromuscular and skeletal deterioration is insidious, occurring over several decades,&#xD;
      rendering most patients wheel-chair dependent. No consistently successful treatment is&#xD;
      available. To better characterize the biochemical phenotype and natural history of this&#xD;
      disorder, we will study 15 patients with AMD, ranging in age from five to 60 years, recruited&#xD;
      from Departments of Biochemical Genetics and Medical Genetics at university medical centers&#xD;
      mainly in the US and Canada or referred by the Intl Society for Mannosidosis &amp; Related&#xD;
      Diseases. Participants in the study will visit the NIH Clinical Center 2-3 days on an&#xD;
      outpatient basis and will undergo clinical and biochemical evaluations to establish reliable&#xD;
      clinical&#xD;
&#xD;
      benchmarks and to identify cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers that could serve as candidate&#xD;
&#xD;
      surrogate markers of treatment effect in future clinical trials. The protocol will take&#xD;
      advantage of the NICHD Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Facility to generate CSF proteomic&#xD;
      profiles. Patients will also undergo MR spectroscopy (under sedation/anesthesia, if&#xD;
      appropriate) in order to establish the phenotypic baseline and for possible utility as a&#xD;
      guide for natural history and/or treatment outcomes in future studies. If the pre-clinical&#xD;
      components of this proposal prove promising, the prospect of a recombinant adeno-associated&#xD;
      viral gene therapy trial involving a brain-directed (intrathecal) approach for AMD would be&#xD;
      possible within 3 years.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Must have a verifiable diagnosis of AMD based on clinical, biochemical and/or&#xD;
                  molecular grounds, including increased urinary excretion of mannose-rich&#xD;
                  oligosaccharides, decreased acidic -mannosidase activity in leukocytes or other&#xD;
                  nucleated cells, and/or mutations in two alleles of the LAMAN gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Must be at least five years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Significant systemic or major disease including congestive heart failure, coronary&#xD;
             artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and pre-existing or recent onset pulmonary&#xD;
             disease, renal failure, organ transplantation, decompensated liver disease, serious&#xD;
             psychiatric disease, or malignancy that in the opinion of the investigator would&#xD;
             preclude successful participation..&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnancy. We will perform a urine pregnancy test on all post-menarcheal female&#xD;
             subjects on the same day as the history and physical exam, prior to MRI. If pregnancy&#xD;
             is identified, we will follow Maryland state law in place at the time concerning&#xD;
             parental notification. In the event a woman becomes pregnant during the study, she&#xD;
             will be withdrawn from all study procedures, but the study team will follow up with&#xD;
             the participant regarding the pregnancy outcome.&#xD;
