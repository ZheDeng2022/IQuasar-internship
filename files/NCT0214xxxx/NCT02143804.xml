  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access protocol to study the safety and efficacy of CG0070 in Cis and Cis&#xD;
      with Ta and/or T1 disease patients who failed both BCG therapy and the BOND protocol (NCT&#xD;
      01438112), or in high grade Ta and T1 patients who failed BCG therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The plan is to study the safety and efficacy of CG0070 in high-grade NMIBC patients who&#xD;
      failed BCG therapy. Most patients with NMIBCis (Cis, Cis with Ta and/or T1, high grade Ta or&#xD;
      T1 with frequent or uncontrolled recurrences) who have failed BCG intravesical therapy&#xD;
      (standard of care) usually have no other choice but to proceed to cystectomy. Cystectomy is a&#xD;
      surgery associated with major morbidity, mortality and quality of life issues. Morbidity and&#xD;
      long term tedious medical care will be for the rest of the patient's life span. Most patients&#xD;
      at this stage do not show signs of disease progression into the muscle layer or of&#xD;
      metastasis, making surgery a very difficult decision. CG0070, if successful in this trial,&#xD;
      will serve to provide a therapeutic alternative for this patient population in need. For the&#xD;
      present study, Cis or Cis with Ta and/or T1 patients can only be enrolled if they have failed&#xD;
      the BOND study and are medically unfit for surgery. Furthermore, patients with high grade Ta&#xD;
      or T1 disease who have failed both BCG and chemotherapy treatments are also prone to disease&#xD;
      progression. Since these patients are not eligible to be enrolled in the BOND trial, the&#xD;
      present study will serve as an alternative to access CG0070 experimental treatment.&#xD;
