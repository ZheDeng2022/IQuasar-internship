  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Velcade (bortezomib), thalidomide and dexamethasone (VTD) has been demonstrated to be a&#xD;
      highly effective combination in both patients with previously untreated and those with&#xD;
      relapsed multiple myeloma. In previously untreated patients VTD demonstrated clear&#xD;
      superiority to TD as induction therapy prior to planned tandem autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of this trial is to combine a 'gold standard' antiMM combination with the HDAC&#xD;
      inhibitor Panobinostat. There is emerging data to support the concept of clinical synergy&#xD;
      between BTZ and HDACi's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and estimated&#xD;
      response rates of panobinostat, administered in combination with VTD, in subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
