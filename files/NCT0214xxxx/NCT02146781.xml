  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study of a vaccine for allergy to Japanese Red Cedar. The vaccine is&#xD;
      called CryJ2-DNA-LAMP Plasmid vaccine. This research study will determine how the vaccine is&#xD;
      tolerated and how research participants respond to the vaccine using a different route of&#xD;
      administration, the Intradermal (ID) route. CryJ2-DNA-LAMP Plasmid vaccine is&#xD;
      investigational, which means it is not approved for use by the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) but is available in research studies like this one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a Phase IC study to assess and evaluate the safety and immunological responses&#xD;
      to therapeutic doses of a dosing regimen of 1.08 mg and 2.16 mg of CryJ2-DNA-LAMP plasmid&#xD;
      vaccine delivered intradermally (ID) using the Biojector 2000 device, to be administered&#xD;
      every 14 days in subjects with atopic sensitivity to Japanese Red Cedar pollen, identified by&#xD;
      skin test reactivity to this pollen. The protocol has three subject cohorts: a Cohort 1:&#xD;
      composed of atopic and non-atopic subjects (half atopic and half non-atopic), who will only&#xD;
      receive saline control administered using the Biojector 2000 device; a Cohort 2: atopic&#xD;
      subjects, who will receive 2.16 mg per dose in a four (4) dose regimen using a Biojector 2000&#xD;
      device; and a Cohort 3: atopic subjects, who will receive 1.08 mg per dose in a four (4) dose&#xD;
      regimen vaccinated using a Biojector 2000 device.The study will be conducted at 1 study&#xD;
      center. Subjects are enrolled in the trial for a period of 132 days. The objectives of the&#xD;
      statistical analyses are to establish the safety and to explore the immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      LAMP-vax vaccine using a different route of administration, the Intradermal (ID) route. All&#xD;
      statistical analyses conducted on the data from this trial will be exploratory in nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this Phase IC Study is to evaluate the safety and immunological&#xD;
      responses of therapeutic doses and the dosing regimen of CryJ2-DNA-LAMP plasmid vaccine&#xD;
      delivered intradermally (ID) using the Biojector 2000 device.&#xD;

      A safety and Immunological assessment of JRC sensitive (atopic) subjects will be assessed in&#xD;
      terms of current skin test reactivity. Subjects that are eligible to participate in this&#xD;
      study will be assigned by whether they are sensitive or non sensitive to CryJ2 or Mountain&#xD;
      Cedar to one of 3 study vaccine cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: These Japanese Red Cedar atopic and non-atopic subjects will be recruited as a&#xD;
      placebo control. This cohort will be composed of 5 atopic and 5 non-atopic subjects (half of&#xD;
      the subjects will be atopic and half non-atopic), that will receive 4 vaccinations, 14 days&#xD;
      apart, of a saline control in four separate 0.200 ml volumes administered Intradermally (ID)&#xD;
      using the needle-free Biojector device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: These Japanese Red Cedar atopic subjects will receive intradermal (ID) injections&#xD;
      of the same CryJ2-DNA-LAMP vaccine previously used in Phase IA and IB studies. Cohort #2 will&#xD;
      receive four (4) 2.16 mg doses at 14 day intervals. Each 2.16 mg dose will require&#xD;
      administration of four (4) separate 0.200 ml volumes of a 2.7 mg/ml vaccine concentrate using&#xD;
      the needle-free Biojector device. Each of the four volumes will be injected at different&#xD;
      sites on the same or different deltoid muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3: These Japanese Red Cedar atopic subjects will receive intradermal (ID) injections&#xD;
      of the same CryJ2-DNA-LAMP vaccine previously used in Phase IA and IB studies. Cohort #3 will&#xD;
      receive four (4) 1.08 mg doses at 14 day intervals. Each 1.08 mg dose will require&#xD;
      administration of two (2) separate 0.200 ml volumes of a 2.7 mg/ml vaccine concentrate using&#xD;
      the needle-free Biojector device. Each of the four volumes will be injected at different&#xD;
      sites on the same or different deltoid muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be between 18 to 26 men and women participating in the study at one location. Your&#xD;
      participation in this study will last approximately 132 days.&#xD;

These subjects were identified by positive skin test re-activity and/or IgG specific antibody titers from previous time-points in the Phase IA using one boost of IM route of administration.&#xD;

    <description>The subjects in Cohort 1 will receive four doses of saline control 14 days apart, beginning Day 0. Each dose will be delivered as four separate injections of 0.200 mL volumes administered Intradermally (ID) using the needless Biojector 2000 device in separate skin sites. The use of the four 0.200 mL volumes is necessitated in order to compare the skin test sites to the number of sites in Cohorts 2 (4 sites per dose) and Cohort 3 (2 sites per dose). The multiple intradermal administration sites per dose are because of the dilute vaccine material (2.7 mg/mL).</description>
