  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. It causes more than one&#xD;
      million deaths every year. Researchers want to gather tissue samples from people with lung&#xD;
      and thymic cancers to understand the disease better. This may lead to new ways to diagnose&#xD;
      and treat it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect tissue samples for use in the study of lung cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults over age 18 with non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, extra pulmonary&#xD;
      small cell cancer, pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors, and thymic epithelial tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;
           They will be asked about how they perform their daily tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may be asked to give urine and blood samples. They may give a saliva sample&#xD;
           if they cannot give blood. They will also give a sample of their tumor from a biopsy&#xD;
           they had. They may also be given the option to undergo a biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have MRI, CT, and/or PET scans of the body. They will lie in a machine&#xD;
           that takes pictures of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After visits to the Clinical Center end, researchers will contact participants by phone&#xD;
           every year to check on their health.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, accounting for more&#xD;
           than one million deaths every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Several genetic and epigenetic alterations are involved in initiation and progression of&#xD;
           NSCLC. Some of these alterations are seen in normal and preneoplastic cells as well,&#xD;
           suggesting a sequential development from normal epithelial cells to cancer, through a&#xD;
           multistep process, usually coincident with cigarette smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This natural history protocol is an extension of our Molecular Profiling protocol to&#xD;
           enable tissue collection for more in-depth proteomic and genomic analyses to understand&#xD;
           tumor biology and treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cohort of patients enrolled in this natural history study is likely to enroll in the&#xD;
           IRB approved protocol for end-of-life in-patient hospice and rapid autopsy following&#xD;
           death (13-C0131). Longitudinally collected tumor tissue from these patients, including&#xD;
           from several metastatic sites at autopsy will be a unique resource to understand tumor&#xD;
           evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be opportunity to embark upon a wide array of studies in the future with the&#xD;
           longitudinally collected tissue samples tagged with clinical information from patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To allow sample acquisition for use in the study of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),&#xD;
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), extrapulmonary small cell cancer (ESCC), pulmonary&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumors (PNET), and thymic epithelial tumors (TETs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC, SCLC, ESCC, PNET, and&#xD;
           TET.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients consulted in the Clinical Center without a definitive diagnosis, but clinically&#xD;
           considered likely to have a thoracic malignancy of the above histologies, pending&#xD;
           further tissue acquisition and/or pathology review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a bio-specimen collection and natural history protocol in which samples will be&#xD;
           collected from patients with NSCLC, SCLC, ESCC, PNET, and TET.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible patients undergoing screening for or participating in NIH protocols or eligible&#xD;
           patients treated elsewhere and referred from other oncologists will be referred for&#xD;
           participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upon providing informed consent, patients will undergo sample acquisition procedures,&#xD;
           which may include a tumor biopsy, bone marrow biopsy or the collection of blood, urine&#xD;
           or other body fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An accrual ceiling of 2000 subjects is planned over an accrual period of 10 years.&#xD;
