  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-site (up to 5 sites), single-blinded, randomized trial. Up to 88&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled and randomized to one of four treatment groups (4 Groups of 22&#xD;
      subjects), and will receive study treatments based on their assigned treatment group.&#xD;
      Following study treatments, follow-up visits will occur at 90, 180 and 365 days from each&#xD;
      subject's last study treatment.&#xD;

      Clinician Erythema Assessment (CEA) and Patient Self-Assessment (PSA) scores, assessing&#xD;
      severity of erythema, will be obtained prior to study treatment to confirm subject&#xD;
      eligibility. Enrolled subjects will receive up to three dual-depth treatments to affected&#xD;
      areas of the midface (cheeks, chin, forehead, glabella and nose) each treatment provided&#xD;
      approximately 2 weeks apart. Groups A and B will receive low-density treatment, and Groups C&#xD;
      and D receive high-density treatment. Groups A and C will receive 2 treatments. Groups B and&#xD;
      D will receive 3 treatments. Protocol amended Sept 2014: Groups A and C will receive 1&#xD;
      treatment; Groups B and D will receive 2 treatments.&#xD;
