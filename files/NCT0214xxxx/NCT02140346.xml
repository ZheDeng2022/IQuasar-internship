    <textblock>
      RV1729 is a new medicine being developed for the potential treatment of asthma and smoking&#xD;
      related lung disease (also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - COPD). The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics repeat doses of RV1729 in patients with COPD for 28 days.&#xD;
