  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a drug called carfilzomib used in combination with another&#xD;
      drug called belinostat with participants who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
      (NHL).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered&#xD;
      safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have NHL, not&#xD;
      everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study&#xD;
      drug. The dose the each participant gets will depend on the number of participants who have&#xD;
      been enrolled in the study prior and how the dose was tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Drug(s): Both carfilzomib and belinostat will be given through a vein in the&#xD;
           participant's arm (IV infusion). Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days (4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Carfilzomib will be given on Days 1-2, 8-9, and 15-16 of each cycle. The&#xD;
                carfilzomib infusion will be given over about 10 minutes during the first cycle.&#xD;
                However if the dose is increased over the course of the trial, or if in one of the&#xD;
                groups that joins the study at a higher dose level, the infusion will last about 30&#xD;
                minutes. All participants will remain at the clinic under observation for at least&#xD;
                1 hour following each dose of carfilzomib during Cycle 1 and after the Cycle 2 Day&#xD;
                1 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Belinostat will be given on Days 1-5 of each cycle. The belinostat infusion will be&#xD;
                given over about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical Exams: During all cycles the participant will have a physical exam and will be&#xD;
           asked questions about their general health and specific questions about any problems any&#xD;
           medications you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacokinetic (PK) blood tests: One of the main reasons for this study is to find the&#xD;
           highest dose of the study drug combination that can be used safely without experiencing&#xD;
           severe side effects to use for future studies. Once this dose is found (the maximum&#xD;
           tolerated dose, or MTD), additional blood samples will be drawn from a small set of&#xD;
           participants (about 5 participants total) to learn more about the activity of the study&#xD;
           drugs in the body over a period of time, including the ways the study drugs are&#xD;
           absorbed, distributed, and then released from the body. If participating in this group&#xD;
           (the participant will be informed from the Investigator) these pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
           samples will be drawn repeatedly over a period of 24 hours on certain days: Blood&#xD;
           samples will be drawn at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 minutes, and 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours after&#xD;
           the study drug dosing on Days 1-2, 4-5, and 9 of Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans (or Imaging tests): Tumor assessment by CT or PET CT scans once every 8 weeks&#xD;
           (every other cycle).&#xD;

Participants with high-grade histologies will be staged and re-staged with PET/CT scans.</description>

    <description>Carfilzomib and Belinostat will be administered on a 28-day schedule.&#xD;
Carfilzomib will be given on days 1-2, 8-9, and 15-16 of each cycle, beginning at a dose of 20 mg/m2 (dose level 0).&#xD;
Belinostat will be given on days 1-5 beginning at a dose of 600 mg/m2.&#xD;
Belinostat dosing will precede carfilzomib dosing on days when both drugs are administered. In dose level 1 and beyond, carfilzomib will be given at a dose of 20mg/m2 with cycle 1, and then escalated with cycle 2&#xD;
A maximum of four dose levels are planned with carfilzomib escalated no higher than 20/36 mg/m2 and belinostat escalated no higher than 900 mg/m2.</description>
