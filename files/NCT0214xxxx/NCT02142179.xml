      The purpose of this study is to estimate the impact of a curriculum intervention on asthma&#xD;
      knowledge in adolescents of a public school in Salvador-Bahia-Brazil.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is one of major causes of morbidity and mortality due to chronic diseases worldwide&#xD;
      with higher mortality and morbidity in adolescents. Interventions directed to adolescents and&#xD;
      systematically developed within the school environment has been performed around the world.&#xD;
      In spite of that, studies such Bruzzese (2004; 2011) have already shown that clinical&#xD;
      interventions associated with educational activities in group composed of individuals with&#xD;
      similar lifestyles and characteristics are able to modify the behavior of the individual as&#xD;
      well as reduce emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Thus, it is necessary to develop&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a controlled clinical trial. The intervention will be a curriculum intervention&#xD;
      on asthma. This intervention will consist of theoretical - practical weekly workshops with a&#xD;
      targeted content for asthma and involves aspects related to anatomy and physiology of the&#xD;
      respiratory tract, conceptualization of asthma, prevention, treatment, maintenance and&#xD;
      retrieval; recognition and actions in periods of exacerbations and use the action plan. These&#xD;
      workshops are suitable for the course plan of disciplines sciences, biology, chemistry,&#xD;
      physics, history , geography, portuguese and mathematics . Those are characterized as a&#xD;
      mandatory curriculum component and they should be developed for all students in elementary&#xD;
      and secondary education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel curriculum intervention, the investigators will identify the frequency of&#xD;
      individuals with diagnosis/symptoms suggestive of asthma by applying the ISAAC questionnaire&#xD;
      and verification of Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) using the portable&#xD;
      Vitalograph copd - 6. This assessment will identify students with suspected asthma, symptoms&#xD;
      suggestive of asthma and asthma diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The curriculum will be organized educational intervention with school staff to be applied to&#xD;
      the intervention group (it includes all students from 10 to 19 years previously registered.&#xD;
      The afternoon shift is defined as the intervention group and may participate asthmatic and&#xD;
      non-asthmatic students). It is noteworthy that, subsequently, the same intervention will be&#xD;
      performed with the control group (in which students participate in the morning shift and may&#xD;
      participate in asthmatic and non-asthmatic students). The intervention group will receive a&#xD;
      complementary intervention where questions directed reinforce attitudes in periods of&#xD;
      exacerbation and use the action plan, while the control group will receive this same&#xD;
      intervention after the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be held at the College Presidente Emilio Garrastazu Medici (Currently its name&#xD;
      is College Estadual do Stiep Carlos Marighella) which is a school unit with medium-sized and&#xD;
      offers all series of the second segment of the Elementary School, Middle School and&#xD;
      Professional Education. This school was chosen because of system of evaluation and teaching&#xD;
      methodology as well defined in its political pedagogical project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will identify the frequency of individuals with diagnosis/symptoms&#xD;
      suggestive of asthma by applying the ISAAC questionnaire and verification of Forced&#xD;
      Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) will monitor all individuals duly registered and&#xD;
      allocated in the age group 10-19 years are enrolled in the 5th to 8th grades in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A despite about data Collection Instrument, will be used: 1. Questionnaires ISAAC -&#xD;
      International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood; 2. Form to characterize the&#xD;
      subjects and clinical outcomes and 3. Structured questionnaires for assessing knowledge (two&#xD;
      different data collection instruments):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Questionnaires ISAAC - International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the first phase of the study, standardized questionnaires developed by ISAAC will be&#xD;
           applied. It aims to evaluate symptoms suggestive of asthma. The first part of the&#xD;
           questionnaire consists of 8 questions which mainly use 3 questions to estimate the&#xD;
           prevalence of asthma : 1 - &quot; Did you ever in your life you (or your child ) had wheezing&#xD;
           (wheezing )? &quot; , 2 - &quot;In the last twelve months you (or your child ) had wheezing (&#xD;
           wheezing )?&quot; 3 - &quot;Have you ( or your child ) had asthma?&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Form to characterize the subjects and clinical outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This form is composed of two parts: the first part consists of demographic and socio&#xD;
           biological data and the second parts of issues related to clinical outcomes. The&#xD;
           variables are emergency due to asthma in the past year, emergency due to asthma in past&#xD;
           30 days, emergency due to asthma past two weeks, prior oral intubation, hospitalization&#xD;
           due to asthma in the last year, ICU admissions, nocturnal awakenings in the last year,&#xD;
           nocturnal awakenings in the last 30 days, nighttime awakenings in the last two weeks,&#xD;
           daytime last year awakenings, daytime awakenings in the last 30 days, daytime awakenings&#xD;
           in the last two weeks, number of days missed at school in the last year, number of days&#xD;
           missed at school last month, number of lost subjects (if already deprecated) in the last&#xD;
           year, use of control medications, spirometric values. This form must be applied before&#xD;
           and after implementation of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Form for assessing knowledge:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess knowledge about asthma and the exacerbation due to this disease, a structured&#xD;
      questionnaire that contains 20 questions with three possible answers to all questions will be&#xD;
      used: &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; and &quot; I do not know&quot;. This questionnaire is organized so that a number of&#xD;
      questions covering a field but it is not built for the explicit subject in the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The areas are: knowledge of the pathology, triggers, treatment, management of crisis and&#xD;
      myths/truths so that the researcher can analyze the performance counting the overall score&#xD;
      and domains.The adjustments represent the knowledge level of the respondent. Up to 25 % of&#xD;
      hits - Poor knowledge; 26 - 50% correct - satisfactory knowledge; 51-75 % accuracy - Good&#xD;
      knowledge; 76-100 % correct - excellent knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge about learning about relief treatment and maintenance will be carried out through a&#xD;
      questionnaire consists of 4 situations that mimic reality. It trys to observe the therapeutic&#xD;
      knowledge of the individual in situations of imminent asthma attack , with the following&#xD;
      options answer: &quot;never&quot;, &quot;rarely&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot; , &quot;often&quot; ,&quot;always&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect data and analyzed in the period from October 2011 to December&#xD;
      2014. Tools of data collection described above and after signing the Informed Consent and the&#xD;
      Coordinator of School and after approval of the research by the Ethics Committee -&#xD;
      Universidade Federal da Bahia. This protocol was submitted and approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the Statistical Programme Statistic Program for Social Sciences&#xD;
      (SPSS) version 21.0 to process data. We will analyse data by descriptive statistics&#xD;
      (proportions and measures of central tendency), Relative risk (RR) , absolute risk (AR) ,&#xD;
      odds ratios (OR) and logistic regression analysis to identify the measures of association&#xD;
      will be used effect of systematic educational interventions independent of confounding&#xD;
      variables. In all analyzes will be considered the significance level of 5 % .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ethical aspects shall be based on Resolution 196/96 governing research involving human&#xD;
      subjects, the resolution 466/2012 and the Code of Ethics for Professional Nursing. The&#xD;
      research will respect the basic principles of bioethics: autonomy, non - maleficence,&#xD;
      beneficence, and justice, and should be appropriate to scientific principles, rely on free&#xD;
      and informed consent of the research subject and / or his legal representative, establish&#xD;
      procedures to ensure confidentiality and privacy of the people involved indirectly. The&#xD;
      Program will receive the return of the results obtained through research.&#xD;
