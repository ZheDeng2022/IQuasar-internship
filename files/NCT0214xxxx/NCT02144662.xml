      Primary Objective: To investigate the pretreatment quantitative factors as shown in SD-OCT&#xD;
      images that correlate with posttreatment VA in patients who underwent intravitreal Lucentis&#xD;
      (Ranibizumab) for RVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: Correlations between posttreatment BCVA and pretreatment factors were&#xD;
      evaluated, including age, pretreatment BCVA, photoreceptor outer segment (PROS) length,&#xD;
      central foveal thickness (CFT), outer foveal thickness (OFT), and outer nuclear layer&#xD;
      thickness (ONLT). The factors influencing posttreatment BCVA were evaluated using multiple&#xD;
      regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed information on macular morphology, such as the photoreceptor IS/OS junction and ELM,&#xD;
      can be obtained in SD-OCT. Some OCT studies evaluated other quantitative factors in eye&#xD;
      disease. It was reported that PROS length was correlated with BCVA in patients with DME.¹&#xD;
      Other investigators suggested that the thickness, area, and volume of the outer layer were&#xD;
      correlated with BCVA in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD).² Outer&#xD;
      foveal thickness (OFT) and relative reflectivity of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) were&#xD;
      associated with BCVA in patients with macular hole.3, 4 The volume of the ONL was found to be&#xD;
      associated with BCVA in patients with AMD.5 The aim of this study was to investigate the&#xD;
      pretreatment quantitative factors as shown in SD-OCT images that correlate with posttreatment&#xD;
      VA in patients who underwent intravitreal Lucentis (Ranibizumab) for RVO.&#xD;
