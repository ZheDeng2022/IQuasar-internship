    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (study of what the body&#xD;
      does to a drug), and pharmacodynamics (study of what a drug does to the body) of&#xD;
      JNJ-42756493, a pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in&#xD;
      adult participants with advanced or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, non-randomized (individuals will not be assigned by chance to study&#xD;
      treatments), open-label (individuals will know the identity of study treatments), multicenter&#xD;
      (more than 1 hospital work on a study), Phase 1 study. The study consists of 4 parts. Part 1&#xD;
      is the dose-escalation phase, which will be guided by pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and&#xD;
      safety. In part 1, safe and biologically active Phase 2 doses (recommended Phase 2 doses&#xD;
      [RP2D]) for JNJ-42756493 will be primarily assessed. Participants will be enrolled in&#xD;
      sequential cohorts (first cohort will receive the starting dose and subsequent cohorts will&#xD;
      receive increased doses of JNJ-42756493). Part 2 is the Dose Confirmation Phase, which&#xD;
      consists of a pre and post treatment tumor biopsy cohorts to confirm the RP2D based on the&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic effect of JNJ-42756493 on fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling&#xD;
      pathway in tumor. Part 3 is the first Dose Expansion Phase, which is designed to evaluate&#xD;
      inclusion biomarkers and preliminary clinical activity at the first RP2D. It consists of 4&#xD;
      expansion cohorts, 1 each for squamous cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, breast&#xD;
      cancer, other solid tumors (Cohorts A, B, C, and D). Part 4 is the second Dose Expansion&#xD;
      Phase, which is designed to evaluate inclusion biomarkers and preliminary clinical activity&#xD;
      at the second RP2D. Biomarker eligibility has also been refined based on emerging data. It&#xD;
      consists of 2 expansion cohorts, Cohort E for non-small cell lung cancer and Cohort F for&#xD;
      select solid tumors including breast, urothelial, GBM, ovarian, head &amp; neck, esophageal,&#xD;
      gastric, and cholangiocarcinoma (Cohorts E and F). Enrollment of some cohorts may be&#xD;
      discontinued due to lack of enrollment or for futility. The study is estimated to take&#xD;
      approximately 48 months to complete. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
