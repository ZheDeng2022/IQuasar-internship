    <textblock>
      In pregnant women with suspected DVT, a sure diagnosis is mandatory. In non-pregnant&#xD;
      patients, sequential diagnostic strategies based on 1) the assessment of clinical&#xD;
      probability, 2) D-dimer measurement and 3) compression ultrasonography (CUS) have been well&#xD;
      validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical probability assessment by clinical prediction rules (CPRs) is a crucial step in the&#xD;
      management of suspected DVT. However, the most commonly used CPR for DVT, the Wells' score,&#xD;
      has never been validated in pregnant women. Recently, the 'LEFt' clinical prediction rule was&#xD;
      derived and internally validated. A prospective validation of this rule is now warranted, and&#xD;
      we plan to use it in our prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second step used in the diagnostic strategy including non-pregnant patients is D-dimer&#xD;
      measurement. The test has been widely validated in non-pregnant patients and, in association&#xD;
      with a non-high clinical probability, it allows to safely rule out DVT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As D-dimer level raise steadily during pregnancy, the specificity of the test decreases and&#xD;
      it is less useful in pregnant women. Data from the literature clearly suggest that the usual&#xD;
      cut-off set a 500 ng/ml would safely rule out DVT in pregnant women [6]. As the usual cut-off&#xD;
      has never been prospectively validated in pregnant women with suspected DVT, we would like to&#xD;
      use it in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies suggested that complete CUS is safe to rule out DVT in pregnant women. However,&#xD;
      this test is not always available. Therefore, a strategy in which the association of clinical&#xD;
      probability assessment and D-dimer measurement would allow to safely rule out DVT in a&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients without performing a complete CUS, would be of great help&#xD;
      in everyday clinical practice and would probably be cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we plan a prospective study to assess the safety of a sequential diagnostic&#xD;
      strategy based on the assessment of clinical probability with the LEFt rule, D-dimer&#xD;
      measurement and complete CUS in pregnant women with suspected DVT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In pregnant women with suspected DVT, a sure diagnosis is mandatory. Indeed, false positive&#xD;
      tests lead to inappropriate anticoagulant treatment, which increases the risk of bleeding.&#xD;
      Conversely, false negative tests might lead to a life-threatening thromboembolic event. Thus,&#xD;
      accuracy of diagnostic methods used in pregnant women is crucial [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In non-pregnant patients, sequential diagnostic strategies based on 1) the assessment of&#xD;
      clinical probability, 2) D-dimer measurement and 3) compression ultrasonography (CUS) have&#xD;
      been widely validated [2, 3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical probability assessment by clinical prediction rules (CPRs) is a crucial step in the&#xD;
      management of suspected DVT. However, the most commonly used CPR for DVT, the Wells' score,&#xD;
      has never been validated in pregnant women [3]. Recently, the 'LEFt' clinical prediction rule&#xD;
      was derived and internally validated by Chan et al. among 194 pregnant women investigated for&#xD;
      suspected DVT[4]. This rule combines three variables: symptoms in the left leg (&quot;L&quot;), calf&#xD;
      circumference difference equal or greater than 2 centimeters (&quot;E&quot; for edema) and first&#xD;
      trimester presentation (&quot;Ft&quot;) [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      We performed an external validation of this rule on a recently published prospective cohort&#xD;
      of pregnant patients with suspected DVT (submitted to JTH). This external validation showed&#xD;
      that a negative &quot;LEFt&quot; rule accurately identified pregnant women in whom the proportion of&#xD;
      confirmed DVT appears to be very low. A prospective validation of this rule is now warranted,&#xD;
      and we plan to use it in our prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second step used in the diagnostic strategy including non-pregnant patients is D-dimer&#xD;
      measurement. The test has been widely validated in non-pregnant patients and, in association&#xD;
      with a non-high clinical probability, it allows to safely rule out DVT [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      As D-dimer level raise steadily during pregnancy, the specificity of the test decreases and&#xD;
      it is less useful in pregnant women. A recent study suggested that the currently available&#xD;
      sensitive D-dimer assays that are used for the exclusion in symptomatic non-pregnant women&#xD;
      have the potential to exclude DVT in symptomatic pregnant women with the application of&#xD;
      higher cut-points [6]. Even if this data arises from a small study, it clearly suggests that&#xD;
      the usual cut-off set a 500 ng/ml would safely rule out DVT in pregnant women [6]. As the&#xD;
      usual cut-off has never been prospectively validated in pregnant women with suspected DVT, we&#xD;
      would like, as a first step, to use it in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pregnant patients, limited data is available on the use of complete compression&#xD;
      ultrasonography to rule out DVT. In a recent prospective management study, we included 226&#xD;
      pregnant and post-partum women with suspected lower limb DVT. We observed a 1.1% (95%&#xD;
      CI:0.3-4.0) three-month thromboembolic event rate in those left untreated on the basis of a&#xD;
      negative single complete CUS [7]. This result is in line with what was reported after a&#xD;
      normal phlebography, the gold standard test [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if complete CUS is safe to rule out DVT in pregnant women, current diagnostic strategies&#xD;
      for suspected DVT in non-pregnant patients rely on the use of clinical probability and&#xD;
      D-Dimer prior to leg veins imaging [5]. However, no management outcome study on the safety&#xD;
      and usefulness of D-Dimer to rule out DVT in pregnant women is available to date. Another&#xD;
      limitation of the strategies based on a single unique complete CUS, is that every woman has&#xD;
      to undergo complete CUS. However, this test is not always available. Therefore, a strategy in&#xD;
      which the association of clinical probability assessment and D-dimer measurement would allow&#xD;
      to safely rule out DVT in a significant proportion of patients without performing a complete&#xD;
      CUS, would be of great help in everyday clinical practice and would probably be&#xD;
      cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we plan a prospective study to assess the safety of a sequential diagnostic&#xD;
      strategy based on the assessment of clinical probability with the LEFt rule, D-dimer&#xD;
      measurement and complete CUS in pregnant women with suspected DVT.&#xD;
