  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FMF is the most common periodic fever with a worldwide patient population estimated as&#xD;
      150,000, mainly located in the Eastern Mediterranean basin. colchicine is the established&#xD;
      therapy of choice ,however, around 20.000 patients worldwide fail to respond or cannot&#xD;
      tolerate therapeutic doses, thereby suffering from recurrent debilitating, severe, painful&#xD;
      attacks of peritonitis, pleuritis and synovitis and are at risk to die from reactive&#xD;
      amyloidosis .Mutation-induced reduction in pyrin/ marenostrin activity is thought to underlie&#xD;
      the disease by leading to NALP3 inflammasome activation ,and thereby to IL-1β related burst&#xD;
      of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IL-1 receptor antagonist Kineret (Anakinra), seems to be the most appropriate response to&#xD;
      the uncontrolled IL-1β elevation. Indeed, an increasing number of reports over the last few&#xD;
      years indicate a good response to Kineret (Anakinra), in colchicine-resistant FMF ,also in&#xD;
      children ,however, no controlled study has thoroughly evaluated the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to run at the FMF centre in Sheba Medical Center, covering more than 10,000&#xD;
      patients. The study will evaluate the effect of recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, Kineret&#xD;
      (Anakinra), on the frequency of FMF attacks in patients that, despite maximum tolerable dose&#xD;
      of colchicine, present with more than one attack per month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. 50 patients&#xD;
      will be randomised to treatment with either Kineret (Anakinra), or placebo treatment for 4&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
