  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is some evidence that dietary supplementation with fish oil has health benefits,&#xD;
      especially in respect of some of the known risk factors for cardiovascular (heart) disease&#xD;
      such as cardiac arrhythmia. However, supplies of fish oil are limited, and it is desirable to&#xD;
      validate alternative sustainable sources of the important omega-3 fatty acid components. It&#xD;
      has been suggested that oil from krill, which are small marine crustaceans, may be as&#xD;
      effective or possibly more beneficial than fish oil, and may provide a more effective and&#xD;
      beneficial supplement. Dietary management of cardiovascular health parameters (such as blood&#xD;
      lipids)is becoming more and more important as the rising trends in obesity nationally and&#xD;
      worldwide are leading to escalating incidence of diabetes and heart disease. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to use some specific novel lipid measurements of cardiovascular risk to&#xD;
      test this possibility in a group of men who, although generally healthy, show some risk&#xD;
      factors in terms of their weight and metabolic profile.This pilot study will provide&#xD;
      preliminary data to show whether krill oil has similar or different effects from fish oil on&#xD;
      the cardiovascular health of overweight but otherwise healthy men, and in particular will&#xD;
      provide detailed information on alterations in novel lipid markers of cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      which may be a better diagnostic tool than classical lipid measurements (e.g. serum&#xD;
      cholesterol). The investigators have been developing and validating new techniques to measure&#xD;
      emerging lipid markers of cardiovascular risk accurately and will continue to develop and&#xD;
      investigate these techniques during the course of this project. The investigators hypothesise&#xD;
      that krill oil will be more efficacious in reducing markers of risk relating to&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
