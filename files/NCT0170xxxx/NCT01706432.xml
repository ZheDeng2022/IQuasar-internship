      This pilot clinical trial studies hypofractionated image guided radiation therapy in treating&#xD;
      patients with stage IV breast cancer. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor&#xD;
      cells. Giving radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the feasibility of correlating changes in the number of circulating tumor&#xD;
      cells in metastatic breast cancer patients with time to progression following&#xD;
      hypofractionated image guided radiotherapy to all known sites (=&lt; 5) of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the progression free survival, overall survival, pattern of failure, and&#xD;
      toxicity of hypofractionated image guided radiotherapy to all active sites (=&lt; 5) of&#xD;
      metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the feasibility of the Interferon-Related DNA Damage Resistance Gene Signature&#xD;
      (IRDS) for its predictive value in treatment failure, both in and out of the radiation field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with metastases in the lung, liver, abdomen, and extremities undergo 10 fractions or&#xD;
      less of hypofractionated radiation therapy and patients with brain metastases undergo a&#xD;
      single fraction of stereotactic radiosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 weeks for 2 months, at&#xD;
      3 months, every 3 months for a year, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

             to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior metastatic treatment are eligible if they have been disease free&#xD;
             for &gt; 3 years; participants may receive hormonal and Herceptin treatment at any time&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             disease free for a minimum of 3 years (for example, carcinoma in situ of the breast,&#xD;
             oral cavity, or cervix are all permissible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant pulmonary dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, any history of&#xD;
             clinically significant congestive heart failure (CHF), unstable angina pectoris, or&#xD;

             however, that laboratory tests for liver function and coagulation parameters are not&#xD;
             required for entry into this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Centers for Disease&#xD;
             Control (CDC) definition; note, however, that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
             testing is not required for entry into this protocol; the need to exclude patients&#xD;
             with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this&#xD;
             protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive; protocol-specific requirements may&#xD;

             treatment and for at least three months following completion; this exclusion is&#xD;
             necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly&#xD;
             teratogenic&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with anti-angiogenic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant atelectasis such that CT definition of the gross tumor volume (GTV) is&#xD;
             difficult to determine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exudative, bloody or cytologically malignant effusions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion prior to study start; patients with&#xD;
             pleural effusion that is transudative, cytologically negative, and non-bloody are&#xD;
             eligible; if a pleural effusion is too small for diagnostic thoracentesis, the patient&#xD;
             will be eligible&#xD;
