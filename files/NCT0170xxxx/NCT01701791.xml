  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In Italy, several recent studies found that a large percentage of patients&#xD;
      attending Primary Care (PC) clinics meet criteria for at least one common mental disorder, as&#xD;
      they show high rates of depression, anxiety, and co-morbid anxiety and depression. These&#xD;
      patients may experience significant functional impairment and suffer from unexplained somatic&#xD;
      symptoms, and often remain undetected and untreated. Consistent evidence for the&#xD;
      effectiveness of organized care programs for depression, by improving quality of care and&#xD;
      treatment adherence, is now available. Fundamental elements of these programs include&#xD;
      algorithms to prompt the proper and timely implementation of evidence-based treatments,&#xD;
      structured outcome assessment and systematic outreach. Telemedicine tools may represent a&#xD;
      valuable strategy for improving depression outcomes in PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: 1.To develop and employ computer-based assessment to more accurately and timely detect&#xD;
      patient depression in PC settings; 2.To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a care&#xD;
      support program developed in conjunction with the PC-based assessment for patients suffering&#xD;
      from depression, as based on two main objectives: 2a.To support GP decisions with treatment&#xD;
      algorithms and improve the quality of GP and mental health service collaboration; 2b.To&#xD;
      improve patient compliance and treatment adherence by using appropriate telecommunication&#xD;
      tools and technologically advanced tools to conduct systematic routine assessment. Although&#xD;
      much of this system will be computer-based, live telephonic and in-person contacts will also&#xD;
      be included as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The study is a randomized controlled trial, involving four PC group clinics&#xD;
      (GCs) located in two areas of Northern Italy. Two PC clinics will use the experimental&#xD;
      protocol; the other two will serve as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare two different conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (experimental): GPs will use a Computer Decision Support System with treatment&#xD;
           algorithms and advice and supervision from a consultant psychiatrist. Patients will&#xD;
           receive reminders via mobile texting or automatic mobile (or landline) phone calls to&#xD;
           improve adherence to the treatment prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (control): GPs will provide TAU, will make their own decisions and will&#xD;
           therefore not use the CDSS. Patients will not receive any reminders. All enrolled&#xD;
           patients will be administered and will fill in the IDS-SR at baseline, 3 and 6-months:&#xD;
           the IDS-SR score will be used as a primary endpoint.&#xD;
