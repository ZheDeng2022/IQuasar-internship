  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 100 million patients in the United States suffer from chronic pain. Chronic pain&#xD;
      conditions are often debilitating, taking a toll on a patient's physical and mental welfare.&#xD;
      Though a variety of pain management techniques currently exist, the most common nonsurgical&#xD;
      options provide slow-acting and/or short-term relief. Medication, often in the form of&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids, comes with an array of side&#xD;
      effects such as nausea and vomiting. Medication also presents the possibility of more serious&#xD;
      effects such as increased risk of heart attack and stroke, and tolerance or dependency&#xD;
      issues. Surgical strategies tend to be reserved for more severe cases and are limited by the&#xD;
      risks and complications typically associated with surgery including bleeding, bruising,&#xD;
      scarring, and infection. A nonsurgical, minimally invasive, long-lasting approach to chronic&#xD;
      pain management is desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cryo-Touch III is a pain management device developed for a novel, minimally invasive&#xD;
      procedure using focused cold therapy to target sensory nerve tissue and offer long-lasting&#xD;
      pain relief through cryoanalgesia. The device operates on the well-established cryobiology&#xD;
      principle that localized exposure to controlled moderately low temperature conditions can&#xD;
      alter tissue function. The therapy treats nerves with low temperatures via a cold probe in&#xD;
      the form of an assembly of small diameter needles, creating a highly localized treatment zone&#xD;
      around the probe. This focused cold therapy creates a conduction block that prevents nerve&#xD;
      signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though studies have proven efficacious in targeting motor nerves, the device's effect on&#xD;
      sensory nerves has yet to have been investigated in the clinical setting. The goal of the&#xD;
      study described herein is to evaluate the degree and duration of effect of the Cryo-Touch III&#xD;
      in reducing chronic pain by targeting sensory nerves.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, 18 years of age and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must meet American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for&#xD;
             osteoarthritis of the knee (unilateral or bilateral). Clinical criteria includes knee&#xD;
             pain and at least three of the following 6 criteria: 50 years of age or older,&#xD;
             stiffness lasting less than 30 minutes, crepitus, bony tenderness, bony enlargement,&#xD;
             and/or no warmth to the touch.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medications (prescription and/or over-the counter) must be maintained on a stable&#xD;
             schedule for ≥ 2 weeks prior to treatment. No washout period is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An average Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain ≥ 4 over the last 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is willing and able to give written informed consent.&#xD;

             would adversely affect treatment or outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any chronic medical condition that in the investigator's opinion would prevent&#xD;
             adequate participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any chronic medication use (prescription, over-the-counter, etc.) that in the&#xD;
             investigator's opinion would affect study participation or subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For any reason, in the opinion of the investigator, the subject may not be a suitable&#xD;
             candidate for study participation (i.e., history of noncompliance, drug dependency,&#xD;
             any related knee injury due to a worker's compensation claim, etc.).&#xD;
