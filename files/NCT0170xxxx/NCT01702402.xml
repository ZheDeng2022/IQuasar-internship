    <textblock>
      The proposed operations research study is designed to evaluate a package of family planning&#xD;
      services and related behavior change interventions aimed at addressing the unmet need for&#xD;
      family planning in postpartum women, integrated with an ongoing maternal and newborn health&#xD;
      program, and to assess the program's impact (1) on knowledge of healthy fertility practices,&#xD;
      (2) on contraceptive use prevalence in women during the postpartum period, (3) on postpartum&#xD;
      birth spacing, and (4) to examine the feasibility and sustainability of the proposed&#xD;
      integrated service delivery approach. The study will have a quasi-experimental design, with&#xD;
      evaluation primarily through household surveys in four intervention unions and four&#xD;
      comparison unions (unions are lowest local government entities with an average population of&#xD;
      about 20,000) in rural Sylhet District, Bangladesh.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The specific objectives of this operations research are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Integrated Family Planning/Maternal Neonatal Health Intervention: To develop and test an&#xD;
           integrated Family Planning and Maternal and Neonatal Health (FP/MNH) service delivery&#xD;
           approach in the Bangladesh setting, building on the ongoing Projahnmo study.&#xD;
           Intervention activities will include behaviour change communications on healthy timing&#xD;
           and spacing of pregnancy, couples counseling, social networking and expansion of&#xD;
           contraceptive options for postpartum women, including provision of oral contraceptive&#xD;
           pills and condoms in the home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Integrated Service Delivery Approach: To assess the strengths and limitations of&#xD;
           integrating family planning into an ongoing community-based maternal and newborn care&#xD;
           program.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To compare the quality of counseling provided by CHWs in the integrated (MNH+FP)&#xD;
                intervention arm versus regular (MNH) control arm in Sylhet district, Bangladesh&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To assess the knowledge of CHWs providing integrated (MNH+FP) counseling in the&#xD;
                intervention arm versus CHWs providing regular MNH counseling in the control arm in&#xD;
                Sylhet district, Bangladesh&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To determine factors that affect the quality of care provided by CHWs in both the&#xD;
                intervention and control arms in Sylhet district, Bangladesh&#xD;
