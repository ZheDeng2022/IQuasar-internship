             symptoms of hyperglycemia with casual plasma glucose &gt; 200 mg/dl or two-hour plasma&#xD;
             glucose ≥200 mg/dl after a 75 gram oral glucose load. Individuals who have a clinical&#xD;
             history strongly suggestive of type 1 diabetes will be excluded. Individuals taking&#xD;
             oral hypoglycemic medication with diet and exercise are eligible. Subjects taking&#xD;
