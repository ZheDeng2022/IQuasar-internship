  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled. All subjects will receive one Ultherapy treatment to the&#xD;
      lower two thirds of the face and neck. Subjects will be equally grouped into those with a&#xD;
      history of submentoplasty and or rhytidectomy and those naive to submentoplasty and or&#xD;
      rhytidectomy. Follow-up visits will occur at 14, 30, 60, 90 and 180 days following treatment.&#xD;
      Study images will be obtained pre-treatment, 30-60 minutes post-treatment, and at each&#xD;
      follow-up visit.&#xD;

      This is a prospective single center study. Subjects will be enrolled one per group as they&#xD;
      present. Efficacy will be determined by the change in submental volume and cervicomental&#xD;
      angle. GAIS and patient satisfaction questionnaires will also be obtained.&#xD;
