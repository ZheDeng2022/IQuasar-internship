  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At least 30% of patients initially treated with sulphonylureas for NIDOM will have a poor&#xD;
      response, and in the remaining 70% the subsequent failure rate is approximately 4% to 5% per&#xD;
      year. BRL 49653C has a different mechanism of action to the sulphonylureas, and therefore the&#xD;
      effects on fasting plasma glucose and Hb A1c are expected to be additive. Since circulatory&#xD;
      insulin levels should decrease, and plasma glucose should be regulated, these combinations&#xD;
      are also anticipated to slow both the progression of diabetic complications and delay the&#xD;
      need for exogenous insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is intended primarily to determine the effectiveness of BRL 49653C by&#xD;
      measure of glucose homeostasis as determined by Hb A1c and fasting plasma glucose, when added&#xD;
      to sulphonylurea therapy (sulphonylureas are limited to: glibenclamide, glipazide and&#xD;
      gliclazide). In addition, the clinical safety of BRL 49653C will be assessed in this patient&#xD;
      population. The starting doses have been selected based on dose response studies examining&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and efficacy in the U.S.A.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is the most common form of the hyperglycaemic&#xD;
      state. Although NIDDM exists in all populations, its prevalence varies greatly, depending&#xD;
      upon age and race, and appears to be increasing. It is estimated that NIDOM occurs in 5% of&#xD;
      50-year-old-adults and 20% of the 80-year-old population with a linear progression between&#xD;
      these age groups. Aberrant insulin secretion from pancreatic p-cells, and insulin resistance&#xD;
      in peripheral tissues with reduced glucose uptake (particularly in muscle and liver) are the&#xD;
      primary pathogenic mechanisms believed to be responsible for the metabolic abnormalities&#xD;
      associated with NIDDM. Insulin resistance progresses to overt diabetes at the rate of&#xD;
      approximately 5% of patients per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with insulin resistance, but no overt diabetes mellitus, are generally overweight,&#xD;
      usually have a sedentary lifestyle, and frequently have a family history of diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. Insulin-resistant phenotype is commonly associated with cardiovascular risk factors&#xD;
      such as hypertension and dyslipidemia (decreased HDL and increased VLDL, LDL and&#xD;
      triglycerides). Current available therapies for NIDOM include insulin and oral hypoglycemic&#xD;
      agents (e.g. sulphonylurea compounds and biguanides). Sulphonylureas achieve blood glucose&#xD;
      control by enhancing pancreatic insulin secretion. However, a significant failure rate does&#xD;
      exist for this mode of treatment, and many patients who have received long term treatment&#xD;
      with sulphonylureas do require exogenous insulin therapy when there is no longer adequate&#xD;
      pancreatic insulin secretion (even in response to sulphonylureas). Single therapy with the&#xD;
      biguanide, metformin, or combination therapy with an additional sulphonylurea may also be&#xD;
      administered to NIDDM patients. However, the overall effect of metformin on glycemic control&#xD;
      seems to be smaller than that of sulphonylureas, and in many cases, combination therapy does&#xD;
      not stop the need for insulin after a period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BRL 49653C is a highly potent and orally active anti-diabetic thiazolidinedione compound. The&#xD;
      thiazolidinediones such as BRL 49653C represent a novel class of compounds that act as&#xD;
      &quot;insulin sensitizers&quot; in target tissues. Unlike sulphonylureas, BRL 49653C improves the&#xD;
      sensitivity of muscle and liver to insulin. An agent that enhances insulin sensitivity may be&#xD;
      effective in regulating elevated blood glucose in patients with NIDDM and theoretically may&#xD;
      be beneficial in reducing the frequency and severity of morbid complications of this disease.&#xD;
      BRL 49653C does not increase pancreatic insulin secretion; therefore, treatment with BRL&#xD;
      49653C should not have the potential to exhaust pancreatic function, or produce the untoward&#xD;
      effect of hypoglycemia (a potential complication of treatment with sulphonylureas).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal testing, repeat oral administration of BRL 49653C has been effective in reducing&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and free fatty acids associated with&#xD;
      insulin-resistant models of NIDDM2. In the genetically obese mouse, the potency of BRL49653C&#xD;
      as an anti-hyperglycemic agent, was compared with competitor insulin sensitizers, and BRL&#xD;
      49653C was proven to be at least 100 times more potent than CS-045 (troglitazone) and at&#xD;
      least 30 times more potent than pioglitazone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six month toxicological findings were similar to those observed in one month studies. Please&#xD;
      refer to the Investigator Brochure for more detailed information about pre-clinical studies&#xD;
      and the pharmacology, metabolism, and toxicology of BRL 49653C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, seven completed Phase I studies have shown BRL 49653C to be safe and well tolerated.&#xD;
      The levels of exposure to BRL 49653C have been shown to be similar in both the fed and fasted&#xD;
      state, and pharmacokinetic analysis has shown no evidence of accumulation after 10 days once&#xD;
      daily dosing of 1 to 5 mg in obese volunteers. A total of 140 volunteers received BRL 49653C&#xD;
      ranging in doses of 0.2 to 20 mg (20 mg dose is approximately 4 to 5-fold higher than doses&#xD;
      expected to be administered to NIDDM patients). Of these, 140 subjects, 91 received one or&#xD;
      more single doses of BRL 49653C up to 20 mg. This includes 10 healthy elderly males (&gt;= 65&#xD;
      years of age). Additionally, 49 obese subjects have received dosages of up to 5 mg/day for 10&#xD;
      consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SmithKline Beecham Phase I clinical studies have shown BRL 49653C to be safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated. The most frequently observed adverse experience was headache. Serious adverse&#xD;
      experiences of transient asymptomatic accelerated unifocal ventricular rhythm of less than 10&#xD;
      seconds duration were observed in two volunteers. The arrhythmias were noted at 27 minutes&#xD;
      and 2 hours and 20 minutes after administration of a single dose of BRL 49653C 2mg. Hotter&#xD;
      monitoring was performed in two studies in order to evaluate the arrythmogenicity of BRL&#xD;
      49653C. Study 002, was a placebo controlled, 10 day repeat dose, two-period, period balanced,&#xD;
      cross-over study, within each of three dose groups (1, 2 or 5 mg) of BRL 49653C. Study 016&#xD;
      was a single dose, double-blind, randomized (with respect to order of placebo), placebo&#xD;
      controlled, five period cross-over, oral dose rising study in which each subject received a&#xD;
      randomly allocated placebo and four doses of BRL 49653C (5, 10, 15, 20 mg). In both of these&#xD;
      studies, there was no evidence of protocol- defined incidence of ventricular tachycardia,&#xD;
      ventricular premature beats, or supraventricular tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study with another thiazolidinedione compound, troglitazone, has shown that there is&#xD;
      no increase in cardiac mass or cardiac function impairment in patients with NIDDM . To the&#xD;
      contrary, these patients were observed to have decreases in systemic vascular resistance,&#xD;
      with enhanced cardiac output and stroke volume. Other studies examining thiazolidinediones&#xD;
      have shown beneficial effects on Hemoglobin A1c with statistically significant decreases&#xD;
      indicating beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis over periods of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BRL 49653C has also been examined in combination with glyburide (glibenclamide). BRL 49653C&#xD;
      was administered 2mg bd to NIDDM patients receiving stable doses of glyburide for seven days.&#xD;
      No changes were observed in either the 24 hour glucose or insulin profiles, suggesting that&#xD;
      the combined treatment is not associated with any acute pharmacokinetic interaction that&#xD;
      would likely result in an acute untoward pharmacodynamics effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety, tolerability and efficacy of BRL 49653C in patients with NIDDM has been examined&#xD;
      in a phase II, double-blind, placebo controlled dose response study. A total of 380 patients&#xD;
      received either placebo, 005mg bid, 0.25mg bid, 1mg bid or 2mg bid for 12 weeks. Analysis of&#xD;
      variance showed highly significant (p&lt;0.001) treatment effects on fasting blood glucose from&#xD;
      week 2 onwards, although it was clear that a plateau in response had not been achieved at the&#xD;
      highest dose tested. At the higher dose of 2mg bid, there were statistically significant&#xD;
      differences compared to placebo, at week 12 for fasting plasma glucose (-40.1 mg/dL),&#xD;
      fructosamine (-27.1 mmol/L) and insulin (-16%), and a significant reduction in hemoglobin Alc&#xD;
      (0.4%). The lowering of fasting glucose in the 2mg bid group with a concomitant 16% decrease&#xD;
      in insulin levels supports the hypothesis of insulin sensitization as a mechanism of action&#xD;
      for BRL 49653.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug was found to be safe with no adverse effects on vital signs, ECG or clinical&#xD;
      chemistry. 2D M-Mode echocardiography revealed no on left ventricular mass effects, and the&#xD;
      small reductions in hemoglobin 14.5 to 14.3 g/100ml in the highest dose group) and hematocrit&#xD;
      (from 42.6% to 41.8%) are not regarded as being clinically significant. Furthermore, BRL&#xD;
      49653C was found to be well tolerated over the dose range 0.05-2.0mg bid with an adverse&#xD;
      event profile that was similar to placebo both qualitatively and quantitatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study a total of 18 serious adverse events (sAE) were reported, 9 during the&#xD;
      screening/run-in phase and 9 during the 12 week randomization period. There were 3 sAE in&#xD;
      each of the placebo and 2.0mg BRL 49653 groups and I in each of the 0.05, 0.25 and 1.0mg&#xD;
      groups. There were 2 deaths during the study, one case of myocardial infarction (2.0mg group)&#xD;
      in a 52 year old male was designated as possibly related, and the other case (0.25mg group),&#xD;
      a 71 year old male with cardiopulmonary arrest, was unrelated. All other sAE were specified&#xD;
      by the investigators as being unrelated to trial medication, apart from 1 case of exercise&#xD;
      induced non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in a 56 year old male receiving placebo. Causal&#xD;
      relationship was given as possibly related in this case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 30% of patients initially treated with sulphonylureas for NIDDM will have a poor&#xD;
      response, and in the remaining 70% the subsequent failure rate is approximately 4% to 5% per&#xD;
      year. BRL 49653C has a different mechanism of action to the sulphonylureas, and therefore the&#xD;
      effects on fasting plasma glucose and Hb A1c are expected to be additive. Since circulatory&#xD;
      insulin levels should decrease, and plasma glucose should be regulated, these combinations&#xD;
      are also anticipated to slow both the progression of diabetic complications and delay the&#xD;
      need for exogenous insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is intended primarily to determine the effectiveness of BRL 49653C by&#xD;
      measure of glucose homeostasis as determined by Hb A1c and fasting plasma glucose, when added&#xD;
      to sulphonylurea therapy (sulphonylureas are limited to: glibenclamide. glipazide and&#xD;
      gliclazide). In addition, the clinical safety of BRL 49653C will be assessed in this patient&#xD;
      population. The starting doses have been selected based on dose response studies examining&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and efficacy in the USA.&#xD;
