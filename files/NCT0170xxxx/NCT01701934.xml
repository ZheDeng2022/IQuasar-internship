    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether roflumilast can improve metabolic profile&#xD;
      and reduce visceral adiposity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although underweight has been the traditional nutritional concern in patients with COPD,&#xD;
      overweight and obesity are becoming important issues in this disease. In a rehabilitation&#xD;
      study, investigators found that 66% of patients with moderate to severe COPD were either&#xD;
      overweight or obese according to the WHO obesity classification (BMI â‰¥ 25 kg/m2). Obesity and&#xD;
      COPD being two frequent conditions, it is important to understand the nature of their&#xD;
      interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity, particularly in its visceral form is associated with a plethora of metabolic&#xD;
      consequences that increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. This would seem relevant to&#xD;
      COPD which is in itself an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The presence of&#xD;
      obesity, particularly visceral obesity, may thus define in patients with COPD a clinical&#xD;
      phenotype at high risk of cardiovascular diseases. In this context, it is relevant to note&#xD;
      that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is increased in COPD. Although fat distribution has&#xD;
      not been precisely assessed in COPD studies, increased waist circumference is common in this&#xD;
      disease suggesting that visceral obesity is part of the obesity syndrome seen in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the relationship between COPD, obesity and the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases, it is tempting to suggest that visceral obesity is likely to be frequent in COPD&#xD;
      (as in the general population) and that the profound metabolic and inflammatory perturbations&#xD;
      associated with this form of overweight/obesity could play a central role in the link between&#xD;
      COPD and cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Roflumilast, a Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, has been recently evaluated as an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medication in patients with COPD. Roflumilast, alone or in combination with&#xD;
      long-acting bronchodilators, provide modest but significant improvement in lung function&#xD;
      along with reductions in the rate of exacerbation in patients with moderate to severe COPD. A&#xD;
      very interesting observation that was made in these 12-month duration studies was that the&#xD;
      use of roflumilast was associated with an average reduction in body weight of 2 kg that took&#xD;
      place during the first 6 months of the trials and remained relatively stable throughout the&#xD;
      rest of the trials. The mechanisms and the precise effects of roflumilast on body composition&#xD;
      and adipose tissue distribution have not been studied in great detail. However, available&#xD;
      data suggest that roflumilast induces a preferential loss in body fat mass in comparison to&#xD;
      fat-free mass. It remains to be seen whether roflumilast specifically affects visceral versus&#xD;
      subcutaneous adipose tissue. The improved insulin sensitivity reported in one study in the&#xD;
      presence of an apparently trivial weight loss (0.7 kg compared to placebo) may suggest that a&#xD;
      selective loss of visceral adipose tissue may have been produced in response to roflumilast&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These observations, although not definitive, suggest that roflumilast could be used not only&#xD;
      to treat the respiratory component of COPD but also to modulate the metabolic aspect of this&#xD;
      disease including visceral adiposity, features of the metabolic syndrome and significant&#xD;
      co-morbidities of COPD.&#xD;
