  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Efavirenz is an essential component of HIV treatment in children aged 3 years or older on&#xD;
      anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) treatment. However, the appropriate efavirenz dose during anti-TB&#xD;
      treatment remains unclear. Rifampin (an anti-TB drug) increases the activity of the drug&#xD;
      metabolizing enzymes that breakdown efavirenz, which may lead to low blood levels of&#xD;
      efavirenz and treatment failure during cotreatment. The drug-to-drug interactions between the&#xD;
      HIV and anti-TB drugs also vary between individuals based on genetic factors. This study will&#xD;
      investigate the effects of anti-TB treatment, as well as drug-gene interactions on the blood&#xD;
      concentrations of efavirenz in children with HIV and TB infections. Such data could enhance&#xD;
      optimization of efavirenz dosage or selection of alternate regimens in some children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the preferred regimen in children older than&#xD;
      3 years on rifampin-containing anti-TB therapy. Efavirenz trough plasma concentrations below&#xD;
      1000 ng/mL have been associated with increased risk of virologic failure among HIV-infected&#xD;
      adults, while concentrations above 4000 ng/mL have been associated with risk of central&#xD;
      nervous system side effects. Efavirenz is primarily metabolized by hepatic CYP2B6, with&#xD;
      secondary contributions from CYP2A6. On average, rifampin co-administration causes a 26%&#xD;
      reduction in efavirenz plasma exposure but some individuals have paradoxically elevated&#xD;
      efavirenz concentrations with co-administration in adult pharmacokinetic studies. The&#xD;
      inter-individual variability in the drug-to-drug interactions suggest that efavirenz dose&#xD;
      adjustment with concomitant anti-TB therapy may not be necessary in some patients. In&#xD;
      children, there is very limited data on the pharmacokinetic interactions between&#xD;
      rifampin-containing TB treatment and efavirenz. To our knowledge, there is only one published&#xD;
      study in children to date. Among 15 TB/HIV co-infected children treated with standard&#xD;
      efavirenz-based active antiretroviral therapy and rifampin-containing TB treatment, a wide&#xD;
      inter-patient variability in efavirenz concentration as well as a bimodal distribution of&#xD;
      efavirenz trough concentrations were observed. Overall, rifampin-containing anti-TB treatment&#xD;
      had no significant influence on the mean change in efavirenz concentration in the study&#xD;
      population as a whole, but 60% and 53% of children had efavirenz trough concentration &lt; 1000&#xD;
      ng/mL during and after anti-TB, respectively. This data suggest that current dosing of&#xD;
      efavirenz may be suboptimal in a large proportion of children irrespective of anti-TB&#xD;
      therapy. To overcome the risk of under-dosing of efavirenz especially with concurrent anti-TB&#xD;
      treatment, the WHO recommended prescribing the maximum dose for each weight-band when&#xD;
      efavirenz is coadministered with anti-TB treatment. This study seeks to evaluate whether the&#xD;
      current dosing of efavirenz provides adequate efavirenz concentrations in children, as well&#xD;
      as explore how genetic factors influence efavirenz pharmacokinetics with concomitant anti-TB&#xD;
      treatment. The specific hypotheses to be tested are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At the population level, efavirenz plasma concentrations in TB/HIV co-infected children&#xD;
           who are treated with the maximized weight-based efavirenz dosage during&#xD;
           rifampin-containing anti-TB therapy will be comparable to concentrations in HIV-infected&#xD;
           children receiving ART without anti-TB treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Co-treatment with rifampin- and efavirenz-containing therapies will lead to&#xD;
           substantially decreased (by at least 40%) efavirenz concentration in the children with&#xD;
           CYP2B6 extensive but not in those with intermediate or slow metabolizer genotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-arm, as well as a two-period pharmacokinetic study in HIV-infected children with and&#xD;
      without TB will be performed at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), Kumasi, Ghana.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will include children aged 3 - 14 years with HIV with or without TB&#xD;
      coinfection, ART-na√Øve and eligible to initiate ART. The ART regimen will consist of the WHO&#xD;
      recommended weight-band dosing of efavirenz (10-13.9kg - 200 mg; 14-24.9kg - 300mg; 25-39.9kg&#xD;
      - 400 mg and &gt; 40Kg - 600 mg), plus ZDV 180 - 240 mg/m2 and 3TC 4 mg/kg twice daily.&#xD;
      Tenofovir may be used in place of ZDV. Standard anti-TB therapy will be prescribed to the&#xD;
      co-infected patients and will start immediately upon TB diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete medical history, physical examination, and staging of HIV disease will be&#xD;
      performed before initiation of ART. Baseline measurements prior to initiation of ART will&#xD;
      include CBC, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, LFTs, CD4 cell count determination and plasma&#xD;
      HIV-1 RNA level. Weeks 12 and 24 CD4 cell count and plasma HIV-1 RNA will obtained at&#xD;
      scheduled follow-up. Pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed at week 4 of ART in both arms&#xD;
      and at 4 weeks after anti-TB treatment in the co-infected group. At each sampling time, 3 mL&#xD;
      of blood will be collected into an EDTA tube. Blood samples will be collected at times 0 2,&#xD;
      8, 12 and 24 hours post-dose for determination of efavirenz concentrations. Efavirenz&#xD;
      concentrations in plasma will be measured using a HPLC-MS. After sample analysis, a data set&#xD;
      will be constructed. Anticipated covariates included in this data set to be explored will&#xD;
      include age, sex, weight, relevant drug-metabolizing enzyme genotype, TB therapy status&#xD;
      (on/off), and CD4 cell count. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (using NONMEM, version VI)&#xD;
      will be used to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters (CL/F, V/F, AUC, Cmin, Cmax, elimination&#xD;
      rate constant), inter-individual error, and residual error. Results of this population&#xD;
      analysis may be used to simulate alternative efavirenz dosing strategies in this TB/HIV&#xD;
      co-infected population, or in relevant sub-populations with variant PK/pharmacogenetics.&#xD;
