      Critical ischaemia is pain at rest as the result of poor blood flow and lack of oxygen being&#xD;
      delivered to the tissues. It normally affects the hands and feet and can be very&#xD;
      debilitating. It is particularly common and difficult to treat in patients with end stage&#xD;
      renal failure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with renal failure are often high risk of any operative intervention which might&#xD;
      help the pain. Often the only treatment options are painkillers. Unfortunately however, the&#xD;
      commonly used painkillers, for example morphine, are known to cause worse side effects in&#xD;
      patients with renal failure (drowsiness, confusion etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qutenza (topical capsaicin 8%) is a new treatment made from chilli peppers which is applied&#xD;
      to the skin as a patch and works directly at the nerve endings in the skin to prevent pain.&#xD;
      It therefore should not have the systemic side effects of other drugs. It has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be beneficial in other painful conditions for example post-shingles pain and&#xD;
      nerve pain from HIV. It has never been used for critical ischaemia before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to investigate the efficacy of Qutenza in treating patients with end stage renal&#xD;
      failure and painful ischaemia. We will recruit 20 patients with painful ischaemia and treat&#xD;
      them with Qutenza. We will follow them up for 12 weeks and monitor the change in their pain&#xD;
      scores.&#xD;

      Peripheral vascular disease is common in end-stage renal failure (ESRF) affecting 24-77% of&#xD;
      patients (Stack, 2005). Critical ischaemia (pain at rest caused by insufficient blood supply&#xD;
      to a limb) is notoriously difficult to treat in this patient group. Advanced disease and&#xD;
      extensive co-morbidities limit surgical revascularisation options of proximal vessels&#xD;
      (Blankensteijn et al., 1996) and calciphylaxis (a process of calcification within the small&#xD;
      vessels unique to patients with end-stage renal failure) has few effective treatments (Ng &amp;&#xD;
      Peng, 2011). Often the only treatment option is symptomatic relief with strong analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective pain relief in patients with end-stage renal failure can be difficult to achieve.&#xD;
      The active metabolites of many opiates are renally-excreted and side effects are more common&#xD;
      in patients with end-stage renal failure. In particular, confusion and drowsiness limit their&#xD;
      use. Similarly drugs commonly used for neuropathic pain, such as gabapentin, have not be&#xD;
      investigated in clinical trials in patients with end-stage renal failure (Kurella et al.,&#xD;
      1993).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A drug which is not renally excreted, has minimal systemic absorption and does not require&#xD;
      dose adjustment in renal failure, is an attractive treatment option for patients with renal&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qutenza (topical capsaicin 8%) is an advanced dermal application system designed for rapid&#xD;
      delivery of capsaicin into the skin. The high concentration of capsaicin results in&#xD;
      reversible desensitisation of TRPV-1 expressing cutaneous sensory nerve endings and reduction&#xD;
      in nerve fibre density in the epidermis (Noto et al., 2009). The resulting pain relief is&#xD;
      long-lasting (12 weeks after a single application) (Backonja et al., 2008); Simpson et al.,&#xD;
      2008). Previous phase III studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in neuropathic&#xD;
      pain in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia (Blonsky et al., 2009) and HIV neuropathy (Noto&#xD;
      et al., 2099; Simpson et al., 2008) with a good tolerability profile and it is now licensed&#xD;
      for use in treatment of neuropathic pain in these patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and tolerability of Qutenza (topical capsaicin 8%) has been evaluated in over&#xD;
      1,600 patients within clinical trials, with a reduction in pain scores at 8 weeks from 30-32%&#xD;
      to 20-24% compared to an active control (capsaicin 0.04%) (Simpson et al., 2008). Patients&#xD;
      frequently developed mild irritant symptoms of erythema and itch at the site of application,&#xD;
      but significant side effects of blistering were rare occurring in &lt;5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently Qutenza (topical capsaicin 8%) is not licensed for the treatment of diabetics&#xD;
      however there is evidence from a moderate number of diabetics enrolled into clinical trials&#xD;
      that Qutenza is both safe and effective in this patient group also. Webster et al, (2011)&#xD;
      treated a total of 91 patients with painful diabetic nephropathy and found a 31.5% reduction&#xD;
      in mean pain scores during weeks 2-12 post treatment. There was no difference in the&#xD;
      incidence of local side effects experienced by diabetics and non-diabetics (Backonja et al,&#xD;
      2011). One patient did develop an ulcer in the area of treatment however it is unclear&#xD;
      whether this related to the treatment or not (Webster et al, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic patients will be enrolled into this trial due to the frequency of diabetic patients&#xD;
      with renal failure and the contributing role of diabetes in small vessel disease leading to&#xD;
      critical ischaemia. The distinction between painful diabetic neuropathy and digital critical&#xD;
      ischaemia can be difficult to make clinically and it may be that a small proportion of&#xD;
      patients recruited for this study also have an element of diabetic neuropathy in addition to&#xD;
      their critical ischaemia. In view of the concern with ulceration of the feet in diabetics&#xD;
      treated with Qutenza, patients with diabetic neuropathy causing a loss of sensation will be&#xD;
      excluded from having their feet treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain from critical ischaemia is multi-modal and notoriously difficult to treat particularly&#xD;
      in patients with established renal failure in whom other analgesic agents are poorly&#xD;
      tolerated. A drug such as Qutenza (topical capsaicin 8%) which is not renally excreted, has&#xD;
      minimal systemic absorption and does not require dose adjustment in renal failure, is an&#xD;
      attractive treatment option for patients with renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single centre, prospective observational trial evaluating efficacy and tolerability&#xD;
      of Qutenza (topical capsaicin 8%) for the treatment of digital critical ischaemia in patients&#xD;
      with end stage renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Qutenza (topical capsaicin 8%) in relieving chronic&#xD;
      neuropathic pain from digital critical ischaemia in patients with end stage renal failure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate Quality of Life (QoL) measures in patients with end stage renal failure who&#xD;
      have chronic neuropathic pain from critical ischaemia treated with Qutenza (topical capsaicin&#xD;
      8%)&#xD;
