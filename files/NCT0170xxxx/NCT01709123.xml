  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      6-8% of USA population has diabetes. Intensive blood glucose control dramatically reduces the&#xD;
      devastating complications that result from poorly controlled diabetes. However, for many&#xD;
      patients, achievement of tight glucose control is difficult with current regimens. Trivalent&#xD;
      chromium, the form found in foods and dietary supplements, is believed to be safe. Our&#xD;
      preliminary studies have reported that chromium supplementation inhibits the increase in&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6; TNF-alpha and&#xD;
      IL-6) secretion levels caused by high glucose levels in cultured monocytic cells. Similarly,&#xD;
      animal studies have shown that chromium niacinate supplementation lowered blood levels of&#xD;
      glycemia and pro-inflammatory cytokines in streptozotocin-treated diabetic rats. Cytokines&#xD;
      are proteins that are secreted by monocytes and other cells in response to various stimuli,&#xD;
      such as infection. Some of the cytokines are known to regulate insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      elevated level of these cytokines in blood may accelerate clogging of arteries. Thus,&#xD;
      chromium supplementation may increase insulin sensitivity and glycemic control in diabetic&#xD;
      patients, and may prevent the development of cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients.&#xD;
      Given the enormous public health cost of diabetes, the prospect of being able to use a&#xD;
      relatively low-cost dietary supplement, such as chromium, as an adjuvant therapy to help in&#xD;
      achieving normal blood glucose level merits further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will examine the effects of placebo and chromium niacinate supplementation on the fasting&#xD;
      glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and markers of vascular disease in blood of diabetic&#xD;
      patients. We will determine these above parameters at baseline and after the 1, 2 and 3&#xD;
      months of supplementation in diabetic patients. The long-term objective is to explore the&#xD;
      efficacy of chromium as an adjuvant treatment for better glycemic control, prevent the&#xD;
      development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and improve the life expectancy in diabetic&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chromium supplements are widely used by the public and are available in many stores, such as&#xD;
      Wal-mart, Walgreens, and many other food and drug stores. Chromium is an essential trace&#xD;
      metal and micronutrient present in wide variety of vegetables. Niacin is a vitamin B6, an&#xD;
      essential vitamin for our body. This study plans to use chromium niacinate, a complex of&#xD;
      chromium and niacin. Chromium niacinate is considered a nutrient.&#xD;
