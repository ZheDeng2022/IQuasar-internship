      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of a new wearable computerised system&#xD;
      designed for an ongoing monitoring of sportsmen under real-life conditions. This system&#xD;
      consists of different sensors and Bluetooth Transmitters interconnected by wires and&#xD;
      integrated in the textile of a T-shirt. Several physiologic parameters including bioimpedance&#xD;
      should be investigated under conditions relevant for an intensive physical activity, like&#xD;
      high body temperature or partial dehydration. This system has to be tested under laboratory&#xD;
      and &quot;natural/open air&quot; conditions, the obtained evaluations compared with standardised&#xD;
      established diagnostic methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The new wearable sensor- and monitoring system has to be tested on 20 healthy sportsmen of&#xD;
      both genders in the age between 18 and 35 years. The aim of the present study is the&#xD;
      characterisation of technical parameters, diagnostic precision and practical applicability of&#xD;
      this system, which should be able to measure and translate information of actual physiologic&#xD;
      state during the physical activity of sportsmen under real-life conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPANEMA (Integrated Posture and Activity Network) is a construct consisting of electrodes and&#xD;
      several specialized sensors integrated in the textile tissue of a T-Shirt and interconnected&#xD;
      with &quot;electronic nods&quot;, an equipment supporting the central computerized control system with&#xD;
      information via Bluetooth signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This body sensor network enables ablations of electrical activity of heart (ECG),&#xD;
      Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (BIS), measuring of temperature and humidity on the surface of&#xD;
      skin, breathing intensity and acceleration of body movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided in 3 parts, the indoor part, the outdoor part, and the part of&#xD;
      measurements under controlled artificial temperature conditions (climate chamber).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outdoor measurements will be performed at different running tracks, e.g. at the&#xD;
      Hochschulsportzentrum, Lousberg, and can be separated in two subtypes, the training and the&#xD;
      competition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The indoor study phase lasts ca. 2 hours, where the volunteers will be analysed during&#xD;
      running on a tread mill with both, the IPANEMA system and common medical monitoring&#xD;
      procedures. The evaluations of identical physiological parameters obtained by use of&#xD;
      stationary diagnostic equipment, the ergospirometric device PowerCube Ergo, BIS measurement&#xD;
      system Xitron Hydra 4200, infra-red camera VarioCam®hr-basic and standard medical ECG&#xD;
      measurements are used as reference values. Two hours before the start and during the entire&#xD;
      training phase, the experimental group is restricted to food and liquid intake in opposite to&#xD;
      control group. These experimental conditions purpose to clarify several physiological effects&#xD;
      of dehydration during sportive activities. The outdoor- and climate chamber- investigations&#xD;
      do not prescribe the liquid deprivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The climate chamber measurements will be performed in a temperature controlled room. This&#xD;
      measurement session can last up to 3 hours and temperature inside of climate chamber can be&#xD;
      increased until 40Cº. Such conditions may simulate body sensor network and elicit&#xD;
      physiological effects comparable to effects obtained during sportive activities. No sport is&#xD;
      performed by volunteers during the climate chamber phase.&#xD;

    <description>Due to the design and type of measurements the study is divided into 3 parts, Indoor, Outdoor and Climate Chamber. The measurement duration for every part lasts 2-3 hours. The obtained data will be compared to results obtained by conventional methods. It includes the precision of measurement, the transfer of data and validation of computer supported data analysis. The measured parameters include temperature of the body, humidity on the body surface, ECG, volume and rate of breathing</description>
