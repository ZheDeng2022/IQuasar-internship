  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, multi-center study to assess clinical features and biologic&#xD;
      biomarkers in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients compared to healthy controls (HC). The&#xD;
      primary objective of this study is to discover clinical and biologic markers of PD for use in&#xD;
      clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies.&#xD;

      BioFIND is a two-year observational clinical study designed to discover and verify biomarkers&#xD;
      of Parkinson's disease (PD). BioFIND is collecting clinical data and biospecimens, including&#xD;
      blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in a population of 120 well-defined, moderately advanced&#xD;
      PD subjects and 120 healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BioFIND will follow standardized data acquisition protocols to ensure that tests and&#xD;
      assessments conducted at multiple sites can be pooled. Data and samples acquired from study&#xD;
      participants will enable the development of a comprehensive Parkinson's database and&#xD;
      biorepository, which will be available to the scientific community to conduct research on&#xD;
      novel PD biomarkers.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria (PD Subjects):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have bradykinesia and rigidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or history of well documented resting tremor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unilateral onset or persistent asymmetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A well established response to dopaminergic agents including the presence of levodopa&#xD;
             induced dyskinesia for at least 3 years according to treating physician's judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has progressive PD of 5 to 18 years of duration from the onset of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female age of onset of PD 50 to 70 by history. Current ages would range from&#xD;
             55 to 93 based on #5 and #6 requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide written informed consent in accordance with Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
             (GCP), International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), and local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, required study procedures and&#xD;
             laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria (PD Subjects):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Family history of PD in first degree relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ashkenazi Jewish subject (defined as all 4 grandparents being Ashkenazi Jewish) will&#xD;
             be excluded because of the high likelihood of genetic forms of PD (LRRK2) and GBA),&#xD;
             unless these have been already excluded by genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has others serious neurological disorders (clinically significant stroke, brain tumor,&#xD;
             hydrocephalus, epilepsy, other neurodegenerative disorders, encephalitis, repeated&#xD;
             head trauma).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has early severe autonomic involvement. Symptomatic orthostatic, hypotension or&#xD;
             urinary incontinence within one year of onset of disease symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current treatment with anticoagulants (e.g., Coumadin, heparin) that might preclude&#xD;
             safe completion of the lumbar puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Condition that precludes the safe performance of routine lumbar puncture, such as&#xD;
             prohibitive lumbar spinal disease, bleeding diathesis, or clinically significant&#xD;
             coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
