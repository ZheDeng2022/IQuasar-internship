  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rapidly fatal malignancy of the bone marrow. It can be&#xD;
      treated with chemotherapy alone, in some cases, but in the majority of cases, the only&#xD;
      treatment that can cure the disease is an allogeneic stem cell transplant, with a cure rate&#xD;
      of 30-40%. In another subset, the disease is less responsive to chemotherapy and in these&#xD;
      aggressive forms, its cure rate is no better than 20% beyond 2 years, and is usually rapidly&#xD;
      fatal within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, for this most aggressive form of the disease, modifications to the transplant&#xD;
      protocol are required in order to try to improve on these poor results. There are a number of&#xD;
      areas within the transplant protocol on which modifications can be made in order to achieve&#xD;
      these goals. These include: higher doses of chemotherapy and or radiation; alterations of the&#xD;
      new bone marrow graft; and alterations of the immune suppression, enhancing the graft vs.&#xD;
      leukemia effect. By focusing on one or more of these components, one might be able to enhance&#xD;
      the anti-leukemic aspect of the treatment resulting in a more successful outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One aspect the investigators, in Ottawa, have focused on is the initial intensive&#xD;
      conditioning regimen, specifically the radiation component. It is the investigators belief&#xD;
      that in the most resistant disease it is important to use the highest tolerable anti-leukemic&#xD;
      treatment upfront, specifically, enhancing the radiation component of the initial&#xD;
      conditioning regimen. Previous studies have suggested that higher doses of radiation might be&#xD;
      more effective at eliminating the disease, however, toxicity and logistics of delivering the&#xD;
      radiation have limited its use. Technical advances in the delivery of radiation have now&#xD;
      permitted the safer use of high doses of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through modifications to the transplant procedure, the investigators believe that they can&#xD;
      deliver higher doses of radiation safely and this will translate into improved outcomes in&#xD;
      this high-risk subgroup of patients with AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine if a total dose of 18Gy ED-TBI followed by an alloHSCT&#xD;
      for patients with refractory AML will result in an improved progression-free survival.&#xD;

      Study Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. AML is a bone marrow based malignancy that is rapidly growing and rapidly fatal if left&#xD;
           untreated. Despite therapeutic strategies for up to 70% of patients, 20% are primarily&#xD;
           refractory and another 50% will relapse after first line therapy. Among these refractory&#xD;
           and relapsed patients the only, potentially, effective therapy is an alloHSCT, however,&#xD;
           long-term survival rates range from as low as &lt;10% up to 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increased doses of radiation in the form of TBI to a threshold of 15.75 Gy with&#xD;
           chemotherapy have been demonstrated to reduce the relapse rate significantly; however,&#xD;
           OS is compromised by the high rate of toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evidence suggests that escalated doses of radiation are possible, which offers the&#xD;
           potential to increase the dose of radiation to as much as 20Gy, safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Locally, increased doses of radiation without chemotherapy did not demonstrate any&#xD;
           significant toxicity up to a dose of 16Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Therefore, as proposed a radiation-only stem cell transplant would allow us to test the&#xD;
           hypothesis that increased doses of radiation will reduce the relapse rate while&#xD;
           minimizing the toxicity in a very high-risk population of patients with AML, resulting&#xD;
           in an improved progression-free and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single institution, Phase II study examining the efficacy and toxicity of ED-TBI&#xD;
      followed by an alloHSCT on patients with high risk, refractory acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have met the inclusion criteria will receive a myeloablative dose of radiation&#xD;
      followed by an alloHSCT. Acute radiation and transplant related toxicity will be evaluated as&#xD;
      the maximum value on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
      Events, version 4.0 (CTCAE v.4), during the first 30 days following the transplantation and&#xD;
      the LENT-SOMA Radiation Toxicity Scale. The radiation dose to the lungs and kidneys as well&#xD;
      as the total dose received by the other organs will be considered independently for the&#xD;
      purposes of determining the maximum tolerated radiation dose for that body region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments to determine the eligibility to participate in this study will be performed&#xD;
      before enrollment in the study, but after the subject has signed the informed consent.&#xD;
      Subjects who do not meet the eligibility criteria will be considered screening failures and&#xD;
      will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These assessments will determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject eligibility for entry on study,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suitability to undergo TBI followed by an alloHSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-treatment leukemia activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following pre-treatment assessments will be performed within a six-week period prior to&#xD;
      enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and physical examination, including height, weight, vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG Performance Status and Karnofsky performance status (appendix #3).&#xD;

           post-transplant, then at four months, six months, one year, 18 months and two years&#xD;
           post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acute GVHD will be evaluated according to the grading system in appendix 8&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Chronic GVHD will be evaluated according to the grading system in appendix 9&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CBC at least three times a week from Day 0 until ANC &gt; 0.5 x 109/L for 3 consecutive&#xD;

           then preferably weekly until Day 100, then at 12 months, 18 months and two years&#xD;
           post-transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Creatinine, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, twice a week until Day 28 and&#xD;
           then preferably weekly until 12 weeks, then at four months, six months, one year,&#xD;
           eighteen months and two years post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tacrolimus levels will be measured at least once weekly until the drug is tapered off.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum CMV-PCR weekly for at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy at Day 100 ±30 days on all patients. Bone marrow&#xD;
           aspirate and biopsy at 12 ±3 months post-transplant is recommended, but not required,&#xD;
           for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treat-related toxicity (RRT) assessments will be conducted weekly until Day 100 and&#xD;
           additional toxicity assessments will be conducted on Day 100, 180, 365 and 730&#xD;
           post-transplant using the CTCAE V.4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly urinalysis until discharge and then at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests will be performed at 6 months following treatment and then annually until&#xD;
      2 years after the transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone Mineral Density&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TSH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum Testosterone (males)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LENT-SOMA Radiation Toxicity Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary Function Tests (Flow Rates, Diffusion Capacity, Lung Volumes and O2 Saturation&#xD;
           by oximetry.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be performed at any time to look for relapse, if indicated (i.e. drop in&#xD;
      the platelet count below 100 x 109 cells/L or in the neutrophil count below 1 x 109 cells/L,&#xD;
      circulating blasts &gt;0%, unrelated to treatment) or if there is any other reason to suspect&#xD;
      relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Bone marrow aspirate +/- biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other tests may be added and the frequency of the above test may be changed depending on the&#xD;
      clinical scenario during the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following summary statistics will be obtained at the time of discharge from the alloHSCT&#xD;
      hospital admission:&#xD;
