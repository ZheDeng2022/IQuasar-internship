      Objective: to assess the effect of gastric bypass on HDL-cholesterol concentration and its&#xD;
      Apolipoprotein A4 content at 1 year following bariatric surgery in comparison with a&#xD;
      hypocaloric diet. Secondary aim was to measure total cholesterol and triglycerides levels as&#xD;
      well as insulin sensitivity after interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary Background Data: Very few prospective uncontrolled studies have investigated the&#xD;
      effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on cardiovascular risk factors. No controlled&#xD;
      studies had as primary goal the changes in HDL-cholesterol after gastric bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Forty subjects with a BMI&gt;40 or ≥35 kg/m2 in the presence of diabetes were enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty of them were operated of RYGB while 20 received lifestyle modification suggestions and&#xD;
      medical therapy for obesity complications (diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia).&#xD;

      Study design The study was an unblinded, prospective, non randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
      Participants were recruited from referrals for treatment of morbid obesity between September&#xD;
      2008 and July 2009. One year follow-up was completed in September 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study related to the changes in HDL-cholesterol at 1 year after the&#xD;
      intervention. Secondary aims were the changes in Apolipoprotein 4 (Apo4) and insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity after the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty morbidly-obese subjects (11 women and 9 men), whose 14 with normal glucose tolerance&#xD;
      and 6 with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), have been studied before and 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12&#xD;
      months after bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty morbidly-obese subjects (12 women and 8 men), 15 with normal glucose tolerance and 5&#xD;
      with T2DM, in the waiting list for bariatric surgery were enrolled in the protocol and&#xD;
      underwent medical therapy for obesity complications (diabetes, hypertension and&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia) and lifestyle modification suggestions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were eligible for inclusion if they had a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or &gt;35 kg/m2 in&#xD;
      presence of type 2 diabetes, were aged 30 to 60 years, and had not sustained weight loss in&#xD;
      the previous 1 year. Exclusion criteria were a history of major abdominal or bariatric&#xD;
      surgery, disabling cardiac or pulmonary diseases, cancer, long-term treatment with oral&#xD;
      corticosteroids, and mental illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Roux-&amp;-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) involves the use of a surgical stapler to create a small and&#xD;
      vertically oriented gastric pouch with a volume usually &lt; 30 ml. The upper pouch is&#xD;
      completely divided by the gastric remnant and is anastomosed to the jejunum, 75 cm distally&#xD;
      to the Treitz's ligament , through a narrow gastrojejunal anastomosis in a Roux-en-Y fashion.&#xD;
      Bowel continuity is restored by an entero-entero anastomosis, between the excluded biliary&#xD;
      limb and the alimentary limb, performed at 150 cm from the gastrojejunostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle modifications A hypocaloric diet (15 kcal/kgbw containing 55% carbohydrates, 30%&#xD;
      lipids and 15% proteins) was prescribed together with the indications to perform 30 minutes&#xD;
      brisk walk each day. Patients had open access to a diabetologist every 3 months. Medical&#xD;
      therapies, including pharmaceutical agents, were assigned on an individual basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measures Body weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg with a beam scale and&#xD;
      height to the nearest 0.5 cm using a stadiometer (Holatin, Crosswell, Wales, U.K.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure Blood pressure was measured 3 times with an appropriately sized cuff after the&#xD;
      participant had rested for 5 minutes, and the last 2 measurements were averaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral glucose tolerance test A standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed&#xD;
      after an overnight fasting with blood sampling at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min. Samples&#xD;
      were placed in chilled tubes, and plasma was separated within 20 min and stored at -80°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical methods Blood was drawn in the morning after an overnight fast. The sera and&#xD;
      plasma were immediately separated by centrifugation at 4°C and stored at -80°C until assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma glucose was measured by the glucose-oxidase method (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Plasma&#xD;
      insulin was assayed by microparticle-enzyme immunoassay (Abbott, Pasadena, CA) with a&#xD;
      sensitivity of 1 μU/ml and an intra-assay CV of 6.6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured enzymatically. HDL-cholesterol was measured&#xD;
      after precipitating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins with dextran sulfate and&#xD;
      magnesium chloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HbA1c serum levels were measured by high-performance liquid-chromatography (normal range&#xD;
      3.5-6.5%) Apo A4 was assessed by ELISA (Cusabio Biotech, Wuhan, Hubei, China); the detection&#xD;
      range is from 15.62 μg/l to 1000 μg/l and the minimum detectable concentration is 4 μg/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin Sensitivity Models&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OGTT and fasting plasma glucose and insulin were used to compute the insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
      Insulin resistance was assessed using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) originally&#xD;
      described by Mathew et al. HOMA-IR was calculated using the following equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOMA-IR(μU/ml∙mg/dl)=fasting insulin(μU/ml)∙(fasting glucose (mg/dl))/405 Peripheral insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity was assessed by the Oral Glucose Insulin Sensitivity (OGIS) model. OGIS is an&#xD;
      index of insulin sensitivity calculated in this case from the 3 hours OGTT and it is an&#xD;
      estimate of the glucose clearance during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp&#xD;
      expressed in ml/min per square meter of body surface area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics All of the data are expressed as means ± SD unless otherwise specified. The&#xD;
      Wilcoxon paired-sample test was used for intragroup comparisons. Two-sided P &lt; 0.05 was&#xD;
      considered significant. Nonparametric Spearman correlations were used to assess linear&#xD;
      relationships between single variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We calculated that a total of 30 participants would give 80% power to detect a significant (P&#xD;
      &lt; 0.05) difference between the groups. To allow for possible dropouts and add power for&#xD;
      analysis of secondary outcomes, we decided to enroll 40 participants.&#xD;
