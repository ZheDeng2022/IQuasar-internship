  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to learn more about how different levels of exercise feel to people&#xD;
      with Type 2 Diabetes and how it feels to people without Type 2 Diabetes. This study team will&#xD;
      also look at what causes exercise to feel harder or easier to people with and without Type 2&#xD;
      Diabetes. The investigators will also compare the potential benefits of supervised exercise&#xD;
      training to that of diabetes education/blood sugar monitoring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is a potent therapy to reduce cardiovascular mortality in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).&#xD;
      Although exercise is a cornerstone of treatment for T2D, people with T2D are more sedentary&#xD;
      than similarly obese people without diabetes, for reasons that are unclear. Interventions&#xD;
      which combined behavioral support and physical activity prescriptions successfully increased&#xD;
      physical activity levels for people with T2D and at-risk for T2D. However, the program&#xD;
      components which mediated increased physical activity were combined and thus the individual&#xD;
      benefits of each component remain unknown. Given the success of these combined programs, it&#xD;
      appears behavioral support and other psychological factors may play an important role. The&#xD;
      study investigators are interested in the predictors of physical activity adherence in T2D as&#xD;
      key targets for future interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One likely factor which may influence physical activity adherence is perceived exercise&#xD;
      effort. The study investigators reported, based on a small study, that perceived exercise&#xD;
      effort is worse in people with T2D than in healthy obese controls, as measured by the Borg&#xD;
      Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE), even during low intensity exercise. Thus, one strategy to&#xD;
      increase physical activity in T2D is to first identify the mediators of RPE in the proposed&#xD;
      study and then to address them in future studies. The preliminary data suggest that likely&#xD;
      mediators of RPE are both objective and subjective in nature. A key objective mediator of RPE&#xD;
      is serum lactate level during exercise, which is a physiological marker of effort, and is&#xD;
      disproportionately elevated in people with T2D vs. healthy controls. A key subjective&#xD;
      mediator of RPE is self-efficacy, which influences the perception of exercise effort, and is&#xD;
      disproportionately worse in people with T2D vs. healthy controls. To develop optimal physical&#xD;
      activity interventions for people with T2D, the study investigators must understand whether&#xD;
      RPE differences vary across the spectrum of exercise intensities (Aim 1), and the&#xD;
      investigators must also determine the mediators of RPE across exercise intensities (Aim 2).&#xD;
      Mediators of RPE in low-to-moderate intensity exercise are particularly important, because&#xD;
      walking is a preferred physical activity for people with T2D.&#xD;
