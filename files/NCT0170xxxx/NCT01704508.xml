    <textblock>
      Plasmodium falciparum causes malaria and approximately 665 000 deaths each year. chloroquine&#xD;
      and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine resistant P. falciparum are widespread. An artemisinin&#xD;
      derivative combined with lumefantrine, amodiaquine or piperaquine is therefore recommended&#xD;
      for the treatment of malaria in Africa. However, artemisinin resistance appears to be&#xD;
      developing and resistance/tolerance to amodiaquine and lumefantrine exists. We are presently&#xD;
      conducting a study in Guinea-Bissau. Preliminary data indicates that the effectiveness and&#xD;
      availability of artemether-lumefantrine (AL), the 1st line drug, is poor. Consequently there&#xD;
      is a need for another treatment option. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) has been shown to&#xD;
      be efficacious and well tolerated in several African countries and is therefore such an&#xD;
      option. A clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine and&#xD;
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is therefore needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents to children seeking Bandim Health Centre (CSB) with symptoms compatible with malaria&#xD;
      will be informed of the study. If accepting and the child fulfil the inclusion criteria, the&#xD;
      child will be randomised to treatment with either AL or DP. The treatment will be given&#xD;
      supervised at the health centre in the morning and the evening on day 0, day 1, and day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit and in the morning on day 3, the child will be examined, the mother asked for&#xD;
      any symptoms and signs of side-effects, the temperature measured. Furthermore, a blood sample&#xD;
      will be taken for examination of malaria parasites. On day 0 samples for measurement of&#xD;
      antimalarial drugs and for genotyping of the parasites will be taken on filterpaper. In a&#xD;
      subgroup of 50 children a blood sample for in vitro culturing and for analysis of the number&#xD;
      of leucocytes will also be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After having finished the treatment the children will be followed on day 7 and then once a&#xD;
      week until day 42. At each visit the condition of the child will be examined and a&#xD;
      bloodsample taken for examination of parasites in the blood. Furthermore, a filterpaper&#xD;
      bloodsample will be collected for measurement of the drug concentration of if the child has&#xD;
      recrudescence for genotyping of the parasites. On day 0, 3 and 42 the haemoglobin level will&#xD;
      be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of the two treatments will be evaluated by comparing the number of children with&#xD;
      recurrent parasitaemia, both corrected and uncorrected (recrudescence vs. reinfections). This&#xD;
      will be presented as adequate clinical and parasitological response rates PCR-corrected and&#xD;
      PCR-uncorrected. Furthermore, the chance in haemoglobin level from day 0 till day 3 and till&#xD;
      day 42 will be compared. The concentration of the antimalarial drug in the blood samples&#xD;
      taken at the visit before the re-parasitaemia will be capered to the concentrations in&#xD;
      children without re-parasitaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a 20% loss to follow up a total of 346 children should be included. For the children&#xD;
      included, health care and medications at Bandim Health Centre will be free during the study&#xD;
      period but no other gifts or payments will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be presented to the staff at the Bandim health centre and the ministry of Health&#xD;
      and will be published in an international peer reviewed journal.&#xD;

      Background Plasmodium falciparum causes malaria and approximately 665 000 deaths each year.&#xD;
      Previously chloroquine (CQ) and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine were the principle drugs for the&#xD;
      treatment of malaria. Due to widespread resistance to these drugs1, the World Health&#xD;
      Organization recommends that P. falciparum in Africa should be treated with artemisinin +&#xD;
      amodiaquine, artemether + lumefantrine (AL) or dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine2 (DP).&#xD;
      However, resistance to artemisinins appears to be developing3,4, resistance to amodiaquine&#xD;
      exists2 and treatment with AL rapidly selects for parasites with increased tolerance (5 times&#xD;
      higher inhibitory concentration) to lumefantrine5-7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Guinea-Bissau, CQ remained efficacious until replaced by AL. This is explained by the use&#xD;
      of a unique well tolerated high dose treatment schedule 8-10. Since the introduction of AL in&#xD;
      2008, the number of children with malaria has increased manyfold in Bissau in contrast with&#xD;
      other African countries. Our data suggests that this increase is due unavailability of AL,&#xD;
      poorer than expected effectiveness of AL and to an increased use of the second-line drug&#xD;
      quinine. Quinine is typically given for 3 instead of 7 days and has very poor efficacy when&#xD;
      used thus11. To counter this Guinea-Bissau needs an alternative cheap and easily dosed 2nd&#xD;
      line drug that can also be used when AL is not available or when funding for AL no longer&#xD;
      exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dihydroartemisinin+piperaquine is a safe and well tolerated artemisinin based combination12.&#xD;
      DP is taken once daily and has been shown to be highly efficacious (&gt;95%) in several African&#xD;
      settings13,14. DP also protects from re-infection for longer than AL14. As such this is a&#xD;
      drug that could become an attractive treatment option in Guinea-Bissau. It has however, never&#xD;
      been used in the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim Conduct an efficacy study with artemether + lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin +&#xD;
      piperaquine&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure the efficacy and safety of AL and DP in children aged 6 months to 12 years&#xD;
           suffering from uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the capacity of each drug combination to protect against re-infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To differentiate recrudescence from re-infections using PCR based methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine whole blood concentrations of lumefantrine and piperaquine the week before&#xD;
           reparasitaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine haemoglobin values on days 0, 3 and 42&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To determine differential white blood cell counts on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 21&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To determine genetic polymorphisms in P. falciparum causing reparasitaemia,&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To culture parasites from 50 children for further characterisation of P. falciparum&#xD;
           geno- and phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2. Methods Study design This will be an open label, randomized, non inferiority trial&#xD;
           conducted at the Bandim health centre, Guinea-Bissau. Children with uncomplicated&#xD;
           malaria who meet study inclusion criteria will be enrolled, randomised to treatment with&#xD;
           either AL or DP, treated on site and monitored for 42 days. The follow up will consist&#xD;
           of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and corresponding clinical and laboratory&#xD;
           examinations. The proportion of children experiencing therapeutic failure during the&#xD;
           follow-up period will be used to estimate the efficacy of the study drugs. PCR analysis&#xD;
           will be used to distinguish between a true recrudescence due to treatment failure and&#xD;
           episodes of re-infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Site and population Children aged 6 months to 12 years with uncomplicated P.&#xD;
           falciparum malaria that attend the Bandim health centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Timing and duration of the study The study will start in November 2012 and continue&#xD;
           until 350 children are included. If this is not achieved in one year the study will run&#xD;
           for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria A) Age ≥6 months, and &lt;13 years. B) Mono-infection with P. falciparum&#xD;
           detected by microscopy. C) Parasitemia of 1.000-200.000/µl asexual forms. D) Axillary&#xD;
           temperature ≥37.5 ˚C or a history of fever within 24 hours. E) Ability to swallow oral&#xD;
           medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
           F) Ability and willingness to comply with the study protocol for the duration of the&#xD;
           study and to comply with the study visit schedule. G) Informed consent from a parent or&#xD;
           guardian&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria A) Signs or symptoms of severe malaria including the following&#xD;
           symptoms Prostration. Impaired consciousness. Respiratory distress. Repeated generalised&#xD;
           convulsions (three or more per 24 hours or 2 witnessed seizures in 24 hours).&#xD;
           Circulatory collapse. Abnormal bleeding. Jaundice. Haemoglobinuria (dark red/black&#xD;
           urine). Severe anaemia (Haemoglobin &lt;5g/dl). Hyperparasitaemia (&gt;200.000/ µl asexual&#xD;
           forms) B) Presence of general danger signs in children under 5 including the following&#xD;
           Prostration. Respiratory distress. Haemoglobin &lt;5g/dl. Two or more convulsions within 24&#xD;
           hours. Persistent vomiting C) Presence of severe malnutrition. D) Any evidence of&#xD;
           chronic disease or acute infection other than malaria. E) Regular medication which may&#xD;
           interfere with antimalarial pharmacokinetics. F) History of hypersensitivity reactions&#xD;
           or contraindications to AL, DP or quinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           G) Domicile outside the study area.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Loss to follow up If a child is not seen on the day of follow up the child will be&#xD;
           sought at home on two consecutive days and if possible contacted by mobile phone. At&#xD;
           each subsequent weekly follow up three new attempts to see the child will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Treatment Antimalarial treatment Treatment with AL will be given according to a&#xD;
           6-dose regime. Treatment with DP will be given according to a 3 dose regime. Tablets of&#xD;
           AL (20 mg artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine) will be obtained from the manufacturer.&#xD;
           Tablets of DP (Eurartesim®) with 160mg/20mg or 320mg/40mg obtained from Sigma-Tau.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Block Randomization Identical slips of paper specifying treatment arm AL or DP will be&#xD;
           put into an envelope. Each envelope will contain 20 slips from each group and children&#xD;
           will randomly select one slip.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Concomitant treatment and medication that should not be used Paracetamol will be used to&#xD;
           treat fever. Iron and vitamin supplementation will be given if required. Prior treatment&#xD;
           with an antimalarial drug will not be considered as exclusion criteria. Children taking&#xD;
           any drug with antimalarial activity (including antibiotics such as tetracycline or&#xD;
           azithromycin) during the study period will be withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rescue treatment If children vomit twice, they will receive therapy with quinine&#xD;
           intramuscularly and will be withdrawn from the study. Any child with signs of severe or&#xD;
           complicated malaria will be treated according to recommendations of the attending nurse.&#xD;
           If a child meets criteria for early treatment failure, he or she will receive parenteral&#xD;
           quinine. If a child meets criteria for late treatment failure he or she will be&#xD;
           re-treated with AL.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. Evaluation Criteria Efficacy and safety evaluation Treatment outcomes will be early&#xD;
           treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or adequate&#xD;
           clinical and parasitological response as defined by the WHO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safety end points The incidence of any adverse event including neutropenia will be&#xD;
           documented. All children will be asked routinely about previous symptoms and about&#xD;
           symptoms that have emerged since the previous follow up visit. When clinically&#xD;
           indicated, children will be evaluated and treated appropriately. All adverse events will&#xD;
           be recorded in the case record forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical evaluation All children will be evaluated by an attending study nurse and the&#xD;
           examination will include a physical examination, body weight, body (axillary)&#xD;
           temperature as shown in table 3&#xD;
&#xD;
           Microscopic examination Two thick and thin blood films for parasite counts and species&#xD;
           identification will be obtained as shown in table 3 and whenever a child returns to the&#xD;
           Bandim health centre. Slides will be stained using freshly prepared Giemsa and examined&#xD;
           with 1000 x magnification. The number of asexual parasites per 200 white blood cells&#xD;
           will be counted or, if parasitaemia is high, the number of white blood cells per 500&#xD;
           parasites will be counted. Parasite density will be assessed independently by 2&#xD;
           qualified microscopists. Discordant results will be read a third time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Genotyping, antimalarial drug concentration, haemoglobin and white blood cell count&#xD;
           100µL of blood will be collected on Whatman 3MM filter-paper using a capillary tube on&#xD;
           day 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 and whenever reparasitaemia is detected. Filter-papers will&#xD;
           be dried and then placed inside separate sealed plastic bags. Filter-papers and bags&#xD;
           will be labelled with study number date and follow up day. The samples will be stored at&#xD;
           -20˚C. Blood samples will be obtained at the same time that blood is taken for&#xD;
           microscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to differentiate recrudescence from a re-infection genotyping using sequential&#xD;
           analysis of pfglurp, pfmsp1 and pfmsp2 will be done21.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The proportion of resistance associated genotypes in resistance associated genes&#xD;
           including pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfmrp1 and pfcmu will be determined. Genotyping will be done at&#xD;
           Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden and/or Universidade do Minho, Portugal.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Drug concentrations will be assessed on the week prior to reparasitaemia at Mahidol&#xD;
           University Bangkok using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Haemoglobin concentration will be determined on day 0, 3 and 42 using a haemocueTM At&#xD;
           the same time that blood sampling for microscopy is done on Day 0, exactly 200μL of&#xD;
           blood will also be taken for in vitro culturing from 50 patients. The blood will be put&#xD;
           into medium and grown in vitro in an incubator at 37 ˚C. When a culture is established&#xD;
           it will be frozen in liquid nitrogen for transport to Sweden or Portugal where extensive&#xD;
           drug assays will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5. Study Assessment Screening and enrolment As part of the routine medical services&#xD;
           provided at the health centre, all children with symptoms suggestive of malaria will be&#xD;
           screened for malaria using a rapid diagnostic test. Positive tests are confirmed by&#xD;
           microscopy. Children fulfilling inclusion critera will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
           study following informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow up Children will be given a unique personal identification number and be given&#xD;
           treatment after informed consent. The basic follow up schedule is shown below.&#xD;
           Treatments, information to the children, clinical observations and adverse events will&#xD;
           be recorded in the clinical record forms. The children will come to the health centre on&#xD;
           days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42. If a child is not seen at the health centre&#xD;
           he/she will be visited at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6. Data Management The principle investigator will ensure that the study protocol is&#xD;
           strictly adhered to and that data are correctly collected and recorded on the case&#xD;
           record form. Data will be entered into an EpiData database during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7. Sample size The PCR corrected day 42 ACPR of AL was 97% in 2008 ( = before the&#xD;
           national recommendation was changed in favour of A). It is likely that DP should be as&#xD;
           efficacious as AL and it is therefore appropriate to conduct a non-inferiority trial13.&#xD;
           Assuming 97% ACPR for both treatments, 5% significance level (alpha), 80% power (1-beta)&#xD;
           and a non-inferiority limit (d) of 5% 144 children are required in each arm. Assuming a&#xD;
           20% loss to follow up a total of 346 children should be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analysis of data The data will be analysed using survival estimates of per protocol&#xD;
           treatment failure rates but also intention to treat treatment failure rates. Final&#xD;
           analysis will include a description of included children, proportions of adverse events&#xD;
           and any serious adverse events, the proportion of children withdrawn or lost to follow&#xD;
           up, the cumulative PCR corrected and uncorrected success and failure rates on day 42 and&#xD;
           the proportion of early, late clinical and late parasitological treatment failures.&#xD;
