  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fecal incontinence is the complaint of involuntary loss of feces. Fecal incontinence affects&#xD;
      2-12% of the adult population. It is a hidden problem - less than one third of the affected&#xD;
      persons discuss the problem with their doctor. The condition has a negative effect on quality&#xD;
      of life. It is associated with shame and limitation in social life, leisure, occupational and&#xD;
      sexual activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic floor muscle exercises with or without the use of biofeedback has been recommended and&#xD;
      used for the treatment of fecal incontinence over the last decades. Several uncontrolled&#xD;
      trials and some controlled trials have shown a positive effect of this training, but most of&#xD;
      the trials are small and/or have methodological problems. Therefore there is to day still a&#xD;
      lack of sufficient evidence for the effect of pelvic floor muscle exercise as a treatment of&#xD;
      fecal incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of an individual physiotherapeutic supervised&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscle training program with a control physiotherapeutic treatment (massage of&#xD;
      the neck and back). Both treatments will be given parallel with standard information and&#xD;
      guidance given by a nurse specialized in anal incontinence issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: Pelvic floor muscle exercises given parallel with standard advice and&#xD;
      guidance by a specialized nurse, provides better effect to reducing fecal incontinence than&#xD;
      control treatment and standard advice alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, investigator blinded, randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms. 100&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to one of two groups. Ratio 1:1. Baseline data consists of a&#xD;
      physical examination, anal ultrasound and a thorough medical history including age, duration&#xD;
      of complaints, fecal incontinence specific symptoms and known risk factors for fecal&#xD;
      incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive standard information and guidance and care by a specialized nurse. The&#xD;
      treatment consists of advice about diet and fiber supplements and information about&#xD;
      optimizing bowel emptying and use of antidiarrheal medication if appropriate. In addition the&#xD;
      participants will receive six individual treatments of 30 minutes by a physiotherapist. This&#xD;
      treatments will consist of massage of the back and neck. The participants will get no&#xD;
      instructions on pelvic floor muscle exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will receive the same information and guidance by a specialist nurse as group 1. In&#xD;
      addition they will receive six individual treatments of 45 minutes by a physiotherapist&#xD;
      specialized in incontinence problems and pelvic floor disorders. The participants will get&#xD;
      instructions in the anatomy and function of the pelvic floor muscles and instructions on how&#xD;
      to do a correct pelvic floor muscle contraction. The pelvic floor muscle exercises will be&#xD;
      taught both by verbal instructions and by vaginal and anal palpation. For each session by the&#xD;
      physiotherapist, the participants will get a physiotherapeutic examination of the pelvic&#xD;
      floor muscles by a vaginal and rectal examination. The pelvic floor muscle and the external&#xD;
      anal sphincter strength will be measured according to the Modified Oxford Score (ranging&#xD;
      0-5). Endurance of sub-maximal contractions will be determined. The function of pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscle will also be measured with intra-anal EMG biofeedback. Biofeedback will be used to&#xD;
      give the participant visual and auditory feedback on a correct pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      contraction to enhance the participants awareness, strength and endurance of a correct pelvic&#xD;
      floor muscle contraction. Biofeedback will also be used in sitting and standing position to&#xD;
      assess the pelvic floor muscle function in those positions. According to the findings of the&#xD;
      physiotherapeutic examinations there will be prepared an individual adapted pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscle training program. The program consists of 3 sets of 10 contractions sustained up till&#xD;
      10 seconds and 2 sets of 3 contractions sustained up till 30 seconds. 1 minute rest between&#xD;
      each set. The participants will also be instructed in how to contract the pelvic floor in&#xD;
      response to anal urgency and in situations with increased intra abdominal pressure. The&#xD;
      participants will be encouraged to perform the training program on a daily basis and will be&#xD;
      instructed in filling out a training dairy. The diary will be used as a motivational tool and&#xD;
      to quantify the amount of training. The individual training program will be adjusted, based&#xD;
      on the findings from the examinations, and participants will be instructed to perform the&#xD;
      exercises in different positions and during movements e.g. transfers, lifting, walking,&#xD;
      coughing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatments in both groups will be distributed over 16 weeks, with treatment in week&#xD;
      0,2,5,8,12 and 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note 15. februar 2016:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to logistical reasons, we failed to perform the 12 months follow-up in the first 15&#xD;
      patients, which is why we decided to change the follow-up from 12 months to 36 months. This&#xD;
      will enable us to perform a long-term outcome assessment for all included patients. This&#xD;
      change does not affect the pre-specified primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve as high respond rate as possible we decided to restrict the follow-up&#xD;
      measurement to the questionnaires: Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale (PGI-I&#xD;
      scale), Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI), St. Marks Incontinence Score (Vaizey) and&#xD;
      Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life Scale (FIQL). Questions about further treatment for fecal&#xD;
      incontinence since completion of the study and the amount of current pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      exercise will be added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We thus decided to omit anal manometry, rectal capacity measurement and diaries from the 36&#xD;
      months follow-up measurements.&#xD;
