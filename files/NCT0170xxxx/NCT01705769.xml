      This project aims to assess the efficacy of three options under consideration in India for&#xD;
      home management of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM). The investigators propose to conduct a&#xD;
      multi-center randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of two community-supported&#xD;
      home-based regimes using centrally or locally produced Ready to Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTF)&#xD;
      for recovery from uncomplicated SAM after 16 weeks of management, compared with an augmented&#xD;
      home-prepared foods regimen. The trial will enroll 911 children with uncomplicated SAM and&#xD;
      will have enough statistical power to detect a 15% or greater difference in recovery rates&#xD;
      between either one of the intervention groups compared with comparison group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      India accounts for over half the global burden of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in the&#xD;
      world. While it is important to accelerate efforts to prevent SAM, effective management of&#xD;
      children suffering from it is critical for reducing child mortality and achieving MDG1 and&#xD;
      MDG4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available evidence mostly from studies in Africa suggest that home based management of&#xD;
      uncomplicated SAM with Ready to Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTF) is at least as efficacious as&#xD;
      facility-based management and that locally produced RUTF is as efficacious as centrally&#xD;
      produced RUTF. More evidence on efficacy and effectiveness of home based management using&#xD;
      RUTF is needed to decide if this intervention offers substantial advantages over&#xD;
      home-prepared foods in the Indian settings. Additionally, there is a demand to generate&#xD;
      evidence of efficacy of locally produced RUTF as compared to that of centrally produced RUTF.&#xD;
      These issues can only be resolved through a well designed randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project therefore aims to assess the efficacy of three options under consideration in&#xD;
      India for home management of SAM. The investigators propose to conduct a multi-center&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of two community-supported home-based&#xD;
      regimes using centrally or locally produced Ready to Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTF) for&#xD;
      recovery from uncomplicated SAM after 16 weeks of management, compared with an augmented&#xD;
      home-prepared foods regimen. The trial will enroll 911 children with uncomplicated SAM and&#xD;
      will have enough statistical power to detect a 15% or greater difference in recovery rates&#xD;
      between either one of the intervention groups compared with the comparison group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: The study will be conducted in three sites - urban slums and resettlement&#xD;
      colonies in the national capital region, rural (predominantly tribal) Rajasthan, rural and&#xD;
      urban Tamil Nadu. Field workers will survey the study area to measure mid-upper arm&#xD;
      circumference (MUAC) in children 6 to 59 months of age and refer children with MUAC less than&#xD;
      13 cm to a study clinic. At the study clinic, anthropometric measurements will be taken and&#xD;
      children with weight for height less than -3 SD of the WHO standards or oedema of both feet&#xD;
      will be offered participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and Comparison Regimes for Home Management of SAM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children randomized to the first intervention arm (Arm 1) will receive a centrally&#xD;
           produced RUTF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children randomized to the second intervention arm (Arm 2) will receive a locally&#xD;
           produced RUTF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children randomized to the comparison group (Arm 3) will receive augmented Home-Prepared&#xD;
           Foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of food advised for each child in all the 3 study arms are calculated to provide&#xD;
      175cal/kg body weight per day. These foods will be given to children from the time of&#xD;
      enrollment until recovery (but not beyond 16 weeks). Caregivers of all enrolled children will&#xD;
      receive counseling on frequency of feeding, amounts to be fed, encouraging children to&#xD;
      continue breastfeeding and good hygiene practices. Additional support through a volunteer&#xD;
      from the community will be provided to mothers who give consent, to assist in feeding the&#xD;
      child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management Phases: The management will be in two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase: From enrolment until recovery or 16 weeks (whichever is earlier), enrolled&#xD;
      children will be provided the foods according to the study group they are randomized to, and&#xD;
      counselled on their use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sustenance Phase: After completion of the treatment phase, children in all arms will be&#xD;
      referred to the closest Anganwadi centre from where he/she will access supplementary foods&#xD;
      given to children as a part of the ICDS strategy. The sustenance phase will last for 16 weeks&#xD;
      after end of treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: A trained and standardized team of field workers will conduct weekly anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements and also record morbidity, hospitalizations and deaths from enrolment, weekly&#xD;
      till recovery or 16 weeks whichever is earlier. In addition, mortality and hospitalization&#xD;
      data will be collected at 16 weeks post treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be recovery by 16 weeks after enrollment (defined as achieving&#xD;
      weight for height greater than or equal to -2 SD and absence of oedema).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the weight gain (in grams/kg body weight/day) from enrolment till recovery,&#xD;
           or till 16 weeks in those who do not attain recovery, at 16 weeks after recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the time required to reach recovery (in weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence and prevalence of diarrhea, ARI and fever during the&#xD;
           treatment phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the mortality and hospitalizations during the treatment phase, 16 weeks after&#xD;
           recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the perceptions of families, health care providers and ICDS functionaries&#xD;
           regarding feasibility of use of the feeding regimens in a sub sample from enrolment tom&#xD;
           completion of treatment phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To ascertain factors which affect recovery, at 16 weeks post enrolment in those who do&#xD;
           not recover.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the perceptions of families regarding Anganwadi centre experience at the end&#xD;
           of sustenance phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the proportion of children with weight for height greater than or equal to -2&#xD;
           SD and absence of oedema feet at 16 weeks after recovery (or 32 weeks after enrolment&#xD;
           for those who do not recover)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the costs of implementing the feeding regimens till end of treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Estimation of costs of human resource and other inputs&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Estimation of household costs&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Costs per week per child estimated based on total costs and covered population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has been approved by the National Research Alliance for SAM constituted by the&#xD;
      Department of Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health Research and Department of&#xD;
      Biotechnology. It will be coordinated by Centre for Health Research and Development-Society&#xD;
      for Applied Studies. WHO will provide technical support and monitoring for the study&#xD;
      implementation as a response to a request from the Alliance. Oversight to the study will be&#xD;
      provided by a Technical Advisory group constituted by the Alliance and a Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board. Clearances have been sought from the state governments of Delhi, Rajasthan&#xD;
      and Tamil Nadu.&#xD;
