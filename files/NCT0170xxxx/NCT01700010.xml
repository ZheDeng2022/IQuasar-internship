  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve subjects who have advanced urothelial cancer who are platinum&#xD;
      refractory (platinum based chemotherapies that are not effective in treating the cancer), and&#xD;
      who are over-expressing EGFR and/or HER2, or do not over-express EGFR and HER2. Genetic&#xD;
      expression is a process that takes inherited information in genes (like DNA sequence), and&#xD;
      from that information makes a specific functional product (sometimes called a gene product)&#xD;
      such as RNA (ribonucleic acid) or protein. Normal tissue cells have a particular genetic&#xD;
      expression, which changes when they turn into cancer. EGFR and HER2 are involved in the&#xD;
      process by which normal cells are transformed into cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of the study is to look at the proportion of subjects, who over-express EGFR&#xD;
      and/or HER2, who do not progress (cancer gets worse) after 16 weeks of study treatment with&#xD;
      daily lapatinib and weekly paclitaxel. The study will also look at the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of this therapy in all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another part of this study will look at blood and tissue samples. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected to see how many cells express EGFR and HER2 before study treatment and at the time&#xD;
      the cancer gets worse. Tumor tissue will be analyzed to look at the expression of certain&#xD;
      genes in advanced urothelial cancer. Some gene expression tests can reveal how cancer cells&#xD;
      are different from normal cells and the results might lead to more accurate diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer caused 14,680 deaths in 2010 in the US. In advanced bladder cancer, MVAC&#xD;
      (methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin and cisplatin) and GC (gemcitabine, cisplatin)&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy demonstrate comparable efficacy with response rates of 45%- 50%.&#xD;
      Despite the reasonable initial response to platinum based chemotherapy, median time to&#xD;
      progression on first line therapy is only 7 months and median survival approximately 15&#xD;
      months. There is no standard second line therapy after platinum based chemotherapy in the US&#xD;
      and no survival benefit has been noted with any agent. Median progression free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      is around 2 months in platinum refractory urothelial cancer (PRUC) and overall survival (OS)&#xD;
      is 6 - 8 months with single agent second line therapy. Combination chemotherapy does not&#xD;
      prolong overall survival. Given the dire prognosis in PRUC and the lack of efficacy of&#xD;
      conventional chemotherapy, preclinical investigations and clinical research have focused on&#xD;
      identification of novel molecular targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lapatnib is approved by the FDA for the treatment of breast cancer. Paclitaxel is approved by&#xD;
      the FDA for the treatment of sarcoma, breast and lung cancers. Lapatinib and paclitaxel are&#xD;
      not approved for advanced urothelial cancer; however, the FDA allows the use of these drugs&#xD;
      in this study for research purposes.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have progressed on prior regimens (1-2 allowed) of systemic chemotherapy&#xD;
             for any stage of urothelial carcinoma (including peri-operative chemotherapy alone in&#xD;
