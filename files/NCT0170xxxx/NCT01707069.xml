  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study of a vaccine for allergy to Japanese Red Cedar. The vaccine is&#xD;
      called CryJ2-DNA-LAMP Plasmid vaccine. This research study will determine how the vaccine is&#xD;
      tolerated and how research participants respond to the vaccine in various doses.&#xD;
      CryJ2-DNA-LAMP Plasmid vaccine is investigational, which means it is not approved for use by&#xD;
      the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but is available in research studies&#xD;
      like this one. This is the first time that CryJ2-DNA-LAMP Plasmid vaccine is being given to&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of an investigational vaccine intended to&#xD;
      treat allergy to Japanese red cedar. The vaccine is composed of DNA, which is the material&#xD;
      that cells use to provide instructions to make proteins. The DNA carries the information&#xD;
      necessary to make a special protein which is a combination of a protein found in all cells,&#xD;
      LAMP (lysosomal associated membrane protein), and the protein from Japanese red cedar that&#xD;
      causes the allergy known as Cry J2. This vaccine is intended to help re-educate the immune&#xD;
      system with respect to how it will respond to naturally occurring red cedar allergen and&#xD;
      eliminate the allergic symptoms. Another purpose of this study will be to document the immune&#xD;
      response to the vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that are eligible to participate in this study will be assigned by whether they are&#xD;
      sensitive or non sensitive to CryJ2 or Mountain Cedar and chance (like flipping a coin) to&#xD;
      one of 3 study vaccine groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: will receive four (4) 4-milligram doses of the study vaccine. Group 2: will receive&#xD;
      four (4) 2-milligram doses of the study vaccine. Group 3: will receive four (4) 4-milligram&#xD;
      doses of the study vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study vaccine is administered as an intramuscular injection. Enrolled subjects will&#xD;
      receive the study vaccine every 14 days (at day 0, 14, 28 and 42). Subjects will know their&#xD;
      study vaccine assignment. Participants who are not allergic to Japanese red cedar will be&#xD;
      assigned to Group 1. Participants who do have an allergy to Japanese red cedar or Mountain&#xD;
      Cedar will have an equal chance of being assigned to Group 2 or 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be between 18 to 30 men and women participating in the study at one location. Your&#xD;
      participation in this study will last approximately 72 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a Phase I, prospective, three cohort, open label study conducted on one cohort&#xD;
      of non-atopic subjects and two cohorts of patients with a history of allergic rhinitis&#xD;
      symptoms to Japanese red cedar Cry j 2 pollen allergen. The study will be conducted at 1&#xD;
      study center. Subjects are enrolled in the trial for a period of 72 days. The objectives of&#xD;
      the statistical analyses are to establish the safety and to explore the immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      LAMP-vax vaccine. All statistical analyses conducted on the data from this trial will be&#xD;
      exploratory in nature.&#xD;
