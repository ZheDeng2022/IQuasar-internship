      The purpose of this study is describe the frequency of chest pain and how chest pain impacts&#xD;
      patients' quality of life in the outpatients with chronic coronary artery disease in&#xD;
      contemporary cardiology practice settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goals in the management of stable coronary artery disease (CAD) are to reduce&#xD;
      risk factors for heart attack and to control the symptoms of angina (chest pain). Ideally&#xD;
      angina is well controlled with medications alone, but invasive procedures are a valuable&#xD;
      option for patients with persistent angina. The amount of angina among patients with stable&#xD;
      CAD in the outpatient setting, however, is unknown. An Australian study reported that almost&#xD;
      1 in 3 patients with stable angina being treated by primary care doctors had angina at least&#xD;
      once a week, which was associated with worse quality of life. We propose to examine the&#xD;
      burden of angina in outpatients with stable CAD who are being medically managed by&#xD;
      cardiologists in the United States through administration of a one-time survey. The&#xD;
      information from this study could ultimately help improve management of stable CAD and angina&#xD;
      and illuminate potential underuse of revascularization. While cardiologists are generally&#xD;
      expected to provide better angina control than primary care doctors, establishing the&#xD;
      prevalence of angina among the best providers will help with a framework for interpreting&#xD;
      symptom control among other practitioners.&#xD;
