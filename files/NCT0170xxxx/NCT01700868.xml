  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test hypotheses that are potentially important to diabetes management,&#xD;
      with practical implications for reducing the medical, personal, and economic costs of the&#xD;
      disease. Anticipated outcomes include reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin that are&#xD;
      significantly greater than those achievable with current diet recommendations, reductions in&#xD;
      medication use among many intervention-group participants, beneficial changes in body weight&#xD;
      and serum lipid concentrations, and a demonstration of the acceptability of the intervention&#xD;
      diet. Progress toward these goals could refine dietary guidance for individuals with&#xD;
      diabetes, increase treatment expectations, and reduce the massive burden the disease&#xD;
      currently imposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study further attempts to translate a dietary intervention studied in a clinical research&#xD;
      setting to a medical practice. This will contribute to developing a model for diabetes care&#xD;
      that can be used widely.&#xD;

      Specific Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that the nutrition intervention (low-fat, low-GI, vegan&#xD;
      diet; henceforth called the 'vegan diet') improves glycemic control, body weight, plasma&#xD;
      lipid concentrations, blood pressure, and indices of renal function in a within-group&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycosylated hemoglobin is the primary dependent variable, as well as fasting plasma glucose&#xD;
      and urinary albumin and creatinine concentrations. The within-group changes in these&#xD;
      variables from baseline to week 20, one-year follow-up will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that the vegan diet is more effective than standard&#xD;
      nutrition care for improving glycemic control, body weight, plasma lipid concentrations,&#xD;
      blood pressure, and indices of renal function in individuals with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycosylated hemoglobin is the primary dependent variable, as well as fasting plasma glucose&#xD;
      and urinary albumin and creatinine concentrations in both the intervention and control&#xD;
      groups. The between-groups differences in the changes in these variables from baseline to&#xD;
      week 20, and one-year follow-up will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that the vegan diet is sustainable among individuals with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes for a 20-week period, with weekly classes, and in a follow-up period of one&#xD;
      year with limited professional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be assessed by 3-day dietary records at weeks 0, 20 and one-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4 tests the hypothesis that the vegan diet has an acceptability that is&#xD;
      comparable to that of standard nutrition care among individuals with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hypothesis will be addressed by quantitatively assessing adherence to and acceptability&#xD;
      of the intervention and control diets, using the 3-day dietary record, the Food Acceptability&#xD;
      Questionnaire, and the Eating Inventory, as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 5 tests the hypothesis that the effects of the dietary interventions on A1c and&#xD;
      body weight are reduced in individuals with the A1 and B1 alleles of the DRD2 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be assessed through Taq1 A1 and B1 genotype determination at baseline.&#xD;
