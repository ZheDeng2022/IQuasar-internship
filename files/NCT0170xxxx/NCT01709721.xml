    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Who Are Treatment Failures During the Double-blind Randomized Withdrawal Period</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks [Baseline (Day 84) to Day 119 Visit]</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment failure during the Randomized Phase is defined as at least one of the following: a) increase of &gt;= 20mm VASPI vs. baseline over 5 days; b) intolerable pain that in investigator's opinion requires intervention; or c) pain-related interventions that violate protocol from Day 84 to Day 119.&#xD;
Note: Baseline pain for the randomized phase is defined as the average of the last 5 days with daily pain measurements while on an optimal intrathecal dose of Hydromorphone, between Days 77 and 83 of the open label dosing period.&#xD;
Note: A subject who does not have sufficient data for evaluation, drops out for any other reasons that are not listed above or who experiences withdrawal syndrome as identified by COWS &gt; 12 during the randomized phase will not be classified as a treatment failure.&#xD;
Note: Analysis period is from beginning of randomization phase (Day 84) to end of study.</description>

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI): Pain Severity, &quot;Worst&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Weeks [Baseline (Day 84) to Day 119 Visit]</time_frame>
    <description>'Worst' pain experienced in the past 24 hours. Brief Pain Inventory (BPI): Scale: 0 = No Pain, 10 = Pain as bad as you can imagine; a high score indicates a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI): Pain Severity &quot;Average&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Weeks [Baseline (Day 84) to Day 119]</time_frame>
    <description>'Average' pain experienced in the past 24 hours. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI): Scale: 0 = No Pain, 10 = Pain as bad as you can imagine; a high score indicates a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI): Pain Severity Summary Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Weeks [Baseline (Day 84) to Day 119]</time_frame>
    <description>Pain severity will be evaluated by rating pain on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine) for the 'worst', 'least', and 'average' pain experienced in the past 24 hours, as well as, the pain experienced 'now'. In addition, a calculated mean pain severity score will be based on the sum of all 4 of the pain scores divided by 4. If any of the 4 questions are missing, then the calculated mean pain severity score will be considered missing. High values indicate worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory: Interference With Function Summary Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Weeks [Baseline (Day 84) to Day 119]</time_frame>
    <description>Pain interference with daily functioning will be evaluated by rating interference on a scale from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) for 'general activity', 'mood', 'walking ability', 'normal work', 'relation with other people', 'sleep', and 'enjoyment of life'. A calculated mean pain interference will be based on the sum of non-missing interference questions answered divided by the number of questions answered. The mean should be set to missing if fewer than 4 pain interference questions are answered. A high score is worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ): Summary Score</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Weeks [Baseline (Day 84) to Day 119]</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-MPQ consists of a 15 item pain rating index. The severity of each item will be scored as None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), or Severe (3). The total SF-MPQ score is the sum of the severity scores for each item. The total score can range from 0 to 45; high score is worse.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Rescue Medication After Randomization (Days)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Weeks [Baseline (Day 84) to Day 119]</time_frame>
    <description>The number of days to rescue will be calculated by calculating the number of hours between the time of randomization and the time of rescue. The number of hours will then be divided by 24 to obtain the number of days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Weeks [Baseline (Day 84) to Day 119 / Treatment Failure]</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC rating represents observed changes (if any) from the subject's Baseline Visit in activity limitations, symptoms, emotions, and overall quality of life, related to the subject's painful condition. Change is rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale from 1 (no change) through 7 (a great deal better). High score is better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oral Opioid Supplement Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Weeks [Baseline (Day 84) to Day 119]</time_frame>
    <description>Total consumption (mg) = The total number of milligrams consumed of any oral opioid product from Day 84 (Baseline) through the end of study will be calculated for each subject.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Subjects Who Are Treatment Failures During the Double-blind Randomized Withdrawal Period</title>
        <description>Treatment failure during the Randomized Phase is defined as at least one of the following: a) increase of &gt;= 20mm VASPI vs. baseline over 5 days; b) intolerable pain that in investigator's opinion requires intervention; or c) pain-related interventions that violate protocol from Day 84 to Day 119.&#xD;
Note: Baseline pain for the randomized phase is defined as the average of the last 5 days with daily pain measurements while on an optimal intrathecal dose of Hydromorphone, between Days 77 and 83 of the open label dosing period.&#xD;
Note: A subject who does not have sufficient data for evaluation, drops out for any other reasons that are not listed above or who experiences withdrawal syndrome as identified by COWS &gt; 12 during the randomized phase will not be classified as a treatment failure.&#xD;
Note: Analysis period is from beginning of randomization phase (Day 84) to end of study.</description>

          <title>Proportion of Subjects Who Are Treatment Failures During the Double-blind Randomized Withdrawal Period</title>
          <description>Treatment failure during the Randomized Phase is defined as at least one of the following: a) increase of &gt;= 20mm VASPI vs. baseline over 5 days; b) intolerable pain that in investigator's opinion requires intervention; or c) pain-related interventions that violate protocol from Day 84 to Day 119.&#xD;
Note: Baseline pain for the randomized phase is defined as the average of the last 5 days with daily pain measurements while on an optimal intrathecal dose of Hydromorphone, between Days 77 and 83 of the open label dosing period.&#xD;
Note: A subject who does not have sufficient data for evaluation, drops out for any other reasons that are not listed above or who experiences withdrawal syndrome as identified by COWS &gt; 12 during the randomized phase will not be classified as a treatment failure.&#xD;
Note: Analysis period is from beginning of randomization phase (Day 84) to end of study.</description>
