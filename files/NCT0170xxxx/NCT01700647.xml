      It is possible to test a sample of breath from a patient, run it through a machine, and find&#xD;
      out certain diseases in the patient without needing to do Xrays. It is sort of like&#xD;
      a&quot;breathalyser&quot;.In the future it is hoped this type of testing will be common, and allow&#xD;
      certain conditions to be picked up early. One of these conditions is Cancer of the Larynx&#xD;
      (voice box). It is not in wide use yet however a study has shown it is very effective in&#xD;
      detecting Larynx cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This breath test has detected cancers at a stage when they CAN be seen on Xrays or looking in&#xD;
      with cameras. However the larger the cancer ultimately the worse it is for the patient. It&#xD;
      would therefore be much better to have the breath test find patients with cancers at a much&#xD;
      smaller size. It is interesting that the cancers which the breath test HAVE found all have&#xD;
      the same breath test signal, regardless of size. This means even smaller cancers may have the&#xD;
      same signal. These small cancers are only 1-2 mm thick, and when found at this size almost&#xD;
      all can be cured. We want to find a group of patients who have these early cancers and&#xD;
      compare it to breath test result in patients who have large obvious cancers. These patients&#xD;
      will be compared to other patients who have are negative for larynx cancer who also have a&#xD;
      breath test. We want to prove that their breath test will be negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You have been referred either because you have symptoms (such as cough or hoarse voice) and&#xD;
      need a scope to look into the airways, OR your specialist has identified a spot on the larynx&#xD;
      which needs a biopsy (sample) and then possible treatment, The spot may or may not be cancer-&#xD;
      that is why the biopsy is needed. After that the correct treatment would be considered&#xD;
      depending on the result, that is, whether it is a cancer or not. If possible we would like to&#xD;
      take a test of your breath before the biopsy. Alternatively we can take a breath test 2 weeks&#xD;
      after a biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary this study is trying to show whether the breath test is the same in patients who&#xD;
      have large cancers as patients with small cancers invisible on XRay and only found with&#xD;
      careful magnification by scopes looking in. If we can show these findings it will demonstrate&#xD;
      great potential for the breath test to find many more cancers which are truly curable.&#xD;

      Worldwide there are 130 000 new larnx cancers diagnosed annually resulting in 82 000&#xD;
      deaths.Survival after diagnosis of larynx cancer depends on initial stage. For T3N0Mo&#xD;
      laryngeal cancers 5-year survival ranges from 59 to 66%. Patients survivals are as follows:&#xD;
      receiving either chemoradiation (59.2%), irradiation alone (42.7%) ,patients after surgery&#xD;
      with irradiation (65.2%) and surgery alone (63.3%) By contrast in early stage larynx cancer&#xD;
      survivals range from 90-100%. Tamura et al reported therapeutic outcomes of 130 cases with&#xD;
      laryngeal cancer treated at Kyoto University Hospital between 1995 and 2004[3] In all, 121&#xD;
      males and 9 females were involved. Their ages ranged from 40 years to 92 years (average 66&#xD;
      years). All tumors were squamous cell carcinoma - arising at the glottis in 111 cases, the&#xD;
      supraglottis in 18, and the subglottis in 1 case. Most glottic cancers (77.5%) were&#xD;
      classified as stage I or II, while most supraglottic cancers (77.8%) were at stage III or IV.&#xD;
      Stage I/II cancers were basically treated by conventional radiotherapy (60-66 Gy) and&#xD;
      twice-daily hyperfractionated radiotherapy (70-74 Gy), respectively, attempting to preserve&#xD;
      the larynx. Total laryngectomy with neck dissection was performed in the treatment of stage&#xD;
      III/IV cases. Five-year disease-specific survival rates were 100%, 96%, 100%, and 68% for&#xD;
      stage I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Five-year laryngeal preservation rates were 98%,&#xD;
      100%, 86%, 0%, and 0% for T1a, T1b, T2, T3, and T4 of glottic cancer, respectively. Local&#xD;
      recurrence occurred in five cases of stage I/II glottic cancer, which was successfully&#xD;
      salvaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chera et al reported excellent treatment outcomes of definitive radiotherapy (RT) for&#xD;
      early-stage squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the glottic larynx. Endoscopic laser resection&#xD;
      can also have an excellent outcome in early stage larynx cancer. Schrivers et al [5]reported&#xD;
      survival analysis on 100 patients with T1a glottic carcinoma treated with CO(2) laser surgery&#xD;
      (n = 49) or radiotherapy (n = 51). No significant differences in local control and overall&#xD;
      survival were found. Ultimate 5-year laryngeal preservation was significantly better in the&#xD;
      CO(2) laser surgery group (95% vs 77%, p = .043).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volatile organic compound (VOC) breath testing in cancer detection The concept for VOC&#xD;
      testing is that VOCs, mostly alkanes and aromatic compounds, are preferentially produced and&#xD;
      exhaled by cancer patients and can be used as accurate markers of malignancy. As early as&#xD;
      1971, testing on normal breath identified more than 100 volatile organic compounds In the&#xD;
      1980s Gordon and Preti used mass spectroscopy and gas chromatography to identify specific&#xD;
      alterations in the profile of volatile organic compounds in the breath of lung cancer&#xD;
      patients[16]. In two papers in 1999 and 2003, Phillips further refined this original data to&#xD;
      identify a group of 9 volatile organic compounds which were highly sensitive and specific for&#xD;
      the presence of lung cancer . The concentration of these alkane and methylalkane oxidative&#xD;
      stress products was reduced in the breath of lung cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional studies have investigated exhaled biomarkers as a function of disease, both&#xD;
      as biomarkers of disease state and as predictive markers. In cross-sectional studies, a&#xD;
      control group is compared with a patient or diseased group, and breath markers are analyzed&#xD;
      to identify qualitative or quantitative differences between the two groups. Phillips and&#xD;
      coworkers [14] investigated alveolar gradients (i.e., the abundance in breath minus the&#xD;
      abundance in room air) of C4 to C20 alkanes and monomethylated alkanes in the breath as tumor&#xD;
      markers in primary lung cancer. They concluded that a breath test for C4 to C20 alkanes and&#xD;
      monomethylated alkanes provided a rational new set of markers that identified lung cancer in&#xD;
      a group of patients with histologically confirmed disease. The analytical methodology was&#xD;
      described in 2003 , where it was reported that amongst smokers and ex-smokers there was a&#xD;
      sensitivity for malignancy of 86% (55/64) and a specificity of 83% (19/23). This compared&#xD;
      with sensitivity and specificity in non smokers of 66% (2/3) and 78% (14/18). Overall&#xD;
      therefore the VOC breath test was not affected by smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in breath VOC patterns are independent of the size of the lung cancer in that T1&#xD;
      tumours (&lt;3cm) have a similar breath pattern of abnormality to T4 tumours, raising the&#xD;
      possibility that VOC abnormalities may even be detectable at the preneoplastic (severe&#xD;
      dysplasia or carcinoma in situ) stage. It describes a comparison between 212 controls without&#xD;
      lung cancer and 195 patients with primary lung cancer. The breath test was as likely to be&#xD;
      abnormal in stage 1 disease as in stage 4 disease. This implies firstly that as a screening&#xD;
      tool VOC breath testing has potential to detect operative curable cases. Secondly, it implies&#xD;
      that oxidative changes leading to altered breath VOCs are an early feature of lung cancer&#xD;
      development, and that the method may therefore detect the presence of preneoplastic lesions&#xD;
      in the bronchial tree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breath testing in Laryngeal cancer In a recent article Hakim et al [24]described for the&#xD;
      first time that Head and Neck cancer can be identified by breath testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alveolar breath was collected from 87 volunteers (HNC and LC patients and healthy controls)&#xD;
      in a cross-sectional clinical trial. The discriminative power of a tailor-made Nanoscale&#xD;
      Artificial Nose (NA-NOSE) based on an array of five gold nanoparticle sensors was tested,&#xD;
      using 62 breath samples. The NA-NOSE signals were analysed to detect statistically&#xD;
      significant differences between the sub-populations using (i) principal component analysis&#xD;
      with ANOVA and Student's t-test and (ii) support vector machines and cross-validation. The&#xD;
      results showed breath testing could clearly distinguish between (i) HNC patients and healthy&#xD;
      controls, (ii) LC patients and healthy controls, and (iii) HNC and LC patients. The GC-MS&#xD;
      analysis showed statistically significant differences in the chemical composition of the&#xD;
      breath of the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cyranose / Enose VOC testing with the eNose allows groups of patients to be tested for&#xD;
      differences or similarities of breath signal . A single expired breath is collected in a&#xD;
      sample bag then a pump draws the sample into the device where it passes over 32 electronic&#xD;
      sensors. Over 400 possible chemicals affect these sensors in different ways, ad a pattern of&#xD;
      electronic signals is generated. It is the distribution of the electric signals across the 32&#xD;
      sensors which gives the pattern. Software within the device determines which of the 32&#xD;
      sensors is giving the strongest signal in each test, and uses these sensor results in a&#xD;
      combination result called a factor. This is known as Principal Component analysis. When&#xD;
      comparing 3 groups of patients the software will generate 2 factors for each breath sample&#xD;
      and plot these on a graph. Where a group of patients has a distinctive signal the factor&#xD;
      analysis will clump that group together, at a certain &quot;distance&quot; on the graph from the other&#xD;
      group. The greater the distance t(Mahalobinus distance) the more different the groups are.&#xD;
      Numerous authors have published data on this type of analysis for a variety of disease&#xD;
      states, particularly lung cancer. This approach is very easy technically and leads to further&#xD;
      study of the individual VOCs which are responsible for the signal. It is likely however based&#xD;
      on results from other tumours that a combination of VOCs are present in different amounts in&#xD;
      cancer patients as opposed to a single VOC. The ENose approach has not been applied in Head&#xD;
      and Neck cancer patients and nor has there been any report of detection of in situ cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the step wise development of squamous cell cancer it is quite possible that In&#xD;
      situ cases would be clumped together with advanced cases of Squamous cell carcinoma, and that&#xD;
      both would be different to smoking controls. Alternatively it may be the signal in the early&#xD;
      cases is different from later stages but different from controls as well, so that both early&#xD;
      and advanced cases could be diagnosed from breath testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that both CT and VOC breath test can detect stage 1 cancer of the lung which has&#xD;
      at least a 50% cure rate. There is potential however that VOC can detect even earlier stages&#xD;
      of lung cancer, such as in-situ-carcinoma which when properly staged and treated has over 95%&#xD;
      long term cure rate. It is possible that VOC testing will ultimately be used in larynx cancer&#xD;
      screening either as the first step (high negative predictive value) or as a second line test&#xD;
      to further evaluate equivocal results of screening low dose CT chest. Also, we have expertise&#xD;
      in NBI and fluorescence bronchoscopy and our focus is on the management of the type of early&#xD;
      lesions found by this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Breath testing will be done using the Cyranose ENose in Thoracic Medicine Established&#xD;
      protocol for testing from Lung Cancer study, x 2 single expirations into a collection bag&#xD;
      Ideally this would be best done when a lesion has been seen by ENT surgeon but BEFORE it is&#xD;
      biopsied (to avoid confounding effects on VOCs of tissue disruption by the biopsy) The ENose&#xD;
      software allows comparisons of 3 groups of 10 subjects each - 10 Tis/T1, 10 advanced Larynx&#xD;
      Ca, 10 smoking controls with demonstrated normal ENT and tracheobronchial tree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would have a routine panendoscopy before treatment with NBI to exclude concommittant&#xD;
      second primary disease either in head and neck or Bronchial tree&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Significance Proof of principal of screening detecting highly treatable lesions&#xD;
      Supportive data for similar tumours, particularly Squamous cell carcinoma of the bronchus,&#xD;
      viz the benefits of early detection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures All will be done in the Thoracic Mediine department Breath test sampling for VOCs:&#xD;
      A portable breath collection apparatus will capture VOCs in a slow vital capacity exhalation&#xD;
      breath sample , using Standard Operation Procedure process already in place. Two samples are&#xD;
      taken, with the patient breathing gently on a mouthpiece with a nose clip on for 5 minutes&#xD;
      each time. Patients should be&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nil by mouth&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. No smoking for 12 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. No alcohol for &gt;24 hours Breath will be processed by 1. The Enose and 2. Gas&#xD;
           chromatography/Mass spectroscopy&#xD;
