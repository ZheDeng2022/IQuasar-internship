  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is currently estimated that above 50% of new cancer cases are diagnosed in the elderly&#xD;
      population[1]. With the increased life expectancy in the industrialised countries, the&#xD;
      incidence of head and neck cancers has significantly increased in the last decade with rates&#xD;
      estimated between 24-40% in patients over 70 years old [2-4]. It is estimated that with the&#xD;
      improvement in quality of life and treatment modulation, the incidence will continue to rise&#xD;
      in the coming years. Because the current available prospective studies often exclude patients&#xD;
      above 65 or 70 years old, the data and guidelines on head and neck treatment for these&#xD;
      patients population remain limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of elderly patients with advanced stage III-IV oropharyngeal squamous carcinoma&#xD;
      with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using RapidArc® or Helical Tomotherapy® at a&#xD;
      dose of 70 Gy in 33 fractions to the PTV (GTV) and 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions to the first&#xD;
      disease-free lymphatic relay bilaterally as well as a combination Cisplatin chemotherapy at a&#xD;
      reduced dose.&#xD;

    <description>Obtain a locoregional control that is similar to historical data, therefore above 90%, while decreasing toxicity rates related to treatment in an elderly population at risk. We aim to recruit 10 patients for a confidence interval of 72 to 96% on the locoregional control rate. Kaplan-Meier curves will be obtained to calculate the locoregional control rate for these patients. Analysis will be conducted after each group of 5 patients. If a recurrence is document in 1 patient or more outside the CTV in each 5 patients group, the study will be interrupted.</description>
