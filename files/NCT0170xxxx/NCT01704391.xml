  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open elective abdominal aortic surgery is a high risk procedure involving clamping of the&#xD;
      aorta. Indications include abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) or aortic occlusive disease (AOD)&#xD;
      causing lower limb ischaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients are often regarded as one entity in postoperative study settings. However,&#xD;
      previous studies indicate that risk profiles, inflammatory activity, and haemodynamic&#xD;
      capacity may differ between these groups. The first aim of this study was to evaluate&#xD;
      postoperative ICU-requirements after open elective abdominal aortic surgery, hypothesising&#xD;
      that AAA-patients had longer ICU-stays and needed more mechanical ventilation or acute&#xD;
      dialysis than did patients with AOD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators see a relatively high incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI)&#xD;
      following aortic surgery. Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalcin (NGAL) may be useful in&#xD;
      the early diagnosis of postopeative AKI. However, NGAL is also known as a marker of&#xD;
      inflammatory activation. The ischaemia-reperfusion injury and subsequent inflammatory&#xD;
      response to aortic cross clamping may per se induce a rise in NGAL despite intact renal&#xD;
      function. Therefore NGAL may not be a reliable marker of AKI after AAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim of this study is to describe the changes in NGAL after AAS in patients with&#xD;
      and without postoperative dialysis-dependent AKI.&#xD;
