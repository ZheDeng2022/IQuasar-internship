    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetic and activity profiles of&#xD;
      the ch14.18 antibody produced in cells of hamster origin (ch14.18/CHO).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anti-ganglioside GD2 antibody ch14.18 is a monoclonal antibody specifically recognizing the&#xD;
      target antigen GD2, which is expressed on virtually all neuroblastoma tumours. This antibody&#xD;
      is a chimeric protein and consists to 30% of mouse variable light and heavy chain and to 70%&#xD;
      of human constant heavy and light chain. Ch 14.18 has already been tested in stage 4&#xD;
      neuroblastoma patients in phase I/II clinical trials with encouraging response rates.&#xD;
      Therefore, the European SIOP neuroblastoma group designed a Phase III protocol to test the&#xD;
      efficacy of ch14.18 immunotherapy in a randomised trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the ch14.18 antibody for this Phase III trial was recloned and produced in Chinese&#xD;
      hamster ovary (CHO) cells in contrast to ch14.18 antibody used for previous clinical trials,&#xD;
      which was produced in murine, non-secreting myeloma cells (SP2/0). Although the antibody-gene&#xD;
      transfer into CHO and SP2/0 was done with exactly the same plasmid assuring an identical&#xD;
      protein sequence, changes in the glycosylation of the final protein product may occur since&#xD;
      the glycosylation pattern varies between different production cell lines. Glycosylation is&#xD;
      important for the immunological effector function of the antibody and the pharmacokinetics in&#xD;
      patients. Therefore, this change is considered to be a major change in production requiring&#xD;
      the reassessment of the new product in a Phase I clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is the re-evaluation of toxicity of the new ch14.18/CHO&#xD;
      antibody. This is ultimately followed by the secondary objectives including the determination&#xD;
      of pharmacokinetics and immunostimulation in patients receiving ch14.18/CHO therapy. This&#xD;
      involves particularly the determination of activation of immune effector cells and complement&#xD;
      during and after application of ch14.18/CHO. Subsequently, we will evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      effect of this treatment on the course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nature of this phase I trial is a bridging study for a medicinal product subjected to a&#xD;
      major change in production according to the guidelines provided by the &quot;Committee for&#xD;
      Proprietary Medicinal Products&quot; (CPMP) of the &quot;European Agency for the Evaluation of&#xD;
      Medicinal Products (EMEA) (Document Number CPMP/BWP/3207/00).&#xD;

    <description>A dose escalation design based on Phase I rules starting at 10 mg/m2/day ch14.18/CHO. This is 50% below the dose of ch14.18/SP2/0 used in a large cohort of patients. Dose escalation will be adapted to a modified Fibonacci series aiming at 10, 20 and 30 mg/m2 of ch14.18/CHO. Since this study is a bridging study aiming at a reassessment of the toxicity and determination of the pharmacokinetics of ch14.18/CHO, only a limited number of dose escalation steps (3) is implemented in the design.</description>
