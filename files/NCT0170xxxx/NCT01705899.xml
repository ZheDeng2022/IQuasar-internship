      Islet transplantation can provide physiologic insulin replacement to patients with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes without the complications associated with whole pancreas transplantation. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to achieve insulin-independence in patients with type 1 diabetes,&#xD;
      thereby eliminating the need for exogenous insulin injections to maintain normal glucose&#xD;
      levels, ameliorating severe hypoglycemia and potentially decreasing the development of&#xD;
      diabetes-related complications. This study will investigate islet transplantation in subjects&#xD;
      who have preserved renal function and subjects who have undergone cadaveric renal&#xD;
      transplantation, since the latter subjects are already on immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, prospective trial of islet transplantation in subjects receiving&#xD;
      islets alone or islets after kidney transplant. This is a phase I study investigating the use&#xD;
      of islet transplantation for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Subjects will be eligible for&#xD;
      an islet transplant if they meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria outlined in the protocol. In brief, the aims of this study are to establish an islet&#xD;
      transplant program at the Ohio State University, determine the safety of islet&#xD;
      transplantation in islet alone and kidney transplant recipients, determine whether islet&#xD;
      transplantation will reduce the frequency of severe hypoglycemic events, determine whether a&#xD;
      novel steroid-free immunosuppressive protocol will prevent rejection in islet transplants and&#xD;
      to achieve insulin independence at one year after the final islet transplant.&#xD;

      Hypothesis - Insulin independence (insulin injections no longer needed) will be achieved in&#xD;
      subjects with type 1 diabetes receiving islet transplantation using the immunosuppressive&#xD;
      regimen of cyclosporine and sirolimus. Amelioration of severe hypoglycemia will also be&#xD;
      achieved in these groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety of islet transplantation in islet alone and in kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients. Safety analyses include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence, timing and severity of adverse events and their relationship to the&#xD;
           transplant protocol, islet infusion and immunosuppressive medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion without protocol-related serious adverse events (SAE) at 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence, type and severity of infectious complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence and severity of procedural-related events, such as bleeding and portal vein&#xD;
           thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence and severity of liver function test elevations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence and severity of hypoglycemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence and severity of creatinine clearance and urine microalbumin changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence and severity of lipid abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of those who develop donor-specific alloantibody&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy of islet transplantation in islet alone and in kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients. Efficacy analyses include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to insulin independence, defined as freedom from insulin use (insulin injections&#xD;
           not needed) for 14 or more consecutive days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of those that achieve insulin independence at any time during the first year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of those one year after final transplant who have:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Positive C-peptide (≥0.3 ng/ml after stimulation)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Full function of their graft&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Partial function of their graft&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Marginal function of their graft&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mixed meal stimulated C-peptide &gt;1.0 ng/ml at 6, and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of those that have an acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg) &gt;20uU/ml&#xD;
           during frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of those with blood glucose level &lt;140 mg/dl two hours after oral glucose&#xD;
           tolerance test (OGTT) at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of those that have improved QOL at 6 and 12 months compared with baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of those that have improved hypoglycemia and glycemic lability scores at 6&#xD;
           and 12 months compared with baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of full islet function:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin independence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A1C ≤ 6.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of severe hypoglycemic episodes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting glucose ≥140 mg/dl less than 3 times a week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-prandial glucose (2 hours) &gt;180 mg/dl less than 4 times a week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of partial islet function:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin requirement less than 50% of pre-transplant insulin requirement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C-peptide positive (≥0.3 ng/ml after stimulation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A1C ≤ 6.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No severe hypoglycemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of marginal islet function:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C-peptide positive (≥0.3 ng/ml after stimulation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A1C ≤ 7.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No severe hypoglycemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will have two study groups consisting of N=10 subjects with type 1 diabetes. One&#xD;
      group (IA) will include subjects with preserved kidney function. A second group (IAK) will&#xD;
      include subjects with renal failure secondary to diabetes who have received a prior kidney&#xD;
      transplant at least 6 months previously and have stable renal function on a steroid-free&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential study participants will be recruited from the Endocrinology and Transplant clinics&#xD;
      at the Ohio State University, and community physician referrals. Those who are potentially&#xD;
      eligible will undergo a screening evaluation after review of the medical records. If the&#xD;
      subject remains eligible, he/she will be enrolled in the islet transplant study and will be&#xD;
      placed on a waiting list for an islet transplant. Once a transplant becomes available, the&#xD;
      subject will be admitted to the hospital to undergo the transplant procedure. Frequent&#xD;
      follow-up visits in the transplant clinic will occur throughout the following year after the&#xD;
      transplant. Subjects will be closely monitored for adverse events and insulin requirements.&#xD;
      If the subject does not achieve insulin independence, he/she may be eligible for a subsequent&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a 10-year enrollment with 12-month follow-up after last transplant. Since&#xD;
      subjects may be eligible for a subsequent transplant within 18 months of the first&#xD;
      transplant, the total duration may be up to 30 months after the first transplant in some&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be completed one year after the last islet transplant. Subjects who have&#xD;
      undergone the islet transplant procedure and have completed the post-transplant evaluations&#xD;
      one year after their last transplant will be considered to have completed the study.&#xD;
