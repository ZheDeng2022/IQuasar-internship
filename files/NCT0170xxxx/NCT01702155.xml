      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of DFP-10917 given via&#xD;
      continuous 7 or 14 day infusion to patients with acute leukemias (AML or ALL).&#xD;

      This study will determine the safety and efficacy of DFP-10917 in patients with AML or ALL.&#xD;
      The Phase I dose-escalation portion of the study will determine the highest tolerable dose&#xD;
      and regimen (7 or 14 day continuous infusion) based on safety data in patients with&#xD;
      refractory or relapsed AML or ALL. The phase II portion will investigate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of DFP-10917, at the dose and regimen to be determined in the Phase I portion, in&#xD;
      patients with refractory or relapsed AML.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have pathologically-confirmed acute leukemia, refractory or relapsed&#xD;
             after standard therapy for the disease or for which conventional systemic chemotherapy&#xD;
             is not reliably effective or no effective therapy is available Phase II Only: Patient&#xD;
             must have histologically or pathologically confirmed diagnosis of AML based on WHO&#xD;
             classification that is refractory after standard therapy, or for which conventional&#xD;
             systemic chemotherapy is not reliably effective, or no effective therapy is available.&#xD;
             Patients aged 60 years or older with newly diagnosed AML who are not eligible for, or&#xD;
             who refuse, standard care are also eligible.&#xD;

          4. Adequate clinical laboratory values (i.e., plasma creatinine &lt;= 1.5 x upper limit of&#xD;
             normal (ULN) for the institution, bilirubin &lt;=1.5 x ULN, alanine transaminase (ALT)&#xD;
             and aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt;= 2.5 x ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Absence of CNS involvement by leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Absence of uncontrolled intercurrent illnesses, including uncontrolled infections,&#xD;
             cardiac conditions, or other organ dysfunctions.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The interval from prior treatment to time of study drug administration is &lt; 2 weeks&#xD;
             for cytotoxic agents or &lt; 5 half-lives for noncytotoxic agents. Exceptions: Use of&#xD;
