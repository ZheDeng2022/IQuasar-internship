    <textblock>
      Over the last decades different life style factors have been established as risk factors for&#xD;
      various diseases. The obesity pandemic displays a good example of a disease where great&#xD;
      effort is undertaken to characterize risk factors associated with obesity (1). Smoking is&#xD;
      another life style risk factor established since several decades, and where primary&#xD;
      prevention has been increasingly successful (2, 3). Cardiovascular epidemiologic research at&#xD;
      the University of Gothenburg recognized PA as a factor of importance early on and thus&#xD;
      included PA related questions in the work up of studies with large cohorts (4-6). A 4-level&#xD;
      scale was introduced in the late 1960:s by Saltin and Grimby (7) and has been used&#xD;
      extensively since then. With this background it is of interest to record physical activity&#xD;
      one year and one month prior to certain types of elective surgery and to study the&#xD;
      relationship of PA to surgical complications and recovery is of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether a higher physical activity prior to a&#xD;
      surgical procedure reduces hospital stay, sick leave and the complication rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim is to investigate the effect of preoperative physical activity on the rate of&#xD;
      resumption of QoL and normal physical function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity (PA) has been in focus over the last two decades as a life style factor of&#xD;
      importance. A review summarizing nearly 170 studies states that the scientific evidence for&#xD;
      the association between lack of physical activity and cancer is convincing regarding breast&#xD;
      and colon cancer and probable for prostate cancer and possible for lung and endometrial&#xD;
      cancer (8). Regarding postoperative rehabilitation the benefits from preoperative physical&#xD;
      exercise together with a postoperative early rehabilitation schedule has been reported for&#xD;
      spinal surgery (9). In colorectal surgery the benefits of enhanced recovery programs have&#xD;
      been clearly demonstrated (10). The impact of preoperative prehabilitation has been evaluated&#xD;
      and seems beneficial (11, 12), however most studies have not used clinically important&#xD;
      outcome measures such as complications or postoperative morbidity. The evidence for&#xD;
      prehabilitation as a measure to reduce postoperative morbidity is scarce (12). To evaluate&#xD;
      the recovery after a surgical procedure in a broader sense is difficult. Several scales have&#xD;
      been tried to assess recovery (13-16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The simple instrument for self-reported PA introduced by Saltin and Grimby has been shown to&#xD;
      discriminate between sedentary and active counterparts regarding maximum oxygen uptake (17)&#xD;
      and has been validated against biological measures (18). Indeed, studies have indicated that&#xD;
      such single self-reported approximation of the level of PA, may predict risk for morbidity&#xD;
      and cardiovascular as well as total mortality (19-21). The self-assessed PA-level concurs&#xD;
      well with the actual physical fitness of the individual (22-24). This is also important,&#xD;
      since cardiorespiratory fitness may also predict cardiovascular risk and mortality (25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are also studies indicating that other life-style factors such as alcohol consumption&#xD;
      has a negative impact on outcome after surgery as well as outcome after health-care&#xD;
      associated infections (26, 27). To screen for excessive alcohol consumption the Alcohol Use&#xD;
      Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT) test has been used. Several recent studies&#xD;
      have indicated that a shorter survey with the top three questions in the AUDIT questionnaire&#xD;
      (AUDIT-C) is sufficient to provide information on alcohol use (28, 29).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking is also a life-style factor that affects surgical outcome (30). It has been shown to&#xD;
      increase the risk for complications and studies indicate that smoking cessation prior to the&#xD;
      surgical procedure to reduce the risk for complications (31). Self-reported assessment of&#xD;
      smoking seems to be accurate and reflect the actual nicotine use of the individual (32).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of hospital stay is of importance both to patients and the society. A surgical&#xD;
      procedure that shortens hospital stay may be cost-effective even in cases with higher&#xD;
      operation room costs (33). It is also of importance to consider time to work/sick leave; a&#xD;
      cost for patients and society that can affect the cost analysis of a surgical procedure (34).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether a higher physical activity prior to a&#xD;
      surgical procedure reduces hospital stay, sick leave and the complication rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim is to investigate the effect of preoperative physical activity on the rate of&#xD;
      resumption of QoL and normal physical function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to explore the importance of PA for the outcome after a surgical procedure due to&#xD;
      gallbladder disease, breast cancer and colorectal cancer we will ask all patients operated&#xD;
      for any of the three above mentioned conditions to answer a short questionnaire (Appendix I)&#xD;
      including the Saltin and Grimby (7) questions to study of the effects of the level of PA&#xD;
      immediately before surgical operations. The patients will be asked to estimate their physical&#xD;
      activity four weeks prior to the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mostly sedentary&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Light PA (such as gardening or walking or bicycling to work) at least two hours a week&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Moderate PA such as aerobics, dancing, swimming, playing football or heavy gardening) at&#xD;
           least two hours a week&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Vigorous PA (high intensity) at least five hours daily several times a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will also be asked to report weight, length, smoking habits, alcohol consumption,&#xD;
      socioeconomic situation, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and BMI as well as certain&#xD;
      questions with relation to Quality of Life and their postoperative recovery (Appendix I). The&#xD;
      questions are to some extent validated through previous research (28, 29, 32, 47, 48) but&#xD;
      some questions are newly constructed. The new questions have been constructed by an expert&#xD;
      panel consisting of colorectal and general surgeons, cardiologist and specialized nurses. The&#xD;
      domains chosen have been related to previous research regarding recovery (42). The&#xD;
      questionnaire has been face-to face validated by patients with gall bladder surgery planned&#xD;
      or a previous cholecystectomy performed, patients with breast cancer both prior and after&#xD;
      surgery and colorectal cancer patients prior and after surgery using the same validation&#xD;
      methods previously described for prostate cancer (48).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be contacted by telephone and a subsequently receive a mailed questionnaire&#xD;
      (similar to the pre-operative questionnaire) (Appendix II) regarding their self-assessed QoL&#xD;
      post-operatively and postoperative recovery, the timing of this will be related to the&#xD;
      estimated time for recovery as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 weeks after gallbladder surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 and 6 weeks after surgery for breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 and 6 weeks after surgery for colorectal cancer&#xD;
