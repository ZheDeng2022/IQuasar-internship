      The purpose of this post market clinical investigation is to further evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      performance of the EnligHTN™ Renal Denervation System in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      uncontrolled hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a post market, prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, single arm study of the&#xD;
      EnligHTN™ Renal Denervation System. Approximately 500 subjects with uncontrolled hypertension&#xD;
      will undergo renal artery ablation at approximately 40 investigational sites located&#xD;
      internationally and will be followed up to five years post procedure.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 276 subjects who underwent renal artery ablation fell into the analysis population of three predefined arms at 33 investigational sites located throughout Europe and Australia. The enrollment began on January 2013 and the last subject was enrolled on 06 September, 2016. The patients last follow-up visit occurred on 27 November, 2019.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Among the 353 subjects who were screened initially, 66 subjects did not receive the renal artery ablation procedure, 11 subjects received procedure but did not satisfy the definition of any arm. The 11 subjects who received RND procedure were followed up for exploratory analysis and considered as &quot;unassigned arm&quot;. Of these subjects, 5 subjects completed the study, 6 subjects were withdrawn prior to study completion. Hence they were excluded during the endpoint and safety analyses.</pre_assignment_details>

      <population>Among the 353 subjects who were screened initially, 66 subjects did not receive the renal artery ablation procedure, 11 subjects received procedure but did not satisfy the definition of any arm. The 11 subjects who received RND procedure were followed up for exploratory analysis and considered as &quot;unassigned arm&quot;. Of these subjects, 5 subjects completed the study, 6 subjects were withdrawn prior to study completion. Hence they were excluded during the endpoint and safety analyses.</population>

In the 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, the blood pressure of patient was measured every 30 minutes during the daytime and every 60 minutes during the night time. When using ABP, it was ensured that at least two measurements per hour are taken during the person's usual waking hours and 1 measurement per hour are taken during the person's usual night time hours. The average value of at least 14 measurements taken during the person's usual waking hours and average of at least 8 measurements taken during the person's usual sleeping hours were used for calculation of mean value.</description>

        <description>24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure measurements were taken according to Standard Joint National Committee VII Guidelines / ESC and ESH Guidelines at each follow-up visit. In the 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, the blood pressure of patient was measured every 30 minutes during the daytime and every 60 minutes during the night time. When using ABP, it was ensured that at least two measurements per hour are taken during the person's usual waking hours and 1 measurement per hour are taken during the person's usual night time hours. The average value of at least 14 measurements taken during the person's usual waking hours and average of at least 8 measurements taken during the person's usual sleeping hours were used for calculation of mean value.</description>

        <description>24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure measurements were taken according to Standard Joint National Committee VII Guidelines / ESC and ESH Guidelines at each follow-up visit. In the 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, the blood pressure of patient was measured every 30 minutes during the daytime and every 60 minutes during the night time. When using ABP, it was ensured that at least two measurements per hour are taken during the person's usual waking hours and 1 measurement per hour are taken during the person's usual night time hours. The average value of at least 14 measurements taken during the person's usual waking hours and average of at least 8 measurements taken during the person's usual sleeping hours were used for calculation of mean value.</description>

          <description>24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure measurements were taken according to Standard Joint National Committee VII Guidelines / ESC and ESH Guidelines at each follow-up visit. In the 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, the blood pressure of patient was measured every 30 minutes during the daytime and every 60 minutes during the night time. When using ABP, it was ensured that at least two measurements per hour are taken during the person's usual waking hours and 1 measurement per hour are taken during the person's usual night time hours. The average value of at least 14 measurements taken during the person's usual waking hours and average of at least 8 measurements taken during the person's usual sleeping hours were used for calculation of mean value.</description>

          <title>Mean Change in Ambulatory Systolic Blood Pressure From Baseline to 4 Years Post Denervation</title>
          <description>24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure measurements were taken according to Standard Joint National Committee VII Guidelines / ESC and ESH Guidelines at each follow-up visit. In the 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, the blood pressure of patient was measured every 30 minutes during the daytime and every 60 minutes during the night time. When using ABP, it was ensured that at least two measurements per hour are taken during the person's usual waking hours and 1 measurement per hour are taken during the person's usual night time hours. The average value of at least 14 measurements taken during the person's usual waking hours and average of at least 8 measurements taken during the person's usual sleeping hours were used for calculation of mean value.</description>

In the 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, the blood pressure of patient was measured every 30 minutes during the daytime and every 60 minutes during the night time. When using ABP, it was ensured that at least two measurements per hour are taken during the person's usual waking hours and 1 measurement per hour are taken during the person's usual night time hours. The average value of at least 14 measurements taken during the person's usual waking hours and average of at least 8 measurements taken during the person's usual sleeping hours were used for calculation of mean value.</description>

      <desc>Among the 353 subjects who were screened initially, 66 subjects did not receive the renal artery ablation procedure, 11 subjects received procedure but did not satisfy the definition of any arm. The 11 subjects who received RND procedure were followed up for exploratory analysis and considered as &quot;unassigned arm&quot;. Of these subjects, 5 subjects completed the study, 6 subjects were withdrawn prior to study completion. Hence they were excluded during the endpoint and safety analyses.</desc>
