  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men in Canada. Over 30% of men over&#xD;
      the age of fifty have histological evidence of prostate cancer on biopsy. Despite the stage&#xD;
      migration afforded by early detection with serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing and&#xD;
      an apparent trend toward improved survival over the past several years, prostate cancer&#xD;
      remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Biochemical failure after primary&#xD;
      therapy (surgery or radiation) remains a significant health care burden and strategies to&#xD;
      delay clinical prostate cancer progression and prolong the interval from treatment failure to&#xD;
      systemic therapy would be of significant clinical benefit for those men suffering from a&#xD;
      finding of PSA recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSA is widely accepted as the most useful prognostic marker of prostate cancer progression,&#xD;
      particularly after primary therapy with radical surgery or radiation. 5 Despite improved&#xD;
      cancer control rates with definitive management of early stage prostate cancer, a PSA&#xD;
      recurrence is unfortunately a common occurrence (25-50%) in most large case series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microenvironmental factors have been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in the selection of&#xD;
      neoplastic cell subpopulations expressing more malignant phenotypes and contributing to the&#xD;
      progression of localized and metastatic disease. Very low levels of O2 (&lt; 10 mmHg) has been&#xD;
      well described in many solid tumours (including prostate cancer) and the extent of hypoxia&#xD;
      has been demonstrated to represent an independent marker of a poor prognosis for patients&#xD;
      with various types of cancers. Tumour hypoxia contributes to numerous adaptive phenotypes&#xD;
      including increased invasion and metastasis, as well as evasion of immune cell surveillance&#xD;
      increased resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Although cellular adaptive responses&#xD;
      to hypoxia are likely mediated by various mechanisms, our previous preclinical studies&#xD;
      suggest that decreased nitric oxide (NO)-dependent signalling plays a significant role in&#xD;
      this progression of a malignant phenotype.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Researcher's pre-clinical research has demonstrated that hypoxia-induced tumor cell&#xD;
      invasiveness, metastatic ability, resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and evasion of immune&#xD;
      cell recognition are inhibited by molecules that activate the NO signalling pathway involving&#xD;
      cGMP generation (such as glyceryl trinitrate, GTN), and that pharmacological inhibition of NO&#xD;
      signalling results in phenotypes similar to those induced by exposure to hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on pre-clinical data described above the researchers have recently completed and&#xD;
      published a phase 2 trial in patients with recurrent prostate cancer using a low-dose,&#xD;
      sustained release trasndermal patch of GTN. The GTN was supplied as Minitran™ (nitroglycerin)&#xD;
      transdermal delivery system (3M Company, St. Paul, Minnesota) in an open label, non-blinded&#xD;
      fashion. GTN is a nitrodonor that has been used in the management of angina for over 100&#xD;
      years with a well-documented safety and tolerability record and has never been associated&#xD;
      with carcinogenesis. Their pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that very low molar&#xD;
      concentrations of nitric oxide donors are required to attenuate hypoxia-induced malignant&#xD;
      phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our results suggest a significant inhibition of progressive disease given the effect on PSA&#xD;
      doubling time with GTN treatment compared to their doubling time prior to initiating the&#xD;
      trial. Within 12 months of the trial, 17 of 24 patients had doubling times in the slow&#xD;
      category or even stable/declining PSA levels. The mean doubling time of the entire cohort&#xD;
      increased to 31.8 months from 13.2 months prior to starting treatment. When compared to a&#xD;
      matched control group of patients with PSA recurrence that did not receive any treatment, a&#xD;
      similar significant difference in PSA doubling time was observed. There were no adverse&#xD;
      effects reported in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was the first report of the clinical use of nitric oxide donors in the treatment of&#xD;
      prostate cancer. The role of nitric oxide in malignant progression has been a subject of&#xD;
      controversy, with studies showing either tumor-promoting or tumor-inhibitory roles. These&#xD;
      apparently contradictory effects of NO may be explained by the fact that this molecule can&#xD;
      regulate phenotypes through a variety of mechanisms depending on local concentrations and the&#xD;
      redox state of the cell. Based on our previous findings, the investigators propose that the&#xD;
      observed effect of GTN on the PSA of this patient cohort is related to the 'low&#xD;
      concentration' effects of NO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have identified several possible beneficial mechanisms of effect of&#xD;
      low-dose NO donors for cancer management. We have recently published the positive effect of&#xD;
      effect of NO signalling (with GTN as the effector molecule) on cancer immune surveillance.&#xD;
      The major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related (MIC) molecules, MICA and MICB,&#xD;
      play important roles in tumor surveillance by NK cells, lymphokine-activated killer (LAK)&#xD;
      cells, and cytotoxic T cells. While MICA is absent from most normal tissues, they can be&#xD;
      induced by cellular stresses, such as exposure to carcinogens and infection, and are&#xD;
      expressed in a broad range of carcinomas and some haematopoietic malignancies. In humans, the&#xD;
      interaction of cell surface MIC molecules with the C-type lectin-like NKG2D receptor on NK,&#xD;
      LAK and effector T cells leads to the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses with&#xD;
      the subsequent lysis of the tumor cells. Thus, it has been proposed that MIC-NKG2D&#xD;
      interactions are critical to the immune surveillance function of NK, LAK and cytotoxic T&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have shown that hypoxia contributes to tumor cell shedding of MIC through a&#xD;
      mechanism involving impaired nitric oxide (NO) signalling. While hypoxia increased MIC&#xD;
      shedding in human prostate cancer cells, activation of NO signalling inhibited&#xD;
      hypoxia-mediated MIC shedding. Similar to incubation in hypoxia, pharmacological inhibition&#xD;
      of endogenous NO signalling increased MIC shedding. These findings suggest that the hypoxic&#xD;
      tumor microenvironment contributes to impaired immune surveillance and that activation of NO&#xD;
      signalling is of potential use in cancer immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies it is investigator's hypothesis that low-dose transdermal GTN will&#xD;
      have positive effects on cancer immune surveillance that may translate to therapeutic&#xD;
      benefit. In order to establish proof-of-concept, they propose to initiate the correlative&#xD;
      study described in this protocol, to determine the effect of the GTN treatment on biomarkers&#xD;
      of immune activity in patients with prostate cancer.&#xD;
