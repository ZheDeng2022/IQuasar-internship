  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicentre, observational study aims to test pre-operative platelet&#xD;
      function when taking anti-platelet medications. The investigators are using a simple bedside&#xD;
      blood test called Thromboelastography (TEG) and Platelet Mapping Assay (PMA). The&#xD;
      investigators will then follow the patient throughout their hospital stay for any major&#xD;
      cardiac complications (MACE) after surgery (peri-operative). The investigators hope to&#xD;
      determine if there is an association between how well platelets were inhibited by these drugs&#xD;
      before surgery and MACE during the perioperative period, 30 day, and one year follow-up.&#xD;
      Also, the response of various people to anti-platelet medications and their chances of&#xD;
      getting a major adverse cardiac outcome are determined by their genetic makeup. The&#xD;
      investigators will try to determine if certain genes are associated with higher cardiac risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: In patients who had percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and are undergoing&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery (NCS) major adverse cardiac events (MACE) are associated with inadequate&#xD;
      platelet inhibition.&#xD;

      Data analysis: The participants' demographics, preoperative characteristics and postoperative&#xD;
      information will be summarized using descriptive statistics: expressed as mean (standard&#xD;
      deviation) or median (minimum, maximum, interquartile range) for continuous variables and&#xD;
      number (percent) for categorical variables. We will initially use restricted cubic spline&#xD;
      plots to evaluate the nature of the association of platelet inhibition (continuous variable)&#xD;
      and the risk of MACE (logit transformation). Based upon these results, we will determine if&#xD;
      percent inhibition can be treated as a continuous variable, or whether it can be categorized&#xD;
      along specific cut-offs. We will also compare these results against a&#xD;
      receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis. Once we have determined the appropriate&#xD;
      approach for describing percent platelet inhibition, univariate analyses will be performed&#xD;
      with chi-square or Fishers' exact test for categorical data, and t-test and Mann-Whitney U&#xD;
      test for continuous data. A p &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Random&#xD;
      effect multivariable logistic regression will be used to assess the adjusted association of&#xD;
      platelet inhibition with MACE during the perioperative period.46 This regression model will&#xD;
      employ a random intercept for each center, so as to minimize the bias due to any confounding&#xD;
      by center.47 Regression models will be constructed to selectively include the potentially&#xD;
      confounding perioperative variables that are associated with a higher risk of MACE (as&#xD;
      identified from the literature and clinical experience).7-12 In addition to platelet&#xD;
      inhibition (preoperative value or change), four covariates will be included in the model:&#xD;
      type of stent; time between PCI and NCS; mono-, dual (aspirin or aspirin and clopidogrel) or&#xD;
      no therapy until the day of surgery; and urgent surgery. Since the recommended range of&#xD;
      platelet inhibition (20-50%)was never validated during the perioperative period we will&#xD;
      describe it as a continuous variable (0-100%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis will be as per protocol the secondary analysis will include patients who&#xD;
      have incomplete data i.e. discharged early or refused one or more TEG samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: The sample size estimations were based on comparison of platelet inhibition&#xD;
      (measures as a continuous variable) between individuals who did or did not suffer MACE. We&#xD;
      assumed that the difference between the MACE and non-MACE groups with regard to platelet&#xD;
      inhibition would correspond to a medium Cohen's effect size (0.5 SD; i.e. difference in means&#xD;
      equaling 0.5 of the pooled standard deviation). Based on the assumption of the medium effect&#xD;
      size difference, an expected 20% rate of MACE, a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, 90 % power, and a 10%&#xD;
      dropout rate, we would need 189 patients in total. In addition, since our planned statistical&#xD;
      model involves logistic regression with a total of five covariates (platelet inhibition&#xD;
      value; stent type; emergency surgery; time between PCI and NCS; mono-, dual or no therapy&#xD;
      after PCI [aspirin vs. aspirin and clopidogrel or no medications]) the sample size estimate&#xD;
      would still have approximately 8 events per included covariate in the regression model. To&#xD;
      minimize bias in the regression model, estimates recommend the minimum number of outcomes per&#xD;
      covariate is 5-10.&#xD;
