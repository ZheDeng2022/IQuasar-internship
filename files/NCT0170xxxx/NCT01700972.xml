  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current protocol for myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) entails imaging within 30-45&#xD;
      minutes after radiotracer injection, for both rest and stress studies. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      early imaging 10 minutes after radiotracer injection provides high image quality and&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy comparable to 30-45 minutes MPI.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The current MPI protocol entails imaging within 30-45 minutes after radiotracer injection&#xD;
      (W30 imaging), for both the rest and stress part. This delay between the radiotracer&#xD;
      injection and imaging is intended to limit the nonspecific liver and gut radioactivity to the&#xD;
      heart and allows an optimal imaging of the heart. A recent publication however indicates that&#xD;
      an early imaging within 10 minutes after radiotracer injection (W10 imaging) appears feasible&#xD;
      and may be as good as W30 imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Encouraged by the recent data, we think that a waiting time of 10 minutes is feasible while&#xD;
      preserving the image quality; thus, we would like to assess the feasibility and accuracy of&#xD;
      W10 imaging compared with W30 imaging in this study. The main purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      obtain imaging information on the use of early imaging (W10). The feasibility of W10 imaging&#xD;
      will be assessed visually using a 3-point scale as well as semiquantitatively using&#xD;
      region-of-interest measurements. The accuracy of W10 imaging will be determined by comparing&#xD;
      the findings of W10 with those of coronary angiography, which will be obtained within 30 days&#xD;
      of the MPI and serve as reference standard. The tolerability of W10 will be assessed using&#xD;
      3-point scale Questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine if early MPI imaging within 10 minutes works as well as imaging&#xD;
      after 30-45 minutes waiting and its role in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The&#xD;
      major advantages of this new imaging procedure include the shortening of the procedure time,&#xD;
      the reduction of patient discomfort and improvement of patient care.&#xD;
