    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the investigational study drug everolimus&#xD;
      may be used to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy treatment for patients with&#xD;
      advanced lung cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced lung cancer remains an incurable disease although new agents and new treatment&#xD;
      strategies have resulted in improved survival outcomes for patients. Most recently there has&#xD;
      been interest in augmenting tumor response to chemotherapy by the addition of drugs which&#xD;
      inhibit tumor cell growth and proliferation. Everolimus is a new cancer drug which works as&#xD;
      an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (or mTOR), mTOR is a protein that is part of a&#xD;
      signaling pathway which can cause cancer cells to divide. Everolimus when used alone as a&#xD;
      single agent has produced some response as well as prolonged stable disease in both&#xD;
      chemo-naïve and pre-treated non-small cell lung cancer. The goal of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety of everolimus with combined other cancer drugs called pemetrexed, carboplatin, and&#xD;
      bevacizumab. Pemetrexed and carboplatin are both chemotherapy drugs and bevacizumab inhibits&#xD;
      the growth of new blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be entered onto dosing cohorts of 3 patients according to the following dose&#xD;
      escalation scheme. The first cohort will begin at dose level 1. At least three patients on&#xD;
      each dose level must have completed cycle one before the study leadership (principal&#xD;
      investigators, study statisticians) will allow patients to be enrolled onto the successive&#xD;
      dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Levels: 1, 2, 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pemetrexed (mg/m²): 500, 500, 500&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carboplatin (AUC): 5, 6, 6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab (mg/kg): 15, 15, 15&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus (mg/day): 2.5, 2.5, 5.0&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, for the&#xD;
      combination of everolimus with pemetrexed, carboplatin, and bevacizumab in patients with&#xD;
      Stage IV non-squamous, non small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Pemetrexed, carboplatin and bevacizumab will be given intravenously on day 1 of a 21-day cycle with doses determined by the dose level to which the patient is assigned.&#xD;
Everolimus will be taken orally days 1-21 of a 21-day cycle. There will be no rest between each 21 day cycle. Tumor scans will be done every 2 treatment cycles. Patients who are not progressing and who are tolerating therapy will be treated with 6 cycles of Pem/Carbo/Bev/Everolimus followed by maintenance Pem/Bev/Everolimus, which will be continued if there is no tumor progression and the patient is tolerating therapy. If there is toxicity related specifically to one of the maintenance drugs, that drug will be discontinued and the other drugs will be maintained.</description>
