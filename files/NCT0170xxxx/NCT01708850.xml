  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer and an upper extremity DVT associated with a central venous catheter&#xD;
      (CVC) will receive rivaroxaban. CVC survival will be assessed and compared to previous rates&#xD;
      with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and warfarin, along with secondary safety outcomes&#xD;
      including bleeding and recurrent venous thromboembolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that anticoagulation with rivaroxaban in patients with UEDVT&#xD;
      secondary to central venous catheters in patients with active malignancy is an effective&#xD;
      therapy as quantified by the success of catheter preservation. Prolonged line salvage rate&#xD;
      without recurrence of UEDVT will improve the management of cancer patients who develop an&#xD;
      upper extremity deep venous thrombosis in the setting of a central venous catheter.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective cohort study of patients who present with an acute upper limb&#xD;
      thrombosis in the setting of a central venous catheter. The total study duration will be 12&#xD;
      weeks, with one follow up telephone visit at 6 months. All patients will be treated with&#xD;
      rivaroxaban at a dose of 15 mg orally twice daily for three weeks, followed by 20 mg daily.&#xD;
      Anticoagulation will continue for three months regardless of the length of time the catheter&#xD;
      is in place. Continuation of anticoagulation beyond this time period is at the discretion of&#xD;
      the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strengths of this study include its prospective cohort format, and access to a large&#xD;
      oncologic population through the London Regional Cancer Program and other corresponding&#xD;
      centres. In addition, The Catheter Study looking at CVC survival and safety in patients with&#xD;
      cancer diagnosed with UEDVT and treated with a bridging protocol of warfarin/dalteparin was&#xD;
      organized primarily through the LHSc and results therein could be directly compared to the&#xD;
      results from this study given the similar patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations of this study include the small sample size and the fact that there is no LMWH&#xD;
      monotherapy comparison group. In addition, this will be an open study with no blinding, given&#xD;
      the nature of line survival. There is also the chance that a proportion of patients will have&#xD;
      their catheters removed for other reasons, such as finishing treatment or personal&#xD;
      preference, which could affect the validity of survival results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This design was selected given the small number of patients presenting with this diagnosis&#xD;
      each year at our centre, which would present difficulty in accruing enough patients for&#xD;
      several comparisons group. Results will be compared to the Catheter Study and previous&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
