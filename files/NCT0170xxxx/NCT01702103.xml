      Demonstrate the therapeutic clinical equivalence of two mometasone nasal sprays in the relief&#xD;

      baseline of Total Nasal Symptom Scores (TNSS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perennial allergic rhinitis may be defined clinically as an inflammatory condition of the&#xD;
      nose characterised by nasal obstruction, sneezing, itching, or rhinorrhoea. It occurs due to&#xD;
      an exaggerated response to an environmental trigger which results in inflammation of the&#xD;
      lining of the nose; it is similar to hayfever, however, the substances which cause the&#xD;
      allergic reaction are present all year round; common causes include the faecal matter of the&#xD;
      house dust-mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus), animal proteins from domestic pets (saliva&#xD;
      or skin proteins), and industrial dusts and fumes In those with perennial rhinitis, cigarette&#xD;
      smoke, washing powders, detergents, strong perfume, and traffic fumes may exacerbate the&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According with WAO (World Allergy Organization), perennial rhinitis predominates in South&#xD;
      America, Asia, Africa and Australia; perennial and seasonal rhinitis occur commonly in the&#xD;
      U.S.A. and Japan. Seasonal rhinitis predominates in Europe. In one study in London of adults&#xD;
      between the ages of 16 and 65 years, in 1991 the prevalence of rhinitis was 16%; of these, 8%&#xD;
      had perennial symptoms, 6% perennial and seasonal symptoms, and 2% seasonal symptoms alone.&#xD;
      As with asthma, both seasonal and perennial rhinitis seem to be increasing. The 2004-05&#xD;
      National Health Survey stated that 3.2 million Australians (approximately 16.1% of the&#xD;
      population) self-reported experiencing symptoms of hay-fever and perennial rhinitis. The&#xD;
      prevalence was found to be highest amongst those aged 25-34 and was slightly higher among&#xD;
      females (1.7 million) than males (1.5 million).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) as seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) result from an&#xD;
      immunological response mediated by IgE; there is also a Th2 cell component accounting for&#xD;
      chronic symptoms. Histamine is a well-known mediator responsible for the signs and symptoms&#xD;
      of SAR but many other mediators including leukotrienes and prostaglandin D2 are involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of perennial rhinitis involves the avoidance of triggers such as house&#xD;
      dust-mite faeces and animal proteins, in conjunction with pharmacological treatments as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroids as Budesonide, Mometasone furoate, in the form of a nasal spray are the&#xD;
      first-line treatment for perennial allergic rhinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antihistamines as Cetirizine hydrochloride, Fexofenadine hydrochloride, work by blocking the&#xD;
      effects of histamine which is one of the main substances driving allergic reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decongestants as Phenylephrine hydrochloride, may be taken orally or as a nasal spray to&#xD;
      reduce the secretions and swelling of the lining of the nose by constricting the blood&#xD;
      vessels in the nose. Anti-inflammatories as Sodium cromoglycate, block the inflammatory&#xD;
      pathways that cause the symptoms of perennial rhinitis, however, they have not been found to&#xD;
      be more effective than corticosteroids or antihistamines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye drops as Ketotifen fumarate, Hydrocortisone acetate, may be used to control symptoms such&#xD;
      as itchy or watery eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergen desensitisation involves exposing the patient to small doses of allergens in an&#xD;
      attempt to desensitize them and prevent an allergic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroids, as reported above, in the form of a nasal spray are the first-line treatment&#xD;
      for perennial allergic rhinitis; one of the most widely used is mometasone furoate. A&#xD;
      meta-analysis of randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, clinical trials on mometasone&#xD;
      furoate nasal spray in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, by a comprehensive search of the&#xD;
      MEDLINE, LILACS, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library databases up to 31 October, 2007 was&#xD;
      carried out. Meta-analysis was performed with the random or the fixed effect models depending&#xD;
      on heterogeneity, by using revman 5 software on the sixteen of the 113 identified articles&#xD;
      that met the inclusion criteria. This meta-analysis provides a level Ia evidence for the&#xD;
      efficacy of MFSN in the treatment vs placebo, with adverse events frequency similar in both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this basis we decided to design a trial to show therapeutic equivalence of a generic&#xD;
      mometasone product with the drug Nasonex® Nasal Spray which is already marketed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients: 298 completed patients with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis are required in&#xD;
      this study; with a planned drop-out rate of 20%, 360 patients have to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
