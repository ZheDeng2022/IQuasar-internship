  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if giving reolysin in combination with docetaxel or&#xD;
      pemetrexed can offer better results than standard therapy with docetaxel or pemetrexed alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reolysin is a virus which has been shown to target and destroy cancer cells in laboratory&#xD;
      tests. Reolysin has been studied in over 360 cancer patients to find safe doses that can be&#xD;
      given and has also undergone testing in combination with docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel and pemetrexed have anticancer activity in certain cancers including lung and they&#xD;
      have been approved by Health Canada for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers doing this study also want to evaluate the side effects of reolysin when given&#xD;
      together with docetaxel or pemetrexed.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of non-small&#xD;
             cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As treatment arm is assigned based on histology subtype, it&#xD;
             must be feasible to subtype into squamous or other.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have a formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue block (from primary&#xD;
             or metastatic tumour) available for translational studies and must have provided&#xD;
             informed consent for the release of the block as well as for blood samples for&#xD;
             correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of clinically and/or radiologically documented disease. At least one site of&#xD;

                  negative).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have advanced and or metastatic disease, for which no curative therapy&#xD;
             exists and for which systemic therapy is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;

        have had platinum based adjuvant chemotherapy after complete surgical resection and have&#xD;
        relapsed within one year of treatment, may be considered to have had one prior platinum&#xD;
        containing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior paclitaxel is permissible. Patients who have had prior pemetrexed for first line&#xD;
        therapy will be randomized to Treatment Arm C or D (docetaxel ± reolysin). Prior&#xD;
        maintenance therapy with pemetrexed is not permitted. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy is&#xD;
        permissible providing completed at least 1 year prior to relapse/recurrence of disease and&#xD;
        the patient has received one regimen of palliative first line chemotherapy as described&#xD;
        above.&#xD;
&#xD;

        elapsed between the last dose and enrollment to the trial. Exceptions may be made for low&#xD;
        dose, non-myelosuppressive radiotherapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.0 x ULN (unless elevated secondary to conditions such as&#xD;
                  Gilbert's disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ALT and AST ≤ 1.5 x ULN (≤ 3x ULN is permitted in the presence of known liver&#xD;
                  metastases)&#xD;

                  mid-stream urine; if still ≥ grade 2 then uring collection for 24 hours to&#xD;
                  confirm &lt;2g/24hrs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and&#xD;
             regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to enrollment in&#xD;
             the trial to document their willingness to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who cannot give informed consent (i.e. mentally incompetent patients, or those&#xD;
        physically incapacitated such as comatose patients) are not to be recruited into the study.&#xD;
        Patients competent but physically unable to sign the consent form may have the document&#xD;
        signed by their nearest relative or legal guardian. Each patient will be provided with a&#xD;
        full explanation of the study before consent is requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients registered on this&#xD;
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there&#xD;
             must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 2 hour's driving distance) placed&#xD;
             on patients being considered for this trial. Investigators must assure themselves that&#xD;
             the patients registered on this trial will be available for complete documentation of&#xD;
             the treatment, adverse events, response assessment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In accordance with NCIC CTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 5 working&#xD;
             days of patient randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of other malignancies, except for adequately treated&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin cancer or solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence of&#xD;
             disease for &gt; 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are on immunosuppressive therapy or have known HIV infection or active&#xD;
             hepatitis B or C.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with untreated brain metastases, untreated spinal cord compression or&#xD;
             meningeal metastases are not eligible (CT scans are not required to rule this out&#xD;
             unless there is a clinical suspicion of CNS disease). Patients with treated brain&#xD;
             metastases who have radiologic evidence of stable brain metastases, with no evidence&#xD;
             of cavitation or hemorrhage in the brain lesion, are eligible providing that they are&#xD;
             asymptomatic and do not require corticosteroids (must have discontinued steroids at&#xD;

             days prior to registration/randomization and must not be lactating. Men must be&#xD;
