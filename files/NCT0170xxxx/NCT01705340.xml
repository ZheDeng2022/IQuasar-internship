  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of Akt inhibitor MK2206 and&#xD;
      lapatinib ditosylate when given together with trastuzumab in treating patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive breast,&#xD;
      gastric, or gastroesophageal cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Akt inhibitor MK2206&#xD;
      and lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for tumor growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth&#xD;
      in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find&#xD;
      tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving Akt&#xD;
      inhibitor MK2206 and lapatinib ditosylate together with trastuzumab may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of MK-2206&#xD;
      (Akt inhibitor MK2206) in combination with trastuzumab and lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate)&#xD;
      in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast or gastric cancer;&#xD;
      two schedules of lapatinib administration will be examined-continuous daily dosing and&#xD;
      pulsatile dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To provide preliminary assessment of the safety and tolerability of MK-2206 administered&#xD;
      in combination with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/HER2 blockade via trastuzumab and&#xD;
      lapatinib in adult patients with a locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast or&#xD;
      gastric tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the anti-tumor activity of MK-2206 in combination with trastuzumab and&#xD;
      lapatinib in patients with advanced HER2-positive solid tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate the anti-tumor activity of MK-2206 in combination with trastuzumab and&#xD;
      lapatinib in HER2-positive solid tumor patients with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway&#xD;
      activation events, e.g., phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit&#xD;
      alpha (PIK3CA) or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and other related gene mutations and&#xD;
      expressions; to compare the HER2 and PI3K-PTEN mutation status of the primary tumor to&#xD;
      metastatic tumor biopsy when available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Akt inhibitor MK2206 and lapatinib ditosylate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15; lapatinib ditosylate&#xD;
      PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21 or on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17; and trastuzumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;

             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier; if&#xD;
             the patient has residual toxicity from prior treatment, toxicity must be =&lt; grade 1&#xD;

             endocrine therapy is permitted; patients on bisphosphonates or denosumab for bone&#xD;
             metastases or osteopenia/porosis are considered eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active brain metastases requiring radiation should be excluded as they&#xD;
             may develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of&#xD;
             neurologic and other adverse events; patients with stable brain metastases (mets) (&gt; 6&#xD;
             months without change in steroids or seizure medications) will be considered eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Preclinical studies demonstrated the potential of MK-2206 for induction of&#xD;
             hyperglycemia in all preclinical species tested; patients with diabetes or in risk for&#xD;
             hyperglycemia should not be excluded from trials with MK-2206, but the hyperglycemia&#xD;
             should be well controlled on oral agents or insulin before the patient enters the&#xD;
             trial; patients with poorly controlled diabetes with hemoglobin (Hgb)A1C &gt; 9% will be&#xD;
             excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preclinical studies indicated transient changes in corrected QT interval (QTc)&#xD;
             interval during MK-2206 treatment; prolongation of QTc interval is potentially a&#xD;
             safety concern while on MK-2206 therapy; cardiovascular baseline QTc &gt; 480 msec will&#xD;
             exclude patients from entry on study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because MK-2206 an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with MK-2206, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with MK-2206; these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or with a history of a&#xD;
             myocardial infarction within 6 months; patients with high-risk uncontrolled&#xD;
             arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, high-grade atrioventricular [AV] block,&#xD;
             supraventricular arrhythmias which are not adequately rate-controlled); patients with&#xD;
             uncontrolled hypertension (i.e., over 160/90 mmHg); patients who are controlled on&#xD;
             anti-hypertensive medication will be allowed to enter the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and are on&#xD;
             combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with MK-2206; in addition, these patients are at&#xD;
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy and&#xD;
             as such patients with cluster of differentiation (CD)4 counts &lt; 200 will be excluded;&#xD;
             HIV-positive patients not on anti-retrovirals and with an adequate CD4 count will be&#xD;
             considered eligible&#xD;
