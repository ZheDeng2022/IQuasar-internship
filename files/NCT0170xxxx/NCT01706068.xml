      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of ischemic ECG changes including St segment elevation, ST segment depression&#xD;
      or T wave inversion that indicate myocardial ischemia are well established and require&#xD;
      appropriate investigation and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is an abundance of clinical situation, with apparently ischemic ECG change not&#xD;
      indicate traditionally coronary artery related ischemia and therefore require prompt&#xD;
      recognition and treatment of underlying condition, that may be serious and life-threatened.&#xD;
      For example of such conditions are pericarditis, myocarditis, aortic dissection, electrolyte&#xD;
      abnormalities, intracranial hemorrhage and hypothermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Together with them, an ECG ST segment changes may appeared in abdominal serious illness such&#xD;
      as pancreatitis and cholecystitis(17,18,19,20,23). Whereas in pancreatitis various vasoactive&#xD;
      and toxic for myocardium substances released, the cause of ST segment changes in&#xD;
      cholecystitis are discussed and includes tachycardia , vagal reflexes, changed in plasma&#xD;
      rennin activity resulted by distension of the gallbladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The certain proportion of the patients with ECG changes actually didn't have coronary artery&#xD;
      disease(9,15) or other acute cardiac condition and therefore require treatment of the&#xD;
      underlie illness only without spend the time for cardiac investigation or special&#xD;
      treatment(1,3,4,7,8). Some kind of treatment may be even harmful for the patients with&#xD;
      abdominal illness such as thrombolytic, anticoagulant, aggressive antiaggregant therapy or&#xD;
      unnecessary cardiac catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the medical literature the investigators found some case reports and works about the ECG&#xD;
      changes in acute biliary disease in patient with knowing cardiac disease and without it, but&#xD;
      actually incidence of ECG changes that suggest but not represent an acute coronary illness&#xD;
      isn't knowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore this is necessary to investigate actually incidence of ECG changes that mimic acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome in acute cholecystitis and acute biliary disease and determined clinical&#xD;
      and laboratory characteristics that helps to differentiate this patients.&#xD;
