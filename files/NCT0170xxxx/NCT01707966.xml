      The main objective of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase&#xD;
      III trial is to assess the impact of maintenance orteronel on disease progression and hence&#xD;
      on quality of life in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have&#xD;
      achieved at lease disease stabilization after first line chemotherapy with docetaxel.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One in six men will be diagnosed with cancer of the prostate during his lifetime.&#xD;
      Accordingly, prostate cancer is the most common cancer amongst men in the western world. In&#xD;
      Switzerland approximately 5'400 men are diagnosed with the disease and 1'300 die of prostate&#xD;
      cancer every year. Prostate cancer represents 30% of all cancer diagnoses in men. Despite&#xD;
      earlier detection and new treatments the life time risk to die of prostate cancer has&#xD;
      remained stable at 3% since 1980.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastatic prostate cancer is hormone-sensitive and therefore androgen deprivation therapy&#xD;
      (ADT) is the treatment of choice. Yet, virtually all patients with metastatic prostate cancer&#xD;
      progress on androgen deprivation therapy (so called castration-resistant prostate cancer:&#xD;
      CRPC). Further hormonal manipulations are often administered (e.g. maximal androgen blockade&#xD;
      with addition of a non-steroidal antiandrogen such as bicalutamide), however these&#xD;
      interventions have only modest impact. Metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) that progresses despite these&#xD;
      therapies is nowadays treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy. In a phase III trial,&#xD;
      treatment of mCRPC patients with docetaxel in combination with low dose prednisone resulted&#xD;
      in a significant survival advantage in comparison to the previous standard of care of&#xD;
      mitoxantrone plus prednisone. Moreover docetaxel treatment improved response rate,&#xD;
      progression free survival and symptom control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care in patients with disease stabilization after first line&#xD;
      chemotherapy with docetaxel is a wait-and-watch strategy, where patients are regularly&#xD;
      examined in the hospital every 3-4 weeks. A second line chemotherapy in patients with mCRPC&#xD;
      was not standardized until recently. However, two trials presented in 2010 have changed the&#xD;
      landscape: the novel taxane cabazitaxel was tested in a phase III trial against mitoxantrone&#xD;
      as a second line chemotherapy in patients progressing under or after docetaxel. There was a&#xD;
      significant improvement in overall survival, progression free survival and response rate.&#xD;
      Most of the included patients had experienced disease progression during or within three&#xD;
      months of docetaxel first line treatment. Cabazitaxel was associated with increased toxicity&#xD;
      including 5% toxic deaths. Another randomized phase III trial using abiraterone in patients&#xD;
      with progression after docetaxel showed a significant improvement in overall survival and&#xD;
      pain palliation. Abiraterone belongs to a group of agents that very effectively inhibits the&#xD;
      androgen synthesis via blockade of the key enzyme cytochrome P-450c17 (CYP17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new drug orteronel (TAK-700) belongs to the same group of active substances as&#xD;
      abiraterone. Orteronel is currently the subject of a large international Phase III study in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic carcinoma of the prostate and progression of disease following&#xD;
      docetaxel. Initial results have shown that orteronel effectively inhibits testosterone&#xD;
      synthesis and, in contrast to abiraterone, has fewer side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CYP17 inhibitors are active and well tolerated agents for treatment of patients with&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, despite its activity patients become resistant&#xD;
      to this new form of antihormonal treatment and hence develop further progression after a&#xD;
      median of approximately 6 months. In that case, the options are very limited as outlined&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all reported post-docetaxel trials and in the large phase III trials, patients start on&#xD;
      the CYP17 inhibitor treatment at the time of disease progression. Trials examining other&#xD;
      advanced malignant diseases such as lung cancer have shown that initiating an effective&#xD;
      treatment earlier in the disease course at the end of a first-line chemotherapy (so called&#xD;
      switch maintenance therapy) is beneficial in terms of progression free survival (PFS) but&#xD;
      also overall survival (OS). This may also hold true for early administration of antihormonal&#xD;
      agents in patients with mCRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this trial is to test the hypothesis that starting orteronel after&#xD;
      disease stabilization with docetaxel prolongs event-free survival (EFS), consequently&#xD;
      maintains a good quality of life (QL) and eventually also improves OS.&#xD;
