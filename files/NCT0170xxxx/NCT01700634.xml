    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to investigate fMRI ability to identify pain central sensitization&#xD;
      in chronic knee OA. Patients with high and low central sensitization and healthy control&#xD;
      subjects will be included. Central sensitization will be clinically defined based on the&#xD;
      evidence of regional spread of pain (spreading sensitization) and increased pain response to&#xD;
      repeated stimulation (temporal summation). Operatively, a patient will be assigned to high&#xD;
      sensitization group when showing (i) clinical evidence of pain or altered sensations spread&#xD;
      beyond the knee joint by manual palpation, (ii) a minimum of 3 anatomical sites around the&#xD;
      knee showing a pressure pain threshold below 4 kg/cm2 (tender points), (iii) pain score of 4&#xD;
      points or more in a 11-point scale during 4 kg/cm2 pressure stimulation on the&#xD;
      anterior/medial surface of the tibial bone (the site selected for the fMRI experiment) and&#xD;
      (iv) increase of at least 1 point in a 11-point scale after 10 repeated pressure stimulation&#xD;
      on the tenderest point around the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A three-step strategy is proposed to characterize the phenomenon by assessing (i) brain&#xD;
      response to direct pressure stimulation on the painful knee, which will reflect the&#xD;
      combination of peripheral and central sensitization; (ii) brain response to pressure&#xD;
      stimulation on a non-arthritic hyperalgesic area (i.e., the anterior surface of the tibia),&#xD;
      which will mostly reflect central sensitization mediated at the spinal cord level, and (iii)&#xD;
      brain response to moderately painful heat stimulation on a healthy skin area (i.e., volar&#xD;
      forearm), which will reflect central sensitization occurring in the brain and involving the&#xD;
      highest-level pain modulatory mechanisms. An additional evaluation is proposed using&#xD;
      resting-state fMRI to assess potential alterations in baseline brain functional organization.&#xD;

                  examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Have a radiological and clinical diagnosis of knee OA based upon American College&#xD;
                  of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (1986) affecting at least one knee of a minimum of&#xD;
                  3 months in symptom duration prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Subject is either male or female and at least 45 years of age.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. - Subjects will not be permitted to heavily exercise for 12 hours prior to fMRI&#xD;
             assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. - Subjects will be required to refrain from the following treatments: I.- Analgesic&#xD;
             and anti-inflammatory drugs for 3 days prior to fMRI assessment except for rescue&#xD;
             medication. Rescue medication will be based on paracetamol (dosed 1g/8h), which in any&#xD;
             case must be withdrawn for a minimum of 24 h prior to fMRI assessment or the fMRI&#xD;
             assessment may be delayed.&#xD;

        5mg/OD) if they are used as a chronic prescription (more than 6 weeks). If they are used&#xD;
        for less than 6 weeks, patients could participate in the study after a washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be allowed to take their chronic (non-analgesic and non-anti-inflammatory)&#xD;
        medications if the treatments have been used continuously for at least six weeks prior to&#xD;
