      GSK2251052 is a member of a novel mechanistic and structural class of antibiotics that&#xD;
      inhibits the bacterial enzyme leucyl tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) by forming a boron adduct with&#xD;
      tRNA and is currently in development for the treatment of hospital acquired Gramnegative&#xD;
      infections (including E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Enterobacter spp.). This is a multi-part&#xD;
      study. Part A is a randomized, open-label, single dose, three-period, incomplete block design&#xD;
      to evaluate the relative bioavailability of five oral formulations of GSK2251052.&#xD;
      Approximately 24 healthy subjects will be enrolled to receive treatment with GSK2251052 at a&#xD;
      dose of 2000 mg and randomized to receive three of the following five formulations: 1)&#xD;
      enteric-coated tablet (Treatment A), 2) modified release tablet (Treatment B), 3)&#xD;
      enteric-coated powder for oral suspension (Treatment C), 4) immediate release tablet&#xD;
      (Treatment D), and 5) oral solution (Treatment E). One or two formulations from Part A will&#xD;
      be selected on the basis of acceptable safety and pharmacokinetic criteria for further dose&#xD;
      evaluation in Part B. If no formulations are deemed to have the desired PK characteristics,&#xD;
      Part B will not be conducted. Part B is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      dose-escalation evaluation of the selected formulation(s) from Part A. Approximately 8&#xD;
      subjects will be randomly assigned to receive GSK2251052 at the planned starting dose of 2000&#xD;
      mg or respective placebo in Period 1. In Period 2, the next dose level will be administered&#xD;
      at an increment of 500 mg and/or based on the PK and safety of the preceding period.&#xD;
      Additional periods may be conducted with the selected formulation pending acceptable safety&#xD;
      in order to achieve target pharmacokinetic concentrations. Part C is a randomized,&#xD;
      single-blind, placebo-controlled, two-cohort, two period, crossover study of the selected&#xD;
      formulation of GSK2251052 in Part B to evaluate its multiple-dose safety and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      in both young and elderly, male and female healthy volunteers. Approximately 16 subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled (8 per cohort with an equal number of females if possible) and will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive either active treatment or placebo for 5 days both fasted and with a meal. Cohorts&#xD;
      will be evaluated sequentially, with cohort 1 (young) conducted first, and pending acceptable&#xD;
      safety, proceeding with an evaluation in cohort 2 (elderly) subsequently. Part D is identical&#xD;
      in design and conduct to Part C except it will evaluate the multipledose pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      safety, and tolerability of an immediate release formulation given thrice daily at a dose of&#xD;
      2000 mg. Part D is conditional and will only be conducted if none of the new formulations&#xD;
      demonstrate appropriate pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability. This study will be&#xD;
      conducted at a single center in Australia.&#xD;
