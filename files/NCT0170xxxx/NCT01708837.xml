      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Rationale for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a significant relation between postoperative cognitive dysfunction and increasing&#xD;
      age, increasing duration of surgery. But, up to now, the effect of the depth of anesthesia on&#xD;
      POCD remains controversial. This study is designed to investigate whether the depth of&#xD;
      anesthesia affects the incidence of POCD, we will use propofol for total intravenous&#xD;
      anesthesia in elderly patients whose depth of anesthesia was monitored and adjusted by&#xD;
      bispectral index (BIS). The early and long-term incidence of POCD will be compared between&#xD;
      deep and light-anesthesia groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that depth of anesthesia may exert an influence on the early postoperative&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction. One reason that deep anesthesia might protect cognitive function is&#xD;
      the prevention of the stress response to noxious stimulation. The noxious stimulation of&#xD;
      surgery can induce stress responses whose severity correlates with the intensity of surgery&#xD;
      (major versus minor).Light anesthesia with a serious stress response to noxious stimulation&#xD;
      may increase the incidence of POCD. Furthermore, major surgery causing a serious stress&#xD;
      response can give rise to a higher incidence of early postoperative cognitive dysfunction&#xD;
      than minor. This may also prove our hypothesis on the other hand. The elderly patients who&#xD;
      received major surgery had a higher incidence of early POCD than those who received minor&#xD;
      surgery. A deleterious stress response can be associated with major surgery or light&#xD;
      anesthesia, and it can cause excessive production of corticosteroids that target receptors in&#xD;
      the cerebral cortex and subcortical nucleus, eventually resulting in neuron injury. This may&#xD;
      explain why the elderly has a higher incidence of early POCD after surgery. However, the&#xD;
      effect of the depth of anesthesia on POCD remains controversial. Farag E et al. randomized 74&#xD;
      patients to either a low Bispectral Index (BIS) regimen or a high BIS regimen during the&#xD;
      surgical procedure. Preoperatively and 4-6 week after surgery, the patients' cognitive status&#xD;
      was assessed with a cognitive test battery consisting of processing speed index, working&#xD;
      memory index, and verbal memory index. Processing speed index was higher in the low BIS group&#xD;
      versus the high BIS group. But no difference was observed in the other two test battery&#xD;
      components. Certainly one of the limitations of their data is that the observed difference in&#xD;
      cognitive ability occurred in only one of three assessments. Recently, we have made a&#xD;
      randomised, double-blind, controlled study to demonstrate that deeper general anesthesia, as&#xD;
      defined by a median BIS of 38, when compared with a median BIS of 58, was associated with a&#xD;
      reduced incidence of early POCD(at 1 week postoperationly). This study has been published in&#xD;
      J Neurosurg Anesthesiol , Volume 23, Number 1, January 2011. as it was just a small&#xD;
      sample(n=40) study without considering incidence of long-term POCD, we hope to obtain more&#xD;
      reliable data from a multi-center study to investigate whether the depth of total intravenous&#xD;
      anesthesia using propofol affects the early and long-term incidence of POCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bispectral index（BIS）can reflect the depth of anesthesia of propofol combined with&#xD;
      opioids. In our study, BIS will still be used to provide a reference for the selection of a&#xD;
      suitable depth of anesthesia.&#xD;
