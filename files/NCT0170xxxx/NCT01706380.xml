    <textblock>
      The present study, in an out-patient setting for substance use treatment in adolescents,&#xD;
      examines the effect on treatment retention of a mobile telephone follow-up technique&#xD;
      (interactive voice response), with or without personal feedback. Subjects in treatment for&#xD;
      substance use disorders will be followed by automated mobile telephone contact with questions&#xD;
      about psychiatric symptoms and substance use, and the investigators hypothesize that this&#xD;
      technique, including a personal feedback reporting back to the client whether his or her&#xD;
      status is changing in one way or another, may increase the treatment retention, possibly by&#xD;
      means of an intensified treatment contact.&#xD;

    <description>Interactive voice response follows the client twice weekly for 3 months with respect to symptoms and substance use, in both arms. This intervention group also receives a personalized and automated feedback describing whether the symptom status of the patient is better, worse or equal, compared to the preceding follow-up.</description>
