  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to examine the effects of limiting complaints on pain and&#xD;
      pain catastrophizing (PC) in individuals with low back pain (LBP) who are in a state of&#xD;
      central sensitization (CS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed on individuals who have LBP and are in a state of CS. CS is&#xD;
      classified as a type of pain which has the following dominant features: pain that is&#xD;
      disproportionate to the nature or extent of injury/pathology; disproportionate,&#xD;
      non-mechanical, unpredictable pattern of pain provocation in response to aggravating/easing&#xD;
      factors; strong association with maladaptive psychological factors&#xD;
&#xD;
      ; diffuse/non-anatomic areas of pain/tenderness to palpation. These criterion have been&#xD;
      demonstrated to have discriminative validity for diagnosing CS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multicenter, randomized (1:1) controlled trial with an experimental and&#xD;
      control group. The control group will be treated as the clinician wishes and will be given a&#xD;
      bracelet to wear during treatment. The experimental group will be treated as the clinician&#xD;
      wishes as well as given a bracelet and a journal with the following instructions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this bracelet is to help you recognize your verbal complaints, which we believe&#xD;
      may be related to your pain. We are asking that you wear it and follow these rules:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Place the bracelet on either wrist. Please identify in the journal which wrist you have&#xD;
           placed it on and the date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If you verbally complain about Anything, including your pain, switch it to the other&#xD;
           wrist, identify the date, wrist switched to, and complaint. Internal complaints and&#xD;
           thoughts are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Indicate if this complaint made you feel better, worse or the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want you to attempt to limit your complaints through altering your wording to express a&#xD;
      way in which you could make your situation better. For example, instead of saying &quot;it is way&#xD;
      too cold outside&quot; say, &quot;I could have worn more clothes today and I would be less cold&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating clinicians will complete a power-point educational session in which they will&#xD;
      be trained on the randomization process, the rules of the bracelet and goals of this study. A&#xD;
      short education piece on central sensitization will also be provided. Each clinician will&#xD;
      consent that they have successfully completed this and understand all aspects of&#xD;
      participation. We will also require the clinician to complete a short questionnaire that will&#xD;
      ask the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is your highest degree of education?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do you have any board certifications or specializations?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What type of setting do you treat?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How many years have you been a treating clinician?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinician will also complete the Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for Physiotherapists&#xD;
      (PABS-PT) which is a self-reported measure that discriminates between a biomedical and a&#xD;
      biopsychosocial orientation of therapists with regard to low back pain management. The&#xD;
      PABS-PT is available in several languages (e.g. English, German, Dutch, Brazilian-Portuguese)&#xD;
      and appears to generate reliable and valid data (Ostelo et al., 2003; Laekeman et al., 2008;&#xD;
      Magalh√£es et al., 2011; Mutsaers et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treating clinician will take pain measurements on the visual analogue scale and pain&#xD;
      catastrophizing on the pain catastrophizing scale at week 1, week 4, week 12 and 6-months.&#xD;
      The subjects may be discharged when the clinician feels they have successfully achieved goals&#xD;
      or have reached plateau. We anticipate discharge to be an average 4-6 weeks after beginning&#xD;
      treatment. We are asking that they continue to track progress until 6 months post-enrollment.&#xD;
      The clinician will also ask the patient to rate their global rating of change using the GROC&#xD;
      scale at discharge. A detailed registration of the type of interventions the clinicians apply&#xD;
      will be submitted to the researchers (including the number of treatment sessions) but there&#xD;
      is no restriction on how the clinician treats the patient. In addition, we will ask each&#xD;
      participant to list the drugs which they are taking (including changes while they are a&#xD;
      participant) and any other non-PT interventions they undergo (ie. surgery, injections, etc).&#xD;
      This will be crucial for estimating the 'real' treatment effect of the experimental&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concealed allocation will be performed by using a computer-generated randomized table of&#xD;
      numbers created prior to the study. Individual, sequentially numbered index cards with the&#xD;
      random assigned numbers would then be prepared. These would be folded and placed in sealed&#xD;
      opaque envelopes which each participant would choose. A researcher will then provide a&#xD;
      bracelet with or without instructions, depending on group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will not be compensated in any way monetarily. The patient will benefit from the&#xD;
      study in having satisfaction of providing to the pool of physical therapy research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be verbally explained the study as well as provided a consent form for an&#xD;
      agreement of participation. The consent form will highlight the potential risks and benefits&#xD;
      of participation. The subject will sign the consent form and this will be filed within the&#xD;
      physical therapy facility in which the study is being completed. In addition we will ask the&#xD;
      patient that a demographic questionnaire is filled out at baseline that includes the&#xD;
      questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. When did your current episode of back pain begin?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How many episodes of back pain have you experienced in your lifetime?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is your age?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What is your nationality?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What is your gender?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. What is your education level?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Do you expect your back pain will ever resolve?&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no inherent risks from participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be a convenience sample who volunteers to participate after being screened&#xD;
      by a Physical Therapist. The Physical Therapist would verbally explain the study as well as&#xD;
      obtain consent through the attached informed consent forms.&#xD;
