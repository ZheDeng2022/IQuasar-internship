  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the benefits of switching away from efavirenz&#xD;
      (which patients are taking in combination with Kivexa速 or as part of the combination pill,&#xD;
      Atripla速) in patients with central nervous system side effects (such as insomnia {difficulty&#xD;
      with sleeping}, bad dreams etc). The investigators in this study will investigate the effect&#xD;
      of switching to a single tablet regimen (Eviplera速) containing tenofovir, emtricitabine and&#xD;
      rilpivirine. If patients are currently taking Atripla, rilpivirine will be the only new&#xD;
      component of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rilpivirine is a drug for HIV treatment, licensed for first-line treatment. In combination&#xD;
      with Truvada速, it showed fewer side effects when compared to efavirenz in 2 other clinical&#xD;
      studies, where patients were starting HIV treatment for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also investigate the safety (in terms of other side effects and the routine&#xD;
      blood tests which we ordinarily use to monitor your treatment) and monitor effectiveness,&#xD;
      your viral load and CD4 counts, when you switch treatment to&#xD;
      tenofovir/emtricitabine/rilpivirine.&#xD;

    <description>To investigate whether switching individuals with intolerance to efavirenz-containing cART (as Atripla or Kivexa plus Efavarinz) to tenofovir/emtricitabine/rilpivirine is associated with resolution of toxicity after 12 weeks. CNS toxicity will be measured by a questionnaire based on efavirenz SPC and graded based on the ACTG adverse event scale.</description>
