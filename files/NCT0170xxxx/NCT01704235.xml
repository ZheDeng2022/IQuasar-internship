    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to understand the extent of symptom perception and preventive&#xD;
      care-seeking among Vietnamese American women and their impact on cervical cancer screening&#xD;
      from the perspectives and experiences of key informants including primary health care&#xD;
      providers and Vietnamese American women (VAW, foreign-born and United States-born). With this&#xD;
      information, the investigators can better understand how to promote cervical cancer screening&#xD;
      in the Vietnamese community.&#xD;

    <description>To understand the extent of symptom perception among Vietnamese American women (foreign and United States-born) and their impact on cervical cancer screening from the perspective and experiences of key informants including primary health care providers. A semi-structured interview guide will be used to assess the extent of preventive care-seeking. The interview guide includes the following topics: thoughts and experiences regarding Vietnamese American women's knowledge and beliefs about how cervical cancer develops, thoughts and experiences regarding Vietnamese American women and use of cancer screening tests such as cervical cancer screening for early detection/preventive health care, thoughts and experiences about Vietnamese American women's lack of familiarity with the term Pap smear or a Pap test, and thoughts and experiences regarding Vietnamese American women's decision and timing to seek medical care and preventive health care.</description>
