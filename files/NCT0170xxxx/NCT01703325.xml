  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriatic nails can significantly affect a quality of life of patients. Psoriasis affects&#xD;
      both nail matrix and nail bed. Pitting, leukonychia and red spots in lunula indicate a defect&#xD;
      in the nail matrix. Psoriasis can change the nail bed as the results in onycholysis,&#xD;
      discoloration, splinter hemorrhage and subungual hyperkeratosis. The main treatment of&#xD;
      psoriatic nails is using topical high- potent steroids however topical steroids are limited&#xD;
      their ability to penetrate deep nail matrix or nail bed which are the main pathology. Use of&#xD;
      such a treatment can lead to skin atrophy and report in the case of &quot;Disappearing digits&quot;.&#xD;
      Previous studies of steroid injection in the treatment of psoriatic nails show satisfactory&#xD;
      results without any serious permanent adverse effects. At present, there is no comparison&#xD;
      study between intralesional steroid and ultrapotent topical steroid for the treatment of&#xD;
      psoriatic nails.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intralesional&#xD;
      triamcinolone comparing to 0.05% clobetasol ointment in the treatment of psoriatic nails.&#xD;

      Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disorder. The nails involvement has been reported up to&#xD;
      40% of psoriatic patients. Psoriatic nails can significantly affect a quality of life of&#xD;
