  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibroscan is a non invasive imaging investigation which measures liver stiffness, known to&#xD;
      correlate well with liver scarring and cirrhosis on liver biopsy. Indocyanine green is an&#xD;
      inert dye which is purely extracted from the blood by liver cells, and is hence an excellent&#xD;
      marker of both liver cell function and overall liver blood flow. There is little data for&#xD;
      either of these biomarkers regarding outcomes in alcoholic liver disease. We aim to establish&#xD;
      the accuracy of these liver biomarkers in predicting important liver related outcomes (death,&#xD;
      transplantation and hospital readmission with cirrhosis related consequences) in patients&#xD;
      with severe (decompensated) alcoholic liver disease. Moreover, we will assess whether the&#xD;
      serial measurement of biomarkers has any impact on alcohol abstinence, motivation or quality&#xD;
      of life. Over an 18 month period, 125 consecutive hospital inpatients with decompensated&#xD;
      alcoholic liver disease will undergo baseline biomarker measurement, routine blood and urine&#xD;
      tests and qualitative questionnaires. These will be measured during their initial hospital&#xD;
      admission (0 months) with subsequent repeat measurement during follow up visits at 1, 2, 4&#xD;
      and 6 months. Each study visit time will be in the region of 30-40 minutes to complete these&#xD;
      investigations. The end of the study for individual patients will be patient death, liver&#xD;
      transplantation or 6 month from study enrolment; whichever occurs first.&#xD;

      This is a single centre longitudinal cohort feasibility pilot study of patients with&#xD;
      decompensated alcoholic liver disease. We aim to recruit 125 consecutive patients with&#xD;
      decompensated alcoholic liver disease over an 18 month period. This number is based upon&#xD;
      approximately 10 admissions per month to acute liver services with decompensated alcoholic&#xD;
      liver disease and includes a presumed 20% dropout rate during follow up, giving a total&#xD;
      cohort of 100 patients. Patients will undergo a maximum of 6 months follow up following study&#xD;
      recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the performance of diagnostic liver biomarkers (Indocyanine Green, Fibroscan&#xD;
           and blood and urinary biomarkers) in predicting mortality in decompensated alcoholic&#xD;
           liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the diagnostic and prognostic end points of these biomarkers with existing&#xD;
           cirrhosis prognostic scoring systems (Child Pugh, MELD and UKELD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the performance of diagnostic biomarkers as a therapeutic aid to quality of&#xD;
           life and alcohol abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially eligible patients i.e. adults with decompensated liver disease with alcohol as a&#xD;
      major co-factor, and acutely admitted secondary to sequelae of hepatic decompensation, will&#xD;
      be approached by an existing member of their clinical care team (The CI &amp; Co-Investigators&#xD;
      form part of this team). Any patient who decides to take part in the study will have a&#xD;
      baseline inpatient study visit either on their inpatient ward or to the NDDC Biomedical&#xD;
      Research Unit (BRU). Subsequent follow up visits will be to the BRU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Male or female patients 18-75 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of cirrhosis based upon:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a) Histological confirmation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  b) Combination of clinical and radiological criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  c) Validated non invasive biomarker&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol as the primary aetiology for liver cirrhosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital admission related to decompensated liver disease (e.g. ascites, varices,&#xD;
           sepsis, alcoholic hepatitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active alcohol drinking prior to index hospital admission&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 or 4 hepatic encephalopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active non hepatic malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known complete portal vein thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol abstinence at time of index hospital admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active cardiac devices&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research visit will require measurement of ICG clearance, Fibroscan, blood tests, urine&#xD;
      tests and questionnaires. They will then be required to attend study visits at 1, 2, 4 and 6&#xD;
      months following the baseline study visit, after which study follow up will cease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo study visits at the following intervals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline visit (study visit 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 month (study visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 months (study visit 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 months (study visit 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 months (study visit 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected for the purposes of this research project at the&#xD;
      baseline and subsequent study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of demography, anthropometry, drug history, smoking, alcohol intake, blood&#xD;
           pressure, full blood count, renal function, liver function, coagulation and serum&#xD;
           samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief abdominal examination to detect presence of moderate to severe ascites (for the&#xD;
           purposes of Child Pugh score measurement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ICG analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transient elastography (Fibroscan)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urinary biomarkers (proteomics and metabonomics)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic Liver Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol intake assessments (28 Day AUDIT tool)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol STAR tool for qualitative assessment (to assess the influence of Fibroscan/ICG&#xD;
           readings on motivation, beliefs and alcohol abstinence)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demography and history are taken as part of normal clinical care. All patients will be&#xD;
      offered standard follow up from both outpatient hepatology clinic and hospital alcohol&#xD;
      liaison services throughout the period of study.&#xD;
