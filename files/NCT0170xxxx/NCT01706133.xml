      -Can a scheme based on inter geriatricians visiting nurse consultants and reduce negative&#xD;
      impacts on the health of elderly over 70 years ?&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      - Usual care as the comparison group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care or standard refers to those processes or services that the elderly claimant&#xD;
      receives the IMSS services network, after the acute phase of their illness has been&#xD;
      stabilized and is defined that can be discharged from the emergency department, following&#xD;
      clinical and therapeutic recommendations for improving their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elders risk population for emergency&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aging population brings a major change in health conditions and social conditions around&#xD;
      the elderly, the analysis of the elderly population is considered according to functionality&#xD;
      and risks of old age, when it comes to care services emergency, care becomes more critical as&#xD;
      the elderly are older, have been identified adults of 70 and over as more vulnerable to&#xD;
      health services, especially for the emergency services as they do not exhibit classic&#xD;
      patterns to acute events of prevalent diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functionality and dependence&#xD;
&#xD;
      The commitment of the functionality in adults older than 65 may be present in 5% of cases,&#xD;
      while in over 70 years this figure rises to 50% or more. Functional impairment may be a&#xD;
      &quot;marker&quot; of the effect of systemic disease on the patient and is also an indicator of&#xD;
      severity of disease because it measures the ability of independence&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accumulation of normal aging characteristics define a threshold, which once pierced,&#xD;
      tends to increase the propensity for loss of functional abilities due to aging. However, not&#xD;
      everyone ages the same way, since factors such as inherited genetic capital, especially the&#xD;
      accumulation of risks associated with lifestyle and work activities, and the opportunity to&#xD;
      identify the disease in its period latency coupled with the accessibility and use of health&#xD;
      services, can delay or exacerbate the loss of functionality and increase the dependency of&#xD;
      the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life of older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frailty in the elderly is a state of increased susceptibility due to less booking multiple&#xD;
      physiological systems resulting in lower resilience, negative energy balance, sarcopenia,&#xD;
      decreased strength and reduced exercise tolerance. Frailty is associated with adverse health&#xD;
      outcomes such as institutionalization, falls, reduced performance status and increased&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;

    <description>Participants who were assigned to the intervention will be evaluated jointly by the medical service by a medical specialist in geriatrics and a nurse trained in gerontology and geriatrics. The doctor will monitor the apparition and / or aggravation of any geriatric syndromes already established by the specialty in geriatrics, namely, polypharmacy, delirium, dementia, depression, risk of falls, etc.. The nurse will monitor and follow up in four areas I. medical issues (pressure ulcers, infusion, mobility); II. Mental and emotional state and coping strategies with hospitalization; III. functionality, and IV. Atmosphere (A. Service status, architectural difficulties for mobility, bathing etc. B. Support Network, caregiver, and C. hardship)</description>
