      The specific aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if Human Umbilical Cord Blood (hUCB) infusion is safe in children with&#xD;
           perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (AIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if late functional outcome, physiologic response, and anatomic findings are&#xD;
           changed following hUCB infusion in children with perinatal AIS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll ten pediatric patients who have their umbilical cord blood banked with&#xD;
      Cord Blood Registry, Inc. (CBR), who have been diagnosed with an arterial ischemic stroke&#xD;
      (AIS), and whose caregivers contacted CBR, Inc. to notify them that the child has experienced&#xD;
      an AIS around the time of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving permission to release the patient's contact information, the CBR team will&#xD;
      then relay the contact information to the Stem Cell Study Group at the University of Texas -&#xD;
      Houston (UT) / Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital (CMHH) who will contact the family,&#xD;
      explain the study, and send a consent form for their review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several weeks prior to the scheduled procedure date, the patient will go to their family&#xD;
      doctor for a physical evaluation and have blood drawn to rule out problems with the child's&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After successfully meeting initial pre-screening criteria, the patient's family will make&#xD;
      their own arrangements to travel to Houston for the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient is in Houston, he/she will undergo baseline assessments, including physical,&#xD;
      neurological exams and tests, speech therapy testing, laboratory tests, and imaging (MRI) of&#xD;
      the brain. If any of the blood tests are abnormal, or the patient has an active infection,&#xD;
      the procedure may be postponed or the patient may possibly be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient continues to meet all criteria, the frozen cord blood will be shipped&#xD;
      overnight to a special lab in Houston, TX for processing. Once release criteria have been&#xD;
      met, the cells will be brought to the CMHH for infusion into the patient's vein. The patient&#xD;
      will remain at CHMM for 24 hours of monitoring, after which they will be allowed to go home.&#xD;
      Patients will be called daily by the research staff through Day 14, and once a month after&#xD;
      that.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return to Houston, Texas for 6 month, 1 year and 2 year follow-up visits for&#xD;
      repeat assessments, tests, and exams just like at the baseline visit. The MRI of the brain&#xD;
      will only be repeated at the 6 month visit.&#xD;
