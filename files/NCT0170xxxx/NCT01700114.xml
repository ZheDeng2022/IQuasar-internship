      The purpose of this study is to collect data to describe the real-world use and safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of MelaFind® in a post-approval clinical setting.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study to test the hypothesis that, among eligible and evaluable&#xD;
      lesions with central histological reference standard status melanoma or high-grade lesion,&#xD;
      the relative sensitivity ρ comparing enrolling dermatologists after MelaFind use with&#xD;
      enrolling dermatologists if MelaFind were not available is greater than 110%. This represents&#xD;
      a clinically meaningful increase in sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate real-world use and safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of MelaFind in a clinical setting.&#xD;

        All patients of any age, race, ethnicity, or gender, presenting with pigmented skin lesions&#xD;
        that that meet the Indications for Use and Lesion Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria,&#xD;
        including signing the Informed Consent Form, are eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;
        This single-arm study has one study group consisting of eligible lesions on eligible&#xD;
        patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Up to six clinical sites in the US will participate in this study, one in each of the six&#xD;
        states in which MelaFind is commercially available. Some of the sites will be located in&#xD;
        urban settings, and some will be located in a suburban or rural setting. At least 50% of&#xD;
        the sites will new, i.e., they did not participate in the MelaFind pivotal study. Some&#xD;
        sites will be academic centers and some private practices.&#xD;
