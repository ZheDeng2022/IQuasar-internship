      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Serious illnesses like cancer or Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), can cause high levels of&#xD;
      stress in a family. When a child is diagnosed with cancer or NF1, parents face numerous&#xD;
      stressors, each of which can strain relationships. Many parents struggle to effectively cope&#xD;
      with the changes in parenting roles that often accompany treatment of childhood cancer or&#xD;
      NF1. How parents cope with this stress can influence whether the relationship is strengthened&#xD;
      or weakened. Stress levels can also affect the care of the child who has cancer or NF1.&#xD;
      Researchers want to better understand the critical time points and events during the child s&#xD;
      treatment when the relationship becomes most stressed and/or strengthened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how stress affects the relationship between parents who have a child with cancer&#xD;
      or Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents of a child (between 1 and 24 years of age) who has been diagnosed with cancer or&#xD;
           NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must have been in a partnership at the time the child was diagnosed with&#xD;
           cancer or NF1. At least one of the parents must be a biological or legal parent of the&#xD;
           child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will fill out a questionnaire either online or by paper and pencil. It will&#xD;
           take about 20 minutes to complete. The questions ask about the experience of dealing&#xD;
           with a child s cancer OR NF1 diagnosis and how it affects participants relationship with&#xD;
           their spouse/partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants will also have an in-depth interview. It will last about an hour. It&#xD;
           will ask further questions about the cancer OR NF1 diagnosis and treatment and its&#xD;
           effect on the relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents face numerous stressors when their child is diagnosed with cancer or NF1, each&#xD;
           of which can strain a marriage/partnership.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Marital/partner relationship dynamics are often not assessed or addressed when providing&#xD;
           health care for children with cancer or NF1. Many parents struggle to effectively cope&#xD;
           with the changes in parenting roles that frequently accompany treatment of childhood&#xD;
           cancer or NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How parents cope with these stressors can strengthen or weaken the relationship, and can&#xD;
           impact the entire family, including the care to the child undergoing cancer or NF1&#xD;
           treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Limited studies have examined relationship stress or satisfaction during a child s&#xD;
           illness trajectory for cancer or NF1 or the critical time points and events during the&#xD;
           child s illness trajectory when the relationship becomes most stressed and/or&#xD;
           strengthened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore whether the stress associated with having a child with cancer or NF1 is&#xD;
           perceived to impact the communication between partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore whether positive dyadic coping (joint decision making, joint problem solving,&#xD;
           sharing responsibilities) is perceived to have strengthened the marital&#xD;
           relationship/partnership following the child s diagnosis with cancer or NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the time points and events during the child s illness trajectory when the&#xD;
           parents relationship becomes most stressed and/or strengthened.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the perceptions of various subgroups in the sample, (e.g. parents who score&#xD;
           either high or low on a marital stress scale, mothers versus fathers) statistically or&#xD;
           qualitatively as the distribution of the characteristics of the sample allow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must have been in a partnership at the time the child was diagnosed with&#xD;
           cancer or NF1. At least one of the participating parents must be a biological or legal&#xD;
           parent of the child. If a divorce/separation occurred with a previous partner&#xD;
           during/after the child s diagnosis, the other partner will be invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant s child must be between 1-24 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are 3 groups of participants being recruited: 1) those who have a child who has&#xD;
           been diagnosed with cancer at least 3 months prior to enrolling on this study and are&#xD;
           currently undergoing cancer treatment, 2) those who have completed treatment at age 21&#xD;
           or younger (without evidence of disease) within the previous 3 years, and 3) those who&#xD;
           have a child who has been diagnosed with NF1 at least 3 months prior to enrolling on&#xD;
           this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be fluent in the English language&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant s child must have been diagnosed with cancer or NF1 at least 3 months&#xD;
           prior to enrollment on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must verbalize willingness to discuss the impact of their child s cancer or&#xD;
           NF1 diagnosis on their relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cross-sectional, multi-center, exploratory study utilizing a convenience sample to&#xD;
           explore the parents perception of how the child s cancer or NF1 diagnosis, treatment,&#xD;
           decision making and other aspects of care are addressed and impact the martial&#xD;
           relationship/partnership.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will complete a self-administered measure that addresses potential stresses&#xD;
           experienced in the partnership since the child s diagnosis and how each are either&#xD;
           resolved or create a divide in the relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who experience a high or low degree of relationship stress on a standardized&#xD;
           marital stress form (a score greater than one standard deviation from the norm) will be&#xD;
           invited to participate in a qualitative interview, that further explores which&#xD;
           components of parenting a child with cancer is most challenging on the relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 360 participants will be enrolled onto this study (up to 180 couples). Subjects&#xD;
           may be offered a gift card ($20 Target gift card at NIH) upon completion of the&#xD;
           questionnaire for their time and inconvenience, where available. Due to limitations with&#xD;
           funding, participants enrolled after July 2016 will not receive a gift card.&#xD;
