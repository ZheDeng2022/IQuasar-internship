      Evaluate visual outcomes and contrast sensitivity for subjects undergoing bilateral myopic&#xD;
      LASIK with a Nexisvision Shield or bandage contact lens placed postoperatively. Early speed&#xD;
      of visual recovery results indicate that the visual recovery in the first 4 hours after the&#xD;
      LASIK procedure show the most variability. A patient's ability to drive after their LASIK&#xD;
      procedure would potentially alleviate a challenge that patients often face in taking&#xD;
      additional time off work or simply finding a ride to there LASIK procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery has been performed worldwide since 1990.&#xD;
      Historically, LASIK has been reported to decrease contrast sensitivity post operatively and&#xD;
      patients have been advised to take the day off of work and potentially the day after LASIK.&#xD;
      More recently, utilizing advanced laser technology for optimized corneal ablation and&#xD;
      creation of the flap has the potential for improved LASIK surgery results and improved&#xD;
      recovery time. Visual recovery and management of immediate post operative visual acuity is&#xD;
      important for patient satisfaction.&#xD;
