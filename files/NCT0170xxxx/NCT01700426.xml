      The study addresses treatment of iron deficiency, the most common nutritional deficiency that&#xD;
      infants and young children encounter. With the knowledge that iron deficiency may&#xD;
      irreversibly affect a baby's long-term neurodevelopment and behavior, the investigators are&#xD;
      offering free screening blood draws at Children's Hospital Colorado to older babies and&#xD;
      toddlers (9-24 months old). If their blood results indicate a serum ferritin of â‰¤ 15&#xD;
      micrograms/dL without the presence of an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), they will be&#xD;
      invited to continue in the intervention portion of the study, where they will receive iron&#xD;
      supplements as well as vitamin E (or placebo) for an eight week treatment period. The&#xD;
      rationale for the study is to test whether addition of Vitamin E, an antioxidant and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agent, improves the treatment response to supplemental iron.&#xD;

      Enhancing Treatment of Iron Deficiency and Iron Deficiency Anemia with an Antioxidant,&#xD;
      Vitamin E&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synopsis/Abstract Iron Deficiency (ID) and Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA) are common in older&#xD;
      breastfed infants and toddlers. Treatment of 3-6 mg iron/kg/day is recommended by the&#xD;
      American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), but this regimen often results in only modest changes&#xD;
      in iron status, despite being a substantially higher dose (relative to body weight) than is&#xD;
      commonly used for adults. We propose that high therapeutic doses of iron induce an&#xD;
      inflammatory response, thus increasing hepatic synthesis of a critical regulator of iron&#xD;
      absorption, hepcidin, which functions to limit iron absorption in the context of&#xD;
      inflammation. In infants and toddlers found to have ID or IDA, we propose to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of the addition of Vitamin E to iron therapy compared with the same dose of iron&#xD;
      alone. Our primary hypothesis is that in infants and toddlers with ID or IDA, 2 months of&#xD;
      supplemental Vitamin E combined with therapeutic iron supplementation will be more&#xD;
      efficacious than the same dose of iron alone. The study design is a randomized, double blind&#xD;
      efficacy trial of 2 months of iron therapy (6 mg/kg/day) with or without Vitamin E (18&#xD;
      mg/day), in infants and toddlers with ID or IDA from 9 to 24 months of age. Primary outcomes&#xD;
      include biomarkers of iron status (ferritin, hemoglobin, transferrin saturation, and&#xD;
      transferrin receptor); secondary outcomes include biomarkers of inflammation and oxidant&#xD;
      stress. Subjects: We will screen older infants (9-12 months of age) who were predominantly&#xD;
      breastfed through at least the first 9 months of life, and toddlers (12-24 months of age) who&#xD;
      were breastfed and/or who have modest dietary iron intakes. Intervention: Sixty-eight&#xD;
      subjects found to have ID or IDA will be consented and randomized to one of the two treatment&#xD;
      regimens (34 subjects per group). Liquid supplement preparations of iron (both groups),&#xD;
      Vitamin E (test) and placebo (control) will be distributed by the research pharmacy at The&#xD;
      Children's Hospital.Children's Hospital Colorado. Outcomes: Biomarkers of iron status, iron&#xD;
      homeostasis, oxidant stress, and of systemic and intestinal inflammation will be repeated at&#xD;
      the end of the intervention. If the hypotheses are supported, the findings would provide a&#xD;
      simple and effective modification to enhance iron therapy, and to improve the balance between&#xD;
      adequate iron uptake to meet physiologic needs and excessive iron intake and its potential&#xD;
      adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Goals and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad goal of this proposal is to improve the health and nutrition of young children by&#xD;
      improving iron status of infants and toddlers who have developed iron deficiency (ID) or iron&#xD;
      deficiency anemia (IDA). The specific objective is to test an intervention proposed to&#xD;
      enhance the efficacy, and minimize potential toxicity, of therapeutic iron for infants and&#xD;
      young children who have a dietary iron deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency in the world and negatively&#xD;
      impacts health in several ways 1, 2. ID and IDA contribute to stunting and impaired growth,&#xD;
      increased behavioral problems, and delayed mental and motor development 3, 4, 5-7. Studies&#xD;
      have also shown that some of the behavioral and developmental consequences of ID and IDA in&#xD;
      young children are not reversible with treatment 8. Despite the fortification of infant and&#xD;
      toddler foods in the United States, a significant number of children still develop ID or IDA&#xD;
      9. Current treatment recommendations include a wide dosage range (3-6 mg/kg/day), which&#xD;
      represents amounts that are higher than routine supplementation levels for adults (typically&#xD;
      equivalent to &lt; 1 mg/kg/day), reflecting the challenge and imprecision of effective treatment&#xD;
      for ID and IDA in children. Iron excess is not without risk, and studies in adults have shown&#xD;
      local (intestinal) and systemic inflammatory changes within days of iron therapy initiation&#xD;
      10, 11. Recent advances in the understanding of the regulation of iron homeostasis and&#xD;
      metabolism indicate that systemic inflammation induces a protein called hepcidin, which&#xD;
      blocks the uptake of iron into the body12, 13. Thus, stimulation of inflammation by high dose&#xD;
      iron supplements may actually counteract the intended beneficial effect of the increase in&#xD;
      iron intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin E is an essential nutrient that functions as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      agent, and has been studied for many potentially beneficial facets of human health, including&#xD;
      potential for protection against heart disease14; accelerated aging mediated through DNA&#xD;
      damage; and impaired immunity 15. Research in adults giving antioxidants along with iron&#xD;
      therapy was associated with reduced oxidative potential. In this study, a palm oil extract&#xD;
      containing approximately 7 mg of Vitamin E was supplemented along with iron therapy and was&#xD;
      associated with reduced fecal oxidation 16 Alpha-tocopherol is the most studied form of&#xD;
      Vitamin E, and has been shown to decrease biomarkers of total body oxidative stress and&#xD;
      inflammation 15, 17. We propose to accomplish our primary specific objective by testing the&#xD;
      effect on treatment outcomes of administration of Vitamin E along with iron supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our central hypothesis is that in infants and toddlers with ID or IDA, 2 months of&#xD;
      supplemental Vitamin E combined with therapeutic iron supplementation at 6 mg/kg/day will be&#xD;
      more efficacious than the same dose of iron alone. The specific hypotheses to be tested by&#xD;
      the intervention are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Subjects receiving both iron and vitamin E supplements will have significantly&#xD;
      greater changes in serum ferritin (reflecting greater improvement in their iron status), than&#xD;
      subjects receiving iron alone after eight weeks of supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Significantly more subjects receiving both iron and vitamin E supplements will&#xD;
      have an improved iron status profile, including ferritin, transferrin saturation, and serum&#xD;
      transferrin receptor, than subjects receiving iron alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3 Subjects receiving both iron and vitamin E supplements will have significantly&#xD;
      lower levels of inflammatory and oxidant stress biomarkers than subjects receiving iron&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: (exploratory): The exposure to two months of iron therapy will be associated&#xD;
      with significantly altered intestinal bacterial profiles compared to baseline, and at the end&#xD;
      of therapy, the placebo group will have a greater predominance of potentially pathogenic&#xD;
      bacterial phyla.&#xD;
