      Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluating the effect of anti-IL-5-therapy&#xD;
      in patients with bullous pemphigoid. The primary study objective is to determine the efficacy&#xD;
      of an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody therapy, administered as 750mg mepolizumab, in patients&#xD;
      with bullous pemphigoid.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common autoimmune blistering skin disease. It&#xD;
      characteristically affects the elderly (&gt;70 years) with an annual incidence of 5 to 35 per&#xD;
      million. This is comparable with the incidence of eosinophilic esophagitis that we determined&#xD;
      with approximately 14 per million. Eosinophilic esophagitis has been recognized as an&#xD;
      emerging medical problem and, consequently, several studies with anti-IL-5-antibodies have&#xD;
      been performed and are still ongoing. It should be noted, however, that, in contrast to&#xD;
      eosinophilic esophagitis, the incidence of BP is dramatically increasing with an average of&#xD;
      17% per year. Moreover, with the increase of the proportion of the elderly in the&#xD;
      industrialized world, the medical problems associated with BP will even be more visible in&#xD;
      the near future. For instance, patients with BP have an increased mortality risk of 2.3. In&#xD;
      the US, an increase in mortality of BP patients has been noticed from 1979 to 2002. Taken&#xD;
      together, BP is a frequent disease that affects mostly the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BP often starts with extremely pruritic skin lesions resembling eczema or urticaria before&#xD;
      vesicles and blisters arise. In 10-30% of patients, BP also involves the oral mucosa. Disease&#xD;
      severity can be determined by means of the autoimmune bullous skin disorder intensity score&#xD;
      (ABSIS) that evaluates the involved area as well as the disease activity. The disease is due&#xD;
      to an autoimmune response to structural components of junctional adhesion complexes leading&#xD;
      to the damage of the dermal-epidermal junction with subepidermal blister formation.&#xD;
      Specifically, autoreactive B and T cell responses against the hemidesmosomal antigens BP180&#xD;
      and BP230 have been identified. Serum levels of autoantibodies to BP180 reflect the disease&#xD;
      severity and activity. The T cells are memory CD4+ cells producing both Th1 and Th2&#xD;
      cytokines, mostly IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. IL-5 as well as eotaxin are abundantly found in&#xD;
      blister fluids. The production of IL-5 is indeed associated with blood eosinophilia and&#xD;
      significant eosinophil infiltration in the skin of BP patients. Eosinophils are thought to be&#xD;
      critically implicated in blister formation by releasing toxic granule proteins (ESP, MBP) and&#xD;
      proteolytic enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic corticosteroids have been widely used for the treatment of BP. Nevertheless, the use&#xD;
      of steroids is limited by their side effects. in therapy-resistant cases, immunosuppressive&#xD;
      drugs such as azathioprine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, methotrexate,&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil are employed, but their corticosteroid-sparing effect and overall&#xD;
      benefit in BP is highly disputed. 70% of the relapses are usually observed within three&#xD;
      months, 85% within 6 months after stopping therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since eosinophils are characteristically found in the skin at early stages of the disease&#xD;
      before blisters occur and contribute to tissue damage, targeting eosinophils by reducing&#xD;
      their number and activation might thus be a promising alternative therapeutic approach.&#xD;
      Anti-IL-5 antibody therapy has been shown to be effective in depleting eosinophils, e.g. in&#xD;
      diseases such as eosinophilic esophagitis and hypereosinophilic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and efficacy of mepolizumab in patients with bullous pemphigoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      clinical trial with 750 mg mepolizumab over three months, evaluate time period from start of&#xD;
      therapy until relapse, ABSIS-Score, Pruritus Score, Antibody levels, immuno pathological&#xD;
      evaluation of skin biopsy.&#xD;
