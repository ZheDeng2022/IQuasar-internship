      The objective of the Expanded Access Program is to provide HEMOLEVEN, a replacement&#xD;
      coagulation factor XI, to patients with severe inherited factor XI deficiency where, in the&#xD;
      opinion of the treating physician, the benefits of administering selectively the missing&#xD;
      factor outweigh the potential risks associated with the administration of fresh-frozen&#xD;
      plasma.&#xD;

      Many patients are asymptomatic until hemostatically challenged by surgery or trauma; so, the&#xD;
      diagnosis is often made in late childhood or early adulthood but always after full liver&#xD;
      maturation (i.e. 6 months) as reported by Andrew et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spontaneous bleeding is rare, except menorrhagia, and bleeding occurs mainly after surgery or&#xD;
      injury. Bleeding is observed mainly in surgical sites with high fibrinolytic activity such as&#xD;
      mouth, nose, or the genitourinary tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy, labor and delivery can also be challenging for women with FXI deficiency. In 1999&#xD;
      a study published in the American Journal of Hematology revealed that FXI levels are&#xD;
      inconsistent during pregnancy. The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage is increased in women&#xD;
      with factor XI deficiency. The incidence is 16% for the primary postpartum hemorrhage in FXI&#xD;
      patients, compared with 5% in the general population. Moreover, the incidence is 24% for the&#xD;
      secondary postpartum hemorrhage in comparison with that in the general obstetric population&#xD;
      (0.7%). The authors recommend that FXI levels be obtained during the initial visit and&#xD;
      monitored during the woman's third trimester. For all of these reasons it is important for&#xD;
      women who suspect they might have a FXI deficiency to be tested and diagnosed before&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe factor XI deficiency is defined by levels of &lt;0.20 IU/mL. Such individuals have a high&#xD;
      probability of post-operative hemorrhage. Individuals with levels between 0.20 IU/mL and the&#xD;
      lower limit of the normal range, generally 0.65-0.80 IU/mL, are generally classified as&#xD;
      having partial or mild deficiency with a lower risk of post-operative bleeding. Partial&#xD;
      deficiency is being increasingly recognized following pre-operative tests or as a result of&#xD;
      family screening. Thus partial factor XI deficiency is often diagnosed in asymptomatic&#xD;
      individuals, creating management dilemmas because of the unpredictability of the bleeding&#xD;
      risk. To differentiate an isolated or combined bleeding disorder in a patient with factor XI&#xD;
      deficiency, other causes of bleeding should be investigated and excluded (e.g. von Willebrand&#xD;
      disease, platelet disorders).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Severe inherited factor XI deficiency (FXI:C &lt; 0.20 IU/mL i.e. &lt;20 %)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient older than 6 months old and weight at least 8 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known personal bleeding history&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient requiring FXI replacement therapy when oral antifibrinolytic agents alone or&#xD;
             other means are ineffective or are contraindicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Scheduled to undergo an elective surgical procedure (including caesarean section) for&#xD;
             which the patient requires hemostasis prophylaxis, which in the case of caesarean&#xD;
             section is due to a history of postpartum bleeding, OR vaginal delivery for which the&#xD;
             patient requires hemostasis prophylaxis due to a history of postpartum hemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient/guardian provides signed and dated Informed Consent for 'HEMOLEVEN Expanded&#xD;
             Access Program' prior to entry into the program&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Personal history of thromboembolic events&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Underlying cardiopulmonary disease of NYHA Class III or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of severe reaction to any component of HEMOLEVEN notably to heparin or to its&#xD;
             derivatives,including LMWH. Past history of serious type II heparin-induced&#xD;
             thrombocytopenia (HIT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of antibody to FXI in the past or currently&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Presence of any other condition that could contraindicate treatment with factor XI&#xD;
             concentrate or lead the Physician/Investigator to believe treatment would not be in&#xD;
             the best interest of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Positive, confirmed pregnancy test for patients undergoing elective surgery (not&#xD;
             applicable for caesarean section and prevention in vaginal delivery)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Lactating woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Of the seven exclusion criteria, the first four are included as a precautionary safety&#xD;
        measure; the fifth is included to avoid a lack of efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The two last criteria are included to minimize confounding influences on the evaluation of&#xD;
        patient safety. Oral contraception is not mandatory as a pregnancy test is scheduled at&#xD;
        inclusion visit and before surgery.&#xD;
