  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 220 eligible subjects will be enrolled into one of five treatment groups. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that some of the randomized study subjects may not complete the study; subjects&#xD;
      who withdraw or are discontinued, will not be replaced. Randomization will be stratified by&#xD;
      age (60 to &lt;75 years and ≥ 75 years) in order to distribute the proportion of such persons in&#xD;
      each age group equally across treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments will comprise a single IM dose of a placebo or RSV-F protein nanoparticle vaccine&#xD;
      on Day 0, with concurrent IM immunization with a licensed inactivated influenza vaccine. A&#xD;
      rescue dose of the licensed TIV will be provided to subjects in all groups except the placebo&#xD;
      group on Day 28, the placebo group will receive saline. For each subject, study follow-up&#xD;
      will span approximately one year from the first immunization (on Day 0) for all subjects.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult males and females, ≥ 60 years of age, without symptomatic cardiopulmonary&#xD;
             disease. Note that subjects who have any functional limitation or symptoms related to&#xD;
             cardiac and/or pulmonary disease (including asthma or other episodic symptoms), or who&#xD;
             receive ongoing therapy to control symptoms or functional limitation, are not&#xD;
             eligible. The following are examples of subjects who may bear cardio-pulmonary&#xD;
             diagnoses but who would remain eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Subjects on stable (no change in ≥ 2 months) therapy for findings (e.g.,&#xD;
                  hypertension or hyperlipidemia) that are not associated with current symptoms or&#xD;
                  disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subjects who receive intermittent prophylaxis for risks associated with&#xD;
                  asymptomatic findings (e.g., antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures in&#xD;
                  a subject with asymptomatic mitral valve prolapse).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Other clinically insignificant findings, not deemed to be associated with&#xD;
                  increased risk due to respiratory viral infections as determined by the&#xD;
                  Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Free of other illnesses which are believed to increase the risk of influenza or&#xD;
             influenza related complications including: diabetes mellitus, congenital or acquired&#xD;
             blood dyscrasias, renal or hepatic dysfunction, and morbid obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to give informed consent prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to comply with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in research involving investigational product (drug / biologic / device)&#xD;
             within 45 days before planned date of first vaccination and/or planned participation&#xD;
             at any time during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of a serious reaction to any prior vaccination or known allergy to&#xD;
             constituents of licensed TIV (e.g., egg proteins).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of Guillain-Barré Syndrome within 6 weeks following a previous influenza&#xD;
             vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any influenza vaccine within the preceding 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the study vaccination and planned&#xD;
             receipt of a licensed vaccine any time prior to Day 56.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of an RSV vaccine at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any known or suspected immunosuppressive condition, acquired or congenital, as&#xD;
             determined by medical history and/or physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 continuous days) of immunosuppressants&#xD;
             or other immune-modifying drugs within 6 months prior to the administration of the&#xD;
             study vaccine. An immunosuppressant dose of glucocorticoid will be defined as a&#xD;
             systemic dose ≥10 mg of prednisone per day or equivalent. The use of topical, inhaled,&#xD;
             and nasal glucocorticoids will be permitted provided these are not administered for&#xD;
             diagnoses inconsistent with the inclusion criteria. The use of inhaled&#xD;
             glucocorticoids, although typically not associated with system absorption, will&#xD;
             generally indicate the presence of a diagnosis inconsistent with inclusion criteria 1&#xD;
             or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months&#xD;
             preceding the administration of the study vaccine or during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute disease at the time of enrollment (defined as the presence of a moderate or&#xD;
             severe illness with or without fever, or an oral temperature &gt;38.0°C on the planned&#xD;
             day of vaccine administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known disturbance of coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspicion or recent history (within one year of planned vaccination) of alcohol or&#xD;
             other substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that in the opinion of the Investigator would pose a health risk to the&#xD;
             subject if enrolled or could interfere with evaluation of the vaccine or&#xD;
             interpretation of study results (including neurologic or psychiatric conditions deemed&#xD;
             likely to impair the quality of safety reporting).&#xD;
