  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human study (phase 1) of a 3-dose vaccination regimen with one of three&#xD;
      dose levels of C difficile vaccine with or without adjuvant in healthy adults aged 50 to 85&#xD;
      years. The main goal of the study is to determine how safe and well-tolerated the vaccine is.&#xD;
      In addition, the study aims to assess the immune response to the C difficile vaccine.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Healthy male and female adults aged 50 to 85 years at enrollment as determined by&#xD;
             medical history, physical examination, and the clinical judgment of the investigator&#xD;

             must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception from the time of informed&#xD;
             consent through at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Any abnormality in screening hematology and/or blood chemistry laboratory values&#xD;
             according to the toxicity grading scale. Subjects with stable Grade 1 abnormalities&#xD;

             discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. A positive screening test or known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or&#xD;
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
