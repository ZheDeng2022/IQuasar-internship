      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a condition that affects ovary function. It means&#xD;
      that the ovaries are not able to function at a level appropriate for a woman's age.&#xD;
      Previously, it was thought that women had only a fixed number of eggs that were lost each&#xD;
      month until none were left at menopause. However, recently, stem cells have been found in the&#xD;
      ovaries of adult women. These stem cells may be able to make new eggs. Studying these cells&#xD;
      may help women with POI in the future. Researchers want to collect ovarian tissue from women&#xD;
      with POI to investigate ovarian stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect ovarian tissue from women with primary ovarian insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women between 18 and 50 years of age with primary ovarian insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also&#xD;
           have a full gynecological exam. They will provide blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will donate ovarian tissue for study. It will be collected through&#xD;
           outpatient surgery. The surgery will take either half of an ovary or a full ovary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Early loss of human ovarian function results in a clinical condition known as primary ovarian&#xD;
      insufficiency (POI) or premature ovarian failure (POF). This devastating condition renders&#xD;
      women unable to have their own genetic child in more than 95% of cases (1), as well as&#xD;
      failure of hormonal production by the ovary that is critical in maintaining bone health,&#xD;
      restful sleep, and quality of life. Indeed, in more carefully designed studies where control&#xD;
      groups were used, only 1.5% of POI patients became pregnant (2-8), which may more accurately&#xD;
      represent the true fertility rate in this population. Currently, fertility treatments for&#xD;
      these patients are primarily to use an egg donated from a young woman&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, it was thought that women were born with a limited number of eggs, which were&#xD;
      slowly depleted each month until exhaustion at the time of menopause. However, recent studies&#xD;
      have suggested that new eggs can be made from adult stem cells in the ovary. (1, 2) These&#xD;
      ovarian stem cells could be transplanted into a recipient mouse, who then delivered donor&#xD;
      derived offspring (3). Recently, ovarian germline stem cell (i.e., oogonial stem cell)&#xD;
      isolation has been reported from human ovaries (12).(4). However, it is not known if oogonial&#xD;
      stem cell problems play a part in diseases such as premature ovarian failure or diminished&#xD;
      ovarian reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this protocol is to characterize oogonial stem cells in patients with primary&#xD;
      ovarian insufficiency (POI)/failure (POF) and diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). There will be&#xD;
      three groups in this study: patients with POI or POF undergoing ovarian biopsy by&#xD;
      laparoscopy, patients with POI or POF undergoing clinically indicated abdominal surgery that&#xD;
      provides access to the ovaries, and patients over 18 undergoing clinically indicated ovarian&#xD;
      surgery (with or without POI or POF). Ovarian biopsies will be harvested by laparoscopy or at&#xD;
      the time of indicated surgery, and oogonial stem cells will be isolated in the laboratory and&#xD;
      characterized.&#xD;
