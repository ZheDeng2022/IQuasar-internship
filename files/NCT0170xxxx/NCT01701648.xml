  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is an acquired skin disease that significantly impacts the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients. Medical treatment of vitiligo includes the use of melanocyte transplantation but&#xD;
      the results are variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single center, single blind clinical trial comparing another treatment and also no&#xD;
      treatment was designed to assess the efficacy of autologous monocyte transplantation in&#xD;
      monolayers on a substrate of amniotic membrane for the treatment of stable vitiligo. Patients&#xD;
      will receive the two interventions, melanocyte suspension and monolayer on amniotic membrane&#xD;
      and will provide an untreated area as a control.&#xD;

      Main Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess the efficacy of autologous transplantation of monocytes in&#xD;
      monolayers grown on a biological substrate of amniotic membrane in the treatment of stable&#xD;
      vitiligo. Using a system of digital imaging analysis the percentage of re-pigmentation&#xD;
      obtained will be studied after 3, 6 and 9 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate differences in efficacy (as measured by the percentage of re-pigmentation) of&#xD;
      each of the 2 techniques used: pure melanocytes in suspension and amniotic membrane with&#xD;
      melanocytes in monolayers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess how rapidly epithelialization occurs and the cosmetic result in the short and long&#xD;
      term of the areas treated with each of the techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess if de-epidermization with CO2 laser may be by itself a stimulus for the reservoir&#xD;
      of melanocytes in the adjacent epidermis or hair follicles or if the re-pigmentation obtained&#xD;
      with this procedure is merely postinflammatory as a result of trauma to the epidermis.&#xD;
