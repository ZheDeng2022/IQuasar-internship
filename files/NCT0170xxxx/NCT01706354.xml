      End stage renal failure (ESRF)describes an irreversible loss in renal function. The majority&#xD;
      of these patients will opt for haemodialysis (HD)as their chosen method of renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy (RRT). Arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) are the optimal method of achieving vascular&#xD;
      access to permit HD. AVF are created with a small surgical procdure to join the artery and&#xD;
      vein together. Over the next 6- 8weeks after surgery the AVF should grow (&quot;mature&quot;) into a&#xD;
      vessel suitable for needles to be inserted for dialysis. Unfortunately however, around 24% -&#xD;
      35% of AVF fail at an early stage. Some anaesthetic techniques can influence intraoperative&#xD;
      blood flow and venous diameter, factors which are associated with fistula success. There&#xD;
      remains no conclusive evidence that any particular anaesthetic technique can significantly&#xD;
      influence long term surgical outcome. This study aims to investigate whether a regional,&#xD;
      compared to local, anaesthetic technique can affect fistula patency.&#xD;

      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) describes abnormal kidney structure or function and is a&#xD;
      significant public health problem. It is common, increasingly prevalent with age and often&#xD;
      co-exists with significant morbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension,&#xD;
      hyperlipidaemia, cerebrovascular disease and coronary artery disease. Patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of CKD have a decreased life expectancy compared with individuals without this&#xD;
      diagnosis. This is primarily due to cardiovascular disease, but other complications of CKD&#xD;
      include bone and mineral disorders, anaemia, depression, and malnutrition. Early recognition&#xD;
      and treatment of these complications is recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a proportion of patients, CKD will progress to end stage renal disease (ESRD). This is&#xD;
      defined as an irreversible decline in kidney function for which renal replacement therapy&#xD;
      (RRT) is required if the patient is to survive. In one UK study, 4% of patients with CKD&#xD;
      progressed to develop ESRD requiring RRT over a five and a half year follow up period. The&#xD;
      decision to commence RRT takes into account symptoms of biochemical disturbance, in&#xD;
      conjunction with the risks and inconvenience of starting RRT. European Best Practice&#xD;
      Guidelines recommend that RRT should commence when the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate&#xD;
      (eGFR) falls below 15ml/min/1.73m2 or when symptoms of uraemia, fluid overload or&#xD;
      malnutrition are resistant to medical therapy. In an asymptomatic patient, an eGFR of below&#xD;
      6ml/min/1.73m2 would also prompt the initiation of dialysis. It is known that the life&#xD;
      expectancy of patients receiving RRT is shorter than that of the general population and&#xD;
      varies further dependent on underlying diagnosis and age. For example, the median survival&#xD;
      for a patient in Scotland aged 45 - 64 years starting RRT for glomerulonephritis is 7.7&#xD;
      years, whereas the median survival of a patient in the same age group with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy is 2.9 years. The life expectancy of a male of the same age group within&#xD;
      the general Scottish population is 24.2 years. Instituting RRT prolongs life and reduces the&#xD;
      incidence of vasculo-occlusive events in patients with ESRD. As such, patients with CKD&#xD;
      should be monitored by a nephrologist in order that timely referral for preparation for RRT&#xD;
      can be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal replacement therapy may come in the form of haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or renal&#xD;
      transplantation, and may be managed both in and out of hospital. Haemodialysis (HD) remains&#xD;
      the most common modality of first RRT in Scotland; of 2885 patients commencing RRT during the&#xD;
      period 2005-2009, 2264 received HD. In order to undergo HD, there must be a connection&#xD;
      between the patient's vascular system and the dialysis machine. The most common method is&#xD;
      surgical creation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF), into which a needle can be inserted that&#xD;
      in turn is connected to a dialysis machine. In 2009, 75% of Scottish patients undergoing HD&#xD;
      underwent formation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Other options for vascular access&#xD;
      include arteriovenous grafts using synthetic materials and long-term central venous&#xD;
      catheters, though these are associated with higher rates of occlusive and infective&#xD;
      complications. AVF are currently regarded as the optimal form of vascular access for HD and&#xD;
      are recommended by National guidelines. There is excellent evidence that good quality, stable&#xD;
      vascular access is a major factor in determining survival in this group of CKD patients.&#xD;
      Unfortunately however, around 24% - 35% of arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) fail at an early&#xD;
      stage. Some anaesthetic techniques can influence intraoperative blood flow and venous&#xD;
      diameter, factors which are associated with fistula success. There remains no conclusive&#xD;
      evidence that any particular anaesthetic technique can significantly influence long term&#xD;
      surgical outcome. This study aims to investigate whether a regional, compared to local,&#xD;
      anaesthetic technique can affect fistula patency.&#xD;
