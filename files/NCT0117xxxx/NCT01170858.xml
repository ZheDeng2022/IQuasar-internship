  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an established dialysis modality in patients with end stage renal&#xD;
      disease (ESRD). However, there is growing awareness of the deleterious effect of high glucose&#xD;
      content in PD solutions on the peritoneal membrane over time (1). Accordingly, development of&#xD;
      new solutions to minimize glucose-induced toxicity and/or containing an alternative osmotic&#xD;
      agent to glucose such as icodextrin and amino-acid were developed. Icodextrin is a mixture of&#xD;
      high molecular weight, water soluble glucose polymers isolated by fractionation of hydrolyzed&#xD;
      cornstarch (2). Unlike glucose which is absorbed from the peritoneal cavity primarily by&#xD;
      diffusion across the peritoneal capillary endothelium, its absorption occurs mainly due to&#xD;
      convective fluid movement out of the peritoneal cavity via the lymphatics (2). As a result,&#xD;
      relatively constant osmotic pressure is created by icodextrin, thus it can provide sustained&#xD;
      ultrafiltration during the long dwell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have reported that icodextrin-based solution provides various clinical&#xD;
      benefits compared with conventional glucose-based solutions (3-7). In particular, icodextrin&#xD;
      has been successfully used in the fluid management of PD patients (4-5, 7). However,&#xD;
      excessive ultrafiltration may induce underhydration, resulting in faster decline in residual&#xD;
      renal function. This concern was first raised by Konings et al (8). In this study, a greater&#xD;
      fall in residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was observed in patients using icodextrin&#xD;
      compared to those using 1.36% glucose solution. In contrast, contradictory findings were also&#xD;
      reported from the two studies indicating that residual renal function can be preserved by&#xD;
      icodextrin solution (4, 9). Although the mechanisms are not clear, possible explanation&#xD;
      includes the presence of high-molecular-weight icodextrin metabolites in plasma, which in&#xD;
      turn may increase plasma oncotic pressure and hence preserve plasma volume and renal&#xD;
      perfusion as suggested by Davies et al (10). Such discrepant findings may be explained by&#xD;
      differences in study design, baseline fluid status, and other factors affecting residual&#xD;
      renal function during the study. In the study by Konings et al (8), the comparative solution&#xD;
      was 1.36% glucose, whereas 2.27% glucose was used in the study by Davies et al (4).&#xD;
      Therefore, it can be speculated that volume status might differ depending on different&#xD;
      concentration of glucose solution, thus leading to conflicting results. Also, these two prior&#xD;
      studies are limited by residual renal function as secondary outcome, a short follow-up&#xD;
      duration (4 mo vs. 6 mo), and small number of patients (32 vs. 50).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further explore the effects of icodextrin solution on residual renal function, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a multicenter prospective randomized controlled open-label trial.&#xD;
      Briefly, incident or prevalent adult CAPD patients with residual urine volume &gt; 750 ml will&#xD;
      be included. Patients on APD will be excluded. After a 4-week screening period, patients will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to icodextrin or 2.5% glucose solution for the long dwell. Residual GFR&#xD;
      and fluid status will be assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Residual GFR will be&#xD;
      calculated as an average of urea and creatinine clearance from a 24-hour urine collection. To&#xD;
      assess fluid status, the investigators will use three different assessment tools; 1)&#xD;
      echocardiography for measuring intra vena cava (IVC) diameter and left ventricular end&#xD;
      diastolic diameter, 2) measurement of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, 3) bioimpedence&#xD;
      analysis. Primary outcome is residual GFR change at 1-year and secondary outcome is change of&#xD;
      fluid status during the study period. Also, biochemical laboratory data such as hemoglobin,&#xD;
      hsCRP, plasma osmolality, and lipid profile, peritoneal equilibration test, dialysis&#xD;
      adequacy, and daily peritoneal glucose exposure will be monitored. At least 50 subjects (a&#xD;
      total of 100) would be required for each group to detect 50% difference of residual GFR&#xD;
      between the two groups if type I error rate is 5% and type II error is 20% given 30% of&#xD;
      drop-out rate during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preservation of residual renal function is of paramount importance because it is an&#xD;
      independent risk factor of mortality in PD patients. In addition, achievement of adequate&#xD;
      ultrafiltration is another crucial therapeutic goal to improve clinical outcomes in these&#xD;
      patients. In this regard, if these two goals can be accomplished by icodextrin, it would be&#xD;
      an ideal dialysis solution in PD practice. The investigators study will address this issue to&#xD;
      answer the unresolved question on the effect of icodextrin on residual renal function.&quot;&#xD;
