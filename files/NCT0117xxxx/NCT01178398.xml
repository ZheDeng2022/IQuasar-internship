    <textblock>
      Many pregnant women in the US do not consume enough docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an essential&#xD;
      nutrient found in fish. Apparently conflicting findings that fish consumption is beneficial&#xD;
      for the developing fetus, yet potentially toxic because of mercury contamination, have&#xD;
      created uncertainty about the appropriate fish consumption advice to provide pregnant women.&#xD;
      The investigators objective was to determine knowledge, behaviors, and received advice&#xD;
      regarding fish consumption among pregnant women who are infrequent consumers of fish.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fish is a healthful food that is the primary dietary source of elongated n-3 polyunsaturated&#xD;
      fatty acids (PUFA), nutrients essential for optimal neurodevelopment. Most pregnant women in&#xD;
      the US do not consume adequate n-3 PUFA. However, fish also may be contaminated with&#xD;
      methylmercury, and approximately 10% of women of childbearing age in the US have mercury&#xD;
      levels higher than recommended. Because the same food contains both essential nutrients and&#xD;
      harmful contaminants, substantial confusion reigns about the best course of action for&#xD;
      pregnant women. Additionally, it is not clear what fish consumption advice would be most&#xD;
      effective in changing women's fish consumption habits. The goal of this pilot study is to&#xD;
      perform formative work to allow us to develop and refine an intervention to promote&#xD;
      consumption of fish low in mercury and high in n-3 PUFA among pregnant women. This project,&#xD;
      together with a pilot RCT already funded, will serve as preliminary data to support a larger&#xD;
      RCT to evaluate the effects of the intervention on pregnancy outcomes and postpartum maternal&#xD;
      and infant health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims Aim 1. Among pregnant women, identify: 1) knowledge of the potential risks and&#xD;
      benefits associated with fish consumption during pregnancy; 2) awareness of current&#xD;
      recommendations for fish consumption by pregnant women; 3) the sources of information from&#xD;
      which they are learning about the health effects associated with fish intake; and 4)&#xD;
      facilitators and barriers to fish consumption, such as cost, availability, taste, and habits.&#xD;
      To achieve this aim, we will conduct focus groups with pregnant women in the Boston area who&#xD;
      are infrequent consumers of fish (defined as &lt;= 2 monthly fish servings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Develop materials for a planned intervention to increase consumption of fish high in&#xD;
      n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and low in methylmercury among pregnant women who are&#xD;
      infrequent consumers of fish at baseline. We will use results from Aim 1 to inform the&#xD;
      development of these materials.&#xD;
