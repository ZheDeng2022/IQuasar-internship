  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Until now it has been assumed that regular endurance training has a positive influence on&#xD;
      cardiac function and that the positive effect increases with increasing intensity. However,&#xD;
      little is known about the effects of intense endurance stress on the heart. According to&#xD;
      current knowledge repeated exposure to strenuous endurance activity may lead to minor but&#xD;
      possibly irreversible damage to the heart with resultant scarring of the heart's muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this study we attempt to find out by different analytical methods - in particular&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound of the heart - to what extent the heart&#xD;
      muscle is affected by an intense endurance exercise, i.e. the &quot;Jungfrau-Marathon&quot;, and which&#xD;
      changes can possibly be found. Due to repeated measurements we will obtain further&#xD;
      information on the short-term course of possible changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: A single bout of prolonged strenuous exercise (PSE) leads to transient alteration&#xD;
      in cardiac function accompanied by the appearance of biomarkers for myocardial damage.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the well documented cardio-protective effects of aerobic exercise of moderate&#xD;
      intensity, short- and long-term consequences of strenuous exercise are less clear. There is&#xD;
      increasing evidence that maintaining a high cardiac workload over a prolonged duration may&#xD;
      result in transient impairment of cardiac function. Recent studies have also reported a&#xD;
      transient increase in cardiac biomarkers after prolonged strenuous exercise. While in&#xD;
      patients with cardiac disease the presence of cardiac dysfunction and increased cardiac&#xD;
      biomarkers generally reflects myocardial damage, the impact of these observations in athletes&#xD;
      is ill defined. It is a matter of concern whether in athletes such findings simply reflect a&#xD;
      reversible response or whether repetitive events may lead to an accumulative cardiac damage.&#xD;
      Traditional echocardiographic methods used to determine potential cardiac changes in&#xD;
      morphology or function are investigator-dependent and may be subject to interference by&#xD;
      cardiac pre- and afterload. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging provides an&#xD;
      investigator-independent and objective method to quantify cardiac dimensions and function.&#xD;
      Delayed contrast enhancement MR imaging is a highly reproducible cardiovascular magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging technique to directly visualize myocardial edema, necrosis and fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To use cardiac and delayed contrast enhancement magnetic resonance imaging in combination&#xD;
      with echocardiographic methods to quantify cardiac dysfunction after a single competitive PSE&#xD;
      event and to study post-exercise changes in morphology and function as well as the&#xD;
      post-exercise dynamics of specific markers of myocardial damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac and delayed contrast enhancement magnetic resonance imaging will be used in&#xD;
      combination with echocardiographic methods to repetitively investigate post-exercise cardiac&#xD;
      function and morphology in 10 elite athletes finishing the &quot;Jungfrau Marathon&quot;. Biomarkers of&#xD;
      myocardial damage are assessed simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-exercise dynamics of the outcome parameters are followed over a minimum of 7 days after&#xD;
      the exercise.&#xD;
