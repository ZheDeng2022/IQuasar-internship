      RATIONALE: Genetically-modified neural stem cells (NSCs) that convert 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC)&#xD;
      into the chemotherapy agent 5-FU (fluorouracil) at sites of tumor in the brain may be an&#xD;
      effective treatment for glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies genetically-modified NSCs and 5-FC in patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgery for recurrent high-grade gliomas.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of intracerebral administration of NSCs in&#xD;
      combination with oral 5-FC in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the relationship between intracerebral and systemic concentrations of 5-FC&#xD;
      and 5-FU with increasing NSC dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To non-invasively assess the presence of 5-FU in the brain with the use of fluorine&#xD;
      (19F)-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)(no longer in effect as of 5/1/2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess for the possible development of immunogenicity against the NSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the intracerebral distribution of NSCs using iron-labeling as a cellular&#xD;
      tracker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To gather preliminary imaging data regarding perfusion permeability parameters and imaging&#xD;
      characteristics as shown on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies due to the presence of&#xD;
      NSCs in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine, at time of autopsy, the fate of the NSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After biopsy or surgery to resect tumor, study patients receive injections of genetically&#xD;
      modified NSCs directly into brain tissue on day 0. Patients then take oral 5-FC every 6 hours&#xD;
      during days 4-10 which is converted to 5-FU in the brain by the NSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up MRIs of the brain are performed on days 32, 60, and every 2 months thereafter to&#xD;
      assess for response and side effects.&#xD;
