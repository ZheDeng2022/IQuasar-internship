      The main objective of this study is to examine if absence of a satisfactory response on&#xD;
      DCE-WB-MRI (see MR criteria of responders section) after completion of HDT followed by&#xD;
      autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) is an independent prognostic factor for EFS in&#xD;
      patients with MM, compared with established ones including beta2-microglobulin and&#xD;
      cytogenetic abnormalities. Secondary objectives are to examine if the microcirculation&#xD;
      parameters obtained from baseline DCE-WB-MRI have prognostic significance and to examine if&#xD;
      early DCE-WB-MRI performed after the induction HDT and before ASCT might also provide&#xD;
      independent prognostic information for patient outcome, which might help in patient&#xD;
      stratification and be integrated into the response criteria in the future.&#xD;

      Introduction Bone marrow angiogenesis is increased in multiple myeloma (MM) and is an&#xD;
      important prognostic factor for survival. Newly diagnosed MM patients have higher microvessel&#xD;
      density (MVD) than controls on bone marrow biopsies. In addition, patients with higher MVD,&#xD;
      receiving conventional chemotherapy or high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation, have shorter median overall survival than those with lower MVD by using the&#xD;
      median MVD as the cutoff. In a study with 81 patients with MM treated with thalidomide with&#xD;
      or without dexamethasone, MVD decreased significantly in responders while no significant&#xD;
      change in MVD was seen in those failing to respond to thalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microcirculation variables derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (DCE-MR)&#xD;
      imaging, i.e. maximum enhancement and the exchange rate constant, correlate well with the&#xD;
      histologic infiltration grade, MVD and serum markers of disease activity. Recently, the&#xD;
      maximal amplitude of lumbar bone marrow enhancement on DCE-MR examination has been identified&#xD;
      as a prognostic variable for event-free survival (EFS) in progressive MM. These parameters&#xD;
      may serve as non-invasive surrogate biomarkers for determining prognosis and for assessing&#xD;
      treatment response in myeloma patients. However, these studies used techniques which were&#xD;
      limited to a maximal 400-mm field of view, whereas myeloma can involve the bone marrow&#xD;
      focally, diffusely throughout the body, or even outside the marrow space. With the&#xD;
      advancement of MR technologies, unenhanced whole-body MR imaging has proven more reliable&#xD;
      than radiological skeletal survey and whole-body multidetector computed tomography in&#xD;
      patients with MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, whole-body single-phase contrast-enhanced sequence was applied in combination with&#xD;
      unenhanced sequences for the detection of myeloma lesions. However, single-phase&#xD;
      post-contrast MR examinations do not provide detailed enhancement curves, and this limitation&#xD;
      possibly hinders the assessment of disease activity. On the other hand, segmental dynamic MR&#xD;
      examinations do not enable assessment of the dynamic enhancement of focal lesions in&#xD;
      different bone marrow segments. That was the reason which led us to develop a dynamic&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-WB-MRI) protocol, which was&#xD;
      never explored in MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of patients with MM was largely palliative until, with the advent of high-dose&#xD;
      melphalan, high rates of complete response (CR) could be obtained. For previously untreated&#xD;
      patients aged 70 years (amendment n°5)or younger, high-dose therapy (HDT) followed by&#xD;
      treatment (amendment n°3) with growth-factor-mobilized peripheral-blood stem cells (PBSCs)&#xD;
      have been demonstrated superior to conventional chemotherapy with not only higher CR rates&#xD;
      but also significantly extending EFS and overall survival. Recently, the International&#xD;
      Myeloma Working Group proposed new uniform response criteria to facilitate precise&#xD;
      comparisons between new evolving treatment strategies. As a functional imaging providing&#xD;
      parameters related to angiogenesis and disease activity in MM, DCE-WB-MRI might provide&#xD;
      additional information on prognostically important microcirculation variables on a whole-body&#xD;
      scale. It might also prove helpful in assessing treatment response and further treatment&#xD;
      strategy decision for patients with oligo- or nonsecretory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment regimen: the HDT followed by ASCT with PBSCs will be given. The ASCT will be&#xD;
      conditioned by high-dose melphalan (HDMel) 200 mg/m2 with or without bortezomib following the&#xD;
      actual guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response assessment: clinical response will be assessed on the same day of each&#xD;
      post-treatment MR examination and recorded according to the uniform response criteria. After&#xD;
      completion of HDT followed by ASCT, patients will be followed every 4 months for the first&#xD;
      two years and every 6 months thereafter for a total of at least 5 years. An event is defined&#xD;
      as disease progression, relapse from clinical CR/VGPR, or death from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DCE-WB-MRI schedule: three MR examinations will be performed, the first at diagnosis and&#xD;
      before initiation of chemotherapy, the second after induction chemotherapy and before ASCT,&#xD;
      and the third exam three months after ASCT. The results of each DCE-WB-MRI will not influence&#xD;
      further treatment strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR Criteria of Responders:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A satisfactory response on DCE-WB-MRI is defined by the presence of a maximal percentage of&#xD;
      bone marrow enhancement below 100%. All focal lesions, if present, must not present an early&#xD;
      enhancement but a progressive, delayed type maximal enhancement.&#xD;
