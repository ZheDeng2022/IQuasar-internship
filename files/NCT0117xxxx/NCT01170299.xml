      RATIONALE: Fiber may lessen bowel side effects caused by radiation therapy. It is not yet&#xD;
      known whether a high-fiber diet is more effective than a low-fiber diet in preventing bowel&#xD;
      side effects caused by radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying a high-fiber diet to see how well it&#xD;
      works compared with a low-fiber diet in preventing bowel side effects in patients undergoing&#xD;
      radiation therapy for gynecological cancer, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, or anal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy of a high- vs low-fiber intervention in preventing bowel&#xD;
           toxicity in patients receiving radical pelvic radiotherapy treatment for gynecological,&#xD;
           urological (bladder), colorectal, or anal malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare whether a high- or low-fiber intervention has any beneficial effect over no&#xD;
           intervention (i.e., ad-libitum fiber consumption).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the effect of a low- or high-fiber diet on gastrointestinal symptoms,&#xD;
           measured using the IBDQ-B and Bristol Stool Chart, in patients receiving radical&#xD;
           radiotherapy for pelvic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To minimize any potential risk associated with change in fiber intake by using a&#xD;
           controlled and gradual dietary-based intervention combined with dietetic advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the relationship between volume of irradiated bowel and onset of&#xD;
           gastrointestinal symptoms as measured by the Bristol Stool Chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure percentage compliance with fiber prescription through validated dietetic&#xD;
           techniques including the 7-day Food Diary using household measures and the 24-hour&#xD;
           recall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (gynecological vs gastrointestinal) and&#xD;
      concomitant therapy (received vs not received). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (low-fiber diet): Patients are assessed by a qualified dietitian, receive written&#xD;
           guidance, and are counseled as to how best to meet their study fiber prescription of a&#xD;
           low-fiber diet, comprising 'not more than' 10 g of fiber per day for up to 7 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (high-fiber diet): Patients are assessed by a qualified dietitian, receive&#xD;
           written guidance, and are counseled as to how best to meet their study fiber&#xD;
           prescription of a high-fiber diet, comprising a target of between 18 and 22 g of fiber&#xD;
           per day for up to 7 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm III (no intervention): Patients receive advice designed to ensure they maintain&#xD;
           their normal habitual diet for up to 7 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergo radiotherapy once daily comprising approximately 25 (or more) fractions&#xD;
      in total to be delivered for 5-7 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are asked to complete two 7-day Food Diaries at baseline and end of radiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment. All patients keep a daily record of stool characteristics and frequency using the&#xD;
      Bristol Stool Chart. Patients also complete a short 1-page weekly-cost questionnaire to&#xD;
      assess the economic impact of symptom management. Patients in arms I and II complete several&#xD;
      additional questions regarding the costs (if any) of adhering to their fiber prescription and&#xD;
      the palatability of the diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and stool samples may be collected at baseline and during study therapy for biomarker&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 1 year.&#xD;
