    <textblock>
      By doing this study, researchers hope to understand the many changes that occur in the blood&#xD;
      of people who have chronic GvHD. This may also help the researcher understand how ECP works&#xD;
      and help guide therapy for patients who have chronic GvHD in the future.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The occurrence of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and its&#xD;
      prevention/treatment induce further immunologic compromise. Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)&#xD;
      accounts for significant morbidity and mortality in recipients of allogeneic bone marrow&#xD;
      transplants (BMT) or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplants. The condition occurs as&#xD;
      donor lymphocytes recognize the recipient's tissue as foreign and mount an inflammatory and&#xD;
      destructive response in the recipient. GvHD has a predilection for epithelial tissues,&#xD;
      especially skin, liver, and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract. This can lead to severe&#xD;
      skin lesions, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and liver failure. In addition, people with GvHD&#xD;
      are especially susceptible to infection. Approximately 30-70% of people undergoing allogeneic&#xD;
      HSCT for hematologic malignancies can anticipate experiencing acute and/or chronic GVHD. The&#xD;
      physical consequences depend on the severity of GVHD, but moderate to severe organ system&#xD;
      involvement is associated with substantial medical morbidity and mortality. The current&#xD;
      standard of care treatment for patients with chronic graft-vs-host disease is steroid&#xD;
      treatment with or without a calcineurin inhibitor. This treatment, while effective for some,&#xD;
      does not control the chronic gvhd of all. The use of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) was&#xD;
      developed in patients with several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including&#xD;
      scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis. Successful use of ECP has also been reported in&#xD;
      patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma, the Sezary syndrome variant, cardiac and lung&#xD;
      transplant rejection and other T cell mediated/autoimmune and autoimmune diseases and even&#xD;
      after facial transplantation. More recently, ECP has proven to be a highly effective useful&#xD;
      tool in the treatment of GvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact mechanism of action of ECP is unknown, but the principle of the process is to&#xD;
      induce leucocyte apoptosis with UVA radiation after their exposure to psoralens, which are&#xD;
      light sensitizers. These leukocytes are immediately re-infused into the patient, where they&#xD;
      undergo early apoptosis. Following apoptosis, the leukocytes are engulfed by macrophage or&#xD;
      other antigen-presenting cells, such as immature dendritic cells, in an anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokine environment. The anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion pattern, with a switch from&#xD;
      TH1 to TH2 for CD4+ lymphocytes, and the engulfment by immature cells without co-stimulatory&#xD;
      molecules induces anergy, by deleting effector T-cells that responded to the presented&#xD;
      antigens. An increase in regulatory T-cells (T-regs) is also induced after ECP and may&#xD;
      contribute to allograft acceptance by the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECP has also been effective in treating solid organ transplant rejection and improving the&#xD;
      course of various autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosis, and pemphigus vulgaris. Since the early 1990s, ECP has been investigated as a&#xD;
      rescue immunotherapy for patients with steroid resistant acute and chronic GVHD. ECP is&#xD;
      generally well tolerated and Phase II data have confirmed activity in more than 250 patients&#xD;
      with steroid-refractory cGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECP involves the isolation of peripheral blood buffy coat cells, ex vivo exposure of the&#xD;
      cells to 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and ultraviolet-A radiation, and subsequent re-infusion of&#xD;
      the treated cells to the patient. The combination of 8-MOP and PUVA results in DNA crosslinks&#xD;
      and causes apoptosis. However, the direct induction of lymphocyte apoptosis is unlikely to&#xD;
      account for the clinical efficacy of ECP given that less than 10% of circulating leukocytes&#xD;
      are exposed to PUVA during ECP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of ECP beyond the effects of apoptosis induction is incompletely understood.&#xD;
      Studies to date suggest that ECP in autoimmune conditions or GVHD stimulates anti-idiotypic&#xD;
      responses against host tissue-reactive T cell clones, attenuates antigen-presenting function&#xD;
      by type 2 dendritic cells, and induces anti-inflammatory cytokine responses. In addition, an&#xD;
      important component of tolerance induction is thought to involve the expansion of Tregs that&#xD;
      suppress alloreactive mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECP therapy has been studied in two well-defined minor MHC incompatible murine models of CD8+&#xD;
      or CD4+ T cell mediated GVHD. These studies showed that ECP treated cells could successfully&#xD;
      reverse established GVHD by reducing allogeneic responses of donor effector T cells and&#xD;
      generating FOXP3+ Tregs from donor cells that had not been directly exposed to PUVA, thereby&#xD;
      ruling out a mechanistic role for direct apoptosis of effector cells. The increase in Tregs&#xD;
      occurred early after the infusion of ECP treated cells, remained stable for several weeks,&#xD;
      and was required to reduce GVHD and mortality after BMT. Correlative data in humans is&#xD;
      preliminary, but one small case series has shown an increase in the percentage of functional&#xD;
      Tregs after 6 ECP procedures from 8.9% to 29% of the total circulating CD4+ cells (p = .05).&#xD;
      UVAR Photopheresis System (Therakos, Inc., Exton, PA, USA) was approved for ECP treatment of&#xD;
      advanced cutaneous T cell lymphoma in 1988 by the Food and Drug Administration. In 2009 FDA&#xD;
      approval was granted for this indication for the new Cellex machine.&#xD;
