    <textblock>
      Racism and health care system distrust are potent stressors and may be associated with&#xD;
      preterm birth (PTB). Additionally, cervical shortening is a common pathway leading to PTB.&#xD;
      This study is enrolling a prospective cohort of pregnant women. The study assesses racial&#xD;
      discrimination, health care system distrust, and cervical change using 2 questionnaires,&#xD;
      exam, and protein levels in cervical vaginal fluid and maternal serum.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Preterm birth (PTB) is currently the most important maternal and child health problem in the&#xD;
      United States. It is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and a significant contributor to&#xD;
      neonatal morbidity. In the United States, approximately 12% of all live births are born&#xD;
      preterm, an incidence that continues to rise. The extreme cost of PTB resides not only in the&#xD;
      immediate neonatal care but also in the longterm care of lasting morbidities resulting from&#xD;
      prematurity. Effective prevention or treatment of PTB could significantly lower neonatal&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity as well as health care costs. In the United States, PTB costs on the&#xD;
      order of 28 billion dollars a year. But, this cost does not stop at the delivery. The costs&#xD;
      of prolonged hospital care after birth and the increased need for hospital admission during&#xD;
      the first year of life for ex-preterm infants is significant and confers a large economic&#xD;
      burden on our society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that PTB rates in the United States are highest for Black infants (17.9%),&#xD;
      followed by Native Americans (14%), White infants (11.8%), and Asian infants (10%). The&#xD;
      specific large disparity between black and white infants is striking and the etiology of this&#xD;
      disparity is not fully understood. This disparity persists even after adjusting for&#xD;
      socioeconomic status. Maternal stress has been implicated as a potential cause of PTB. Racism&#xD;
      is a potent lifetime stressor in the lives of Black women in particular. It is plausible that&#xD;
      perceptions of racism as well as distrust in the health care system may explain the&#xD;
      persistent racial disparities in PTB, especially through mediation of other factors&#xD;
      associated with premature birth. The data to date offer a preventative strategy only to those&#xD;
      women with a prior PTB. These women represent a small percent of all women with a PTB. More&#xD;
      then half of all PTB occur in apparently low risk pregnancies. Cervical shortening appears to&#xD;
      be a common biological pathway leading to preterm birth, often well in advance of PTB.&#xD;
      Regardless of etiology of PTB, cervical change must occur. The cervix must remodel (change)&#xD;
      for birth to occur at any gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that experiences of discrimination and health care system distrust are&#xD;
      associated with preterm birth. Further, we hypothesize that premature cervical remodeling&#xD;
      occurs weeks prior to actual birth and may be able to be detected in women at highest risk&#xD;
      for preterm birth (nulliparous women-women who have not previously carried a pregnancy beyond&#xD;
      15 weeks). This study investigates whether experiences of discrimination and health care&#xD;
      system distrust are associated with PTB in all women (group 1). It also investigates if the&#xD;
      detection of cervical remodeling (changes in the cervix measured by protein levels,&#xD;
      ultrasound length and physical exam) can accurately identify those women at greatest risk for&#xD;
      PTB-nulliparous (group 2). A prospective cohort of pregnant women will be enrolled. All&#xD;
      enrolled women are asked to complete validated questionnaires about experiences of&#xD;
      discrimination and health care system distrust. Nulliparous women are evaluated for cervical&#xD;
      change, through a comprehensive evaluation at 18-24 weeks. The main outcome assessed is&#xD;
      preterm birth.&#xD;
