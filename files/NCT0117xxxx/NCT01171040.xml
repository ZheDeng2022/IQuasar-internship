      Left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) has prognostic significance in patients with heart&#xD;
      failure. Traditionally, it should be assessed by invasive method, as cardiac catheterization&#xD;
      and Swan-Gung catheter. In advance of new techniques and modality, echocardiography provides&#xD;
      some useful parameters for assessing LVFP, such myocardial tissue Doppler imaging. Many&#xD;
      articles had documented that peak velocity of early-diastolic trans-mitral inflow velocity&#xD;
      divided by early-diastolic velocity over mitral annulus correlated closely to LVFP. However,&#xD;
      myocardial tissue Doppler only provides the information of regional myocardium, so patients&#xD;
      with regional wall motion abnormality, as coronary artery disease, can't be assessed by this&#xD;
      method without handicap. In addition, conduction disturbance, like bundle branch block, also&#xD;
      influences the result of myocardial tissue Doppler. For resolving those problems, the&#xD;
      investigators had designed a new global parameter to assess LVFP. In the investigators prior&#xD;
      study, left atrial distensibility correlated logarithmically to LVFP in patients with severe&#xD;
      mitral regurgitation and also in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Left atrial&#xD;
      distensibility provided a new viewpoint to assess left ventricular diastolic function and to&#xD;
      predict prognosis. This time, to extend left atrial distensibility to general population&#xD;
      received echocardiographic examination for predicting prognosis is attempted.&#xD;

      Introduction High left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) have been associated with volume&#xD;
      overload in patients with heart failure and have also been correlated to some extent with&#xD;
      more severe symptoms and lower survival rates. In a study of more than 1000 patients&#xD;
      hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure, those with persistently elevated LVFP&#xD;
      more than 18 mmHg had increased 1-year mortality compared with those with LVFP less than 16&#xD;
      mmHg. Investigators have also demonstrated that acute reduction of LVFP with vasodilator&#xD;
      therapy can improve cardiac function and reduce mortality risk, suggesting that LVFP is an&#xD;
      appropriate marker of cardiac risk and functional improvement. However, LVFP measurement&#xD;
      involves invasive catheterization, limiting its clinical use especially in the outpatient&#xD;
      setting. In advance of new techniques and modality, echocardiography provides some useful&#xD;
      parameters to assess LVFP, such myocardial tissue Doppler imaging. Many articles had&#xD;
      documented that peak velocity of early-diastolic trans-mitral inflow velocity divided by&#xD;
      early-diastolic velocity over mitral annulus was closed correlated with LVFP. However,&#xD;
      myocardial tissue Doppler only provides the information of regional myocardium, so patients&#xD;
      with regional wall motion abnormality, such as coronary artery disease, can't be assessed by&#xD;
      this method without handicap. In addition, conduction disturbance, like bundle branch block,&#xD;
      also influences the result of myocardial tissue Doppler. For resolving those problems, we&#xD;
      will design a new global parameter to assess LVFP. In prior study, we disclosed the&#xD;
      logarithmic relationship between LVFP and left atrial distensibility in acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction patient received primary coronary intervention. This time, to extend our&#xD;
      conclusion to general population received echocardiographic examination is attempted.&#xD;
      Additionally, we infer that left atrial distensibility which indicates LVFP would influence&#xD;
      long-term prognosis, including the event rate of cardiovascular event, stroke and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose Left atrial size, particularly left atrial volume, has been recognized as a marker of&#xD;
      left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Contrary to flow and tissue Doppler parameters, left&#xD;
      atrial volume is independent of acute volume load and therefore may provide a more accurate&#xD;
      assessment of acute and chronic left ventricular dysfunction. In addition, the measurement of&#xD;
      left atrial volume is lack of some handicaps of tissue Doppler, including regional myocardial&#xD;
      dysfunction in coronary artery disease and bundle branch block. In recent studies,&#xD;
      end-systolic left atrial volume (maximal left atrial volume) was useful to predict the risk&#xD;
      of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery. The short-term and long-term prognosis of acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction was also associated with left atrial volume. In patients with mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation, it could be used to reliably estimate the regurgitant volume. Despite&#xD;
      end-systolic left atrial volume provides prognostic significance in many disease entities,&#xD;
      left atrium is filling and empty in dynamic cyclic motion, so we speculate that left atrial&#xD;
      distensibility, defined as the percentage change of left atrial volume between end-systolic&#xD;
      and end-diastolic phase, has more prognostic power to represent LVFP and to predict the&#xD;
      prognosis. Based on the phenomenon of that higher LVFP, which will conduct to and stretch&#xD;
      left atrium in diastolic phase, induces left atrial distension and makes the reduction of&#xD;
      distensibility between end-systolic and end-diastolic phases, we had proved the logarithmic&#xD;
      relationship between left atrial distensibility and LVFP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2000 consecutive patients received echocardiographic examinations will be enrolled. The&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are including (1) patients with prosthetic mitral valves or mitral&#xD;
      stenosis, (2) rhythm other than sinus rhythm, (3) age more than 18 years-old, (4) inadequate&#xD;
      image quality, (5) lack of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional echocardiographic measurement and myocardial tissue Doppler:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All studies are performed by experienced sonographers and reviewed by staff cardiologists&#xD;
      with advanced training in echocardiography. Left ventricular function is assessed by&#xD;
      Simpson's method. Mitral regurgitation is graded with color flow imaging. Mitral inflow is&#xD;
      assessed with pulsed wave Doppler echocardiography form the apical 4-chamber view. The&#xD;
      Doppler bean is aligned parallel to the direction of flow, and a 1- to 2-mm sample volume is&#xD;
      placed between the tips of mitral leaflets during diastole. From the mitral inflow profile,&#xD;
      the E- and A-wave velocity, E-deceleration time, and E/A velocity ration are measured.&#xD;
      Pulmonary venous flow is recorded with pulsed-wave Doppler with a sample volume placed 1 cm&#xD;
      into the right upper pulmonary vein. The flow velocities are recorded, and the ratio of&#xD;
      systolic to diastolic forward flow (S/D ratio) is calculated. Doppler tissue imaging of&#xD;
      mitral annulus over septal, lateral and inferior borders is also obtained from apical views.&#xD;
      Diastolic filling is categorized as normal (grade 0), impaired relaxation (grade 1),&#xD;
      pseudonormalization (grade 2), and restrictive (grade 3) by a combination of transmitral and&#xD;
      pulmonary flow patterns as validated previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left atrial volume measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left atrial volume is assessed by the biplane area-length method from apical 4- and 2-chamber&#xD;
      views. The volumes are measured at end-systolic (just before mitral valve opening or the&#xD;
      largest dimension), pre-atrial contraction (just before P wave), and end-diastolic (the&#xD;
      smallest dimension or the onset of QRS complex), using the highest frame rate. The left&#xD;
      atrial outlines at those three phases retrace off-line for three consecutive beats, then&#xD;
      average. The recesses of the pulmonary veins and the left atrial appendage are excluded. The&#xD;
      length of left atrium is that of the perpendicular line measured from the middle of the plane&#xD;
      of the mitral annulus to the superior aspect of the left atrium. The left atrial volume is&#xD;
      calculated as: 0.85 x 4-chamber area x 2-chamber area ÷ the shorter of the two lengths. The&#xD;
      volume is indexed for body surface area. Left atrial distensibility is defined as:&#xD;
      (end-systole left atrial volume - end-diastole left atrial volume) ÷ end-systole left atrial&#xD;
      volume. Left atrial ejection fraction is calculated as: (pre-atrial contraction volume -&#xD;
      end-diastole left atrial volume) ÷ pre-atrial contraction volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes are determined 1-year after indexed examination. Follow-up included&#xD;
      assessment for the occurrence of sudden death, heart failure with hospitalization, atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, stroke, and death (both cardiac and non-cardiac) per 3 months by telephone&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interobserver variability:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cases, atrial volume is measured by two observers independently. Interobserver&#xD;
      variability is calculated as the difference between the values obtained by the tow observers&#xD;
      divided by the mean.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPSS software is used for statistical analysis. All continuous variables are presented as&#xD;
      mean ± standard deviation. Comparison of clinical and echocardiographic characteristics is&#xD;
      performed by chi-square analysis for categorical variables and by Student t test for&#xD;
      echocardiography and other continuous variables. A p value &lt; 0.05 is considered significant.&#xD;
      Patients will be subdivided to four quartiles according to left atrial distensibility.&#xD;
      Unadjusted survival curves are produced using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test is&#xD;
      used to compare survival curves. Adjusted survival curves are constructed using variables&#xD;
      entered into the Cox model set to their mean values in the total population. The hazard ratio&#xD;
      of low left atrial distensibility will be assessed by comparing quartile to quartile.&#xD;
