  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) continues to have a profound impact on individuals, families,&#xD;
      and the health care system. Despite marked success in treating active individual episodes of&#xD;
      unipolar depression, our understanding of the neural and cognitive mechanisms involved in the&#xD;
      return of symptoms remains extremely limited, and few interventions exist that specifically&#xD;
      target factors involved in prophylaxis. The research being proposed is among the first that&#xD;
      is designed to examine neurocognitive markers for depressive relapse vulnerability and link&#xD;
      them directly to clinical prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Cortical midline structures (CMS) network recruitment will be associated with&#xD;
      behavioural and neural indices of a reflexive attentional bias towards dysphoric stimuli in a&#xD;
      divided attention task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Behavioural and neural indices of dysphoric attentional bias following mood&#xD;
      challenge will predict depression relapse in prospective 18-month follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Relative to CBT, Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) will normalize CMS&#xD;
      and right insular/fronto-opercular cortices (INS-FO) network imbalance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: Relative to CBT, MBCT will normalize to healthy control levels, behavioural and&#xD;
      neural indices of dysphoric attentional bias, which will be predictive of reduced relapse&#xD;
      risk across a 24 month follow up.&#xD;

      Relapse and recurrence following recovery from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are common and&#xD;
      debilitating outcomes that carry enormous social costs [1-3]. Our CIHR funded program of&#xD;
      research has studied the nature of psychological vulnerability in affective disorder. We have&#xD;
      recently identified the activation of a depressive cognitive mode triggered by temporary&#xD;
      dysphoric states as a reliable risk marker for depressive relapse [4, see attached]. In&#xD;
      parallel, functional imaging studies have increased our understanding of the neural&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying normative affective responses [5] and have begun to examine their&#xD;
      dysregulation in affective disorder [6-8]. Our research has identified potential brain&#xD;
      biomarkers that predict episode relapse in unipolar depression. However, it remains unknown&#xD;
      how these potential biomarkers are related to dysphoria-triggered information processing&#xD;
      modes that also predict relapse, and whether these neurocognitive vulnerabilities are&#xD;
      amenable to intervention, resulting in more lasting prophylaxis. The present proposal employs&#xD;
      a cognitive neuroscience approach to examine whether our previously identified neural markers&#xD;
      of depression relapse and prophylaxis are associated with a dysphoric information processing&#xD;
      mode. In particular, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioural&#xD;
      probes to undertake a finely tuned examination of mood linked biases in attention toward&#xD;
      dysphoric stimulus events (i.e., sad faces) to link our previously identified neural markers&#xD;
      with a specific information processing mode. Further, our preliminary data presented here&#xD;
      demonstrate a correlation between these mood linked neural markers and relapse, but we cannot&#xD;
      demonstrate that these markers are causally related to relapse or prophylaxis. To address&#xD;
      this, we will examine whether these markers and associated dysphoric attentional biases are&#xD;
      1) modifiable via attentional training designed to overcome reflexive modes of thought and&#xD;
      perception and 2) are predictive of relapse status across an 24-month prospective follow up&#xD;
      of treated patients. This research will elucidate the neural and information processing&#xD;
      correlates that may signal relapse risk in recovered depressed patients. This knowledge will&#xD;
      increase our limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying enduring depressive relapse&#xD;
      vulnerability as well as assess potentially efficient strategies for relapse prophylaxis.&#xD;

Patients participate in 8 weekly sessions, each of which incorporates didactic and experiential learning, along with home practice of mindfulness skills taught in the program.</description>
