  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About one-third of the patients who develop mild, acute confusion (i.e., subsyndromal&#xD;
      delirium) will go on to develop a severe acute confusional state (i.e. delirium). Delirium&#xD;
      refers to a temporary change in the way a person thinks about things. Delirium occurs in&#xD;
      patients admitted to the hospital particularly those patients that are very sick, who are&#xD;
      given a number of medications, and who are not able to sleep normally. It affects their&#xD;
      behavior, their understanding of the people and things around them, and their ability to make&#xD;
      decisions. While ICU doctors do everything possible to eliminate the factors that may cause&#xD;
      delirium, delirium may cause a person to become very agitated which if not controlled is&#xD;
      dangerous to their safety as well as the safety of those around them. As well, if delirium&#xD;
      develops in patients in the ICU, it may increase the risk for death, keep patients in both&#xD;
      the ICU and hospital for longer and send patients to a long term care facility rather than&#xD;
      home after they are discharged from the hospital. A recent medical report found that patients&#xD;
      in the ICU who develop subsyndromal delirium have a mortality rate, a length of stay in both&#xD;
      the ICU and the hospital, and a transfer rate to a long term care facility that is nearly as&#xD;
      great as patients with delirium and greater than patients who develop neither subsyndromal&#xD;
      delirium or delirium. Recent studies in non-ICU patients suggest that if a patient who is at&#xD;
      high risk for developing delirium receives a medication called an antipsychotic (e.g.&#xD;
      haloperidol) they may not be as likely to develop delirium or if they do develop delirium it&#xD;
      will not last as long. No studies have evaluated the effect of administering an antipsychotic&#xD;
      in patients in the ICU who have subsyndromal delirium. Another study completed in the ICUs at&#xD;
      Tufts Medical Center found that there may be an association between the development of&#xD;
      delirium in patients with subsyndromal delirium and the use of haloperidol. However, this&#xD;
      small study had many limitations and thus it is not currently known whether using haloperidol&#xD;
      in patients with subsyndromal delirium will actually cause fewer of these patients to develop&#xD;
      delirium. Haloperidol makes a person sleepy and helps control behavior like agitation.&#xD;
      Haloperidol is the drug that is used most often to help control delirium in the ICU. This&#xD;
      prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled study will determine if haloperidol&#xD;
      administered through the vein four times daily (1mg IV q6h) to patients who have subsyndromal&#xD;
      delirium, and who are on a breathing machine and being cared for by the Medical ICU service&#xD;
      at Tufts Medical Center, will help prevent patients from developing delirium. A total of 68&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled. Exclusion criteria are extensive and include conditions that&#xD;
      could affect the ability to determine if delirium is present or increase the risk for side&#xD;
      effects related to the administration of haloperidol. Patients older than 80 will be excluded&#xD;
      from the study. Study medication (i.e. haloperidol) will be administered until one the&#xD;
      following occurs: 1) delirium develops (that is confirmed by a staff psychiatrist or his&#xD;
      designate, 2) the patient is discharged from the ICU at Tufts Medical Center, 3) the patient&#xD;
      has received haloperidol or placebo for 10 days or 4) an adverse event potentially&#xD;
      attributable to the study drug is experienced by a patient that is deemed, in the opinion of&#xD;
      a pulmonologist member of the investigative team to warrant discontinuation of therapy.&#xD;
      Haloperidol may cause unwanted side effects such as low blood pressure, twitching, and an&#xD;
      unsafe abnormal heart rhythm. Patients with chronic confusion (e.g., a dementia such as&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease) should not receive haloperidol and will not be included in this study.&#xD;
      Patients will be carefully monitored for side effects that are potentially related to&#xD;
      haloperidol. Patients who become confusion-free in the ICU before they leave the ICU (i.e.,&#xD;
      have no subsyndromal delirium) will be asked to provide consent for all research activities&#xD;
      that occured in the ICU. If patients where cognition is regained (ie. no subsyndromal&#xD;
      delirium or delirium) are not willing to provide consent then any study data collected from&#xD;
      them while they were in the ICU will be destroyed and they will not be approached to&#xD;
      participate in the post-ICU component of the study. This study also seeks to understand how&#xD;
      the use of haloperidol in the ICU in patients with subsyndromal delirium may have affect&#xD;
      memory, emotional status, happiness, ability to function, and quality of sleep in patients&#xD;
      after they leave the ICU. Patients (that do not have delirium based on CAM screening at the&#xD;
      time the 3-10 day and 6 month assessments are attempted) will be approached to participate in&#xD;
      this post-ICU component of the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Delirium occurs in up to 50% of patients who are not mechanically ventilated and up to 80% of&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) patients who are mechanically ventilated. Even after controlling&#xD;
      for preexisting morbidities, severity of illness, coma and use of sedatives, patients who&#xD;
      develop delirium in the ICU are more than 3-times as likely to be dead at 6 months compared&#xD;
      to those patients who do not develop delirium. (1-4) Additionally, ICU delirium is predictive&#xD;
      of a threefold-higher reintubation rate and &gt; 10 additional days in the hospital. (5) Each&#xD;
      additional day of mechanical ventilation places patients at increased risk for&#xD;
      life-threatening sequelae such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and barotrauma. The&#xD;
      sequelae of delirium are cumulative; for example, each additional day spent in delirium is&#xD;
      associated with a 20% increased risk of prolonged hospitalization and a 10% increased risk of&#xD;
      death. Given these negative outcomes, it is not surprising that delirium is independently&#xD;
      associated with substantially higher ICU and total hospital costs than for patients who do&#xD;
      not develop delirium. (6) Up to a quarter of patients who develop delirium in the ICU develop&#xD;
      long-term cognitive impairment that frequently manifests as dementia. (7-10) This post-ICU&#xD;
      long-term cognitive impairment affects memory, attention, and executive function. It&#xD;
      therefore compromises the ability to return to work, impairs activities of daily living,&#xD;
      increases the need for institutionalization, and decreases quality of life. (11-13) More than&#xD;
      5,000,000 patients are admitted to an ICU in the United States each year. Delirium may&#xD;
      develop in up 80% of these patients. (1, 2, 14) It is therefore critical that interventions&#xD;
      that can prevent delirium from occurring in the ICU be discovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the negative sequelae of delirium, current practice guidelines recommend routine&#xD;
      delirium screening in the ICU with a validated screening tool such as the confusion&#xD;
      assessment method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) or the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist&#xD;
      (ICDSC). (15-17) The ICDSC (Appendix 1) is an 8-item checklist producing a score between 0&#xD;
      and 8, where each item (corresponding to a value of 1 out of 8) reflects a DSM-IV (or&#xD;
      alternative) diagnostic characteristic of delirium and has many advantages over the CAM-ICU.&#xD;
      (15, 16, 18) The data are collected in real-time during each nursing shift. An ICDSC score â‰¥&#xD;
      4 has been shown to highly correlate with a formal psychiatric diagnosis of delirium using&#xD;
      DSM-IV criteria (sensitivity 99%, ROC curve area = 0.901), and has excellent inter-observer&#xD;
      reliability between nurses and between nurses and critical care physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent investigations, both within and outside of the ICU, have moved beyond simply assigning&#xD;
      patients the dichotomous outcome of either being delirious or not, and instead focused on&#xD;
      grading the severity of delirium. (19, 20) Patients who have some of the characteristics of&#xD;
      delirium, but not full clinical delirium, are deemed to have subsyndromal delirium.[10] The&#xD;
      ICDSC, given that its 8 different domains have each been shown to have good item reliability&#xD;
      towards the diagnosis of delirium, allows one to identify those ICU patients that fall short&#xD;
      of the threshold diagnostic criteria for overt or 'clinical delirium' but who still may have&#xD;
      clinically important sub-syndromal delirium (ie. an ICDSC of 1-3). (19)&#xD;
&#xD;
      One recent ICU study compared the outcomes of patients who developed sub-syndromal delirium&#xD;
      (ICDSC 1 to 3) over the course of their ICU stay to those who developed delirium (ICDSC â‰¥ 4)&#xD;
      or who developed neither delirium or subsyndromal delirium (ICDSC = 0). In their study of 537&#xD;
      consecutive, non-comatose patients, 31.5% developed neither clinical delirium or subsyndromal&#xD;
      delirium, 33.3% developed subsyndromal delirium (but not clinical delirium) and 35.3%&#xD;
      developed clinical delirium. Patients who developed subsyndromal delirium had an ICU&#xD;
      mortality rate that was more than 4x greater than patients who developed neither clinical&#xD;
      delirium or subsyndromal delirium (10.6% vs 2.4%, p=0.002). In addition, the patients who&#xD;
      developed subsyndromal delirium, when compared to those patients without clinical or&#xD;
      subsyndromal delirium, had both significantly longer ICU and hospital lengths of stays and&#xD;
      were more likely to be discharged to a long-term care facility than home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When correction of the potential causative factors for delirium fails to reverse delirium,&#xD;
      clinicians frequently turn to antipsychotic therapy. (21) Haloperidol remains the first-line&#xD;
      pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of delirium by critical care clinicians and is&#xD;
      advocated for use in this population by practice guidelines. (14, 22) One large retrospective&#xD;
      cohort analysis, where potential confounding variables were addressed, found that use of&#xD;
      haloperidol within 2 days of mechanical ventilation reduced death. (23)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two recent studies demonstrate the benefit of antipsychotic therapy in non-ICU patients at&#xD;
      high risk for developing delirium. (23, 24) In one randomized study of elderly patients&#xD;
      undergoing hip surgery, a population at high risk for developing delirium, administration of&#xD;
      oral haloperidol 0.5mg q8h decreased the average Delirium Rating Scale (DRS) Score (14.4 Â±&#xD;
      3.4 vs 18.4 Â± 4.3, p &lt; 0.001), the duration of delirium (5.4 vs 11.8 days, p &lt; 0.001) and the&#xD;
      mean number of days in the hospital (17.1Â± 11.1 vs 22.6 Â± 16.7, p &lt; 0.001). No&#xD;
      haloperidol-related side effects were noted. (23) A more recent placebo-controlled study&#xD;
      demonstrated that the post-operative administration of a single dose of risperidone in&#xD;
      patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery decreased the incidence of delirium from&#xD;
      31.7% to 11.1% (p= 0.009). (24) It should be noted that neither of these studies enrolled ICU&#xD;
      patients and the incidence of subsyndromal delirium at baseline was not measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and efficacy of treating ICU patients with delirium symptoms with antipsychotic&#xD;
      therapy has not been evaluated. Recent data highlights the deleterious sequelae of&#xD;
      subsyndromal delirium in the ICU. In addition, the results of two studies demonstrate the&#xD;
      benefits of administering low-dose antipsychotic therapy in patients at high risk for&#xD;
      delirium. We therefore hypothesize that treatment of subsyndromal delirium in the critically&#xD;
      ill with haloperidol will prevent progression to clinical delirium. This should be associated&#xD;
      with decreased agitation, a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, and improved&#xD;
      cognitive function after ICU discharge. Given the documented safety of low-dose haloperidol&#xD;
      therapy in clinical practice, we anticipate the potential risk-benefit ratio for this&#xD;
      intervention to be low - particularly in an ICU environment where patients receive continuous&#xD;
      cardio- respiratory monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically ill patients with subsyndromal delirium (ICDSC 1-3) are also at risk for&#xD;
      substantial morbidity and mortality and are at high risk for developing delirium (ICDSC â‰¥ 4).&#xD;
      Recent studies suggest that the administration of low-dose antipsychotic therapy to non-ICU&#xD;
      patients at risk for delirium prevents transition to delirium, reduces delirium severity and&#xD;
      shortens length of hospital stay without causing adverse effects. Given that up 1.5 million&#xD;
      Americans may develop subsyndromal delirium each year, an intervention that is found to be&#xD;
      safe and effective, particularly if it is of low cost, will have a profound impact on the&#xD;
      U.S. healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subsyndromal risk factor study evaluated ICSDC nursing assessment data for 100 consecutive&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the ICU at Tufts MC for â‰¥ 24 hours without a&#xD;
      neurologic reason for admission (e.g., acute stroke) or having acute alcohol withdrawal. Of&#xD;
      the 100 patients, 72 developed subsyndromal delirium (ICDSC 1 to 3). Of these 72 patients, 26&#xD;
      (36%) went on to develop delirium (ICDSC â‰¥ 4) during their ICU admission. The remaining 28&#xD;
      patients developed neither subsyndromal delirium or delirium over the course of their ICU&#xD;
      stay. For the 26 patients who developed delirium, we found that only 2 of the patients&#xD;
      received â‰¥ 1 dose of haloperidol therapy in the period prior to when delirium was first&#xD;
      identified. In contrast, for the 46 patients with subsyndromal delirium who did not progress&#xD;
      to delirium, 14 of these patients received â‰¥ 1 dose of haloperidol during their ICU stay.&#xD;
      Therefore, there was a weak association for a lower incidence of delirium in those patients&#xD;
      with subsyndromal delirium who received â‰¥ 1 dose of haloperidol at any time during their ICU&#xD;
      admission than patients who did not receive haloperidol [2/16 (12.5%) vs 24/56 (43%), p &lt;&#xD;
      0.0001]. This retrospective, observational data suggests that patients with subsyndromal&#xD;
      delirium who are exposed to haloperidol may remain in subsyndromal delirium and not progress&#xD;
      to delirium. However, there are many methodological limitations with this pilot study thus it&#xD;
      remains unknown if administering low-dose haloperidol to ICU patients with subsyndromal&#xD;
      delirium will prevent the development of delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past 3 years, our delirium research group, a joint collaboration between&#xD;
      Northeastern University and Tufts Medical Center has conducted a number of studies&#xD;
      surrounding the identification and treatment of delirium in the ICU environment. (18, 26-29)&#xD;
      A three-hospital evaluation lead by our group found that an educational intervention&#xD;
      consisting of both patient cases using script concordance theory and a didactic presentation&#xD;
      improved the ability of the bedside nurse to use the ICDSC correctly and to recognize&#xD;
      delirium when compared to a judge. (26) Another study our group conducted found physician use&#xD;
      of the ICDSC improves their ability to recognize delirium compared to a validated judge. (27)&#xD;
      A large regional survey focusing on critical care nurse preferences and practices regarding&#xD;
      delirium assessment compared delirium assessment practices to those for sedation assessment.&#xD;
      (28) Finally, our group concluded a 36 patient double-blind randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      evaluating the use of quetiapine for the delirium treatment in the ICU that was recently&#xD;
      published in Critical Care Med. (29) The track record of our research group is important&#xD;
      given the many challenges of implementing an ICU delirium-focused investigation such as the&#xD;
      one that we have proposed. We therefore feel that we are qualified to conduct the study we&#xD;
      have proposed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of haloperidol therapy in critically ill&#xD;
      patients with subsyndromal delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prior data and our experience conducting delirium research demonstrate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. That progression to delirium may be lower in patients with subsyndromal delirium who&#xD;
           receive haloperidol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Our ability to conduct high quality research in the field of ICU delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A multidisciplinary ICU delirium research group that includes a psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. An academic environment where delirium assessment with the ICDSC has become a standard&#xD;
           of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium occurs in up to 80% of mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the intensive&#xD;
      care unit (ICU). (1-4) Patients who develop delirium are more likely to die, stay in the ICU&#xD;
      longer and cost the healthcare system more. (1-6) Moreover, delirium may cause cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction that persist long after recovery and impact long-term functional ability and&#xD;
      quality of life. (7-10) Given that more than 5 million patients are admitted each year to an&#xD;
      ICU in the United States, delirium in the critically ill is a major health care issue.&#xD;
      Patients who meet some but not all of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
      Disorders (DSM) IV criteria for delirium are deemed to have subsyndromal delirium. (19)&#xD;
      Patients who develop subsyndromal delirium are also more likely to die in the ICU and require&#xD;
      a higher level of care after ICU discharge. (19) Current practice guidelines recommend&#xD;
      routine delirium screening in the ICU using a validated tool such as the Intensive Care&#xD;
      Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). (14, 22) Delirium often persists despite the reversal&#xD;
      of causative factors thereby necessitating the use of pharmacologic therapy. Haloperidol&#xD;
      remains the pharmacologic treatment of choice for delirium in the ICU and its use has been&#xD;
      associated with lower ICU mortality. (23) However, its potential role in preventing the&#xD;
      conversion of subsyndromal delirium to delirium is unknown. In this study we plan to&#xD;
      determine whether the treatment of subsyndromal delirium in the critically ill with&#xD;
      haloperidol prevents progression to delirium without causing adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accomplishing these aims will determine if a pharmacologic intervention, haloperidol, can be&#xD;
      routinely used in critical care practice to prevent patients with subsyndromal delirium from&#xD;
      developing clinical delirium. If haloperidol is found to be safe and effective in the&#xD;
      proposed study, larger studies will be needed to determine the effect of haloperidol therapy&#xD;
      on patient mortality and evaluate predictors for drug response. Information from the proposed&#xD;
      study is greatly needed to determine if there is a safe and effective pharmacological&#xD;
      intervention for the estimated 1.5 million Americans each year who develop subsyndromal&#xD;
      delirium in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survivors of critical illness who develop delirium may experience prolonged cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and decline, decreased functionality and may suffer significant anxiety and&#xD;
      depression. Sleep disturbance is a common factor in patients with delirium and is known to&#xD;
      contribute to impaired function. Hence, a strategy that aims to reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      delirium in the ICU may improve both short and long-term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurocognitive deficits persist in up to 75% of ICU patients 6-12 months after ICU discharge&#xD;
      and presumably may be higher in ICU patients who develop delirium (30). Cognitive deficits&#xD;
      are global (31-33), including deficits in processing speed, memory, and attention. (31)&#xD;
      Hopkins concludes that the most consistent deficit across studies is decreased memory. (30)&#xD;
      This pattern of deficits, as well as the consistent findings of impaired social and&#xD;
      occupational functioning in ICU survivors (32, 34) suggests impaired executive function.&#xD;
      Executive function refers to the capacity to plan, initiate, organize, inhibit, and monitor&#xD;
      thought and behavior. It is a pattern of impairment which is thought to represent diffuse&#xD;
      frontal lobe damage. Executive function is typically poorly assessed in medically ill&#xD;
      patients and yet has potentially substantial impact on overall functioning. Functional&#xD;
      incapacity includes everyday issues such as difficulty buying groceries, keeping appointments&#xD;
      or adhering to medication regimens. (34, 35) For geriatric patients treated in the ICU, only&#xD;
      3% have normal post-ICU functional capacity. (36) It remains unclear if there is a change in&#xD;
      anxiety and depressive symptoms among patients who develop delirium and those that do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium will worsen functional ability and it is suspected that it will also worsen&#xD;
      emotional well being, although it is not well established whether this is the case. Given the&#xD;
      deleterious effects that delirium may have on functional status, it is therefore important to&#xD;
      measure physical status, social functioning, mental health and general health perception&#xD;
      between between patients exposed to an intervention that may decrease the incidence of&#xD;
      delirium. Sleep disturbance is a risk factor for neurocognitive impairment and is a prominent&#xD;
      component of delirium. (37) Thus disturbed sleep is understood as both a potential cause and&#xD;
      a consequence of ICU-related psychological and cognitive morbidity. Since psychological&#xD;
      morbidity often persists after ICU discharge, it is likely that disturbed sleep is frequent&#xD;
      during post-ICU hospitalization. An intervention focused on reducing delirium incidence will&#xD;
      affect post-ICU sleep quality.&#xD;
