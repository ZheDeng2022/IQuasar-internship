  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the first cause of visual impairment in elderly&#xD;
      patients in industrialized countries. Neovascular or &quot;wet&quot; AMD, characterized by the presence&#xD;
      of choroïdal neovessels, represents the most aggressive form of the disease. Its prevalence&#xD;
      is 3.3% among patients older than 65 years in Europe, and increases with age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraocular injections of anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibodies (ranibizumab) to treat AMD&#xD;
      have appeared recently. It is derived from a larger sized molecule, bevacizumab, which do not&#xD;
      have the market authorization for this indication. However, numerous publications of case&#xD;
      series seem to show the effectiveness and a satisfactory safety profile of bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These conclusions have to be confirmed with a high level of evidence study. The aim of the&#xD;
      GEFAL study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of effectiveness in clinical terms after 12&#xD;
      months of treatment with bevacizumab compared to ranibizumab on the visual acuity of patients&#xD;
      affected by neovascular AMD.&#xD;
