      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combination of trientine and carboplatin that can be given to patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
      The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trientine is designed to remove excess copper in the body, which may cause cancer cells to&#xD;
      stop growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carboplatin is designed to block the growth of cancer cells by stopping cell division, which&#xD;
      may cause the cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of carboplatin based on when you joined this study. Up to 3 dose levels of the&#xD;
      carboplatin will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three (3) to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level of carboplatin. The first&#xD;
      group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of carboplatin . Each new group will&#xD;
      receive a higher dose of the carboplatin than the group before it, if no intolerable side&#xD;
      effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of the study drug&#xD;
      combination is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose level of trientine will be based on your blood levels of copper. These levels may&#xD;
      vary from person to person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerable dose of the study drug combination is found, there will be two&#xD;
      expansion groups, one group of 28 extra participants (Group A) and one group of 14 extra&#xD;
      participants (Group B). Group A will receive the study combination at the highest tolerable&#xD;
      dose. Group B will receive extra doses of trientine before starting Day 1 of Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In additional the the Expansion Groups, once the highest tolerable dose of the study drug&#xD;
      combination is found, there will also be 2 PK groups. PK testing measures the amount of study&#xD;
      drug in the body at different time points. There will be 6 participants in each group. These&#xD;
      groups will also receive the study combination at the highest tolerable dose. There will be&#xD;
      extra blood draws for both groups and the drug administration schedule will be different from&#xD;
      the groups described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all participants, your dose of the study drugs may be lowered if you have any intolerable&#xD;
      side effects. You will not receive a higher dose than the dose level that you are first&#xD;
      assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation and Expansion Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each 28-day cycle, you will receive carboplatin by vein over 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will begin taking trientine by mouth several times each&#xD;
      day. If you are in Expansion Group B, you will receive extra doses of trientine within the 14&#xD;
      days before Day 1 of Cycle 1. Your study doctor will tell you when to take trientine and&#xD;
      whether it should be taken with or without food. You will also be told how many pills to&#xD;
      take.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will take the study drugs as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, if you are in PK Group A, instead of on Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will start taking&#xD;
      trientine daily beginning on Day 2 of Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in PK Group B, on Day 21 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycle 2 you will not eat for 2&#xD;
      hours before and 2 hours after you take trientine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 7 days before the first dose of study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily living&#xD;
           (performance status).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn to measure the levels of ceruloplasmin&#xD;
           (copper-carrying protein) copper, and iron in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to become pregnant must have a negative blood (about 1 teaspoon)&#xD;
           pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you may have an electrocardiogram (ECG) and/or an&#xD;
           echocardiogram (ECHO) to check your heart function. An ECG is a test that measures the&#xD;
           electrical activity of the heart&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week until the doctor decides your are taking the correct dose of trientine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to measure the levels of ceruloplasmin in your&#xD;
           blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week during Cycle 1, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to&#xD;
           measure levels of copper and iron in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of every 2 cycles (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT, MRI, PET scan, and/or x-ray to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to&#xD;
           measure tumor markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in PK Group A, blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 1, blood will be drawn 7 times over the 6 hours after you receive&#xD;
           carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 2 of Cycle 1, blood will be drawn 1 time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 2, blood will be drawn 7 times over the 6 hours after you receive&#xD;
           carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 2 of Cycle 2, blood will be drawn 1 time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in PK Group B, blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 21 of Cycle 1, blood will be drawn 7 times over the 6 hours after your dose of&#xD;
           trientine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 22 of Cycle 1, will be drawn 1 time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 2, will be drawn 7 times over the 6 hours after you receive&#xD;
           carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 2 of Cycle 2, blood will be drawn 1 time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse or you experience&#xD;
      intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days after your last dose of study drugs, you will have an end-of-study visit. At&#xD;
      this visit, the following tests and procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to&#xD;
           measure tumor markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a chest x-ray, CT, MRI, and/or&#xD;
           PET scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Trientine is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of Wilson's disease. Trientine is not FDA approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      advanced cancer. Carboplatin is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of&#xD;
      ovarian cancer. The combination of trientine and carboplatin to treat advanced cancer is&#xD;
      investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 72 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
