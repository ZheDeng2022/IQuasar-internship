  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A national priority for health care providers is to initiate early communication about&#xD;
      palliative and end-of-life care (PC/EOL) for children with a poor prognosis. Communication&#xD;
      about prognosis and advanced care planning is critical to empowering parents to make&#xD;
      decisions about PC/EOL for their children. A single-group study to refine and pilot test a&#xD;
      PC/EOL communication intervention is entitled, Communication Plan: Early through End of Life&#xD;
      (COMPLETE). COMPLETE is designed to be delivered during parent meetings and features: (a) a&#xD;
      physician-nurse (MD/RN) team approach to PC/EOL communication; (b) printed visual aids and&#xD;
      parent resource forms; and (c) hope and non-abandonment messages tailored by a MD/RN team to&#xD;
      their communication style and parental preferences for information. During Phase I, an&#xD;
      interdisciplinary approach involving nurses, physicians, PC/EOL expert consultants, and&#xD;
      bereaved-parent consultants met to develop a standardized protocol and training procedures.&#xD;
      During Phase II, this protocol will be evaluated with 24 parents and MD/RN teams. The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate parental outcomes regarding the COMPLETE's influence on: (a)&#xD;
      information needs, emotional needs/resources, appraisal of MD/RN information and of symptom&#xD;
      management; and (b) parental distress, uncertainty, decision regret, hope, satisfaction with&#xD;
      MD/RN communication, and advance care planning over time. Findings from this study address&#xD;
      NIH priorities related to: 1) an underserved population (i.e., parents of children with brain&#xD;
      tumors); 2) an under-examined ethical concern about early integration of PC/EOL communication&#xD;
      for parents of children with poor prognosis; 3) improved communication about PC/EOL among&#xD;
      physicians, nurses, and parents; and 4) the potential for changing health care practice.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Physicians and nurses (MDs/ RNs) struggle to communicate effectively about palliative and&#xD;
      end-of-life (PC/EOL) care with parents when their child's prognosis is poor, and rarely&#xD;
      collaborate as a team in this difficult process. The aim of this study was to develop and&#xD;
      evaluate training strategies for MD/RN dyads to collaboratively deliver a PC/EOL&#xD;
      communication intervention called, Communication Plan: Early through End of Life (COMPLETE),&#xD;
      to 24 parents of children with brain tumors. During Phase I, training strategies were based&#xD;
      on principles from a Relationship Centered Care perspective. The training was delivered to 3&#xD;
      pediatric neuro-oncologists and 5 oncology nurses by a team of parent advisors and a team of&#xD;
      expert consultants (i.e., medical ethics, communication, and PC/EOL). Our 2-day training&#xD;
      included 4 modules: family assessment, goal directed treatment planning, anticipatory&#xD;
      guidance, and staff communication and follow-up. Each module included: didactic content,&#xD;
      small group reflective sessions, and communication skills practice with bereaved parent.&#xD;
      Evaluations included dichotomous (agree/disagree) ratings and qualitative comments on&#xD;
      didactic content, small group reflection, and skills practice for each module. Helpful&#xD;
      aspects of our training strategies included: parent advisers' insights, emotional presence,&#xD;
      emphasis on hope and non-abandonment messages, written materials to facilitate PC/EOL&#xD;
      communication, and a team approach. For this presentation we will discuss insights gained&#xD;
      regarding use of a parent advisory panel, strategies to help the MD/RN dyads feel comfortable&#xD;
      working as a team to communicate with parents, and ways to improve training procedures and&#xD;
      our intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric oncology physicians and nurses found PC/EOL care communication training strategies&#xD;
      and content as helpful and useful. During Phase II of our study, our PC/EOL care&#xD;
      communication intervention is planned to be implemented and evaluated with 24 enrolled&#xD;
      parents. If effective, this intervention will facilitate integration of quality PC care&#xD;
      practices into the care of children with brain tumors.&#xD;

        The target sample size is 24 parents of 12 children diagnosed with a brain tumor. Our&#xD;
        sample size is sufficient to complete descriptive analyses of Aims 2 and 3, and adequate&#xD;
        precision for the estimation of effect sizes and preliminary tests of single-arm efficacy&#xD;
        in Aim 4.1. This study is powered for adequate estimation of effect sizes, not for&#xD;
        efficacy; that is, the study is powered to appropriately detect large effect sizes with&#xD;
        lower power for medium effect sizes. If 10% or fewer participants withdraw after COMPLETE&#xD;
        Session 1, we will be able to collect data from about 22 parents at least once. Twenty-two&#xD;
        parents will provide 61% power for detecting a difference of 0.5 times standard deviation&#xD;
        for a two-sided paired t-test with alpha of .05. The same test would have 70% power to&#xD;
        detect a difference of .55 standard deviation. This approach is typical and justifiable in&#xD;
        pilot feasibility studies to achieve 80% power for detecting only large effect sizes.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligibility criteria include parents who are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the primary decision makers (i.e., single parent or couple-dyad) for their child&#xD;
             (birth to 18 years of age);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the biological parents, step-parents, or legal guardians (e.g., adoptive parent);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  single or married;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  informed that their child is diagnosed with a brain tumor with a poor prognosis as&#xD;
             determined by the primary neuro-oncologist (e.g., glioblastoma multiforme, PNET, WHO&#xD;
             grade 3/4 brain tumor, or metastatic medulloblastoma); [3, 33, 38, 41, 42, 175]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  able to read, speak, and understand English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Our rationale for these criteria is to include: (a) parents of children who are at&#xD;
             high risk of not receiving timely PC/EOL and b) parents who are likely to be mature&#xD;
             enough to make difficult decisions on their own. In addition, we recognize the&#xD;
             importance of providing sensitive PC/EOL communication to all parents; however, it is&#xD;
             beyond the scope of the R21 mechanism to develop scripts in other languages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parents will be excluded from the study if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the child's brain tumor has a good prognosis (e.g., a non-metastatic medulloblastoma);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the child has been treated previously for another type of cancer;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the parents have neurological and/or cognitive impairments, as reported by the site&#xD;
             MD/RN team, preventing them from understanding the treatment options and completing&#xD;
             the questionnaires;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  either parent in a decision-making couple (i.e., dyad) declines consent.&#xD;
