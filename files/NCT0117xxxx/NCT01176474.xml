    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the side effects of an investigational vaccine with an&#xD;
      immune booster, or 2 different boosters together. Investigators also want to find out its&#xD;
      effects on the immune system and whether it will decrease the chance that melanoma will&#xD;
      return.&#xD;

    <description>The vaccine contains two peptides from two different proteins (peptides are pieces that make up proteins) called gpl00 and NY-ES0-1.&#xD;
Route of Administration: When prepared as a vaccine emulsion with Montanide ISA 51 VG, the vaccine is given by deep subcutaneous injection.&#xD;
Method of Administration: The 0.5 mg vaccine emulsion dose is administered as a 1 mL injection (0.5 mg/1 mL) as a deep subcutaneous injection in the anterior thigh of the same extremity. Injections should be separated by at least 3 cm to avoid the formation of coalescent granulomas. All 4 peptides (total of 6 injections) will be administered in the same thigh and alternating thighs will be used for each subsequent treatment.</description>

    <intervention_name>Apheresis Procedure</intervention_name>
    <description>Some blood will be removed from the participant's veins and processed by a machine to remove a small portion of the white cells. The rest of the blood will be returned into their veins. This procedure is called &quot;apheresis.&quot; Apheresis is done to collect cells to allow the investigators to understand how their immune system is functioning before and after receiving nivolumab and vaccine. This will be done for research purposes only. The red cells and blood clotting cells will not be permanently removed during this procedure. White blood cells will need to be removed by apheresis before participants receive the study drug.</description>
