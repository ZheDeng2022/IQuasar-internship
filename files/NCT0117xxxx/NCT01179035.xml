  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the effectiveness of the Transitions Clinic, a&#xD;
      post-release clinic for parolees with chronic medical conditions, in achieving increased&#xD;
      primary care engagement, lower rates of inappropriate hospitalizations, psychiatric emergency&#xD;
      service and emergency department use, and decreased recidivism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that subjects receiving parolee-targeted care in the Transitions Clinic will&#xD;
      have increased rates of non-emergency department ambulatory care and outpatient mental health&#xD;
      care, lower rates of hospitalization, psychiatric emergency service (PES) utilization,&#xD;
      emergency department (ED) utilization, decreased total hospital length of stay, and decreased&#xD;
      recidivism compared to patients receiving primary care from other safety-net providers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      With ever increasing numbers of released inmates, policymakers are developing policy&#xD;
      initiatives and directing funding towards community reentry programs for recent parolees to&#xD;
      decrease recidivism and improve health outcomes. These reentry programs are comprehensive&#xD;
      efforts that coordinate social and medical services for recently incarcerated people to&#xD;
      achieve these aims. Due to documented poor health outcomes in this population and the&#xD;
      resultant costs on the public health system, provision of medical care will be an integral&#xD;
      part of these reentry initiatives. The manner in which medical care is incorporated into&#xD;
      community reentry programs and directed to recently released prisoners needs to be studied to&#xD;
      guide architects of reentry programs, policymakers and allocation of funding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Transitions Clinic (TC) was founded to address the medical needs of recently released&#xD;
      prisoners. The TC is a pilot project designed to target primary care medical services to&#xD;
      parolees in San Francisco and aid in coordination of medical and social services. It operates&#xD;
      within the San Francisco Department of Public Health(SFDPH)-affiliated Community Health&#xD;
      Network (CHN) and is part of the Safe Communities Reentry Council, a city-wide, collaborative&#xD;
      effort of the Sheriff's office, Public Defenders' office and local community organizations to&#xD;
      improve reentry services and outcomes for the 1500 annual parolees to San Francisco.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project will prospectively examine the effectiveness of the TC in achieving&#xD;
      increased primary care engagement, decreased acute health care utilization and decreased&#xD;
      recidivism. After intake in the TC, patients will be randomized to continued,&#xD;
      parolee-targeted care in TC versus referral to safety net medical providers for non-targeted&#xD;
      care. We believe that the results of the study will assist policymakers by improving our&#xD;
      understanding of the:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. effect of targeted and non-targeted medical care provision to post-release prisoners on&#xD;
           primary care engagement and utilization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. effect of targeted and non-targeted medical care provision to post-release prisoners on&#xD;
           inpatient hospitalizations and emergency room and psychiatric emergency service&#xD;
           utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. effect of targeted and non-targeted care provision to post-release prisoners on&#xD;
           recidivism&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. costs for provision of targeted versus non-targeted medical care to post-release&#xD;
           prisoners (Do we want to do a cost analysis?)&#xD;
