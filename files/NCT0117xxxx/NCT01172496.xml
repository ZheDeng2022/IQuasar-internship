  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single center, open label, randomized, two-period, two-sequence cross-over study is&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the relative bioavailability of a treprostinil diethanolamine 1 mg&#xD;
      tablet in reference to treprostinil diethanolamine 1 mg oral solution (administered as four&#xD;
      0.25 mg doses every 2 hours for a 1 mg total dose) in twenty-four healthy volunteers. Other&#xD;
      secondary outcomes of interest include assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters of&#xD;
      treprostinil diethanolamine 1 mg tablets and a treprostinil diethanolamine 1 mg oral solution&#xD;
      administered as four doses (0.25 mg every 2 hours for a 1 mg total dose) and evaluation of&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of each treatment regimen.&#xD;

             inclusive at screening. Male subjects must weigh between 55 and 120 kg, with a BMI&#xD;
             between 19.0-32.0 kg/m2; inclusive at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECG and clinical&#xD;
             laboratory results within normal limits or considered not clinically significant by&#xD;
