  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will develop a measure of endogenous opioid tone that might serve as a&#xD;
      biological marker for drive for palatable food. Using a 'naltrexone probe,' the investigators&#xD;
      will assess whether individual response to one dose of an opioid receptor antagonist,&#xD;
      naltrexone, is related to non-homeostatic eating in non-pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Naltrexone Response will be related to non-homeostatic eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Response profiles to the 25 mg dose will be slightly less in magnitude than the&#xD;
      50 mg dose. However, responses will be similarly related to non-homeostatic eating measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Response to naltrexone will be highly stable within individuals across time, in&#xD;
      the absence of an intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Opioid tone may provide a way to identify people at risk of reward based eating, with more&#xD;
      accuracy than self-report measures. Knowing such risk could improve treatment matching, and&#xD;
      provide a biomarker to assess treatment progress. There is no direct measure of central&#xD;
      opioid activity in humans, short of PET scans for opioid receptor binding. However, there is&#xD;
      a promising indicator using an opioid antagonist such as naltrexone. Blocking opioid receptor&#xD;
      releases the inhibitory opioidergic inputs to hypothalamic corticotropic releasing hormone&#xD;
      (CRH) neurons, thus increasing CRH, and eventually cortisol in the blood. The extent of the&#xD;
      cortisol rise in response to naltrexone might serve as an indicator of endogenous opioidergic&#xD;
      tone. It is hypothesized that greater increases in cortisol indicate weaker endogenous opioid&#xD;
      activity (by indicating a more complete opioid blockade). Salivary cortisol response to&#xD;
      naltrexone may offer a relatively safe and unobtrusive way to measure endogenous opioidergic&#xD;
      tone. We propose to test the reliability and validity of the naltrexone probe, taken at home,&#xD;
      as a measure of endogenous opioidergic tone. In a previous study (Daubenmier et al, 2013), we&#xD;
      administered a one time 50mg dose of naltrexone and examined nausea and cortisol responses.&#xD;
      Results suggested that responses were higher in those who showed greater drive to eat. Here&#xD;
      we examine a more direct measure of drive to eat, using the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS),&#xD;
      and test whether nausea and cortisol responses were associated with greater drive to eat,&#xD;
      whether 50mg produced greater responses than 25 mg, and whether the responses were stable&#xD;
      (highly related) when tested again one month later.&#xD;
