    <textblock>
      This is a pilot phase 1, open-label, single center, multi-dose, dose-escalation study of&#xD;
      BMS-936558 in combination with or without a peptide vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the side effects of an investigational vaccine with an&#xD;
      immune booster. Investigators also wish to find out its effects on the patient's immune&#xD;
      system and whether it will shrink their melanoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BMS-936558 will be administered as an i.v. infusion, using a volumetric pump with a 0.2&#xD;
      micron in-line filter at the protocol-specified dose(s) and rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine consists of the following peptides: gp100280-288 (288V), and NY-ESO-1157-165&#xD;
      (165V).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Patients in cohorts 1-5 will receive the peptide vaccine, but not those in cohort 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected for pharmacokinetic and immunologic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.&#xD;
