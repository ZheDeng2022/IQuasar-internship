  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC),&#xD;
      is a idiopathic, chronic and frequently disabling inflammatory disorder of the intestines&#xD;
      characterized by a dysregulated mucosal immune response that affect more than a million&#xD;
      Americans. This protocol is aimed at obtaining tissue samples to test for expression of genes&#xD;
      associated with IBD and to better understand the pathogenesis of IBD with the study of&#xD;
      genetics, proteomics, physiologic processes and microbiomes (microbiology).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Progress has been made in recent years in understanding the pathological mechanisms of IBD,&#xD;
      particularly in the search of IBD susceptibility genes. However, due to the extreme&#xD;
      complexity of the diseases, there is still a long way ahead in elucidating detailed molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms of IBD pathogenesis and identifying more effective therapeutic targets. Therefore,&#xD;
      it is the goal of this research study to discover genetic, microbial, gene expression and&#xD;
      serological factors involved in the pathogenesis of IBD which may pave the way for the&#xD;
      identification of more effective therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims for these objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Identify proteins that are changed in expression and post-translational modification&#xD;
      in the intestinal mucosa of patients with active UC or CD compared to i) uninvolved&#xD;
      intestinal mucosa from the same patients, ii) normal intestinal mucosa in control subjects,&#xD;
      and iii) infectious/Inflammatory colitis (C. difficile colitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Identify changes in the expression of intestinal membrane transporters for Na&#xD;
      absorption and Cl secretion, including NHE3, in the intestinal mucosa of patients with active&#xD;
      UC or CD compared to i) uninvolved intestinal mucosa from the same patients, ii) normal&#xD;
      intestinal mucosa in control subjects, and and iii) infectious/Inflammatory colitis (C.&#xD;
      difficile colitis). The targeted screening will also include several intestinal epithelial&#xD;
      brush border-associated PDZ-containing proteins that have been recently shown to regulate&#xD;
      trafficking and activity of membrane transporters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3: Enteroid Sub-study - To compare the physiologic regulation of Na absorption, Cl&#xD;
      secretion, protein secretion and other intestinal physiologic processes in IBD cases, other&#xD;
      infectious colitis cases and healthy controls as these processes are often altered with&#xD;
      disease activities. The processes will be studied through the development of self-propagating&#xD;
      culture models called organoids or enteroids. The culture models are developed from biopsy&#xD;
      specimens taken from the upper small intestine, including duodenum and jejunum , lower small&#xD;
      intestine (ileum) and proximal and distal colon and used to grow organoids/enteroids. These&#xD;
      are mini-intestines that have the entire crypt villus axes which grow in culture and can be&#xD;
      kept alive indefinitely in culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 4: Mechanism of Intestinal Inflammation Sub-study - To understand the mechanisms involved&#xD;
      in the recurrence of inflammation following ileal resection surgery for Crohn's disease (CD).&#xD;
      Reasons for recurrence are currently unknown but are believed to be caused by an interaction&#xD;
      of genetic, immune and microbial features. Information gained from this study will be used to&#xD;
      build a predictive model to identify those patients at greater risk of rapid recurrence, and&#xD;
      will aid physicians in tailoring follow-up treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 5: UC Demarcation Sub-study - To gain further understanding of the mechanisms involved in&#xD;
      the susceptibility to and flare of inflammation in UC patients. Blood, stool, urine, saliva,&#xD;
      lavage and tissue samples from UC patients will be used to help study the genetic, microbial,&#xD;
      metabolic, and immune factors involved in the remission and flare of disease. Information&#xD;
      gained from this study will also be used to build a predictive model of which patients are at&#xD;
      greater risk of disease flare, and which are less likely to do so, allowing physicians to&#xD;
      tailor follow-up treatments accordingly.&#xD;
