  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Denmark, 12.000 people a year, is struck by acute myocardial infarction. A third of these&#xD;
      cannot be saved before treatment is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite quick and effective reperfusion of the coronary arteries using PCI (Percutaneous&#xD;
      Coronary Intervention) after an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction, substantial&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality remain. Infarct size is an important determinant of the short-and&#xD;
      long-term outcome after acute myocardial infarction. The most widely used and most effective&#xD;
      proven therapy to limit infarct size is the early reperfusion induced by or PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although beneficial in terms of myocardial salvage, reperfusion itself may contribute to&#xD;
      additional damage of the myocardium; the damage due to the combined processes is known as&#xD;
      &quot;ischemia-reperfusion injury&quot;. The pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury is&#xD;
      a multifactorial process involving the interaction of multiple mechanisms. Numerous studies&#xD;
      indicate that there are three pivotal factors in the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion&#xD;
      injury: elevated oxidative damage, depressed energy metabolism, and altered calcium&#xD;
      homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partially reduced species of oxygen, including the superoxide anion radical, hydroxyl&#xD;
      radical, and hydrogen peroxide, are generated intracellularly as by-product of oxygen&#xD;
      metabolism. These reactive oxygen species cause peroxidation af membrane lipids, denaturation&#xD;
      of proteins, and modification of DNA, all of which ultimately can lead to cell death. In&#xD;
      mammals, cell damage induced by partially reduced oxygen species can also initiate local&#xD;
      inflammatory responses, which then lead to further oxidant-mediated tissue injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melatonin is mainly known for its role as an endogenously produced circadian hormone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the last twenty years, increasing evidence has proven melatonin to be a very potent&#xD;
      direct and indirect antioxidant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent experimental studies have documented the beneficial effects of melatonin in reducing&#xD;
      tissue damage and limiting cardiac pathophysiology in models of experimental&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis: Melatonin given to patients undergoing PCI can reduce the myocardial&#xD;
      damage sustained by ischemia-reperfusion.&#xD;

      Purpose The purpose of this Ph.D study is to examine the antioxidative effect of melatonin in&#xD;
      relation to ischemia-reperfusion injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to examine to which extend melatonin administered to patients&#xD;
      undergoing primary PCI for acute myocardial infarction will reduce the damage of the&#xD;
      myocardium caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury and thereby hopefully improve the clinical&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theory and hypotheses Because there is strong evidence that free radicals contribute to&#xD;
      post-ischemic injury, antioxidant enzyme therapy could potentially be extremely effective in&#xD;
      reducing the cellular damage. In reality, however, the usefulness of this therapy is limited&#xD;
      by a number of factors, in particular the ability of the antioxidants to penetrate the cell&#xD;
      membrane and to scavenge free radicals in situ. Fortunately, this limitation can, in part, be&#xD;
      addressed with the use of melatonin, a potent indirect and direct free radical scavenger that&#xD;
      easily diffuses through the cell membrane to exert its antioxidant effects in all&#xD;
      compartments of the cell. Indeed, in contrast to the partial of distribution of other&#xD;
      antioxidants, such as vitamin C or E, the melatonin distributes it readily in all subcellular&#xD;
      compartments owing to its double-solubility in both, aqueous and in lipid environment.&#xD;
      Several recent publications present evidence that the newly discovered antioxidant melatonin&#xD;
      has significant protective actions against the cardiac damage such as occurs during&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis: Melatonin given to patients undergoing PCI can reduce the myocardial&#xD;
      damage sustained by ischemia-reperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults who are able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 significant coronary occlusion (&gt;2mm) with TIMI 0-1 expected to undergo PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG criteria: The occlusion must be ECG-verified with new ST-elevations ≥ 0.2 mV in&#xD;
           V2-V3 and/or ≥ 0.1 in the other leads or with a new onset left bundle branch block.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having onset of symptoms of qualifying AMI and undergo PCI within 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the patients do not fulfill the ECG inclusion criteria they can still be included if&#xD;
           the primary PCI reveals an acute coronary occlusion (&gt;2mm) with TIMI 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion: Patients with prior myocardial infarction, more than one significant occlusion,&#xD;
      prehospital thrombolysis, known history of renal failure, history of autoimmune diseases,&#xD;
      pregnancy, fertile women or breastfeeding, severe concurrent illness with reduced short-term&#xD;
      prognosis, pacemaker, claustrophobia, cardiogenic shock, metals in the body, atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, BMI ≥ 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The STEMI patient with 1 significant occlusion undergoing PCI less than 6 hours&#xD;
      from onset of symptoms will be randomized to intracoronary injection of either melatonin or&#xD;
      placebo(saline). The melatonin or placebo will be given as a bolus of 10 ml in relation to&#xD;
      PCI, as soon as the occlusion is removed. Immediately after the bolus is given, a solution of&#xD;
      490 ml of either placebo (saline) or 0,1 mg/ml melatonin (49 mg melatonin)will be given&#xD;
      intravenously over 6 hours (80 ml/hour).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point: MRI of the heart at day 4 (+/- 1 day) after the PCI procedure to determine&#xD;
      myocardial salvage index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end point:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether melatonin treatment reduces infarct size as determined by the&#xD;
           concentration of high sensitive TnT or high-sensitive TnI and Creatinin Kinase&#xD;
           Myocardial Band (CK-MB)(area under the curve) in the blood, measured daily for the first&#xD;
           4 days after AMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the concentration of plasma melatonin after PCI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the concentration of oxidative markers 24 hours after PCI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical events occurring within the first 90 days after surgery; death, sustained&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmias, resuscitation from cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, heart failure,&#xD;
      major bleedings, stroke, need for revascularization, recurrent ischemia, re-infarctions and&#xD;
      re-hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Patients who meet the criteria of inclusion will be randomized to intra-coronary&#xD;
      injection plus intravenous infusion of melatonin or placebo. The bolus will be given just&#xD;
      after the opening of the vessel (TIMI ≥ 2) . Hs-Troponin T/I and CK-MB will be measured in a&#xD;
      blood sample taken 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours and 96 hours after the PCI&#xD;
      procedure. At day 4 after PCI, the patients will undergo MRI of the heart focusing on infarct&#xD;
      size and area at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient number: Statistical power analysis shows that with a type 1 error of 5% and a type 2&#xD;
      error of 20%, mean at 9,63 and the SD with MRI of 0,16, one should be able to detect a&#xD;
      difference in infarct size of 25% between the two groups, when including 2x17 patients in&#xD;
      each group. The investigators are including 2x 20 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: The experiments are considered to be of no risk or discomfort for the patients. Both&#xD;
      the intervention group and the placebo group are operated by current clinical guidelines.&#xD;
