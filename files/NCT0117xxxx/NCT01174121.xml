  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood&#xD;
      cells from patients' tumors, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, and then giving&#xD;
      the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, or TIL&#xD;
      and we have given this type of treatment to over 200 patients with melanoma. Researchers want&#xD;
      to know if TIL shrink s tumors in people with digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or&#xD;
      ovarian/endometrial cancers. In this study, we are selecting a specific subset of white blood&#xD;
      cells from the tumor that we think are the most effective in fighting tumors and will use&#xD;
      only these cells in making the tumor fighting cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if these specifically selected tumor fighting cells can&#xD;
      cause digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or ovarian/endometrial tumors to shrink and to see&#xD;
      if this treatment is safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults age 18-70 with upper or lower gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, genitourinary,&#xD;
      breast, ovarian/endometrial cancer, or glioblastoma refractory to standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and undergo&#xD;
      a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo surgery&#xD;
      to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukapheresis: Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood cells.&#xD;
      {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the&#xD;
      patient.}&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the&#xD;
      conditioning chemotherapy, the TIL cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for&#xD;
      about 4 weeks for the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects,&#xD;
      lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1&#xD;
      year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits will take up to 2 days.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metastatic digestive tract cancers, in particular esophageal, gastric, pancreatic and&#xD;
           hepatobiliary carcinomas, are associated with poor survival beyond five years and poor&#xD;
           response to existing therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data from the National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch (NCI-SB) and from the literature&#xD;
           support that metastatic cancers are potentially immunogenic and that tumor-infiltrating&#xD;
&#xD;
      lymphocytes (TIL) can be grown and expanded from these tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In metastatic melanoma, TIL can mediate the regression of bulky disease at any site when&#xD;
           administered to an autologous patient with high-dose aldesleukin (IL-2) following a&#xD;
           nonmyeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The recent young-TIL approach, in which TIL are minimally cultured in vitro, not&#xD;
           selected for tumor recognition, before rapid expansion and infusion to metastatic&#xD;
           melanoma patients, has lead to objective response rates comparable to previous trials&#xD;
           relying on TIL screened for tumor recognition, with no added toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In pre-clinical models, the administration of an anti-PD-1 antibody enhances the&#xD;
           anti-tumor activity of transferred T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We propose to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of TIL adoptive transfer&#xD;
           therapy in combination with pembrolizumab, administered either prior to cell&#xD;
           administration or at the time of progressive disease, for metastatic cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      --With Amendment BB, to determine the rate of tumor regression in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      cancer who receive autologous, minimally cultured TIL in conjunction with a&#xD;
      non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen, high-dose aldesleukin, and anti-PD-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must be/have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metastatic upper or lower gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, genitourinary, breast,&#xD;
           ovarian/endometrial cancer, or glioblastoma refractory to standard chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal basic laboratory values&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may not have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concurrent major medical illnesses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe hepatic function impairment due to liver metastatic burden&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unpalliated biliary or bowel occlusion, cholangitis, or digestive tract bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any form of immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may undergo resection or biopsy to obtain tumor for generation of autologous&#xD;
           TIL cultures and autologous cancer cell lines, and for frozen tissue archive. Lymph&#xD;
           nodes, ascites,peritoneal implants, and normal tissue adjacent to metastatic deposit&#xD;
           will also be obtained when possible for ongoing and future research as described in the&#xD;
           NCI-SB cell harvest protocol 03-C-0277 (Cell Harvest and Preparation for Surgery Branch&#xD;
           Adoptive Cell Therapy Protocols).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With the approval of Amendment BB, patients will be enrolled on Arm 3 or Arm 4. All&#xD;
           patients will receive a non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen&#xD;
           consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by the infusion of autologous&#xD;
           TIL and high-dose aldesleukin. Patients enrolled on Arm 3 will receive pembrolizumab&#xD;
           prior to cell administration and three additional doses every three weeks following the&#xD;
           cell infusion. Patients enrolled on Arm 4 will receive pembrolizumab within four weeks&#xD;
           after meeting progressive disease by RECIST criteria, continuing for up to 8 doses every&#xD;
           3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated about 6 weeks after cell infusion&#xD;
           and periodically thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Twenty-one patients will initially be enrolled in each group to assess toxicity and&#xD;
           tumor responses. If two or more of the first 21 patients per groups shows a clinical&#xD;
           response (partial response or complete response), accrual will continue to 41 patients,&#xD;
           targeting a 20% goal for objective response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 332 patients may be enrolled.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Measurable (per RECIST v1.0 criteria), metastatic cancer of one of the following&#xD;
             types: upper or lower gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, genitourinary, breast,&#xD;
             ovarian/endometrial, or glioblastoma. Patients must have at least one lesion that is&#xD;
             resectable for TIL generation with minimal morbidity, preferentially using minimal&#xD;
             invasive laparoscopic or thoracoscopic surgery for removal of superficial tumor&#xD;
             deposit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmation of diagnosis of metastatic cancer by the NCI Laboratory of Pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refractory to approved standard systemic therapy. Specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer must have received oxaliplatin or&#xD;
                  irinotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with Hepatocellular carcinoma patients must have received sorafenib&#xD;
                  (Nexavar ), since level 1 data support a survival benefit with this agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with breast and ovarian cancer must be refractory to both first and&#xD;
                  second line treatments and must have received at least one second-line&#xD;
                  chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with glioblastoma must have received standard surgery, radiation&#xD;
                  therapy, and chemotherapy for their primary tumors and require resection of their&#xD;
                  tumors for palliative or other clinical indications. These patients will not&#xD;
                  undergo surgery solely for treatment on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with 3 or fewer brain metastases that are less than or equal to 1 cm in&#xD;
             diameter and asymptomatic are eligible. Lesions that have been treated with&#xD;
             stereotactic radiosurgery must be clinically stable for one month after treatment for&#xD;
             the patient to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this&#xD;
             protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive may&#xD;
             have decreased immune-competence and thus may be less responsive to the experimental&#xD;
             treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody. If&#xD;
             hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then the patient must be tested for the&#xD;
             presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.&#xD;

             Syndrome, who must have a total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than four weeks must have elapsed since completion of any prior systemic therapy&#xD;
             at the time the patient receives the preparative regimen, and major organ toxicities&#xD;
             must have recovered to grade 1 or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures or limited field radiotherapy&#xD;
        within the four weeks prior to enrollment, as long as related organ toxicities have&#xD;
        recovered to grade 1 or less.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the&#xD;
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent systemic steroid therapy, except for patients with recurrent glioblastoma&#xD;
             who require steroids for clinical indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
