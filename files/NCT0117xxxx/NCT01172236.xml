      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the antioxidant effect of lactoferrin and its&#xD;
      ability to reduce free radicals related diseases in the newborn. This evaluation will be done&#xD;
      through the assessment of neuro-developmental follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to identify a panel of markers for assessing oxidative stress and&#xD;
      for a correlation with the lactoferrin antioxidant effect.&#xD;

      The study arises from the need to structure care to identify a product natural with&#xD;
      antioxidant propriety that may reduce the extent of damage in perinatal neurological&#xD;
      disorders related to oxidative stress by limiting the pain for infants and families and&#xD;
      simultaneously reducing the cost to the SSN arising from standard pharmacological therapy and&#xD;
      rehabilitation in the short and medium term. The research results will remain available to&#xD;
      the scientific community and will not be used for profit or commercial. The iron (Fe) is the&#xD;
      most abundant transition metal1 in the body and an essential element for growth and welfare&#xD;
      of almost all life2 where he played a key role in many biochemical processes3. It is&#xD;
      essential as cofactor in many enzymatic reactions and as catalyst in the processes of&#xD;
      electron transport, yet is potentially toxic and rarely available. In the presence of oxygen&#xD;
      Fe causes harmful action on the cell since it enhances the production by non-enzymatic&#xD;
      reactive oxygen species. The hydroxyl radical in particular, can damage various cellular&#xD;
      components such as DNA, proteins and membrane lipids. All bodies have therefore developed&#xD;
      strategies that allow them to retain Fe was acquired in a soluble, nontoxic and in a form&#xD;
      readily available. The Fe excess, also caused by weak bonds that the metal has with&#xD;
      nonspecific and specific plasma proteins may carry out its negative effects by generating&#xD;
      free radicals through the reactions of Fenton and Heber-Weiss4. Physiological requirements of&#xD;
      Fe is higher during periods of rapid growth and differentiation, such as perinatal and&#xD;
      nervous system that develops rapidly in late fetal life and early neonatal period, appears to&#xD;
      be particularly sensitive to modulations of Fe contents5 In the newborn the inability to&#xD;
      regulate, as necessary, the uptake of Fe by the immature gut may be the reason for failure&#xD;
      and / or excess metal. Both situations may have adverse effects on neurological development&#xD;
      of infants and in case of failure becomes irreversible even6-8 because any supplementation&#xD;
      does not improve autcome9-11. In both cases the events that occur in early childhood have&#xD;
      adverse effects on neuronal function in adults. The mechanism by which iron deficiency&#xD;
      affects brain development is completely unknown but we know that can range up to a general&#xD;
      lack metabolic errors of myelination and synaptogenesis and changes in specific funcions12 .&#xD;
      It was also suggested that the adverse clinical outcomes in premature infants receiving blood&#xD;
      transfusions and / or colonization13 may be related to oxidative damage14-17 &lt;br&gt;The main&#xD;
      source of food for newborns is breast milk or formula. Breast milk contains heme Fe&#xD;
      consequently the non-heme Fe, which is bound to milk proteins and other substances with lower&#xD;
      molecular weight, is the main source of Fe in the diet of infants. The child is able to&#xD;
      regulate the absorption of iron from the gut, in response to supplementation, only near the&#xD;
      first year of life,18 so the inability of infants to regulate the intestinal absorption&#xD;
      predisposes them to a deficiency when the Fe in the diet is insufficient, or an overload,&#xD;
      when levels in the diet are high. It was also suggested that the enrichment of Fe in young&#xD;
      children may lead to an increase in its plasma concentration and the formation of nonspecific&#xD;
      compounds (nonspecific binding to proteins with low affinity bonds) that give rise to the&#xD;
      so-called free Fe (NPBI) which originate from reactive oxygen species. Some authors have&#xD;
      demonstrated increased oxidative stress in infants of very low birth weight who were&#xD;
      subjected to a large oral iron supplementation, especially if breastfed seno.19-21 Although&#xD;
      gestational age and some clinical treatments such as transfusions and ventilation considered&#xD;
      because of an increased risk of oxidative damage Fe-indotto.22 Since the status of Fe in&#xD;
      breast-fed term infants is usually satisfactory, at least until the sixth month, and an&#xD;
      important part of Fe in human milk is bound to lactoferrin, has been previously suggested&#xD;
      that the effect protective of human milk is related to the presence of this protein fixing&#xD;
      most of the Fe and regulates its absorption. The lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein,&#xD;
      naturally found in high concentrations in breast milk and in low concentrations in other&#xD;
      fluids esocrini23. For the size and structure of lactoferrin is closely linked to another&#xD;
      group of Fe-related protein, the transferrin and is considered by many as a member of this&#xD;
      family. Lactoferrin binds iron with high affinity binding and its structure is unusually&#xD;
      resistant to proteolytic degradation. Besides regulating the absorption of iron during&#xD;
      inflammatory processes and infettivi24 performs several physiological functions including&#xD;
      antibacterial, antifungal, antivirale25, antiparassitary26, antitumoral27,&#xD;
      immunomodulator28-29. This ability antibacterial and antiviral properties, may explain the&#xD;
      low prevalence and shorter duration of infection in breast-fed infants. In human milk&#xD;
      lactoferrin plays an antioxidant sequestering free ions of Fe30 and thus preventing lipid&#xD;
      peroxidation and subsequent milk oxidation31. Some AA.32 have shown this property in vitro&#xD;
      using salts and Fe ions in the presence of a biological agent such as reducing ascorbato33. A&#xD;
      recent study has also demonstrated its antioxidant effect in blood34. Again lactoferrin is&#xD;
      able to bind free Fe, from binding studies, avoiding be sure to trigger a series of chain&#xD;
      reactions that produce free radicals and thus reduces the damage induced by oxidative stress.&#xD;
      This explains why breastfed children have significantly higher total antioxidant capacity and&#xD;
      significantly lower index of oxidative stress. A recent study on infants supplied with&#xD;
      formula supplemented with lactoferrin showed that presence of this protein helps the&#xD;
      absorption of Fe in the small gut. The same study suggests that its activity could stimulate&#xD;
      the proliferation and differentiation of mucosal cells in the gut35, thus increasing the&#xD;
      surface and in turn increase the absorption of nutrients. Studies in pregnancy women 36&#xD;
      suggests that lactoferrin may have an anti-inflammatory effect, while also improving the Fe&#xD;
      status of women.&#xD;
