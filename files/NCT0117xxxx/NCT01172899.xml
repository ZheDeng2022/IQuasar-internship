      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Western world overweight and obesity is an increasing problem both in adults and in&#xD;
      children. In youth, it is associated with early death and a number of co-morbidities&#xD;
      including metabolic and endocrine changes, increased inflammatory status, cardiovascular&#xD;
      abnormalities, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and impaired quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment for morbid obesity in children is by combined life style&#xD;
      interventions. However, the medium and long term effects of dietetic interventions, behaviour&#xD;
      therapy and medication is relatively poor. In adults bariatric surgery shows good results&#xD;
      with up to 30% weight reduction in 3 years. The preliminary results in youth are similar, but&#xD;
      surgery in this age group is relatively uncommon. In the Netherlands surgery in this age&#xD;
      group is only allowed in clinical trials, until the benefits and risks have been established.&#xD;
      (National Health Authorities)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if surgery gives a superior weight and body mass index (BMI) reduction than&#xD;
      combined life style interventions in adolescents with morbid obesity and to assess its effect&#xD;
      on obesity associated co-morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective randomised interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidly obese children, aged 14 - 16 years, with sex and age adjusted BMI &gt;40 kg/m2 or &gt;35&#xD;
      kg/m2 with co-morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery by laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) or combined life style&#xD;
      interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints: weight loss, loss of excess weight, loss of excess BMI. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints: Body composition, pubertal development, metabolic and endocrine changes,&#xD;
      inflammatory status, cardiovascular abnormalities, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, brain&#xD;
      development, quality of life, and behaviour changes. The potential complications of surgery&#xD;
      are monitored.&#xD;
