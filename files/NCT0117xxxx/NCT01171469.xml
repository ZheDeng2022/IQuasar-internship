  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center Phase I study to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) of autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with allogeneic brain tumor stem cells&#xD;
      administered as a vaccination in children and adults with recurrent brain tumors. Once the&#xD;
      MTD has been determined, we will conduct a phase II study to determine efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials that utilize DCs for immunotherapy have demonstrated significant survival&#xD;
      benefit for patients who exhibit robust immune responses against tumor cells. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      at the present time the majority of tumor patients are unable to mount an adequate immune&#xD;
      response and thus succumb to their tumors. We postulate that the inability to generate an&#xD;
      appropriate immune response in these patients is due to a lack of sufficient numbers of&#xD;
      appropriate T cells due to an inadequate source of tumor antigens.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autologous DCs will be obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from each&#xD;
      patient by leukapheresis. An established BTSC line will be used as an allogeneic source of&#xD;
      tumor antigen. Approximately 4 weeks will be required after the leukapheresis for vaccine&#xD;
      production and the first vaccine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive an injection of DCs at his/her assigned dose once every 2 weeks&#xD;
      during the first 8 weeks, followed by injections every 4 weeks for an additional 10&#xD;
      vaccinations. Imiquimod will be applied to the vaccination site just prior to and 24 hours&#xD;
      after each vaccine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use an accelerated dose escalation design (1 subject per level) until dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity (DLT) is encountered, after which a traditional phase I design (3 subjects&#xD;
      per level) will be implemented. DLT is defined as grade 3 or greater treatment related&#xD;
      toxicity. A total of 6 patients will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or, in&#xD;
      the absence of DLT, at dose level 3.&#xD;

    <description>Imiquimod (INN) is a prescription medication that acts as an immune response modifier. Imiquimod is marketed as 5% Aldara cream in 250 mg packets, providing a total dose of 12.5 mg per packet and sufficient to cover 20 square centimeters. The contents of ½ of a packet will be applied as a thin film to cover approximately 10 square centimeters of skin in the area of the planned vaccination.</description>
