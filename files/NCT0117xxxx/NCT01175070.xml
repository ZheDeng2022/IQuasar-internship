    <textblock>
      Diabetic macular oedema (DME) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United&#xD;
      Kingdom's working population. It affects the macula, which lies at the centre of the retina,&#xD;
      at the back of the eye. Damage to the macula can occur either because the blood supply is&#xD;
      reduced (ischaemic DME), or because the blood vessels are leaking excessively (exudative&#xD;
      DME).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A chemical called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may underlie some of the&#xD;
      abnormalities seen in DME. Studies have shown that VEGF encourages leakage of fluid from&#xD;
      blood vessels and increases the stickiness of white blood cells. When white blood cells are&#xD;
      sticky they can attach to blood vessel walls. This may cause small blood vessels to block,&#xD;
      and lead to ischaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser treatment often helps to stabilise exudative DME, but there is currently no recognised&#xD;
      treatment for ischaemic DME. Macugen (pegaptanib), a drug that inactivates VEGF, has been&#xD;
      tried and found to be of benefit in treating exudative DME. Since VEGF promotes ischaemia, it&#xD;
      is possible that Macugen will also prove to be beneficial for ischaemic DME. This has not&#xD;
      been tested before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A healthy macula is essential for good vision. The innermost area of the macula, the foveal&#xD;
      avascular zone (FAZ), is the most important part. The FAZ is enlarged when it is ischaemic.&#xD;
      This is a pilot study to assess whether Macugen can reduce the size of the FAZ in ischaemic&#xD;
      DME. The investigators will also assess whether it can reduce retinal thickness and improve&#xD;
      vision in ischaemic DME. Thirty patients will be involved in the study for thirty weeks each.&#xD;
      They will have their eyes examined and receive an injection of Macugen into the eye every 6&#xD;
      weeks. The study is taking place in the Oxford Eye Hospital and is being funded by Pfizer,&#xD;
      the company that makes Macugen.&#xD;

      Diabetic macular oedema:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A combination of increasing longevity and increasing obesity is causing a rise in the&#xD;
      incidence of diabetes and its associated complications such as diabetic retinopathy. Almost&#xD;
      all patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) develop some signs of retinopathy and&#xD;
      approximately 60% of patients with type 2 DM develop diabetic retinopathy. Of those with type&#xD;
      2 DM, diabetic macular oedema (DME) is the most common cause of reduced visual acuity. [1]&#xD;
&#xD;
      DME is one of the leading causes of loss of vision in people of a working age in the&#xD;
      developed world. It affects the function of the macula, a key part of the retina which is&#xD;
      used for central vision. In DME there are abnormal structural changes in the blood vessel&#xD;
      walls which lead to leakage of fluid and proteins from the blood vessels. [2, 3] DME can be&#xD;
      classified as ischaemic or exudative, based on the dominant underlying problem. In ischaemic&#xD;
      DME, the main problem is a reduction in blood flow to the macula which causes reduced central&#xD;
      vision and swelling of the retinal tissues in this area. [4] In exudative DME, excessive&#xD;
      leakage of fluid from the blood vessels around the macula results in thickening or swelling&#xD;
      of the retina and a resultant reduction in central vision. There is often a combination of&#xD;
      ischaemia and exudation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular endothelial growth factor:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A chemical called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated as a&#xD;
      potential cause of the abnormalities seen in DME. It has been shown to modulate the growth&#xD;
      and pattern of blood vessels, the tone and permeability of their walls, and to cause white&#xD;
      blood cells to be drawn to the inner walls of blood vessels. [5, 6] The actual roles played&#xD;
      by VEGF are in part dependent on the needs of the tissues in which it is acting. [5] Studies&#xD;
      of diseases of the eye that involve the abnormal development of new blood vessels, such as&#xD;
      neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
      (PDR), have demonstrated a central role for VEGF. It has also been implicated in the&#xD;
      development of some of the problems associated with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and&#xD;
      DME. VEGF exists in a variety of subtypes, called &quot;isoforms&quot;, each described by the number of&#xD;
      amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) that it contains. The different VEGF isoforms&#xD;
      have distinct activities at different sites in the body and its various tissues. [7] This may&#xD;
      in part help to explain how VEGF is able to elicit such a variety of functions within blood&#xD;
      vessels and beyond. [5]&#xD;
&#xD;
      A role for VEGF inhibitors in the eye:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macugen [TM] (OSI-Eyetech, Inc. and Pfizer, Inc.), also known as pegaptanib, is a drug which&#xD;
      has the ability to block one of the isoforms of VEGF called VEGF(165), leaving the other&#xD;
      types of VEGF unaffected [8]. It inhibits the amount of leakage of fluid through blood vessel&#xD;
      walls. It has been demonstrated that VEGF(165) alone mediates abnormal new blood vessel&#xD;
      development in the eye, and its inactivation by Macugen [TM] inhibits the new vessel&#xD;
      development observed in patients with neovascular AMD [8] without affecting normal blood&#xD;
      vessel development, which is supported by the VEGF(121) isoform. In addition, animal model&#xD;
      studies have shown that injection of Macugen [TM] into the fluid at the back of the eye&#xD;
      (&quot;intravitreal injection&quot;) can inhibit or even show signs of reversing the typical damage to&#xD;
      the blood vessels that occurs in diabetes. [9] These findings suggest that that intravitreal&#xD;
      Macugen [TM] could provide a safe and effective treatment against both the development of&#xD;
      abnormal new blood vessels in the eye and diabetes-induced damage to the blood vessels of the&#xD;
      retina. [6] They formed the basis for randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of&#xD;
      Macugen [TM] as a therapy for AMD and DME. [8]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other inhibitors of VEGF or &quot;antiVEGF&quot; drugs exist. These include Avastin [TM] (bevacizumab,&#xD;
      Genentech, Inc) and Lucentis [TM] (ranibizumab, Genentech, Inc.) which bind to and inhibit&#xD;
      all VEGF isoforms, in contrast to Macugen [TM] which is specific for VEGF(165). To date,&#xD;
      Macugen [TM] and Lucentis [TM] have received regulatory approval for the treatment of&#xD;
      neovascular AMD. Increasingly antiVEGF drugs are being examined to see if they might play a&#xD;
      beneficial role in other ocular conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The generalized leakage of fluid from tiny blood vessels (&quot;capillary hyperpermeability&quot;) seen&#xD;
      in DME has been described as being somewhat analogous to the leakage or &quot;hyperpermeability&quot;&#xD;
      seen from the abnormal blood vessels (choroidal neovascularisation) associated with AMD. [10]&#xD;
      Therapeutic effects from blockade of the VEGF(165) isoform previously demonstrated in AMD&#xD;
      have been demonstrated in DME. That particular study, detailed below, did not specify the&#xD;
      degree of macular ischaemia that these patients had.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and efficacy of Macugen [TM] were assessed in a randomized, sham-controlled,&#xD;
      double-masked, Phase 2 trial enrolling 172 diabetic subjects with DME affecting the centre of&#xD;
      the fovea. The participants were individuals with a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)&#xD;
      between 20/50 and 20/320 in the study eye and DME involving the centre of the macula for whom&#xD;
      the investigator judged laser photocoagulation (at present the standard treatment for&#xD;
      clinically significant exudative DME) could be safely withheld for 16 weeks. Intravitreal&#xD;
      injections of Macugen [TM], or a sham injection, were administered at baseline and every six&#xD;
      weeks thereafter. At Week 36, 0.3 mg Macugen [TM] was significantly superior to sham&#xD;
      injection. The results suggested an overall visual acuity (VA) gain as well as a reduced risk&#xD;
      of VA loss in eyes with DME treated with intravitreal Macugen [TM]. The 0.3 mg dose seemed to&#xD;
      be the most efficacious dose studied, but due to the relatively small number of participants&#xD;
      in the study, the authors were unable to identify statistical differences between the&#xD;
      different doses given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors felt that these results were consistent with established and known effects of&#xD;
      selective blockade of VEGF(165) bioactivity- decreased leakage from blood vessel walls-and&#xD;
      postulated that they suggest an anti-permeability effect at the macula. Most adverse events&#xD;
      were transient, mild to moderate in severity, and attributed to the injection and the&#xD;
      preparation procedure itself, rather than to the study drug. Macugen [TM] was equally well&#xD;
      tolerated systemically, with no apparent increased risk of cardiac, ischaemic or haemorrhagic&#xD;
      adverse events. [11] Rates of serious injection-related complications, most notably infection&#xD;
      inside the eye (endophthalmitis), were within the range of historical benchmarks of&#xD;
      injections into the eye and not associated with severe visual loss. These preliminary&#xD;
      findings provide evidence that selective inhibition of VEGF(165) may produce a clinically&#xD;
      meaningful and statistically significant benefit in the treatment of DME. Confirmation of&#xD;
      these preliminary observations of Macugen [TM] safety, patient tolerance, and significant&#xD;
      efficacy across a broad spectrum of patients with DME is required. [10]&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is now a growing body of evidence [12, 13] that suggests that there may be a role for&#xD;
      antiVEGF drugs, both selective and unselective, in the treatment of the wide range of ocular&#xD;
      conditions caused by the development of abnormal blood vessels, including exudative DME. [14]&#xD;
      Results of large, randomised, controlled trials are needed to confirm early safety and&#xD;
      efficacy findings from small, open-label prospective studies. Laser photocoagulation&#xD;
      treatment, however, remains the current best treatment for clinically significant exudative&#xD;
      DME. The primary aim of this type of laser treatment is to try to stabilise vision rather&#xD;
      than to improve it. [15] In ischaemic diabetic maculopathy laser treatment is not an option&#xD;
      as it would be expected to make vision worse. There is no known effective treatment for&#xD;
      ischaemic DME, the natural history of which is of a gradual decline in central vision.&#xD;
      Ischaemia is well known to be a major factor in the development and progression of diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy (DR). It may be due in part to the effects of VEGF on the tone of blood vessel&#xD;
      walls and narrowing of small blood vessels. Consequently some studies have been done to try&#xD;
      to assess the effect of antiVEGF treatment on retinal ischaemia. The results in the&#xD;
      literature are conflicting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VEGF inhibitors and retinal ischaemia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neubauer and colleagues [16] showed that the anti-VEGF drug Avastin [TM], which inhibits all&#xD;
      isoforms of VEGF, caused a reduction in peripheral retinal ischaemia and an improvement in&#xD;
      visual acuity in patients with diabetic retinopathy. They investigated changes in central and&#xD;
      peripheral ischaemia after intravitreal injection of Avastin [TM] and were able to&#xD;
      demonstrate in a small series of patients with DR that Avastin [TM] treatment improved&#xD;
      peripheral ischaemia in the short term. They saw no evidence of increasing ischaemia, as&#xD;
      might be feared. Limitations of their study include the small number of patients and short&#xD;
      follow-up after only one administration. They believe that the observed reduction of&#xD;
      ischaemia makes anti-VEGF therapy a promising approach in the treatment of DR, but further&#xD;
      investigations with longer follow-up times are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, a single case report [17] demonstrated a deterioration in VA with the use of&#xD;
      Avastin [TM] for chronic, refractory DME in a 58-year-old woman who had undergone multiple&#xD;
      previous treatments including laser photocoagulation and intravitreal triamcinolone (steroid)&#xD;
      injections. The authors felt that using Avastin [TM] in this way exacerbated macular&#xD;
      ischaemia by disrupting an already fragile perfusion status. It is difficult to attribute the&#xD;
      poor outcome fully to the antiVEGF drug, but the report highlights our need to examine the&#xD;
      effects of antiVEGF in ischaemic DME more closely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chung and colleagues [18] retrospectively analysed the effect of macular ischaemia on the&#xD;
      outcome of treatment of DME with Avastin [TM]. They collected data on 59 eyes of 53&#xD;
      consecutive patients and analysed their preoperative imaging tests (fluorescein angiograms)&#xD;
      for signs of ischaemia. They then divided the patients into two groups, those with and&#xD;
      without signs of ischaemia, in order to assess their outcomes. 3 months after treatment, the&#xD;
      group with ischaemia showed a reduction in visual acuity from approximately 20/63 to 20/80,&#xD;
      whereas the group without ischaemia showed an improvement in visual acuity from 20/100 to&#xD;
      20/80. Nine of 18 eyes (50%) in the ischaemic group, but only 9 of 41 eyes (21%) in the&#xD;
      non-ischaemic group, experienced visual losses of &gt;or=1 line on the ETDRS chart (P = 0.031,&#xD;
      Pearson chi-square test). Four eyes (22%) in the ischaemic group, but only 2 eyes (5%) in the&#xD;
      non-ischaemic group, lost &gt;or=3 lines (P = 0.042, Pearson chi-square test). Whilst these data&#xD;
      show a poorer outcome for patients with macular ischaemia treated with Avastin [TM], compared&#xD;
      to those without, they do not show how treatment with Avastin [TM] compares to what would&#xD;
      have happened to these patients' vision without any treatment at all. As already discussed&#xD;
      the natural history of ischaemic DME is of a decline in visual acuity and there is currently&#xD;
      no established treatment option. The investigators would not expect the patients with&#xD;
      ischaemic DME to do as well as those without ischaemia as they tend to have much more severe&#xD;
      disease than those without ischaemia. In this particular group it appears that the baseline&#xD;
      acuity was much poorer in the non-ischaemic group, which gave them more scope for improvement&#xD;
      in visual acuity with treatment than the non-ischaemic group which had, on average, better&#xD;
      visual acuity, and probably much less oedema, to begin with.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macugen [TM] for ischaemic DME:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have chosen to look at Macugen [TM] because of its specificity and&#xD;
      generally good safety profile which has now been validated over &gt;4 years. It is possible that&#xD;
      a non-selective VEGF inhibitor that blocks all VEGF isoforms could be more deleterious to&#xD;
      retinal function over the long term than a more selective VEGF antagonist that could spare&#xD;
      several of the smaller soluble VEGF isoforms within the eye. [19] No increased risk of&#xD;
      serious systemic adverse events has been shown in any of the major clinical trials of Macugen&#xD;
      [TM]. [11] The incidence of ocular adverse events when used for treating AMD is low [20]. As&#xD;
      discussed above, Macugen [TM] has been used with benefit in exudative DME but its&#xD;
      effectiveness in ischaemic DME, for which there is currently no available treatment, remains&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to use Macugen [TM] to treat 30 patients with ischaemic DME. The&#xD;
      investigators will diagnose macular ischaemia by assessing the size of the foveal avascular&#xD;
      zone (FAZ). This is the area at the centre of the macula. It is usually devoid of blood&#xD;
      vessels in order to maximise visual clarity. The FAZ may be abnormally enlarged and irregular&#xD;
      in patients with diabetes and this is a requirement for the diagnosis of ischaemic DME.&#xD;
      Enlargement of the FAZ is thought to be a sign of reduced blood flow, possibly related to the&#xD;
      effects of VEGF, and is associated with reduced vision. Macugen [TM] will be given at the&#xD;
      standard dose that is used for treating AMD and that which was identified as most effective&#xD;
      in the phase 2 study of Macugen [TM] in DME, i.e. 0.3mg. Our primary outcome will be the&#xD;
      change in size of the FAZ and secondarily we would like to look for a change in thickness of&#xD;
      the retina at the centre of the macula or a change in visual acuity. The investigators hope&#xD;
      that this pilot study will clarify whether Macugen [TM] might be able to reverse some of the&#xD;
      effects of VEGF(165) and be of benefit for those with ischaemic DME, the more severe end of&#xD;
      the DME spectrum.&#xD;
