  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study to determine the reliability and accuracy of Near&#xD;
      Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) to detect oxygen flow in the extremities of injured and&#xD;
      non-injured soldiers over time. This technology may be useful in the detection of acute&#xD;
      compartment syndrome. We hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NIRS values will be well-correlated with intracompartmental pressure measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NIRS values will be significantly different between non-injured and injured extremities,&#xD;
           and injured extremities treated with fasciotomy for acute compartment syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NIRS values of the upper extremity and feet will correlate to values from normal legs in&#xD;
           critical control patients and patients with unilateral sever lower extremity injuries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective observational cohort study is to define the reliability and&#xD;
      accuracy of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) in the detection of intra-compartmental tissue&#xD;
      perfusion in injured and noninjured extremities over time. Additionally, it will establish&#xD;
      diagnostic perfusion value thresholds to be used in a subsequent interventional study&#xD;
      confirming the efficacy of NIRS-based ACS monitoring. Through prospective measurements of&#xD;
      NIRS values, vital signs, intracompartmental pressures and clinical examinations, guidelines&#xD;
      and parameters will be established for the use of NIRS in diagnosing acute compartment&#xD;
      syndrome (ACS), monitoring patients at risk for ACS and evaluating the adequacy of fasciotomy&#xD;
      in patients treated for ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NIRS values do not correlate with intracompartmental pressures, when they are obtained&#xD;
           in the course of routine care of patients in the combat theater.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no difference in the NIRS values between non-injured, injured extremities and&#xD;
           injured extremities treated with fasciotomy for ACS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NIRS values from the upper extremity and feet do not correlate to NIRS values from the&#xD;
           normal legs in critical control patients and patients with unilateral severe lower&#xD;
           extremity injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conduct observational, human-use, study to compile a normative reference database for&#xD;
           NIRS-measured tissue perfusion in the uninjured upper extremity and the injured and&#xD;
           non-injured legs of up to 120 injured subjects, from varying ethnicities (skin&#xD;
           pigmentations) in varying degrees of hemodynamic status (stable, critically injured) to&#xD;
           test the 3 hypotheses listed above. The study groups consist of one control group&#xD;
           (critically ill without leg injuries) and one investigational group (critically injured&#xD;
           with leg injuries):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  COHORT 1: 25 critically injured patients with NO severe traumatic lower extremity&#xD;
                traumatic injuries to provide normative data for the &quot;critically injured&quot;&#xD;
                physiological status (&quot;Critical&quot; CONTROLS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  COHORT 2: 95 total (35 Cohort 2A; 35 Cohort 2B; 25 Cohort 2C) patients with&#xD;
                &quot;severe&quot; traumatic lower extremity injuries presenting to a &quot;participating&quot; level 1&#xD;
                trauma center within 12 hours of their injury, to provide data on the acute&#xD;
                post-injury phase. (INVESTIGATIONAL COHORT)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  COHORT 2A: Patients meeting COHORT 2 inclusion criteria, who have UNILATERAL&#xD;
                &quot;severe lower extremity injuries&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  COHORT 2B: Patients meeting COHORT 2 inclusion criteria, who have BILATERAL &quot;severe&#xD;
                lower extremity injuries&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  COHORT 2C (ACS GROUP): Patients meeting COHORT 2 inclusion criteria, who have been&#xD;
                clinically diagnosed by the treating provider using that treating provider's&#xD;
                standards of diagnosing ACS and the patient, in addition to being diagnosed with&#xD;
                ACS, undergoes four-compartment leg fasciotomy. Patients in this cohort need data&#xD;
                collection to start BEFORE fasciotomy and continue AFTER fasciotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Record provider comments regarding usability of the technology in its new embodiment and&#xD;
           areas of needed design improvement. Apply this knowledge to perfect the industrial&#xD;
           design and functionality of the final device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Establish evidenced-based clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ACS in&#xD;
           traumatically injured soldiers to be tested in a subsequent interventional clinical&#xD;
           (IDE) study.&#xD;
