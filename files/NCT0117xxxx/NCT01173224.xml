      Influenza (flu) is a common respiratory infection and often causes severe illness. Few drugs&#xD;
      are currently approved to treat influenza. This research will test the safety of an&#xD;
      experimental anti-influenza drug called DAS181 that is given through an inhaler. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate the safety of this new medication and how the body reacts to it.&#xD;
      Any side effects will be measured by symptoms, physical examination or laboratory studies.&#xD;
      About 27 healthy men and women age 18-45, who meet screening requirements, will participate.&#xD;
      Three separate groups will be enrolled, with approximately 9 subjects in each group. Cohort&#xD;
      1:20 mg DAS181 or placebo for 1 day (total dose of 20 mg). Cohort 2: 20 mg DAS181 or placebo&#xD;
      for 10 consecutive days (total dose of 200 mg). Cohort 3: 30 mg DAS 181 or placebo for 1 day&#xD;
      (total dose of 30 mg.) Procedures include blood samples, electrocardiograms (measures heart&#xD;
      activity) and breathing tests.&#xD;

      Influenza is typically caused by infection of two types of viruses, influenza virus A and&#xD;
      influenza virus B. The host cell receptors for influenza A and B viruses are cell surface&#xD;
      sialic acids (SA). The Actinomyces viscosus sialidase Catalytic Domain (AvCD) sialidase&#xD;
      domain in DAS181 selectively cleaves sialic acids from the host cells, thereby rendering them&#xD;
      inaccessible to the influenza viral particles that require sialic acids as receptors. By&#xD;
      binding to the negatively charged glycosaminoglycans on the surface of airway epithelial&#xD;
      cells, the cationic C-terminal Amphiregulin (AR) tag anchors DAS181 on the respiratory&#xD;
      epithelium, thereby improving treatment potency and retention of the investigational drug on&#xD;
      the airway surface. DAS181 is the first candidate in a new class of influenza therapeutics,&#xD;
      viral receptor inactivator. The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of DAS181 encapsulated dry powder compared to placebo when administered by oral inhalation&#xD;
      using a dry powder inhaler (DPI) in healthy adults. The secondary objective of this study is&#xD;
      to investigate the pharmacokinetic and immunologic profile of DAS181 encapsulated dry powder&#xD;
      dose to dose and compared to placebo when administered by oral inhalation using a DPI in&#xD;
      healthy adults. A total of 27 normal healthy male and female subjects (9 per cohort) 18 to 45&#xD;
      years of age at the time of screening will be included in this study. This study will be a&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of a three cohorts. Cohort 1:20 mg DAS181&#xD;
      or placebo for 1 day (total dose of 20 mg). Cohort 2: 20 mg DAS181 or placebo for 10&#xD;
      consecutive days (total dose of 200 mg). Cohort 3: 30 mg DAS 181 or placebo for 1 day (total&#xD;
      dose of 30 mg.) The study will proceed to the next stage of multiple daily doses based on&#xD;
      meeting study defined criteria. Within each dose cohort of nine, subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to DAS181 or placebo at 2:1 ratios. Subjects will be admitted to the inpatient&#xD;
      clinic on the day prior to first dose (Day -1). The subjects in single dose cohorts (Cohort 1&#xD;
      and 3) will stay in the inpatient unit for dosing (Day 0) and one day after dosing (Day 1).&#xD;
      Subjects in Cohort 1 will come back for follow-up visits on Study Days 2, 3, 7, 14, and 30 .&#xD;
      Subjects in Cohort 3 will return on Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 8. 10, 16, and 30. The subjects in the&#xD;
      10-day, multiple-dose cohort (Cohort 2) will stay in the inpatient clinic from Day -1 to 1&#xD;
      and will be required to come back for follow-up visits on Days 2 - 7. They will be seen (and&#xD;
      optionally readmitted) Days 8 - 10 and will be seen as outpatients Days 11, 13, 15, 17, 20,&#xD;
      22, 24, and 27. All subjects will be asked to return for an additional blood draw to conduct&#xD;
      an immunogenicity test at 90 days post final dosing. Subjects will be trained in proper&#xD;
      inhalation techniques prior to dosing using a low range inspiratory flow measurement device.&#xD;
