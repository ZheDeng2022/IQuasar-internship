  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still one of the most important causes of morbidity in&#xD;
      adults. (1) In severe cases, parapneumonic effusions or empyema may develop. In these&#xD;
      patients, a transitional fibrin neomatrix constitutes part of the acute inflammatory response&#xD;
      as seen in sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to study the fibrinolytic activity in patients with CAP alone versus CAP with&#xD;
      parapneumonic effusions with and without empyema.&#xD;

      Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still one of the most important causes of morbidity in&#xD;
      adults. (1) In severe cases, parapneumonic effusions or empyema may develop. In these&#xD;
      patients, a transitional fibrin neomatrix constitutes part of the acute inflammatory response&#xD;
      as seen in sepsis. (2) The increased vascular permeability, mediated by several cytokines,&#xD;
      such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and platelet activator factor, allows&#xD;
      migration of inflammatory cells, an increased fluid accumulation and bacterial invasion into&#xD;
      pleural space. (3) At this stage, activation of the coagulation cascade leads to procoagulant&#xD;
      activity and decreased fibrinolysis with deposition of fibrin in the pleural space. The&#xD;
      activation of the fibrinolytic system produce the D-dimer and follow by increased other&#xD;
      procoagulant markers like thrombin anti thrombin, fragment 1.2 (4-5) Several studies showed&#xD;
      that the plasma D-dimer levels were increased even in community-acquired pneumonia patients.&#xD;
      Moreover, others reported that Serum levels of AT-III, D-D and CRP at admission appear to be&#xD;
      useful biomarkers for assessing the severity of CAP. However, no data exists about the&#xD;
      fibrinolytic profile in patients with CAP alone in compare to CAP with parapneumonic effusion&#xD;
      with and without empyema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the fibrinolytic activity in patients with CAP alone versus CAP with parapneumonic&#xD;
      effusions with and without empyema.&#xD;
