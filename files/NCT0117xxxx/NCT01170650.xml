    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) (based upon&#xD;
      investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1) in participants with platinum-resistant ovarian&#xD;
      cancer who receive combination therapy with EC145 and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin&#xD;
      (EC145+PLD) with that in participants who receive PLD and placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of&#xD;
      EC145 and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD; available in the United States as Doxil® and&#xD;
      outside the United States as Caelyx®) compared to PLD and placebo. Enrollment of 640 patients&#xD;
      including approximately 500 that are folate receptor positive is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EC145 is a drug that is specifically designed to enter cancer cells via the folate vitamin&#xD;
      receptor (FR) that is not generally found on normal cells. Experimental evidence shows that&#xD;
      this target receptor is expressed on virtually all ovarian cancers. Early clinical evidence&#xD;
      in a small number of Phase I participants, in a subset of participants in a completed&#xD;
      single-arm Phase II study, and interim data from an ongoing randomized Phase 2 study&#xD;
      (PRECEDENT) suggests that EC145 may have antitumor effect in women with platinum-resistant&#xD;
      ovarian cancer and that EC145 alone and in combination with PLD is generally well-tolerated.&#xD;
      This evidence suggests that EC145 may be useful as chemotherapy against platinum-resistant&#xD;
      ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo imaging with the FR-targeting investigational diagnostic agent&#xD;
      EC20 during the screening period to assess binding of the imaging agent EC20 to tumors. This&#xD;
      non-invasive procedure will provide additional information on the utility of using EC20&#xD;
      imaging to identify subjects with the FR molecular &quot;target&quot; prior to treatment with EC145&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

             therapy (e.g., for nausea prophylaxis) is acceptable; however, concomitant tamoxifen&#xD;
