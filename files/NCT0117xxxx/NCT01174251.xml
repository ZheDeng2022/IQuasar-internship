  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, known as Torsades de Pointes (TdP), is a specific form&#xD;
      of ventricular arrhythmia with a characteristic twist of the QRS complex around the&#xD;
      isoelectric baseline. TdP can degenerate into ventricular defibrillation followed by sudden&#xD;
      cardiac death. A predictor for the development of TdP is the length of the QT interval&#xD;
      measured on an EKG recording. The QT interval is known to be prolonged by many medications&#xD;
      used in a perioperative setting as well as by other conditions such as hypothermia and&#xD;
      electrolyte imbalance. General anesthesia exposes most of the investigators patients to a&#xD;
      combination of several of those medications and conditions and therefore might increase the&#xD;
      risk for the development of QT prolongation. Moreover, patient related risk factors are well&#xD;
      known and aggravate the individual risk for potential life threatening TdP events when&#xD;
      exposed to QT prolonging medications perioperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research suggests that more than 20% of the patients might develop QT prolongations&#xD;
      perioperatively and are consequently on an increased risk for TdP; yet, no study has&#xD;
      systematically investigated the magnitude of the problem and associated risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed pilot study is designed as a prospective observational cohort study to&#xD;
      investigate the QT interval before, during and after general anesthesia. It aims to determine&#xD;
      the incidence of perioperative QT prolongations. A customary long term EKG recording device&#xD;
      will be connected to a random sample of patients undergoing general anesthesia. Using these&#xD;
      continuous EKG tracings, the lengths of the QT interval will be analyzed during the&#xD;
      perioperative period.&#xD;
