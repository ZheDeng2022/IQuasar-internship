  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study the investigators will treat all patients known with Peutz-Jeghers&#xD;
      syndrome (PJS) who are diagnosed with advanced malignancies with everolimus 10mg daily until&#xD;
      disease progression. Most patients with PJS have an inherited LKB1 mutation leading to&#xD;
      aberrant m-TOR activity. Their risk to develop malignancies or intestinal polyps is probably&#xD;
      related to this constitutive mTOR signaling. The hypothesis is that mTOR inhibition is an&#xD;
      effective anticancer treatment in PJS patients with advanced malignancies.&#xD;

    <description>All patients who are willing to undergo extra tissue collection will have a tumor and where possible a polyp biopsy before treatment and for tumor biopsy in week 2 and 4 and for polyps once every 6 months during treatment for biomarker investigations. The activity of mTOR and its downstream targets will be measured in the tumor as well as the arborization pattern and apoptosis activity in the polyps.</description>
