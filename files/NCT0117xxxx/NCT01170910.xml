  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that the Waters Medical® pulsatile perfusion machine (RM 3) is a way to&#xD;
      improve delayed graft function (DGF) in marginal grafts, and some perfusion profiles (flow,&#xD;
      pressure, resistance index, venous effluent pH) are correlated with better recovery of renal&#xD;
      function (without dialysis during the first week after transplant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation or Investigation Method Used :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is multicenter, prospective, open, controlled and randomized:grafts are divided&#xD;
      into two parallel groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group 1 corresponds to a conservation of grafts in static incubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group 2 corresponds to conservation using a pulsatile perfusion machine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration and Organizational Arrangements for Research :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study is planned for 36 months. This duration includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an inclusion period that will last 24 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the follow-up of recipient patients from the day of transplantation until twelve months&#xD;
           after the operation&#xD;

    <description>If conservation in static incubation (group 1) is chosen by random selection, the transplant should be carried out while keeping the cold ischemic time (CIT) as short as possible (preferably less than 18 hours). Keep in mind that for reasons of homogeneity for result analysis and for conservation quality, it is recommended that kidneys in group 1 be conserved in University of Wisconsin (eg, UW, Belzer® or Viaspan®), IGL-1, or SCOT solution.</description>
