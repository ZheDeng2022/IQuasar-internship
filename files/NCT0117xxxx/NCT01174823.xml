    <measure>Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) - Mean Change in Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Responses to questions relating to symptoms and daily activities in the RQLQ were provided for 28 questions encompassing the 7 major domains of activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional state. Each response to an RQLQ question was provided on a scale of 0-6 units, where 0 = not troubled/none of the time and 6 = extremely troubled/all of the time. The minimum total score was 0 units and the maximum total score was 42 units, with higher score indicating decreased quality of life due to rhinoconjunctivitis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline for Twice Daily (BID) Averaged Reflective Ocular Itching Scores Over the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular itching was graded on a 4-point scale (0-3 units; 0=Absent, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe) twice daily in the Screening Diary (Day -7 to Day -1) and the Subject Diary (Day 0 prior to first dose through Day 13).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline for Twice Daily (BID) Averaged Instantaneous Ocular Redness Scores Over the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular redness each was graded on a 4-point scale (0-3 units; 0=Absent, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe) twice daily in the Screening Diary (Day -7 to Day -1) and the Subject Diary (Day 0 prior to first dose through Day 13).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline for Twice Daily (BID) Averaged Proportion of Tearing Episodes Over the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Individual nasal symptoms and ocular itching and redness each were graded on a 4-point scale (0-3 units; 0=Absent, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe) BID in the Screening Diary (Day -7 to Day -1) and BID in the Subject Diary (Day 0 prior to first dose through Day 13). Tearing was scored from Day 0 as either absent or present at the same time as nasal and other ocular symptoms were graded. The proportion of participants was calculated and then then average of the proportions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline for Twice Daily (BID) Averaged Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Scores Over the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Individual nasal symptoms of rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing each were each graded on a 4-point scale (0-3 units; 0=Absent, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe) twice daily in the Screening Diary (Day -7 to Day -1) and the Subject Diary (Day 0 prior to first dose through Day 13). The minimum Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) was 0 units and the maximum TNSS corresponding to multiple individual nasal symptoms scored as severe was 12 units</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Therapeutic Response Rating - Participant Assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked if they felt that they had experienced improvement in allergy symptoms after therapy. Participant assessed global therapeutic response rating: categories that the participant could select were 'no change', 'slight improvement', 'improved', or 'marked improvement'.</description>

        <description>Responses to questions relating to symptoms and daily activities in the RQLQ were provided for 28 questions encompassing the 7 major domains of activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional state. Each response to an RQLQ question was provided on a scale of 0-6 units, where 0 = not troubled/none of the time and 6 = extremely troubled/all of the time. The minimum total score was 0 units and the maximum total score was 42 units, with higher score indicating decreased quality of life due to rhinoconjunctivitis.</description>
