  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff tears are a common injury that lead to pain and loss of function for those who&#xD;
      suffer from it. Treatment includes the use of arthroscopic surgery to return function to the&#xD;
      patient and reduce their pain. This study is interested in a technique that has the potential&#xD;
      to improve patient outcomes in terms of less pain and better function after their surgery.&#xD;
      Autologous Conditioned Plasma (ACP) or Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) is the intervention of&#xD;
      interest, which is simply the patient's own blood that is withdrawn and spun down to obtain a&#xD;
      high concentration of cells called platelets. Platelets release growth factors important for&#xD;
      healing, as well as fibrin, which acts like a biological glue. The PRP is then re-injected&#xD;
      into the shoulder at the time of surgery and again at 4 weeks. It has been shown to&#xD;
      accelerate healing in other studies for injuries such as chronic elbow tendinopathy, but&#xD;
      there is no randomized controlled trial that evaluates the effect of PRP in rotator cuff&#xD;
      tears. It is on this basis that the study is being performed. Participating patients will&#xD;
      receive either a PRP injection or a placebo (normal saline) and the effects will be compared&#xD;
      at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks based on a pain score and return to function questionnaires.&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis for this study is that ACP compared with placebo is effective in&#xD;
      reducing pain at the site of a rotator cuff injury that has undergone arthroscopic repair. It&#xD;
      is expected that ACP administered during surgery and 4 weeks post-surgery will reduce 6-week&#xD;
      pain scores compared to the placebo group.&#xD;

    <description>To investigate the effect of ACP compared to placebo on pain scores in rotator cuff tears undergoing arthroscopic repair at 6 weeks.&#xD;
Pain severity will be measured using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Subjects will be asked to rate their worst pain in their shoulder for the previous 24 hours on a 100 mm vertical scale with &quot;0&quot; indicating no pain at all and &quot;100&quot; indicating the worst pain the subject can imagine.</description>
