  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies has found a connection between breakfast consumption and obesity and obesity-related&#xD;
      complications, but only few studies examined the effect of breakfast size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of breakfast size on several parameters in&#xD;
      adults with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity has rapidly increased during recent decades, while the prevalence&#xD;
      of skipping breakfast has increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have reported inverse relationships between the consumption of breakfast and&#xD;
      BMI and weight gain. A study that examined the effect of breakfast size, found that an&#xD;
      increased percentage of daily energy consumed at breakfast was associated with relatively&#xD;
      lower weight gain. Preliminary results of clinical research (unpublished) show a connection&#xD;
      between a large breakfast and weight loss and increased feeling of satiety throughout the&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of breakfast size on blood glucose&#xD;
      balance, and its correlation with hormonal profile (including appetite hormones), adipokines&#xD;
      and pro-inflammatory cytokines, weight and body composition and lipid profile in adults with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a randomized-controlled, non-blinded, prospective design, including 48&#xD;
      participants with type 2 diabetes, who are not insulin dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research group will receive instructions to eat a large breakfast compared with the&#xD;
      control group that will receive instructions to eat a small breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated duration of the study is about three months.&#xD;

    <description>The research group will receive instructions to eat a large breakfast, Dividing the total daily calories recommended to the patient to: breakfast - 1/8 of the total daily calories , lunch - 1/3 of the total daily calories and supper- 1/3 of the total daily calories.&#xD;
(the rest of the calories will be snacks between the meals) In contrast, the control group that will receive instructions to eat a small breakfast.&#xD;
Dividing the total daily calories recommended to the patient to: breakfast - 1/3 of the total daily calories , lunch - 1/4 of the total daily calories and supper- 1/4 of the total daily calories (the rest of the calories will snacks between the meals).&#xD;
The instructions will be adapted to each patient individually</description>
