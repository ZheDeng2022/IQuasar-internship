      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of canagliflozin on gastrointestinal&#xD;
      glucose absorption in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center study that will be conducted in two Parts (Part 1 and Part 2) to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of a single-dose of canagliflozin on the absorption of glucose in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. Part 1 is a pilot (small) study where responses to key pharmocodynamic (PD)&#xD;
      parameters (ie, specific tests on blood samples to evaluate effects of no treatment on the&#xD;
      body) will be measured to confirm the study design and number of volunteers planned for Part&#xD;
      2. Part 2 is the main study where volunteers will be randomized (assigned to study drug or&#xD;
      placebo by chance) to receive double-blind (neither the volunteer or study physician will&#xD;
      know the identity of the treatment assigned) treatment with canagliflozin or placebo&#xD;
      (treatment identical in appearance to canagliflozin but contains no active drug) to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of canagliflozin compared to placebo on gastrointestinal glucose absorption using&#xD;
      a radiolabeled glucose tracer approach (ie, where a radioactive substance is combined with&#xD;
      glucose allowing the movement of glucose in the body to be traced or detected). Blood and&#xD;
      urine samples will be collected from volunteers at pre-defined times during the study for PD&#xD;
      analysis. Safety will be monitored during the study by evaluating adverse events and results&#xD;
      from clinical laboratory tests, vital signs measurements, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and&#xD;
      physical examinations performed. Volunteers in Part 1 will receive 240 ml of water 10 minutes&#xD;
      before starting of the MMTT in each period (Periods 1 and 2). Volunteers in Part 2 will&#xD;
      receive study drug 20 minutes prior to starting of the MMTT in treatment sequence 1 (a single&#xD;
      300-mg dose of canagliflozin in Period 1 followed by matching placebo in Period 2) or in&#xD;
      treatment Sequence 2 (matching placebo in Period 1 followed by a single 300-mg dose of&#xD;
      canagliflozin in Period 2). Periods 1 and 2 will be separated by 7 to 21 days.&#xD;
