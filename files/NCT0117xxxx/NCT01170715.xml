      Psoriasis is a chronic relapsing prevalent inflammatory disease affecting 2-4% of the world's&#xD;
      population. Severe psoriasis is a disabling disease affecting the physical and emotional well&#xD;
      being of patients, and its effect on quality of life is similar to that seen with other major&#xD;
      medical diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. Lately, it is&#xD;
      increasingly being recognized that psoriasis is not merely a skin disease but is probably&#xD;
      associated with other co-morbidities such as psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome and cardio-vascular diseases (CVD). The metabolic syndrome is a&#xD;
      combination of diabetes mellitus type II (or insulin resistance), hypertension, central&#xD;
      obesity, and combined hyperlipidemia (elevated LDL; decreased HDL; elevated triglycerides).&#xD;
      As the literature linking psoriasis and the metabolic syndrome expands, also reports of an&#xD;
      increased rate of CVD mortality in psoriasis patients accumulates. These data emphasize that&#xD;
      metabolic dysregulations are the leading risk factors for occlusive vascular events and early&#xD;
      death in patients with severe psoriasis. Progress in understanding the pathogenesis of these&#xD;
      apparently diverse diseases has discovered that low-grade systemic inflammation might be the&#xD;
      common physiological pathway that may provide the biological plausibility of the associations&#xD;
      discovered in the epidemiological studies. Since some of these co-morbidities often become&#xD;
      clinically apparent years after the onset of psoriasis we assume that controlling systemic&#xD;
      inflammation might prevent or reverse some of these co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently there is no study in psoriasis that shows that a &quot;systemic&quot; co-morbidity can be&#xD;
      prevented or treated by reversing skin inflammation.&#xD;

      Psoriasis is the most prevalent immune-mediated skin disease affecting 2-4% of the world's&#xD;
      population. Severe psoriasis is a disabling disease affecting the physical and emotional well&#xD;
      being of patients, and its effect on quality of life is similar to that seen with other major&#xD;
      medical diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. Psoriasis is a&#xD;
      prototypical Th-1 and Th-17 inflammatory disease, which demonstrates a complex interplay&#xD;
      between innate and adaptive immunity. Although the etiology of psoriasis in still not&#xD;
      completely elucidated, on the basis of existing knowledge, it is obvious that psoriasis is a&#xD;
      complex trait involving genetic, metabolic and immune mechanisms as well as environmental&#xD;
      factors. Moreover, it is increasingly being recognized that psoriasis is not merely a skin&#xD;
      disease but is probably associated with other co-morbidities such as psoriatic arthritis,&#xD;
      Crohn's disease, the metabolic syndrome and CVD. Some of these co-morbidities often become&#xD;
      clinically apparent years after the onset of psoriasis and are frequently found in patients&#xD;
      with severe disease. Furthermore, recently, studies based on large cohorts of psoriasis&#xD;
      patients showed that severe psoriasis was association with increased mortality and CVD was&#xD;
      found to be the most common cause of death. The metabolic syndrome The metabolic syndrome is&#xD;
      a combination of diabetes mellitus type II (or insulin resistance), hypertension, central&#xD;
      obesity, and combined hyperlipidemia (elevated LDL; decreased HDL; elevated triglycerides).&#xD;
      The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in the USA is estimated to be up to 15% of the&#xD;
      population. Obesity, which is a central feature in the metabolic syndrome, has been termed&#xD;
      the modern &quot;epidemic&quot; of the western world. The metabolic syndrome components are associated&#xD;
      with increased risk for CVD, which is still the leading cause of death in the western world.&#xD;
      Interestingly, inflammation was also implicated in the pathophysiology of the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. Th-1 and Th-17 cells and cytokines as well as other adipocyte-derived-cytokines&#xD;
      adipokines and hormones were identified. Excess numbers of psoriatics are obese,&#xD;
      interestingly, the average weight of patients in recent phase 3 studies was around 90Kg.&#xD;
      Mechanistic links between psoriasis and its co-morbidities Low-grade inflammation possibly&#xD;
      mediated by TNF is suspected to be the biological plausibility explaining the associations&#xD;
      discovered in the epidemiological studies linking between psoriasis and its co-morbidities&#xD;
      and especially the metabolic syndrome. Progress in understanding the immunology of these&#xD;
      apparently diverse diseases has discovered common physiological pathways. Clearly many&#xD;
      different tissues and organs have a common blood supply and can be exposed to increased&#xD;
      levels of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other mediators through the systemic&#xD;
      circulation. The &quot;obesity of psoriasis&quot; is thought to be a key link to the metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      as well as to CVD. In the past, the only known adipose tissue functions were energy storing&#xD;
      and free fatty acids production. However, a dramatic increase of research on the role of&#xD;
      adipose tissue has led to the current view that adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ&#xD;
      with many secretory products including adipokines and other cytokines. Moreover now it is&#xD;
      also being recognized as a part of the innate immune system. Adipocytokines play important&#xD;
      roles in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and associated metabolic complications such&#xD;
      as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and premature heart disease. TNF is a major mediator of&#xD;
      disrupted insulin receptor signaling. Preventing co-morbidities In view of the chronic nature&#xD;
      of the inflammation in psoriasis and the lingering process of metabolic syndrome and CVD&#xD;
      development, the most important question is whether effective, long-term control of psoriasis&#xD;
      could prevent, reverse, or attenuate these co-morbitides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why is this trial important? At present, we do not know how &quot;deep&quot; psoriasis goes as an&#xD;
      inflammatory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory cells (macrophages) are increased in skin lesions of psoriasis, going as deep as&#xD;
      the deep dermis/adipose tissue interface. Macrophages are postulated to be cells increased in&#xD;
      adipose tissue that, in conditions of obesity, produce excess TNF and thus directly cause&#xD;
      disrupted insulin receptor signaling in adipocytes. The extension of inflammation in skin&#xD;
      lesions could well continue into the fat, with common inflammatory circuits then driving both&#xD;
      skin disease and obesity/metabolic syndrome that is so common in psoriasis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, for the purposes of this study, we consider that the adipose tissue in skin is a&#xD;
      functional compartment that is distinct from the epidermis and dermis and that production of&#xD;
      adipokines and other mediators in the fat compartment can drive not only the metabolic&#xD;
      derangements, but also influence the systemic risk of cardiovascular disease. We believe that&#xD;
      treatment of inflammation in the primary site of this disease, epidermis and dermis of skin&#xD;
      lesions could have corresponding effects on inflammation in other &quot;co-morbid&quot; tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adipose tissue underlying psoriasis plaques is the most accessible tissue to direct analysis&#xD;
      for a reduction in co-morbidity pathophysiology. Interestingly, psoriasis lesion show altered&#xD;
      expression of leptin receptors in the &quot;skin&quot; component18 but no studies have been done to&#xD;
      compare &quot;skin&quot; vs. adipose tissue. We want to use powerful, high density, arrays and&#xD;
      functional imaging studies to assess the degree of inflammation and associated metabolic&#xD;
      derangement in fat tissue and then determine the extent to which a reduction in inflammatory&#xD;
      circuits in the skin affects the core pathology in fat tissue. Associated biomarker and&#xD;
      functional assessments of the cardiovascular tree will provide critical information on&#xD;
      whether associated cardiovascular dysfunction can be reversed by treating inflammation in the&#xD;
      primary site. If this study is successful, it will not only extend information on the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of psoriasis and disease-specific co-morbid risks, but it will also provide&#xD;
      guidance on whether long-term effective treatment of inflammation could improve long-term&#xD;
      tissue outcomes deeper than the skin. Some of the studies we propose are &quot;firsts&quot; for the&#xD;
      study of psoriasis and stand to create new research approaches for psoriasis and other&#xD;
      diseases that have similar inflammatory and co-morbid risks. Preliminary Studies Studies in&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, another chronic inflammatory disease associated with&#xD;
      increased risk for CVD, showed that response to methotrexate treatment is associated with&#xD;
      reduction in CVD events and mortality. Biologic treatments for psoriasis, e.g. anti TNF-α&#xD;
      (etanercept) or anti p-40 (ustekinumab), have also been shown to reduce C reactive protein&#xD;
      (CRP) in short-term trials. A key hypothesis to this study is that the classical TNF pathway&#xD;
      (TNF,IL-1,IL-6,IL-8 then the NF kappa B immediate genes) contributes directly to the&#xD;
      metabolic alterations in psoriatic patients and that this pathway could also drive systemic&#xD;
      inflammation. CRP is produced in the liver in response to IL-6. Many other inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators associated with increased CVD risk are made at excess levels in psoriasis lesions&#xD;
      and may well contribute to the systemic inflammation burden through release into the&#xD;
      circulation. We have used gene arrays and RT-PCR to follow systemic modulation of these CVD&#xD;
      related inflammatory molecules in previous studies and will extend this analysis to adipose&#xD;
      tissue in this study. However, the question whether long-term effective management of&#xD;
      psoriasis can alter the pathophysiology of its comorbid conditions has not been investigated&#xD;
      yet.&#xD;
