  <brief_summary>

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluciclatide is a small cyclic peptide containing the RGD tri-peptide, which&#xD;
           preferentially binds with high affinity to alpha(v)beta(3) integrins, which are&#xD;
           up-regulated in and may regulate angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  [18F]Fluciclatide is a new radiopharmaceutical developed for PET imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in [18F]fluciclatide uptake will be evaluated before and after treatment of&#xD;
           patients with targeted antiangiogenic drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine tumor uptake and retention of [18F]fluciclatide before and after 1 cycle of&#xD;
           treatment with targeted anti-angiogenic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety of multiple intravenous (IV) administrations of Fluciclatide [18F]&#xD;
           Injection in subjects with solid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain preliminary data on the relationships between [18F]fluciclatide as a&#xD;
           pharmacodynamic marker and standard of care imaging markers of clinical response (e.g.&#xD;
           contrast-enhanced (CE) static computed tomography (CT), bone scintigraphy, FDG-PET),&#xD;
           obtained as part of routine clinical follow-up as specified in the referring protocols,&#xD;
           as well as any optional imaging performed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years, with documented malignancy, and solid tumor&#xD;
           greater than or equal to 1 cm outside of the liver, who are scheduled to enroll in an&#xD;
           NCI therapy protocol using one of the anti-angiogenic agents described in the full&#xD;
           protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platelet count greater than 75,000 x 10(6)/L, hemoglobin greater than 9g/dL, prothrombin&#xD;
           time (PT) and aPTT less than 2 times normal limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject has not received any targeted anti-angiogenic agents within 60 days prior to&#xD;
           pre-treatment (baseline) [18F]fluciclatide administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is intended to obtain preliminary data on the uptake and retention of&#xD;
      [18F]fluciclatide before and after anti-angiogenic therapy. This will enable optimization of&#xD;
      the imaging protocol, identification of the most relevant imaging parameters, and allow for&#xD;
      calculation of the number patients required to power a larger study to assess the utility of&#xD;
      PET imaging with [18F]fluciclatide as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in the context of targeted&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic therapies. We expect to enroll 30 evaluable patients in this single center&#xD;
      study. Subjects will undergo at least two [18F]fluciclatide PET/CT imaging studies, one&#xD;
      pre-therapy and one following completion of 1 cycle of chemotherapy. An optional early&#xD;
      post-therapy (2-7 days post therapy commencement) [18F]fluciclatide PET/CT may be performed.&#xD;
      The magnitude of [18F]fluciclatide uptake on the pre- and post- treatment PET/CT studies will&#xD;
      be evaluated to determine if there is a measureable difference in uptake. Data from the&#xD;
      subject's referring therapy protocol will be reviewed for up to one year. An optional DCE-MRI&#xD;
      scans of the target lesion may also be performed.&#xD;
