    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of mebendazole 500-mg&#xD;
      chewable tablet formulation in a pediatric population. Mebendazole is a drug used for the&#xD;
      treatment of soil-transmitted parasitic helminth (STH) (ie, parasitic worm) infections such&#xD;
      as pinworm, whipworm, common roundworm, common hookworm, and American hookworm.&#xD;

      This is an open-label (identity of study drug will be known to study participant and&#xD;
      investigator), single-center, single-dose, single-arm (ie, 1 treatment group) safety study.&#xD;
      This study will consist of a screening visit on Day 1 at which time all study-related&#xD;
      screening procedures will be performed. After all results are reviewed, children who meet all&#xD;
      of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the&#xD;
      open-label phase of the study. A single mebendazole 500-mg chewable tablet will be&#xD;
      administered on Day 1 and the children will remain at the study site so that adverse events&#xD;
      can be recorded at approximately 30 minutes postdose. Study participants will return to the&#xD;
      study site 3 days (plus or minus 1 day) postdose at which time adverse events will be&#xD;
      recorded again. Safety will be monitored during the study by assessing adverse events by&#xD;
      direct observation at 30 minutes after dosing and at 3 days (plus or minus 1 day) after&#xD;
      dosing, by direct observation of the study participant, report by the parent or guardian, or&#xD;
      both. On Day 1, a single mebendazole 500-mg chewable tablet will be chewed and swallowed by&#xD;
      each study participant. If desired, study participants will be allowed to drink water when&#xD;
      administered study drug.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be an otherwise healthy child based on medical history, physical examination, vital&#xD;
             signs, and concomitant medications and live in a high-prevalence area where parasite&#xD;
             infection is endemic (ie, Prevalent in or peculiar to a particular locality, region,&#xD;
             or people)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have teeth and be able to chew the mebendazole chewable tablet&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Girls must be premenarchal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent(s)/guardians of study participants (or their legally-accepted representatives)&#xD;
             must have signed an informed consent document indicating that they understand the&#xD;
             purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to have their child&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history of clinically significant liver or renal insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic&#xD;
             (eg, anemia), rheumatologic, psychiatric, or metabolic disturbances that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, renders the candidate not suitable for mebendazole&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a suspected massive intestinal parasitic infection, based on history and physical&#xD;
             findings, as determined by the principal investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the&#xD;
             well-being of the study participant or the study or prevent the study participant from&#xD;
