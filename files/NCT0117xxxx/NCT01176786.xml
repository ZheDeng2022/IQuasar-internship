  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the rate of infections developed by subjects comparing the use of&#xD;
      disposable draping systems versus reusable draping systems in the operating room.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects enrolled in the study will be randomized into two groups. One group will have the&#xD;
      reusable draping system during surgery which the investigators currently use and the second&#xD;
      group will have the disposable draping system. Subjects will be blinded to the type of&#xD;
      draping system used. Subjects are under anesthesia at the time the surgical drapes are&#xD;
      placed. After the subject has signed the informed consent, they will be assigned a study&#xD;
      number for that surgery. The study number will correlate to an envelope which will contain&#xD;
      information on the type of draping system to be used. Subjects enrolled, may be randomized&#xD;
      more than once. Subjects will typically have a minimum of two surgeries, the placement of the&#xD;
      tissue expanders and then the removal of the expanders and placement of the breast implants.&#xD;
      Subjects will not be required to sign another consent form but will be randomized prior to&#xD;
      each surgery. Surgeons who have subjects in the disposable draping system will use a&#xD;
      disposable draping kit that includes gowns for the surgeons and also towels. For subjects who&#xD;
      are having a mastectomy and then the placement of tissue expanders, after the mastectomy has&#xD;
      been performed, the plastic surgeons will use all new draping, towels and gowns to perform&#xD;
      tissue expander placement. A swab will be taken on the wound site to determine if there are&#xD;
      any CFUs (colony forming units) present. The swab will then be placed in a tube containing&#xD;
      1ml of TSB (triptic soy broth). The tube will then be sonicated , and then vortexed for 15&#xD;
      seconds. A 0.1ml aliquot of the solution will be placed in a blood agar plate and incubated&#xD;
      for 48 hours to determine the CFU count. The remainder of the solution will be frozen. In the&#xD;
      event an infection occurs, molecular matching will be done on the culture to determine if it&#xD;
      is from the same exact culture. Rodac plates will be used to test for the presence of&#xD;
      bacterial cultures on the surgeon's gown (Forearm [volar surface]) and glove (palm of&#xD;
      surgeon's dominate hand) and also the subject's surgical drape (Area over sternum). These&#xD;
      will be incubated for 48 hours to determine the CFU count. This process will be repeated at&#xD;
      the second surgery.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females ages 18 years of age and older who are having a mastectomy with tissue expander&#xD;
        placement and for breast implants for reconstruction, which would include immediate or&#xD;
        delayed reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male subjects are excluded from this study, while some males do have breast cancer, this is&#xD;
        a rare occurrence and they do not undergo reconstruction surgery with expanders and breast&#xD;
        implants. Females under the age of 18 are excluded as well as females who undergo a&#xD;
        mastectomy but do not have any reconstruction surgery. Females who otherwise meet the&#xD;
        criteria but have an active infection, currently on antibiotics to treat an infection,&#xD;
        urinary tract infections, soft tissue infections or pneumonia are also excluded until they&#xD;
        are approved for surgery by the physician.&#xD;
