      This is a boron neutron capture (BNCT) therapy for patients with previously irradiated and&#xD;
      locally recurrent head and neck cancer. The primary end points are treatment toxicities and&#xD;
      response rate. The secondary endpoints are time to tumor progression, progression-free&#xD;
      survival, overall survival and change quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Head and neck carcinomas that recur locally after conventional irradiation pose a therapeutic&#xD;
      challenge. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is based on the nuclear capture reaction that&#xD;
      occurs when non-radioactive boron is irradiated with neutrons of thermal energy to yield high&#xD;
      energy alpha particles and recoiling lithium nuclei. The effect of alpha and 7Li is primarily&#xD;
      limited to boron- containing cells. Preferential uptake of boron into cancerous tissue is&#xD;
      achieved using boron carriers such as a derivative of phenylalanine, boronophenylalanine&#xD;
      (BPA). After administration of BPA by an intra-arterial or intravenous infusion, the tumor&#xD;
      site is irradiated with neutrons, the source of which is currently a nuclear reactor. A few&#xD;
      uncontrolled clinical trials have evaluated BNCT in the treatment of glioblastoma after brain&#xD;
      surgery. In these studies, the median survival times have been 13-15 months after BNCT.&#xD;
      However, efficacy and tolerability of BNCT in the treatment of limited number of head and&#xD;
      neck cancer patients showed promising results. Though many basic researches about BNCT has&#xD;
      been done using Tsing Hua Open-pool Reactor (THOR) at National Tsing Hua University, no&#xD;
      clinical trial utilizing BNCT is performed in our country. This study will be the first BNCT&#xD;
      trial to treat head and neck cancer in Taiwan.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, single arm, open label phase I/II trial with boron neutron capture&#xD;
      (BNCT) therapy for patients with previously irradiated and locally recurrent head and neck&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligibility criteria are patients with locoregionally recurrent head and neck cancer;&#xD;
      good performance status; inoperable, clinical measurable tumor size; good organ function and&#xD;
      good compliance. No systemic treatment is in use. Once entering this study, patients will&#xD;
      receive angiographies to evaluate bloody supply of the tumor and PET scan with&#xD;
      18F-fluoro-L-BPA as the tracer. Tumor-to- normal tissue ratios were evaluated from static&#xD;
      emission scans. Boron concentration of normal tissues is derived from measurement of BPA&#xD;
      concentration in the blood. Treatment planning with THORplan will be done after Computerized&#xD;
      Tomography (CT) simulation. After treatment plan approved and on the day of treatment,&#xD;
      intravenous or intra-arterial L-BPA- Fructose complex 500 mg/kg was administered at a&#xD;
      constant rate over about 3 hours before and during neutron irradiation. Neutron beam&#xD;
      irradiations were given at the THOR with prescription dose of 20 to 25 Gy (Eq) for the tumor&#xD;
      in one fraction on day 1 and repeated on day 30. Patients will be regularly followed up at&#xD;
      OPD for toxicities (NCI Common Terminology Criteria) and response evaluation (RECIST&#xD;
      criteria)by MRI and PET, time to progression measurement, survival status and change of&#xD;
      quality of life. Maximally 27 patients will be enrolled. After first 10 patients, the&#xD;
      preliminary results will be reviewed before further patients' enrollment.&#xD;
