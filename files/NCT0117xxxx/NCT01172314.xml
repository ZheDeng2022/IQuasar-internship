  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight loss commonly occurs in lung cancer patients, negatively influencing their quality of&#xD;
      life, treatment response and survival. Gains in lean body mass are difficult to achieve in&#xD;
      cancer unless specific metabolic abnormalities are targeted. It is our hypothesis that a&#xD;
      nutritional supplement containing a high amount of essential amino acids will target the&#xD;
      metabolic alterations of cancer patients. Preliminary research performed in our laboratory in&#xD;
      elderly supports this hypothesis. We hypothesize that intake of an essential amino acid&#xD;
      nutritional supplement will positively influence protein synthesis rate in advanced non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Furthermore, insight in the underlying mechanism of the&#xD;
      higher anabolic response of the essential amino acid supplement will be examined. This&#xD;
      information will potentially enable us to formulate a supplement that is more effective than&#xD;
      normal food intake, and that will reduce the need for muscle protein breakdown.&#xD;

      In this study, we will test the following hypothesis: A high-leucine essential amino acid&#xD;
      mixture stimulates whole body protein synthesis (and in this way protein anabolism) to a&#xD;
      larger extent than a regular balanced mixture of total (essential and non-essential) amino&#xD;
      acids in NSCLC patients with and without recent weight loss. The principal endpoint will be&#xD;
      the extent of stimulation of protein synthesis rate as this is the principal mechanism by&#xD;
      which either amino acid or protein intake causes muscle anabolism. This project will provide&#xD;
      important clinical information, based on novel fundamental basic knowledge on the process and&#xD;
      the specific underlying mechanisms of muscle wasting in patients with NSCLC, and the role of&#xD;
      EAA as a potential anabolic substrate. In this way, it will provide preliminary data for the&#xD;
      development of nutritional strategies that will prevent or even stop this process of ongoing&#xD;
      muscle loss in NSCLC.&#xD;
