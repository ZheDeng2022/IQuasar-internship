  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes (GDM) represents a significant and growing source nationwide of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality for both mothers and infants. Between 5 and 10% of pregnancies are&#xD;
      complicated by GDM. Infants exposed in utero to hyperglycemia from GDM have an increased risk&#xD;
      of neonatal complications as well as an increased prevalence of a number of chronic diseases,&#xD;
      including type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia. Recent research shows that treatment with&#xD;
      metformin begun as soon as hyperglycemia is detected in pregnancy is safe and effective.&#xD;
      Additional studies demonstrated that metformin is able to decrease the incidence of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes among individuals at risk for this disease. Based upon these findings, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to test the hypothesis that metformin therapy for women at risk for&#xD;
      gestational diabetes, started prior to conception and before the onset of hyperglycemia, both&#xD;
      decreases the incidence of and improves the maternal and neonatal outcomes from GDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to conduct a prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo&#xD;
      controlled range-finding study to measure the effects of early metabolic intervention with&#xD;
      metformin in women at risk for GDM before the commencement of pregnancy or prior to&#xD;
      completion of the first trimester. The target sample size for this pilot study is 100 women.&#xD;
      The effect size observed will provide preliminary data for a subsequent study which will be&#xD;
      sufficiently powered to detect small or moderate effects from early metabolic intervention in&#xD;
      women at risk for GDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the proposed research consist of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether treating women at risk for GDM with metformin prior to conception&#xD;
           and/or completion of the 1st trimester decreases the incidence of GDM at 26 weeks'&#xD;
           gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the effects on maternal and fetal pregnancy outcomes of pre-conception&#xD;
           metabolic intervention with metformin in women at risk for GDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use these pilot study results to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. identify specific demographic characteristics associated with an intervention&#xD;
                effect&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. calculate effect size for specific outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. provide range-finding data for a subsequent study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin therapy for women at risk for gestational diabetes, started prior to conception and&#xD;
      before the onset of hyperglycemia, both decreases the incidence of and improves the maternal&#xD;
      and neonatal outcomes from GDM.&#xD;
