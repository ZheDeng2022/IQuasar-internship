      This study aims to test the following hypotheses in women recruited in early pregnancy and&#xD;
      whose children will be followed up till at least 14 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epigenetic changes in conceptual tissues obtained at birth reflect the environment that&#xD;
           the fetus was exposed to during development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pattern of epigenetic marks in gene promoters obtained from DNA in birth tissues,&#xD;
           together with genotype, phenotype, and environmental exposures, can be utilized to&#xD;
           assess how the perinatal environment affects subsequent metabolic, neurodevelopmental&#xD;
           and other phenotypes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The dramatic emergence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Asia has coincided with the&#xD;
      rapid socioeconomic and nutritional transition taking place in the region, with the&#xD;
      prevalence of diabetes rising five-fold in Singapore in less than four decades. One unique&#xD;
      aspect of the epidemic has been the significant ethnic differences in predisposition to&#xD;
      diabetes among Asians and in the ethnic variation between BMI and the risk of developing&#xD;
      insulin resistance, a precursor to type 2 diabetes. Apart from genetic factors, dietary,&#xD;
      lifestyle and cultural factors might have influenced the developmental programming through&#xD;
      effects on the mechanisms associated with developmental plasticity. A center piece of this&#xD;
      study is to examine how epigenetic changes at birth both reflects past developmental&#xD;
      influences and, in association with other factors, influences future trajectories of&#xD;
      development and its relationship to NCDs. Also factors active during childhood - especially&#xD;
      the first 1000 days of life - will be focused upon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The longitudinal GUSTO birth cohort study allows us to examine associations among genetic,&#xD;
      environmental and lifestyle interactions in the three distinct ethnic groups, Chinese, Malays&#xD;
      and Indians, present in the Singaporean population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have been followed up for their pregnancy outcome, fetal growth and offspring&#xD;
      development right up to age 11 currently. Participants will continue to be followed up as the&#xD;
      children enter into the pubertal phase from the age of 10 to 14 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected through questionnaires and clinical measurements. The questionnaires&#xD;
      include socio-economic factors, maternal and child's diet, medical histories, behavioural,&#xD;
      cognition, lifestyle factors, health status, and home environment. Bio-physical measurements&#xD;
      will be obtained from anthropometric measurements of participants, human biological materials&#xD;
      such as blood, buccal swabs, saliva, hair, urine, stool, oral specimen such as exfoliated&#xD;
      milk teeth, dental plaque and tongue biofilms are collected from the participants (mother /&#xD;
      father / child where applicable) at their follow-up time points with the GUSTO cohort upon&#xD;
      their consent.&#xD;
