      Hypoglycaemia is the most common acute complication in insulin-treated diabetes. The fear of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia discourages diabetic subjects from the attempt to maintain tight glycemic&#xD;
      control, which in turn leads to increased diabetes related morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroglycopenic hypoglycaemia in insulin-treated diabetic patients is associated with&#xD;
      characteristic changes in EEG with a decrease in alpha activity and an increase in delta and&#xD;
      theta activity. We have recently demonstrated that hypoglycaemia-associated EEG-changes can&#xD;
      be recorded from subcutaneously placed electrodes using an automated mathematical algorithm&#xD;
      based on non-linear spectral analysis. Experimental findings hold promises that an alarm,&#xD;
      given at the time of EEG-changes, can help the patients to avoid severe hypoglycaemia by&#xD;
      ingestion of carbohydrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first larger scale trial testing the clinical applicability of a&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia-alarm based on real-time analysis of EEG-signals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The near-normalization of glycemic control has become an established treatment goal in&#xD;
      diabetes in order to reduce the risk of late complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy,&#xD;
      retinopathy and cardiovascular disease (1). However, the frequency of insulin-induced&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia increases several-fold during intensified insulin therapy (2;3) and&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia is the most common acute complication in insulin-treated diabetes. The fear of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia discourages diabetic subjects from the attempt to maintain tight glycemic&#xD;
      control, which in turn leads to increased diabetes related morbidity and mortality (4;5).&#xD;
      Symptoms of hypoglycaemia can be classified as autonomic (warning) symptoms caused by the&#xD;
      release of catecholamines and neuroglycopenic symptoms caused by the lack of glucose supply&#xD;
      to the brain. Symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be compromised at night-time (nocturnal&#xD;
      asymptomatic hypoglycaemia) due to impaired glucose counterregulatory response by adrenaline&#xD;
      and glucagon. Some 25% of patients with type 1 diabetes suffer from unawareness in various&#xD;
      degrees increasing with long diabetes duration and tight glycemic control (4;6;7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have evaluated the potential use of continuous glucose monitoring system&#xD;
      (CGMS) as hypoglycaemia alarms but so far failed to show reduction in the frequency of severe&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia (8;9). Although the technology is continuously being improved it is still&#xD;
      associated with a number of problems (10). The technique is rather imprecise, particularly in&#xD;
      the lower range of glucose measurements, and only about 33% of hypoglycemic events were&#xD;
      detected in a larger clinical trial (11). The accuracy of the reading is reduced when rapid&#xD;
      changes in blood glucose occur (12). There is a significant and variable delay from the&#xD;
      change in blood glucose to the change in the interstitial compartment ranging from 4 - 10&#xD;
      minutes (13) and the catheters are rather costly and must be replaced every 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EEG signal reflects the functional state and metabolism of the brain. The brain is almost&#xD;
      totally dependent on a continuous supply of glucose, and when the glucose level is lower than&#xD;
      the metabolic requirements of the brain, its function deteriorates. Neuroglycopenic&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia in insulin-treated diabetic patients is associated with characteristic changes&#xD;
      in EEG with a decrease in alpha activity and an increase in delta and theta activity (14-17).&#xD;
      These changes are clearly seen at blood glucose ~2.0mmol/l (14;15) preceding the development&#xD;
      of severe cognitive dysfunction (18). We have recently demonstrated that&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia-associated EEG-changes can be recorded from subcutaneously placed electrodes&#xD;
      using an automated mathematical algorithm based on non-linear spectral analysis and that&#xD;
      EEG-changes above a predefined threshold can be demonstrated more than 10 minutes before&#xD;
      development of severe hypoglycaemia in the majority of the patients (19). We found a very low&#xD;
      rate of false alarms and no adverse reactions related to implantation of the electrodes. We&#xD;
      have subsequently performed a number of studies with real-time alarms type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      patients exposed to insulin induced hypoglycaemia. In these studies the patients were&#xD;
      instructed to ingest carbohydrates when he/she heard the alarm sound. In three out of four&#xD;
      cases the patients were able to do so, while a fourth patient did not spontaneously ingest&#xD;
      the meal although, he was fully conscious and not clinically affect by the hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
      These findings hold promises that an alarm, given at the time of EEG-changes, can help the&#xD;
      patients to avoid severe hypoglycaemia by ingestion of carbohydrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For clinical applicability the device should be able to distinguish hypoglycaemia-induced EEG&#xD;
      changes from noise, artefacts and physiological variations in the EEG including the&#xD;
      low-frequency waves seen during sleep, with high sensitivity and specificity using a&#xD;
      mathematical algorithm that classifies the EEG in real-time. There should be a &quot;time-window&quot;&#xD;
      between hypoglycaemia-induced EEG changes and severe cognitive impairment. The device should&#xD;
      be fully compatible with normal everyday activities. Thus, the device should be small, fully&#xD;
      biocompatible and implantable, and the monitoring and processing unit should be small and&#xD;
      have sufficient battery power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first larger scale trial testing the clinical applicability of a&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia-alarm based on real-time analysis of EEG-signals.&#xD;
