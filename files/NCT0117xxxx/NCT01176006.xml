      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -DOCK8 deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the immune system and can lead to severe&#xD;
      recurrent infections and possible death from infections or certain types of cancers,&#xD;
      including blood cancers. A stem cell transplant is a life-saving treatment for this&#xD;
      condition. In this study we are evaluating the efficacy and safety of transplant from&#xD;
      different donor sources for DOCK8 deficiency. The donors that we are using are matched&#xD;
      siblings, matched unrelated donors, and half-matched donors, so called haploidentical related&#xD;
      donors, such as mothers or fathers or half-matched siblings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine whether transplant of bone marrow cells from different types of donors corrects&#xD;
      DOCK8 deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donors: Healthy individuals between 2 and 60 years of age who are matched with a&#xD;
           recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recipient: Individuals between 5 and 35 years of age who have confirmed DOCK8&#xD;
           deficiency, have suffered at least one life-threatening infections, or have had certain&#xD;
           viral related cancers of cancer and have a stem cell donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be screened with bloodwork, a physical examination and medical&#xD;
           history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DONORS:&#xD;
&#xD;
           --Donors who have donate bone marrow cells or blood stem cells will have a sample of&#xD;
           blood/bone marrow stored to be compared with the recipients sample after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RECIPIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Recipients receiving 10/10 matched related or unrelated donors will receive 4 days&#xD;
                of chemotherapy with busulfan and fludarabine to suppress their immune system and&#xD;
                prepare them for the transplant. Donors receiving 9/10 matched related or unrelated&#xD;
                donors as well as haploidentical related donors will receive 5 days chemotherapy&#xD;
                with cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and busulfan. They will also receive one dose&#xD;
                of radiation to suppress their immune system and prepare them for the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After the initial chemotherapy and radiation (if indicated), recipients will&#xD;
                receive the donated stem cells as a single infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After the stem cell transplant, recipients will receive two days of a chemotherapy&#xD;
                called cyclophosphamide on day's + 3 and + 4 followed by two drugs tacrolimus and&#xD;
                mycophenolate to prevent graft versus host disease where the donor cells attack the&#xD;
                patient's body. All patients will remain in the hospital for at least approximately&#xD;
                1 month, and will be followed with regular visits for up to 3 years with periodic&#xD;
                visits thereafter to evaluate the success of the transplant and any side effects.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mutations in the Dedicator of Cytokinesis-8 (DOCK8) gene are responsible for an&#xD;
      immunodeficiency disease characterized by: severe cutaneous and sinopulmonary infections with&#xD;
      bacterial organisms; extensive cutaneous viral infections with Herpes simplex, Herpes zoster,&#xD;
      Molluscum contagiosum, and Human Papilloma Virus; a marked elevation in serum IgE levels and&#xD;
      eosinophilia; homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the dedicator of cytokinesis 8&#xD;
      (DOCK8) gene. Patients with DOCK8 deficiency die from severe infections, squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinomas, or hematological malignancies. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      (HSCT) represents a potentially life-saving treatment for immunodeficiency diseases such as&#xD;
      DOCK8 deficiency. In this study, we will evaluate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic HSCT&#xD;
      for DOCK8 deficiency. We are particularly interested in determining whether allogeneic HSCT&#xD;
      using different donor sources and conditioning regimens reverses the lethal disease phenotype&#xD;
      in DOCK8 deficiency by reconstituting normal host defense. The development of lethal squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinomas and lymphomas arising from the immunodeficiency in DOCK8 deficiency supports&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention before overt malignancy arises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether allogeneic HSCT reconstitutes T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte cells and&#xD;
      myeloid cells with normal donor cells at one year post-transplant and reverses the clinical&#xD;
      phenotype of severe recurrent infections in subjects with DOCK8 deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects 5-35 years old with DOCK8 deficiency who have suffered one or more life-threatening&#xD;
      infections, or who have developed lymphoma or squamous cell carcinoma, and have a 10/10&#xD;
      matched related donor, a 10/10 matched unrelated donor, a 9/10 matched related donor a 9/10&#xD;
      matched unrelated donor, or a haploidentical related donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with a 10/10 matched related or unrelated donor will receive a pre-transplant&#xD;
      conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine 40 mg/m2/day on days -6, -5, -4, and -3, and&#xD;
      busulfan IV (dose based on pharmacokinetic levels) every day for 4 days on days -6, -5, -4,&#xD;
      and -3. Donor hematopoietic stem cells will be infused on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with a 9/10 matched related, 9/10 matched unrelated, or a haploidentical related&#xD;
      donor will receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide 14.5&#xD;
      mg/kg on days -6 and -5, fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day on days -6, -5, -4, -3 and -2, busulfan IV&#xD;
      (dose based on pharmacokinetic levels) once daily for three days on -4, -3 and -2, and 200&#xD;
      cGy TBI on day -1. Donor hematopoietic stem cells will be infused on day 0. Post-transplant&#xD;
      immunosuppression for graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis for recipients of 9/10&#xD;
      matched related or unrelated donors will consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily&#xD;
      for two days on day s +3 and +4, along with mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and&#xD;
      tacrolimus from day +5 to day 180. If there is no evidence of graft-versus-host disease,&#xD;
      tacrolimus will be stopped at approximately day+180.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive post-transplant immunosuppression for graft-versus-host-disease&#xD;
      (GVHD) prophylaxis for recipients of 10/10 matched related and unrelated donors will consist&#xD;
      of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on days +3 and +4, along with&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus from day +5 to approximately day&#xD;
      180. If there is no evidence of graft-versus-host disease, tacrolimus will be stopped at&#xD;
      approximately day +180.&#xD;

             diaphragm, or cervical cap), or abstinence. Males on the protocol must use an&#xD;
             effective form of contraception at study entry, and for one year post-transplant. The&#xD;
             effects of transplant, the radiation, and the medications used after transplant may be&#xD;
             harmful to a fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of active malignancy in another organ system other than the hematopoietic&#xD;
             system, except when driven by viruses in which case the immune reconstitution after&#xD;

             that HLA compatibility will be a minimum of 5 out of 10 HLA loci matched. The HLA loci&#xD;
             to be tested will be HLA A, B, Cw, DRB1, and DQB1. A minimum number of mismatches are&#xD;
             desirable; however if several options are available the selection of a donor will be&#xD;
             based on the loci where the mismatch occurs and the relative importance of its&#xD;
             potential immunological function. Donor-recipient pairs will initially be typed&#xD;
             molecularly to provide a low resolution typing (antigen-level) to aid in the selection&#xD;
             of the potential donor. Upon review of the familial inheritance pattern, a qualified&#xD;
             HLA staff member will review haplotype inheritance. High resolution (allele-level)&#xD;
             typing will be performed. Final selection of a donor will be in consultation with NCI&#xD;
             physicians and qualified HLA personnel. If more than one haploidentical related donor&#xD;
             is available, we will evaluate each donor individually according to overall health,&#xD;
             ABO matching, CMV, etc. to select the donor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 4-60 years and weight of greater than or equal to 15 kilograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one normal DOCK8 allele demonstrated by a CLIA-certified lab in a sibling&#xD;
             donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No history of life-threatening opportunistic infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate venous access for peripheral apheresis, or consent to use a temporary central&#xD;
             venous catheter for apheresis (if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donors must be HIV negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and hepatitis C&#xD;
             antibody negative. This is to prevent the possible transmission of these infections to&#xD;
             the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Haploidentical donors will undergo marrow harvest with general anesthesia. Subjects&#xD;
             will undergo anesthesia consultation, and meet criteria for eligibility/enrollment.&#xD;
             CD34+ fraction will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will also undergo the Donor Health History Screen to determine donor&#xD;
             eligibility using standard DTM criteria in the Dowling Apheresis Clinic by skilled&#xD;
             staff in the Blood Services Section for adult subjects and age-appropriate questioning&#xD;
             when indicated for pediatric subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult related donors would be preferred over related donors who are minors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will undergo follow-up evaluation within 1 week of donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA-MATCHED RELATED DONOR:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe cutaneous viral infections with herpes simplex, herpes zoster, or&#xD;
             molluscum contagiosum.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic active hepatitis B. Donor may be hepatitis core antibody positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other medical contraindications to stem cell donation (i.e. severe atherosclerosis,&#xD;
             autoimmune disease, iritis or episcleritis, deep venous thrombosis, cerebrovascular&#xD;
             accident).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prior malignancy. However, cancer survivors who have undergone potentially&#xD;
             curative therapy may be considered for stem cell donation on a case-bycase basis. The&#xD;
             risk/benefit of the transplant and the possibility of transmitting viable tumor cells&#xD;
             at the time of transplantation will be discussed with the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donors must not be pregnant. Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication under this&#xD;
             protocol. The effects of cytokine administration on a fetus are unknown. Donors of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception. Effective forms&#xD;
             of contraception include one or more of the following: intrauterine device (IUD),&#xD;
             hormonal (birth control pills, injections, or implants), tubal ligation/hysterectomy,&#xD;
             partner s vasectomy, barrier methods, (condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), or&#xD;
             abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other medical conditions that in the opinion of the PI constitute exclusion as a&#xD;
             donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mutation of DOCK8 on both alleles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Chronic active hepatitis B. Donor may be hepatitis core antibody positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of psychiatric disorder which in the opinion of the PI may compromise&#xD;
             compliance with transplant protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other medical contraindications that in the opinion of the PI constitute exclusion as&#xD;
             a donor. History of prior malignancy. However, cancer survivors who have undergone&#xD;
             potentially curative therapy may be considered for stem cell donation on a case-bycase&#xD;
             basis. The risk/benefit of the transplant and the possibility of transmitting viable&#xD;
             tumor cells at the time of transplantation will be discussed with the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donors must not be pregnant. Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication under this&#xD;
