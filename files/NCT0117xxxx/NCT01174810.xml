  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exenatide is a licensed, safe and effective treatment for patients with Diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      Laboratory work has shown strong, reproducible evidence that this drug has beneficial&#xD;
      &quot;disease modifying&quot; effects when given to animals with a range of experimental models of&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD). This project aims to make an initial evaluation of possible&#xD;
      benefits of Exenatide among patients with moderate symptoms of PD. The drug will be given as&#xD;
      a twice daily 10microgram injection under the skin in a similar way to one of the&#xD;
      conventional &quot;symptomatic&quot; treatments for PD (Apomorphine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty patients with moderate symptoms of PD will be recruited and randomised to receive&#xD;
      Exenatide injections twice daily, or to act as controls in this open label trial. Detailed&#xD;
      assessments will be made of all patients at baseline and periodically for a total of 14&#xD;
      months. The primary outcome measure will be the change between baseline and follow up, in the&#xD;
      severity of a validated PD assessment scale (the UPDRS part 3 motor score) after an overnight&#xD;
      period free of conventional PD medication. Secondary measures will include adverse event&#xD;
      reports, self completed questionnaires, and blood test results. Aside from these assessments,&#xD;
      all patients will continue their regular PD medications throughout the trial with adjustments&#xD;
      made only according to clinical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a subgroup of patients (n=10), brain scans that assess the severity of PD, will be&#xD;
      performed at both baseline and follow up to help understand possible mechanisms of action of&#xD;
      Exenatide.&#xD;
