      The purpose of this study is to assess a bilateral comparison between pimecrolimus cream 1%&#xD;
      (Elidel®) and a medical device cream (EletoneTM) in the treatment and management of atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis. Study subjects will apply pimecrolimus twice daily for four weeks on a target&#xD;
      area located on one side of the body, and apply the medical device cream three times daily&#xD;
      for four weeks on the opposite side of the body at a target lesion symmetric to the other.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common and chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects a large&#xD;
      part of the population. Although atopic dermatitis responds well to twice daily mid-strength&#xD;
      corticosteroids, it is not optimal to expose a patient to the long term use of topical&#xD;
      corticosteroids. Side effects of long term steroid use include skin atrophy, striae,&#xD;
      tachyphylaxis, adrenal suppression, bacterial infections, and contact allergies to name a&#xD;
      few. Elidel® (pimecrolimus) cream 1% and Eletone™ cream are both alternative topical&#xD;
      therapies FDA approved for use in patients with atopic dermatitis. Each has an independent&#xD;
      mechanism of action that has been shown in clinical trials to deliver itch relief, reduce&#xD;
      eczema flares and maintain remission, thus providing an adequate treatment option when&#xD;
      topical steroids are not preferred or contraindicated. Thus far, no study has evaluated the&#xD;
      efficacy of these two products head-to-head. This is an investigator-blinded, bilateral&#xD;
      comparison study in 20 subjects with atopic dermatitis. It is designed to assess and compare&#xD;
      the efficacy Elidel® (pimecrolimus) cream 1% and Eletone™ cream in patients with atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis. Subjects will apply Elidel® (pimecrolimus) cream 1% twice daily for four weeks on&#xD;
      a chosen target eczematous area located on one side of the body and then apply Eletone™ three&#xD;
      times daily on a symmetrical target eczematous area on the opposite side of the body. A&#xD;
      randomized list will be created to determine which side the subject applies each medication.&#xD;
      Patients will be clinically evaluated every two weeks by the investigator on a Physician&#xD;
      Global Assessment (PGA) scale. Part of this clinical study consists of the use of patient and&#xD;
      self-assessment questionnaires and the use of non-identifying digital photography of target&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
