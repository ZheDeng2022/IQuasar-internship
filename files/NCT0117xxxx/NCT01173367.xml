    <textblock>
      The impact of fever and its management in different medical and surgical populations of&#xD;
      critically ill patients has not been explained to date. Clinical trials in critically ill&#xD;
      surgical patients have demonstrated null or potentially harmful effects of treatment of&#xD;
      moderate degrees of fever. However, the pathophysiological effects of fever treatment are not&#xD;
      well defined according to different patient populations, and clinical trial results are&#xD;
      questionably generalized to medical ICU patients. This may relate to different mechanisms of&#xD;
      fever in these populations and merits further investigation. There is also very little known&#xD;
      about the exact timing of expression of the diverse pro and anti-inflammatory mediators&#xD;
      involved in inducing, maintaining and eventually abrogating the fever response. Treating on&#xD;
      the sole basis of an elevated temperature may lead to detrimental effects if the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory cascade naturally regulating this response is active, demonstrating the&#xD;
      importance of understanding the normal pattern of regulation of these diverse mediators. The&#xD;
      current study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment of critically ill patients&#xD;
      with a permissive versus aggressive fever treatment strategy. In addition, the effect of&#xD;
      anti-pyretic therapy on markers of inflammation in neurologically intact critically ill&#xD;
      adults will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be neurologically intact febrile adults (≥18 years) admitted to the&#xD;
      Peter Lougheed Center (PLC) or Foothills Medical Center (FMC) ICU over a 12-month period in&#xD;
      Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Consenting patients that fulfill enrolment criteria will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to either the permissive or aggressive treatment group (see Interventions&#xD;
      section for details). Randomization will be concealed using the consecutively numbered sealed&#xD;
      opaque envelope technique. Samples of blood will be collected from study patients at&#xD;
      enrolment and subsequently at 12, 24 and 48 hours for assessment of inflammatory mediators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Markers of feasibility will include the rate of enrolment, adherence of patients to assigned&#xD;
      treatment regimen/protocol violation, acceptance of the protocol by staff, and facility and&#xD;
      maintenance of random allocation technique. Markers of safety will include potential adverse&#xD;
      events such as 28-day survival, nosocomial infection rate, and evidence of myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia, or hepatocellular inflammation during the febrile episode.&#xD;
