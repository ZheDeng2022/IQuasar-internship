      Exposure and response prevention (AN-EXRP) will help individuals with anorexia nervosa&#xD;
      improve their eating behavior.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious illness associated with substantial morbidity and a&#xD;
      mortality rate among the highest of any psychiatric illness. The rate of relapse is&#xD;
      disturbingly high, with up to 50% of patients requiring re-hospitalization within a year of&#xD;
      discharge. Current treatments are inadequate in helping older adolescents and adults achieve&#xD;
      sustained recovery. Importantly, eating behavior remains disturbed after weight restoration:&#xD;
      patients demonstrate restrictive eating in their self-selected foods and in standardized&#xD;
      meals, and caloric intake in standardized meals is inversely related to pre-meal anxiety.&#xD;
      Emerging data suggest that eating behavior is particularly important in post-hospital course,&#xD;
      and that significantly altering eating behavior is critical in improving outcome for these&#xD;
      individuals. Furthermore, caloric intake in standardized meals has been shown to be related&#xD;
      to pre-meal anxiety. This study evaluates the potential utility of two psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      interventions in improving eating behavior prior to hospital discharge. Each individual&#xD;
      receives, in random order, Cognitive Remediation Therapy for 4 weeks and Exposure and&#xD;
      Response Prevention for AN for 4 weeks. The investigators hypothesize that these&#xD;
      interventions will lead to improvement in eating behavior, measured by food diaries and&#xD;
      standardized meals.&#xD;
