  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness and safety of a self-directed&#xD;
      physical activity program relative to a self-directed dietary program in adults with&#xD;
      arthritis. A process evaluation will also be conducted to examine program reach,&#xD;
      participation/dose, fidelity, and participant compatibility/satisfaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is a critical component of arthritis disease management. It also reduces&#xD;
      the risk for other chronic comorbid conditions in people with arthritis. Yet, most adults&#xD;
      with arthritis are not sufficiently active at the level needed to achieve benefits. Existing&#xD;
      group-based arthritis exercise programs reach only a very small percentage of the population.&#xD;
      The overall purpose of this study is to test a self-directed and low-cost multicomponent&#xD;
      physical activity program for people with arthritis on outcomes including symptoms of&#xD;
      arthritis, lower body strength, functional aerobic capacity, flexibility, physical activity,&#xD;
      arthritis self-efficacy and disability, upper body strength, balance, gait, and depressive&#xD;
      symptoms. The second primary aim is to evaluate the safety of the physical activity program.&#xD;
      The third primary aim is to conduct a process evaluation to examine program reach,&#xD;
      participation/dose, fidelity, and participant compatibility/satisfaction. Adults aged 18&#xD;
      years and older with arthritis will be recruited from the midlands area of South Carolina.&#xD;
      After completion of a baseline visit, participants will be randomized in equal numbers to the&#xD;
      12-week physical activity program (First Step to Active Health®) or the 12-week&#xD;
      attention-control group (Steps to Healthy Eating). The attention control intervention will&#xD;
      have the same &quot;look and feel&quot; as the physical activity intervention and will require similar&#xD;
      activities such as self-monitoring of behavior. Follow-up measurements will take place&#xD;
      post-program (12-weeks) and 6 months post-program (i.e., 9 months post-randomization). If&#xD;
      First Step to Active Health® is shown to be effective, it could be widely disseminated for a&#xD;
      very low cost, thus having the potential to make a tremendous public health impact on the&#xD;
      burden of arthritis.&#xD;
