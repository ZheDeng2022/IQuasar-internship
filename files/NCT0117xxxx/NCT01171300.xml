  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rectal cancer is a frequent but curable malignancy in the Western world. The golden standard&#xD;
      in treating these patients consists of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by&#xD;
      extensive surgery regardless of tumor response. The main question is whether extensive&#xD;
      surgery can be avoided holding in mind that already a significant amount of patients reach a&#xD;
      pathological complete response after radiochemotherapy. The goal of this study is dual. First&#xD;
      of all, the investigators want to investigate the value of DW-MRI and 18FDG-PET in the&#xD;
      assessment of response after neoadjuvant CRT in 100 patients with rectal cancer, to select&#xD;
      those patients eligible for less invasive surgery. In the same patient group, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine the biomarker potential of molecular characteristics of the tumor&#xD;
      in blood and tissue. Using both molecular and radiological findings, the investigators want&#xD;
      to predict pathological response after chemoradiotherapy and to select patients who may&#xD;
      benefit from treatment adjustments during chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
