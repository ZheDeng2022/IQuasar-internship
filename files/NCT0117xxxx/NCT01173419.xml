  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi center, randomized, comparison study using two already cleared methods of&#xD;
      treatment of the great saphenous vein (GSV). The hypothesis to be tested is that the use of&#xD;
      the Venacure EVLT NeverTouch procedure is no worse than the RF ClosureFAST procedure for&#xD;
      treatment of the GSV. Evaluation of post operative pain and bruising, quality of life&#xD;
      assessments, adverse event assessments, confirmation of long term GSV closure, use of&#xD;
      medications are criteria that will be evaluated during the course of this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some form of venous insufficiency affects up to 25% of men and 40% of women in the United&#xD;
      States. While most persons seek treatment because varicose veins are unsightly, most will&#xD;
      also experience symptoms such as aching pain, night cramps, leg fatigue, leg heaviness or leg&#xD;
      restlessness. If left untreated, nearly 50% of patients with significant superficial venous&#xD;
      insufficiency will experience chronic venous insufficiency characterized by lower extremity&#xD;
      swelling, eczema, pigmentation, hemorrhage and ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized study in subjects with symptomatic venous&#xD;
      insufficiency of the great saphenous vein. Subjects evaluated for participation will be those&#xD;
      who, prior to the first visit, have elected to receive invasive treatment for the GSV&#xD;
      insufficiency and have already received conservative treatment (i.e. use of compression&#xD;
      hose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to receive one of two methods of treatment. VenaCure EVLT&#xD;
      NeverTouch method of treatment or the RF ClosureFAST method of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits will take place at 2, 7, 14 and 30 days post treatment where questionnaires&#xD;
      (SF-36, CIVI Q2, Visual Analogue Scale), evaluation of GSV closure via duplex ultrasound (7&#xD;
      day and 30 day only), evaluation of ecchymosis, physician (or their designee) evaluation of&#xD;
      venous disease (CEAP assessment and VCSS assessment), assessments of adverse events and&#xD;
      review of concomitant medications (use of analgesics and other medications)will take place.&#xD;
      These same evaluations with the exception of the use of the Visual Analogue Scale and the&#xD;
      Ecchymosis evaluation will also take place at the 6 month and 12 month follow up visit&#xD;
      timepoints.&#xD;
