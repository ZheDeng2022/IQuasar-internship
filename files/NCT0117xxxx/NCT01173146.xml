  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate Cancer is the most common cancer in men, affecting about as many men as women&#xD;
      diagnosed with breast cancer, and killing about as many men per year as breast cancer kills&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common surgical treatment is prostatectomy, the removal of the prostate. During&#xD;
      prostate surgery, tumor remains at the edge of the surgery, called residual tumor, in 30% of&#xD;
      all prostatectomies. Such patients have a significantly higher risk of local recurrence of&#xD;
      the cancer, and higher rates of death. In contrast, even patients with cancer outside of the&#xD;
      prostate, but still nearby the prostate, do better when the margins are made clean of tumor&#xD;
      during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to reduce the number of patients with residual tumor after surgery.&#xD;
      The investigators will test in patients a fluorescent molecule that allows cancer to be&#xD;
      detected during surgery. If this trial works as designed, the investigators will reduce the&#xD;
      number of patients who have to receive additional treatment, such as high doses of radiation&#xD;
      to the lower abdomen, because the amount of residual tumor left behind has been minimized.&#xD;
      This may also lead to higher rates of survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type of detection of cancer the investigators employ is called Molecular imaging. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that molecular imaging will be the key to improved diagnosis,&#xD;
      individualized treatment selection, and treatment monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, a large human trial will be conducted after this study with a corporate&#xD;
      imaging partner.&#xD;

      In this 5 year academic-industrial partnership to FDA approval, an experienced team and&#xD;
      partners including Cornell, Vanderbilt, Intuitive Surgical, LI-COR, and Sand Hill Institute,&#xD;
      will move a prostate-targeted fluorescent contrast agent, demonstrated in animals in a prior&#xD;
      project to allow real-time detection of residual tumor, through FDA approval to human use.&#xD;
      The unmet need is that because prostate tumor at the surgical margin is undetectable in real&#xD;
      time, residual tumor at the margin occurs in 30% of all prostatectomies. Such patients have a&#xD;
      significantly higher risk of local recurrence, metastasis, and death, and also require&#xD;
      radiation therapy. In contrast, even patients with extra-prostatic extension of tumors do&#xD;
      better when the margins are made clean of tumor during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to leverage our experience and our animal-proven agent to synthesize, receive FDA&#xD;
      IND approval on, and Phase I/II test our targeted fluorescent conjugate in a pilot study in&#xD;
      96 human subjects. Our agent is made from a commercial LI-COR fluorescent dye, and a&#xD;
      humanized antibody from Cornell and Millennium Pharmaceuticals (huJ-591). The targeted&#xD;
      antibody tags Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) which is present on the outside of&#xD;
      all prostate cells of luminal (prostate duct) origin, and was demonstrated in prior funding&#xD;
      to produce 4-12 fold contrast for prostate cells over nearby tissues in animals. The device&#xD;
      will be tested a sites using a fluorescence-sensitive surgery system from Intuitive Surgical,&#xD;
      a $10 billion robotic surgery company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI of this grant has previously developed and commercialized fundamental optical&#xD;
      technologies -- he (1) co-developed the first in vivo luciferase imaging system at Stanford&#xD;
      and co-founded Xenogen, and (2) he developed T-Stat®, the first FDA-approved detection system&#xD;
      for insufficient blood flow to tissue. Other team members have synthesized dye conjugates for&#xD;
      commercial use, and managed antibody-based drug formulation through FDA approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The corporate partners, LiCor (a world-leader in automated sequencing instruments and&#xD;
      reagents using near infrared devices and dyes) and Sand Hill Institute (experienced at&#xD;
      antibody formulation), and Intuitive Surgical, provide proven commercial translational&#xD;
      experience in contrast agents and FDA approval. These groups will formulate and synthesize&#xD;
      the agent, leading to FDA IND filing and human clinical testing. Alternative paths minimize&#xD;
      risks at each stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, the commercial dye will be readied for Phase III multi-center trial with a&#xD;
      major surgical tool partner, a costly and required path to market introduction. Major imaging&#xD;
      companies (Siemens, Phillips, GE, and others) also have molecular imaging programs, into&#xD;
      which this contract agent will fit. A successful imaging agent would likely be adopted.&#xD;
      Extensions to ovarian cancer using the folate type II receptor, and other targets, are&#xD;
      envisioned, including use with other targeting antibodies developed by other groups. We&#xD;
      anticipate that this will be among the first of many real-time surgery-targeting optical&#xD;
      contrast agents in human subjects. Areas with immediate application are the detection of&#xD;
      lymphatic spread intraoperatively for prostate cancer, as well as for ovarian cancer using a&#xD;
      Folate. We expect that the market for such a device in cancer could reasonably be in the&#xD;
      hundreds of millions of dollars/year.&#xD;
