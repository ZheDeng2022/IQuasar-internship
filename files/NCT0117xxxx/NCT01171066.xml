      Assessment of the performance of the Tasman CPAP system in treating obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to (1) evaluate the performance of this system in the efficacy&#xD;
      of the treatment in comparison to S8 Escape, and (2) to evaluate the performance of the&#xD;
      Tasman device via subjective assessment of comfort and ease of breathing compared to the&#xD;
      participant's current CPAP device.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) is a condition characterised by partial or complete collapse&#xD;
      of the upper airway during sleep. The treatment of choice for OSA is Continuous Positive&#xD;
      Airway Pressure (CPAP). CPAP acts as a positive airway splint, delivering a fixed positive&#xD;
      airway pressure to the upper airway via a tube and mask. The mask is attached to the&#xD;
      participant's nose via head straps. The type of mask used is dependent upon participant&#xD;
      choice and comfort and the mask that provides the best fit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants stop using CPAP therapy finding it difficult to tolerate due to leak issues&#xD;
      or discomfort from their nasal mask. Another frequent concern is mask dislodgment while&#xD;
      sleeping causing leaks and consequently waking the patient up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the Tasman CPAP system via&#xD;
      objective and subjective assessment of comfort and ease of breathing compared to the&#xD;
      participant's current CPAP device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if the efficacy of the treatment is clinically equivalent to or better than&#xD;
           the predicate device (S8 Escape)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the performance of the Tasman CPAP system in terms of comfort of breathing&#xD;
           and general ease of use&#xD;
