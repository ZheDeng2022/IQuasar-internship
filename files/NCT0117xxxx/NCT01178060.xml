      The goal of this research is to improve communication to Veterans. The investigators want to&#xD;
      improve how doctors and nurses talk to patients about the risk of heart attack and stroke.&#xD;
      The investigators will give everyone in the study information about the risk for heart attack&#xD;
      or stroke. The investigators will also provide information on how to reduce this risk. This&#xD;
      information will be given in one of two ways. The investigators want to see which way of&#xD;
      giving information works better for veterans. The investigators also want to assess the&#xD;
      impact of personalized stroke risk communication to patients at risk for stroke on patient&#xD;
      knowledge, beliefs, and preferences for risk reduction behaviors and evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      personalized risk communication on medication adherence and blood pressure. The investigators&#xD;
      plan to enroll approximately 100 veterans for this study. All veterans will be from the&#xD;
      Durham VA Primary Care Clinics. The investigators will ask everyone to be in the study for 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2005, over 17,000 patients were treated for stroke within the VA with a cost of almost&#xD;
      $315 million. Prevention of stroke through reduction of established risk factors is an&#xD;
      essential part of the VA Stroke QUERI strategic plan for the VA. In spite of this, in the&#xD;
      Veterans Affairs, only 13% of patients with known CVD achieve target BP and cholesterol&#xD;
      control. Combining risk factors into a composite measure of risk offers a better global&#xD;
      assessment of individual risk and is recommended by the American Heart Association and&#xD;
      American Stroke Association for prioritizing interventions. This practice is rarely done in&#xD;
      routine clinical practice and its use as a tool to motivate patient behavior has not been&#xD;
      tested. Current evidence from VA patients suggests that patients with hypertension do not&#xD;
      adequately translate their risk factors into an accurate estimation of stroke risk. Improving&#xD;
      the accuracy of stroke risk perceptions may be particularly important in motivating risk&#xD;
      reduction in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to: 1.) Assess the impact of personalized stroke risk&#xD;
      communication to patients at risk for stroke on patient knowledge, beliefs, and preferences&#xD;
      for risk reduction behaviors. 2.) Evaluate the impact of personalized risk communication on&#xD;
      medication adherence and blood pressure. 3.) Explore the feasibility and obtain sample size&#xD;
      estimates for a larger, investigator initiative research (IIR) application testing this tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-group randomized controlled trial testing a personalized risk communication&#xD;
      intervention compared to an education-only control group was conducted. Eighty-nine patients&#xD;
      were randomized and followed for 3months. Both groups received written and verbal patient&#xD;
      education on stroke risk factors and prevention. Patients in the intervention arm also&#xD;
      received personalized risk communication based on the Framingham stroke and coronary heart&#xD;
      disease risk scores. A verbal and graphic presentation of their personal risk, risk relative&#xD;
      to an age matched cohort, and their optimal or target risk based on optimal risk factor&#xD;
      modification was presented. Outcomes measured immediately following the intervention and at&#xD;
      3months included: risk perception and worry; risk factor knowledge; decision preference and&#xD;
      conflict; medication adherence; health behaviors; and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study finished enrollment and all follow-up visits have been completed. The data from&#xD;
      this project is being analyzed.&#xD;
