      The purpose of this phase 1b study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated&#xD;
      epicutaneous applications of peanut proteins using a patch delivery system (Viaskin device)&#xD;
      in peanut allergic subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy is a common allergy in the United States, with a prevalence in the general&#xD;
      population as high as 1%. So far, there is no approved treatment of peanut allergy. Peanut&#xD;
      allergy management is based on strict peanut avoidance and injectable epinephrine after the&#xD;
      allergic systemic reactions have started. Specific Immunotherapy methods currently available&#xD;
      have shown some limitations in their use because of safety issues. Hence, there is an&#xD;
      important unmet medical need for efficient and safe treatment of peanut allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DBV Technologies has developed an epicutaneous delivery system, called Viaskin, a method&#xD;
      based on delivering precise quantity of the allergen on the upper layers of the skin.&#xD;
      Avoiding contact between the allergen and the bloodstream should confer to epicutaneous&#xD;
      immunotherapy (EPIT) a higher level of safety as systemic reactions should be circumvented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this phase 1b study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the epicutaneous&#xD;
      immunotherapy method in subjects allergic to peanut. The trial will randomize 110&#xD;
      participants. Four doses of peanut proteins, 20 mcg, 100 mcg, 250 mcg and 500 mcg will be&#xD;
      repeatedly delivered on the skin by dose escalation in consecutive cohorts of 5 subjects,&#xD;
      starting with the lowest dose. In each cohort of 5, 4 subjects will receive peanut proteins&#xD;
      and one will receive placebo in a blinded manner. For each dose, the peanut proteins will be&#xD;
      applied on the skin either every day or every other day. The total duration of the treatment&#xD;
      for each subject is 2 weeks. Firstly, adult subjects (18 to 50 years) with a history of&#xD;
      non-severe anaphylaxis to peanut (Grade ≤3) will enroll and safety information be reviewed.&#xD;
      If there are no major concerns, adolescent cohorts (12 to 17 years) with history of&#xD;
      non-severe anaphylaxis to peanut will then enroll and safety again be reviewed. If there are&#xD;
      no concerns, then child cohorts (6 to 11 years) with history of non-severe anaphylaxis to&#xD;
      peanut will finally enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, after the safety review of the treated adult non-severe cohorts is satisfactorily&#xD;
      performed, adult subjects with a history of severe anaphylaxis to peanut (Grades 4 or 5) will&#xD;
      enroll and dose escalation will undergo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the safety review, all the following parameters will be checked at each patient visit:&#xD;
      physical examination, vital signs, skin examination, lab values, PEF values. FEV1, skin prick&#xD;
      test to peanut and peanut-specific IgE values will also be determined at screening and end of&#xD;
      treatment visits.&#xD;
