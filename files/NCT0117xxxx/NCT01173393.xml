      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-hospital cardiac arrest is common and associated with a poor prognosis and only about 8%&#xD;
      of patients have a good outcome. For patients who are initially successfully resuscitated by&#xD;
      ambulance paramedics and transported to hospital, there is considerable mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity. This is largely due to the anoxic brain injury sustained during the cardiac&#xD;
      arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One current therapy for the severe anoxic brain injury following out-of-hospital cardiac&#xD;
      arrest is therapeutic hypothermia (TH) induced after resuscitation. This treatment was shown&#xD;
      to improve outcomes in two clinical trials. The International Liaison Committee on&#xD;
      Resuscitation now recommend TH (33°C for 12-24 hours) for patients who remain comatose after&#xD;
      resuscitation from cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the optimal timing of TH is still uncertain. The above clinical studies used surface&#xD;
      cooling and this delayed TH until after arrival at the hospital. On the other hand,&#xD;
      laboratory data has suggested that there is significantly decreased neurological injury if&#xD;
      cooling is initiated during CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current ideal technique for induction of TH during CPR is a rapid intravenous infusion of&#xD;
      a large volume of ice-cold fluid. This technique has become established as the cooling method&#xD;
      of choice in the pre-hospital setting, the Emergency Department (14) and the Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, we conducted a randomised, controlled trial of paramedic cooling after CPR&#xD;
      compared with cooling in the emergency department (ED) (NHMRC study number 236879). This&#xD;
      study enrolled 396 patients between 2005 and late 2007. There were 234 patients with an&#xD;
      initial cardiac rhythm of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and 163 patients with an initial&#xD;
      cardiac rhythm of non-VF (asystole or pulseless electrical activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the post-VF arrest patients, there was a good outcome (discharge to home or to&#xD;
      rehabilitation) in both groups of 50%. In the post-non-VF arrest patients, there was a good&#xD;
      outcome at hospital discharge of 12% in the paramedic cooled group compared with 9% in the&#xD;
      standard care group. The study was stopped at the interim analysis due to a lack of&#xD;
      difference in the primary outcome measure (outcome at hospital discharge) between the two&#xD;
      groups (futility).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further analysis of this data revealed that paramedics infused up to 1000mL ambient&#xD;
      temperature fluid during CPR prior to enrolment as part of standard paramedic treatment. In&#xD;
      addition, the rapid infusion of cold fluid was commenced en-route to hospital. Thus, cooling&#xD;
      commenced approximately 30 minutes after paramedic arrival and only just prior to hospital&#xD;
      cooling. Although there was a decrease in the core temperatures of the patients allocated to&#xD;
      pre-hospital cooling on arrival at the ED, this was a transient effect lasting only&#xD;
      approximately 20 minutes. Subsequently, the cooling curves of the patients in both groups&#xD;
      were identical. Thus, it was considered unlikely that this transient difference in core&#xD;
      temperature could have a measurable effect on outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory data suggests that a rapid intravenous infusion of cold fluid during CPR&#xD;
      effectively decreases core temperature. Nordmark et al. studied the induction of hypothermia&#xD;
      with a large volume of intravenous ice-cold fluid after cardiac arrest during CPR in&#xD;
      anaesthetised piglets who were subjected to eight minutes of VF. The mean temperature&#xD;
      reduction was 1.6°C in the hypothermic group and 1.1°C in the control group (p=0.009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also laboratory data that cooling during CPR may increase the rate of successful&#xD;
      defibrillation. Boddicker et al. examined the success rates of defibrillation in swine cooled&#xD;
      to different temperatures. After 8 minutes of VF (with no CPR), the animals were&#xD;
      defibrillated with successive shocks as needed and underwent CPR until resumption of&#xD;
      spontaneous circulation or no response. First-shock defibrillation success was highest in the&#xD;
      hypothermia (33°C) group (6/8 hypothermia versus 1/8 normothermia; P=0.04). None of the 8&#xD;
      animals in the normothermia group achieved resumption of spontaneous circulation compared&#xD;
      with 7/8 moderate hypothermia (P=0.001). Coronary perfusion pressure during CPR was not&#xD;
      different between the groups, thus this beneficial effect of hypothermia was not due to&#xD;
      alteration of coronary perfusion pressure but likely due to changes in the&#xD;
      electrophysiological properties of the myocardium. Thus, it appears that mild hypothermia may&#xD;
      have a beneficial anti-arrhythmic effect, as well as a neuroprotective effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, pilot clinical trials have been undertaken in Europe that suggest that cooling&#xD;
      during CPR by paramedics is feasible. For example, Bruel et al studied the feasibility and&#xD;
      safety of a rapid infusion of 2000mL of normal saline at 4°C during CPR. A total of 33&#xD;
      patients were included in the study of whom eight patients presented with VF as the initial&#xD;
      cardiac rhythm. After intravenous cooling, the temperature in the patients decreased by a&#xD;
      mean of 2.1°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a similar pilot study, Kämäräinen et al. cooled seventeen adult patients with&#xD;
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during CPR. A return of circulation was achieved in 13&#xD;
      patients (76%). The temperature of the patients on hospital admission was a mean of 33.8°C&#xD;
      and the mean infused volume of cold fluid was 1571mL. The authors concluded that induction of&#xD;
      therapeutic hypothermia during prehospital CPR was feasible and apparently well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recent data specifically examining respiratory function in 52 patients treated with&#xD;
      large volume, ice cold saline has indicated that there is no adverse effect on respiratory&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given this supportive laboratory and preliminary clinical data, and our previous experience&#xD;
      in running a large pre-hospital trial in cardiac arrest patients, we propose to conduct a&#xD;
      definitive randomized, controlled trial of paramedic cooling during CPR compared with&#xD;
      standard care including cooling after arrival at the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treatment arm, paramedics will undertake immediate cooling during cardiac arrest,&#xD;
      using a large volume (20mL/kg, followed by 10mL/kg) intravenous bolus of ice-cold saline.&#xD;
      This strategy will overcome the delay in treatment that was found in our previous study.&#xD;
      Thus, cooling will commence significantly earlier, possibly resulting in significantly&#xD;
      improved rates of resuscitation and better neurological outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control arm, patients will be resuscitated using current protocols and be cooled after&#xD;
      arrival at the hospital (the current standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will run as two parallel clinical trials because of the marked difference in&#xD;
      outcomes between patients with VF as the initial cardiac rhythm and patients with non-VF as&#xD;
      the initial cardiac rhythm.&#xD;
