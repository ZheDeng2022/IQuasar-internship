      Observational evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency may have a role in the causes of&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA) and there are biologically plausible mechanisms to explain this. There&#xD;
      is, however, no evidence which shows that intervening with vitamin D supplementation can slow&#xD;
      the progression of OA. This study is to determine if vitamin D supplementation can reduce&#xD;
      knee pain and slow knee cartilage loss in OA patients comparing with a placebo. Use of MRI&#xD;
      will provide sensitive measures of knee OA changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder in the world. In 2004, OA was estimated&#xD;
      to affect over 1.6 million Australians, with total costs of $1.4 billion. OA is the most&#xD;
      frequent reason for joint replacement, at a cost of about $1 billion each year. Conventional&#xD;
      treatment is palliative and costly, and currently there are no effective medical remedies for&#xD;
      OA. These facts have led to 2000-2010 being labelled the Bone and Joint decade, and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disorders being recognised as a National Health Priority. The primary task&#xD;
      for OA management should be to identify modifiable risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D deficiency is very common in older people and has been linked with osteoporosis and&#xD;
      falls in both older women and men. Emerging data suggests that it also plays an important&#xD;
      role in the pathogenesis of knee OA. Firstly, vitamin D may have direct effects on&#xD;
      chondrocytes in osteoarthritic cartilage; secondly, chronic vitamin D inadequacy in adults&#xD;
      has adverse effects on calcium metabolism, osteoblast activity, matrix ossification and bone&#xD;
      density, and thus could impair the ability of bone to respond optimally to pathophysiological&#xD;
      processes in OA; and thirdly, low vitamin D levels are associated with loss of muscle&#xD;
      strength and muscle mass in older men and women, which may be associated with an increased&#xD;
      risk of knee OA. Some observational studies have shown that vitamin D insufficiency is&#xD;
      associated with the progression and development of radiographic knee or hip OA. Recently we&#xD;
      have demonstrated that baseline serum levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D(25-(OH)D) predicts&#xD;
      change in cartilage volume in older adults over 2 years, and increases in vitamin D levels&#xD;
      are associated with a further protective association. This suggests that vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation may enhance cartilage and bone health, and thus prevent disease progression&#xD;
      in patients with knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of vitamin D supplementation versus placebo&#xD;
      on knee pain and knee structural changes in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      over a 2- year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study design is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial.&#xD;
      We will recruit 400 subjects (50-79 years old, having relatively good health and serum&#xD;
      vitamin D level of &lt;60 and &gt;12.5 nmol/L) with symptomatic knee OA for at least 6 months using&#xD;
      a combined strategy in Southern Tasmania and Melbourne. Participants in the intervention arm&#xD;
      (n=200) will receive 50,000 IU (1.25 mg) cholecalciferol tablets given once monthly, whilst&#xD;
      those in the control arm (n=200) will receive an identical inert placebo. All participants&#xD;
      will be provided recommended standard of care. Knee structural changes including knee&#xD;
      cartilage volume, cartilage defects, tibial bone area, bone marrow lesions, and meniscal&#xD;
      pathology (assessed by MRI), and knee pain at baseline and 2 years later will be determined&#xD;
      as outcome measures. Other explanatory factors, such as serum vitamin D levels, height,&#xD;
      weight, physical activity, and smoking will also be determined through study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency may have a role in the progression&#xD;
      of OA and there are biologically plausible mechanisms to explain this. However, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials using a sensitive method are required to determine whether intervening with&#xD;
      vitamin D supplementation can in fact slow the progression of this disease. In this study,&#xD;
      the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design, and the use of MRI to provide&#xD;
      sensitive and precise measures of knee structural change will ensure a rigorous evaluation of&#xD;
      the impact of vitamin D supplementation on knee OA. It will be the first long term clinical&#xD;
      trial to determine comprehensively the effects on knee structural changes (cartilage, bone)&#xD;
      utilizing the pioneering MRI techniques and limb muscle strength assessment. This study&#xD;
      builds upon previous clinical and epidemiological studies that supports the objectives of the&#xD;
      Bone and Joint Decade organization and addresses a National Health Priority Area.&#xD;
