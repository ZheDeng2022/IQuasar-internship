    <textblock>
      Healthy women and women with breast cancer have been enrolled in our nested case-control&#xD;
      study between 2008 and 2009 in order to evaluate the association between metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      and breast cancer, analyzing anthropometric parameters blood pressure, assessing serum HDL-C,&#xD;
      triglyceride, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, testosterone and uric acid levels and&#xD;
      administering a questionnaire about physical activity, food intake, tobacco use, alcohol&#xD;
      abuse, personal and familial history of disease. Our data support the hypothesis that&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome may be an indicator of breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. The&#xD;
      change of the hormonal arrangement in postmenopausal, along with an increase in visceral&#xD;
      adiposity, probably favour the hormone dependent cell proliferation, which drives&#xD;
      tumorigenesis. Adjustments in lifestyle with physical activity intensification and healthy&#xD;
      diet may represent modifiable factors on which sporadic breast cancer primary prevention may&#xD;
      work on.&#xD;

      A total of 777 patients have been enrolled in our nested case-control study. 293 of them&#xD;
      operated for breast cancer (cases) and 484 healthy women (controls) have been recruited&#xD;
      between 2008 and 2009 to take part to our study for evaluating the association between MS and&#xD;
      breast cancer. Liver or renal disease, thyroid pathology and coronary artery disease were&#xD;
      considered exclusion criteria. After obtaining informed consent, signing the authorization to&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study, for each woman anthropometric features were measured, including&#xD;
      weight in kilograms, height in meters, waist and hip circumference, arterial blood pressure&#xD;
      was taken and venous blood was collected [15]. BMI (kg/m²) was calculated from weight and&#xD;
      height values according to World Health Organization classification (&lt; 25 kg/m²=&#xD;
      underweight/normal, ≥ 25 kg/m²= overweight/obese), waist and hip ratio (WHR) was obtained&#xD;
      from waist and hip circumference, measuring the smallest circumference of both to&#xD;
      discriminate between android and gynoid fat distribution [22]. From blood samples fasting&#xD;
      plasma glucose, HDL-C, triglyceride, uric acid, insulin and testosterone levels were&#xD;
      assessed. Fasting plasma glucose, HDL-C and triglyceride were measured according to NCEP ATP&#xD;
      III criteria. The normal range for uricemia was 2.6-6.0 mg/dl. Insulin levels were defined in&#xD;
      normal range when between 5 and 25 mcU/ml, whereas ≥ 25 mcU/ml were considered&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia. Testosterone levels were considered in the normal range when 0.20-1.20&#xD;
      ng/ml. Levels &gt; 1.20 ng/ml were considered indicative of hyperandrogenic status. Women were&#xD;
      asked to answer a questionnaire about chronic diseases, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, food&#xD;
      intake, physical activity grade, parity, age of menarche, menopausal status, oral&#xD;
      contraceptive use, hormonal therapy use, personal and familial history of cancer. According&#xD;
      to the NCEP ATP III [10], women presenting three disorders were diagnosed with low grade MS&#xD;
      [5], whereas women presenting more than three disorders (four or five) were diagnosed with&#xD;
      high grade MS. Chi-squared test and logistic regression analyses (OR and 95% CI) were used to&#xD;
      confirm the association between MS and breast cancer and to calculate the risk. Statistical&#xD;
      significance was considered at P &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
