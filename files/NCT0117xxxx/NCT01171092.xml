  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of G-CSF and bortezomib is safe&#xD;
      and effective in blood cell mobilization.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study plans to use VELCADE for two doses followed by G-CSF given for 4 doses as is&#xD;
      standard for mobilization with G-CSF alone. The rationale for VELCADE prior to the G-CSF is&#xD;
      because VELCADE causes thrombocytopenia, similar to how cyclophosphamide is given followed by&#xD;
      G-CSF for stem cell mobilization. Usually a cycle of VELCADE for myeloma therapy consists of&#xD;
      4 doses, but this may result in more significant drop in the platelet count. Low platelet&#xD;
      counts may preclude adequate stem cell collection. The mobilization with VELCADE and GCSF&#xD;
      will be approximately 3 -4 weeks after completion of the initial therapy for the primary&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting eligibility criteria and who give informed consent will be mobilized using&#xD;
      bortezomib at 1.3mg/m2 on day -11 and day -8. Subsequently G-CSF will be administered&#xD;
      subcutaneously from day -4 to day -1 as a once daily injection at the standard /established&#xD;
      dose of 10mcg/kg. Stem cell collection will be done on day 0 per standard of care regimen and&#xD;
      protocol with processing of 4 -5 blood volumes. Stem cell enumeration by flow cytometry will&#xD;
      be done prior to the collection by flow cytometry. The number of CD 34 positive cells (stem&#xD;
      cell phenotype) / kg obtained each day of collection will be noted. G-CSF will be continued&#xD;
      daily until adequate numbers of stem cells are obtained for the performance of a single&#xD;
      autologous transplant (&gt; 2.5 million CD 34 cells/kg of weight. Subsequently the data for&#xD;
      engraftment of neutrophils and platelets will be monitored as is routine for all patients&#xD;
      undergoing autologous transplant.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure&#xD;
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn&#xD;
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subject is either post-menopausal for at least 1 year before the screening&#xD;
             visit, or surgically sterilized or if they are of childbearing potential, agree to&#xD;
             practice 2 effective methods of contraception from the time of signing the informed&#xD;
             consent form through 30 days after the last dose of VELCADE, or agree to completely&#xD;
             abstain from heterosexual intercourse.&#xD;
