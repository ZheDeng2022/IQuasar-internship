  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, influenza viruses that have traditionally infected animals have infected&#xD;
      humans as well. The H2N3 influenza virus, which first appeared in pigs in the Midwest United&#xD;
      States in 2006, may pose a potential health concern to humans. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety of and immune response to a vaccine designed to protect people from the H2N3 influenza&#xD;
      virus.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Animal influenza viruses, such as the H1N1 and H5N1 viruses, typically infect animals like&#xD;
      birds or pigs, but these viruses can also infect humans. The recent outbreak of the H1N1&#xD;
      influenza virus demonstrates that it is possible for these viruses to cause a pandemic&#xD;
      outbreak in humans. Researchers are specifically interested in evaluating vaccines for H2&#xD;
      viruses, as these viruses caused a pandemic outbreak in humans in the late 1950s to 1960s. In&#xD;
      addition, over half of the world's current population has no previous exposure to related&#xD;
      viruses, which means a pandemic outbreak could pose a serious health risk as many people&#xD;
      would have no immunity against the virus. In 2006, an outbreak of H2N3 infection occurred in&#xD;
      pigs in the Midwest United States. While no humans contracted the virus during that outbreak,&#xD;
      it remains a concern for researchers in the event that the virus ever spreads to humans. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of an&#xD;
      experimental H2N3 vaccine, H2N3 MO 2006/AA ca in healthy adults. This is a live attenuated&#xD;
      vaccine, which means that participants will be exposed to small amounts of the H2N3 vaccine&#xD;
      virus and will need to remain isolated for at least 12 days when receiving the vaccine to&#xD;
      prevent spreading the virus to others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy adults. Participants will receive two doses of the vaccine, 4&#xD;
      weeks apart, and will stay in an isolation facility during both 12-day vaccination periods.&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the isolation facility 2 days before they receive their&#xD;
      first vaccination. They will receive one nasal spray administration of the vaccine and will&#xD;
      be monitored for side effects. On various days while in the isolation facility, they will&#xD;
      undergo a physical exam, blood and urine collection, and a nasal wash procedure. Participants&#xD;
      will remain in the isolation facility for at least 9 days after receiving the vaccine and&#xD;
      possibly longer, until the nasal wash tests negative for the vaccine virus for 2 consecutive&#xD;
      days. Participants will be readmitted to the isolation facility 26 days after the first&#xD;
      vaccination. They will receive a second vaccination and all study procedures will be&#xD;
      repeated. Participants will attend study visits 56, 82, and 208 days after the first&#xD;
      vaccination for follow-up health and safety monitoring, blood collection, and a nasal wash&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
