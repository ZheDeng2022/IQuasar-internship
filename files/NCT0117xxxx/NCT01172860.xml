  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new approach to treating solid tumours (both operable and inoperable) has been carried out&#xD;
      by the Cork Cancer Research Centre (CCRC) at the Mercy University Hospital, Cork, Ireland&#xD;
      since 2002.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approach simply allows a greater concentration of chemotherapy drugs to enter the tumour&#xD;
      cells rather than healthy cells. The uptake of the chemotherapeutic drug directly by the&#xD;
      tumour is aided through applying short electric pulses to the tumor mass (referred to as -&#xD;
      Electrochemotherapy or ECT). The pulses make the tumour more porous which allows the drug&#xD;
      easier access into the cancer cells, whereas other tissues and organs in the body remain&#xD;
      relatively poor at absorbing the drug, thereby reducing the potential side effects on healthy&#xD;
      tissues. This approach to date has been limited to skin based tumours due to the requirement&#xD;
      for the electrodes to be placed directly in contact with the tumour. Procedures with&#xD;
      electrochemotherapy have been applied to human patients in other countries of the EU, the US&#xD;
      and Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug concentration used is significantly reduced due to the more targeted absorption by&#xD;
      the tumor and this significantly reduces side effects normally associated with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large number of preclinical and clinical Phase I and I/II studies have demonstrated the&#xD;
      efficiency and safety of ECT. These studies have included patients with melanoma, head and&#xD;
      neck squamous cell carcinoma, merkel cell carcinomas, basal cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      nodules. Case reports concerning other primary tumours have also been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed an endoscopic approach (EndoVe system) for delivering the&#xD;
      electric pulses to internal cancers and are currently seeking to evaluate its efficacy in the&#xD;
      treatment of inoperable colorectal cancer. The treatment procedure is similar to standard&#xD;
      endoscopic colorectal examination (colonoscopy) with the added element of an intravenous&#xD;
      injection of bleomycin followed after eight minutes by the delivery of electric pulses (each&#xD;
      one less than 1msec in duration). The pulses are endoscopically delivered directly to the&#xD;
      tumour mass. The entire procedure is minimally invasive and does not require intensive care&#xD;
      follow up or stitches. If the treatment is successful the tumour will shrink in size in the&#xD;
      weeks following the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of this approach in&#xD;
      reducing the size of the tumour.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to conduct treatment in a minimally invasive manner (using the endoscope)&#xD;
      and without the requirement for repeated doses of chemotherapy. The single dose of the drug&#xD;
      used (15,000 IU/m2 x Body Surface Area of bleomycin) has been well tolerated in all patients&#xD;
      treated previously with this approach to skin based cancers (in excess of 300 treatments&#xD;
      since 2003 in our hospital). Therefore, it is anticipated that patients are unlikely to&#xD;
      suffer side effects from the low concentration of drug used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no known side effects of the instrument being tested. The pulse generator used has&#xD;
      been certified by European electrical safety bodies charged with assessing compliance of new&#xD;
      equipment with the present security rules for electrical devices. The electrical pulse&#xD;
      generator has the CE mark and is approved for use clinically; the endoscopic electrodes used&#xD;
      are a prototype system and are not currently CE approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is provided on an outpatient basis and does not involve an overnight stay. The&#xD;
      procedure is very similar to a colonoscopy examination with the added element of a low dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy drug being injected intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It reduces operative time; therefore there are fewer anaesthetic risks&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this time, the only option for patients with inoperable colorectal cancers is symptom&#xD;
      relief e.g. a defunctioning colostomy or stent placement. Both carry a risk profile greater&#xD;
      than the treatment with the EndoVe system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quicker recovery time- This is beneficial for the patient in terms of reduced exposure to the&#xD;
      hospital environment through a shorter in-patient stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research: The potential benefits of studying novel medical instruments in general include the&#xD;
      development of new alternatives to conventional or existing therapies for certain cancers. In&#xD;
      particular, the widespread availability of the novel instrument being tested here may lessen&#xD;
      the requirement for more invasive procedures. It will reduce the amount of chemotherapy drug&#xD;
      being used, therefore reducing the systemic effects as well as the side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approach is currently being applied to inoperable cases but in the future it may&#xD;
      potentially be applied to both earlier stage cancers and other internal cancers e.g.&#xD;
      oesophagus, stomach etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the treatment procedure is short (outpatient basis), it allows these patients greater&#xD;
      time outside of the hospital environment to maximise and allowing for a greater quality of&#xD;
      life (this for both individual patient and community at large).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this treatment approach is proven to be safe and effective, patients with inoperable&#xD;
      colorectal cancers will have a minimally invasive option for palliation of symptoms.&#xD;
