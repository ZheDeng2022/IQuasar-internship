    <textblock>
      As they move from preadolescence to adolescence and adulthood, children need nurturing and&#xD;
      supportive environments to realize their potential. Unfortunately, many children reside in&#xD;
      destructive families that often result in negative short and long-term outcomes. As&#xD;
      well-chronicled in the scientific and lay press, an all-too-common example involves parental&#xD;
      substance abuse. Indeed, children living with a parent who abuses substances often have&#xD;
      significant emotional, behavioral, and social problems. It has long been recognized that&#xD;
      interventions are needed to address the clinical needs of these youth and to help prevent the&#xD;
      development of problems that may emerge in early adulthood. To date, the majority of&#xD;
      treatments have focused on either treating the children individually, or in the context of&#xD;
      family therapy. Although directly involving these youth in treatment may be ideal, the&#xD;
      majority of custodial parents who enter treatment for substance abuse are very reluctant to&#xD;
      allow their children to engage in individual or family therapy. Thus, interventions for&#xD;
      substance-abusing parents that do not directly involve children, but serve to improve the&#xD;
      family environment as a whole, may have the greatest potential for reaching the most children&#xD;
      and thereby positively influencing their overall adjustment and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From this vantage, a promising approach is Behavioral Couples Therapy [BCT] for alcoholism&#xD;
      and drug abuse, a comprehensive psychosocial intervention for substance abuse that focuses&#xD;
      both on reducing addiction severity, improving couple adjustment, reducing interparental&#xD;
      conflict and intimate partner violence (IPV), and improving the family environment and&#xD;
      psychological functioning. In a series of preliminary studies, the PI found that children&#xD;
      whose substance-abusing fathers and nonsubstance-abusing mothers participated in BCT&#xD;
      displayed higher psychosocial adjustment at posttreatment and during an extended follow-up&#xD;
      than youth whose substance-abusing fathers participated in individual-based treatment (IBT)&#xD;
      or whose parents participated in a couples-based attention control treatment. These findings&#xD;
      indicate that BCT may extend beyond the couple to their children and may provide an entry&#xD;
      point into the family system from which to improve the adjustment of these youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is the next important step for this line of research. First, the present&#xD;
      study is a far more developed examination of the potential effects of BCT on multiple&#xD;
      dimensions of youth functioning, taken from multiple perspectives. Second, we do not know&#xD;
      &quot;how&quot; BCT works. The positive effects of BCT on parents (reduced addition severity, improved&#xD;
      dyadic adjustment, reduced partner violence, improved parenting, and improved parental&#xD;
      psychological adjustment) may have positive &quot;trickle down&quot; effects on youth; however, we have&#xD;
      not undertaken an empirical examination of these potential mechanisms of action. If we can&#xD;
      understand how it works, we will be able to use that information to refine BCT to enhance the&#xD;
      mechanisms that benefit youth. Thus, the present study will examine possible curative&#xD;
      mechanisms. Third, we have a very limited understanding for &quot;whom&quot; it works. Thus, we will&#xD;
      examine whether BCT may operate differently for children of different stages of development.&#xD;
      If we can understand this moderating effect, we may be able to develop and refine BCT to meet&#xD;
      the needs of families with children of different ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these issues, the present study will examine how BCT is associated with changes in&#xD;
      the emotional and behavioral adjustment, beliefs, and behaviors, including serious problem&#xD;
      behaviors, of youth ages 5 to 18 (as rated by mothers, fathers, and the children themselves).&#xD;
      We will also focus on potential mechanisms of action that are positively influenced by BCT.&#xD;

      The present study provides the next important step for this line of research. First, the&#xD;
      present study is a far more developed examination of the potential effects of BCT on multiple&#xD;

      If we can understand this moderating effect, we may be able to develop and refine BCT to meet&#xD;
      the needs of families with children of different ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these issues, the present study will compare the emotional and behavioral&#xD;
      adjustment, beliefs, and behaviors, including serious problem behaviors, of youth ages 5 to&#xD;
      18 (as rated by mothers, fathers, and the children themselves) whose mothers or fathers take&#xD;
      part in BCT to an Intent-to-Treat group. We will focus on potential mechanisms of action that&#xD;
      are positively influenced by BCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to use the information collected from the proposed investigation to refine and&#xD;
      modify BCT to enhance its positive effects on children. This process of (a) examining&#xD;
      multiple dimensions of functioning and (b) evaluating theoretically and empirically&#xD;
      identified mediators and moderators to inform intervention development and refinement has&#xD;
      been used successfully for over a decade with BCT, resulting in empirically informed BCT&#xD;
      variants for alcoholic patients, drug-abusing patients, patients who engage in domestic&#xD;
      violence, female substance-abusing patients, and so on. Thus, this project provides the next&#xD;
      critical step for BCT refinement and interventions for couples entering BCT who have&#xD;
      custodial children, the latter of whom we may only be able to help by helping their parents.&#xD;
