      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of&#xD;
      ziprasidone monotherapy in comparison to placebo in the treatment of ambulatory bipolar&#xD;
      disorder with co-morbid lifetime panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder and current&#xD;
      at least moderately severe anxiety.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, 8-week trial of&#xD;
      ziprasidone compared to placebo in outpatient subjects with a lifetime bipolar I, II, or NOS&#xD;
      disorder, a lifetime panic or generalized anxiety disorder, and current diagnosis at least&#xD;
      moderately severe anxiety symptoms. Approximately 50 subjects will be randomized. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to ziprasidone or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. No concomitant psychotropic&#xD;
      medication will be allowed throughout the study except for prn lorazepam during the first two&#xD;
      weeks for the management of affective and anxiety symptoms, prn zolpidem and zaleplon for the&#xD;
      management of insomnia and benztropine for the management of EPS. Throughout the study,&#xD;
      psychiatric scales will be used to assess psychiatric symptoms and the presence of&#xD;
      treatment-emergent adverse events will be monitored and recorded.&#xD;
