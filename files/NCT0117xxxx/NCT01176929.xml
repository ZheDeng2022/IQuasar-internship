  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevention of recurrent suicidal about people who have made a suicide attempt is a major&#xD;
      strand in the prevention of suicide. It is estimated that 10-15 % of people who made a&#xD;
      suicide attempt die by suicide. Recidivism rate of suicide increases even faster than the&#xD;
      subject is close to the index suicide attempt. A one month recurrence rate is 5 %, 12-25 % at&#xD;
      one year. Most people who made a suicide attempt receive ambulatory monitoring. On this&#xD;
      population, there is a low adherence to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to test the effectiveness of a prevention program of&#xD;
      recurrent suicidal acts for people who made a suicide attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are the assessment of adherence to care; the&#xD;
      identification of sub - populations benefiting most from this program; the evaluation of the&#xD;
      possible generalization level of the program (eligibles persons rate) and its feasibility&#xD;
      level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled and prospective trial comparing an experimental group (usual&#xD;
      treatment + interventions) to a control group (usual treatment only). All participants are&#xD;
      evaluated after one year of monitoring. The search duration is 2 years (one inclusion year&#xD;
      and one year of follow-up). It is planned to include 330 patients, 165 patients in each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program (experimental group) includes three interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A series of three telephone calls ( the second week , one month and three months after&#xD;
           discharge from hospital )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A systematic telephone contact with the referring physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A telephone helpline for people who made a suicide attempt and referring physicians.&#xD;
