      This study assessed the comparability of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of epoetin following&#xD;
      intravenous administration of Hospira Epoetin and Epogen/Epoetin Alfa (Amgen) in patients&#xD;
      with chronic renal failure receiving hemodialysis treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, active-controlled, cross-over, evaluator-blind, Phase I study in&#xD;
      patients with chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis. The study comprises a 4-week&#xD;
      Screening Period, a 1-week Pre-Treatment Period, a 1-week Treatment Period 1, a 1-week&#xD;
      Treatment Period 2 and a Follow-up visit at Week 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject eligibility will be determined during the 4-week Screening Period. All subjects must&#xD;
      be optimally titrated and stable to qualify for entry into Pre-Treatment Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 1-week Pre-treatment period the patients will continue on the same stable dose as&#xD;
      they received during the Screening Period. Blood samples will be collected during the&#xD;
      Pre-Treatment Period to assess pharmacokinetics of Epogen. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized at Day 1 of Treatment Period 1 to receive either Epoetin Hospira or Epogen (Amgen)&#xD;
      by intravenous (IV) bolus injections administered three times a week for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then be switched to receive the alternate study drug for three times a week for&#xD;
      1 week in Treatment Period 2. Blood samples will be collected during Treatment periods 1 and&#xD;
      2 to assess pharmacokinetics of Epoetin Hospira and Epogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint, i.e. pharmacokinetics concentrations, will be evaluator blinded. After&#xD;
      completing Treatment Period 2, all subjects will receive standard of care treatment and will&#xD;
      undergo a Follow-up Visit at Week 7 (i.e., 28 days after Treatment Period 2).&#xD;
