  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is a poorly understood symptom that is often described either as ringing, clicking,&#xD;
      ocean sounds, or nature sounds. There is no cure for tinnitus. Approximately 50 million&#xD;
      Americans are affected with a small minority being severely affected. This study targets&#xD;
      patients with tinnitus who are severely bothered. Through MRI the investigators plan to&#xD;
      evaluate the cortical networks of the brain in hopes to better understand this complex&#xD;
      process.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is the perceived sensation of sound without actual acoustic stimulation that affects&#xD;
      50 million Americans, with 15 million being significantly bothered. Using functional&#xD;
      connectivity MRI (fcMRI), the investigators have found distinct differences in the cortical&#xD;
      attention networks between patients with bothersome tinnitus and age-matched controls. These&#xD;
      novel findings suggest that some of the classic and most disturbing characteristics of&#xD;
      tinnitus result from derangements in cortical pathways. Using a validated task-based&#xD;
      functional MRI (fMRI) paradigm developed at Washington University, the investigators will&#xD;
      explore the ventral and dorsal frontoparietal cortical attention networks in patients with&#xD;
      bothersome tinnitus and non-tinnitus controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an experimental task-based fMRI pilot study involving the neurocognitive and&#xD;
      neuroimaging assessment of patients with severely bothersome tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to perform a pilot study and enroll a total of 10 subjects to undergo&#xD;
      task-based imaging. These results will be compared to a control (no tinnitus) cohort (n=35)&#xD;
      that has already undergone task-based fMRI. This task-based paradigm will allow us to advance&#xD;
      knowledge about the role of the attention, control, and other cortical networks in the&#xD;
      development and maintenance of bothersome tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate it will take one year to successfully enroll and test a total of&#xD;
      10 patients. All scans will be performed on the Washington University grounds.&#xD;
