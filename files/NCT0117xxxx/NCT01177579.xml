  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Copper is an essential nutrient for humans and is cofactor in enzymes that participate in&#xD;
      critical body functions. Insufficient copper can lead to hematological and neurological&#xD;
      abnormalities that may be irreversible if left untreated. Copper deficiency is believed to be&#xD;
      rare in the U.S. population because typical dietary intake is usually sufficient to meet&#xD;
      requirements. More recent evidence suggests that specific populations may be susceptible to&#xD;
      copper deficiency in cases where copper absorption in the gut is impaired following gastric&#xD;
      surgery or in individuals with high intakes of zinc. Preliminary studies by us and others&#xD;
      have identified significant levels of moderate and severe symptomatic copper deficiency in&#xD;
      patients who have undergone weight loss (bariatric) gastric bypass surgery. Copper deficiency&#xD;
      in humans is difficult to recognize and treat because current diagnostic tools rely on&#xD;
      measures of plasma concentrations of copper and ceruloplasmin, which are neither sensitive&#xD;
      nor specific for copper deficiency, and early warning blood markers (biomarkers) have not&#xD;
      been identified. Recent developments indicate that copper chaperone molecules and&#xD;
      cuproenzymes such as cytochrome C oxidase and superoxide dismutase may be more sensitive to&#xD;
      changes in copper status, but there has been very little work done in humans. The studies&#xD;
      outlined here are aimed at assessing copper status using these biomarkers in gastric bypass&#xD;
      surgery patients who are at risk for symptomatic copper deficiency. In addition, patients&#xD;
      identified to be deficient will be supplemented with copper and this treatment will be&#xD;
      evaluated using biomarker concentrations. The findings of these studies should provide&#xD;
      insight into the effectiveness of novel biomarkers to identify those at risk and to guide&#xD;
      appropriate treatment to prevent serious and permanent morbidity due to copper deficiency.&#xD;

        CuD subjects In order to be enrolled into the CuD Arm, subjects who have had RYGB surgery&#xD;
        will be recruited and screened for eligibility (inclusion and exclusion criteria below).&#xD;
        Subjects whose plasma copper concentrations are in the deficient range (less than 80 μg/dL&#xD;
        for women and less than 70 µg/dL for men, and/or ceruloplasmin activity below 62 units/L-1)&#xD;
        following 4 weeks of supplementation with the RDA for copper will be eligible. Such&#xD;
        supplementation is the routine standard of care with all patients undergoing RYGB surgery.&#xD;
        This process aims to exclude patients who were only marginally copper deficient and not in&#xD;
        need of sustained copper therapy. Subjects will be notified about their copper status by a&#xD;
        study physician. They will be contacted by the study team, and their willingness to&#xD;
        participate in the study will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria: 1) Patient has a history of RYGB weight loss surgery; 2) subject has a&#xD;
        plasma copper level which is less than 80 μg/dL for women andl less than 70 µg/dL for men,&#xD;
        and/or ceruloplasmin activity below 62 units/L-1; 3) subject is at least 18 but not more&#xD;
        than 65 years of age; and 4) subject has signed an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria: 1) subject exhibits severe neurologic signs or symptoms (e.g. severe&#xD;
        paresthesias, severe gait disturbances, or severe weakness which require intravenous copper&#xD;
        supplementation; 2) subject is pregnant; 3) subject has history of surgical revision or&#xD;
        conversion of bariatric procedure; 4) subject has a history of hospitalization for acute&#xD;
        illness in the previous 3 months; 5) subject has current active malignant neoplasm; or&#xD;
        history of malignancy other than localized basal cell cancer of skin during previous 5&#xD;
        years; 6) subject has current history of type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CuN subjects In order to be enrolled into the CuN control arm, subjects who have had RYGB&#xD;
        surgery will be recruited and screened for eligibility (inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;

        for women and 70 - 140 µg/dL for men, and/or ceruloplasmin activity above 62 units/L-1).&#xD;
        Subjects will also be eligible if they can be matched for stage of weight management&#xD;
        (either active weight loss or weight stable) and gender with a CuD subject. Subjects will&#xD;
        be notified about their copper status and their eligibility and their willingness to&#xD;
        participate in the study will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria: 1) Patient has a history of RYGB weight loss surgery; 2) subject has a&#xD;

        management and gender with a CuD subject, 4) subject is at least 18 but not more than 65&#xD;
        years of age; and 5) subject has signed an informed consent.&#xD;
