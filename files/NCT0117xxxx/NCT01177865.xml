      RATIONALE: Gathering information about patients with prostate cancer may help doctors learn&#xD;
      more about how patients choose treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This study is looking at treatment choice in patients with localized prostate&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the importance of prostate cancer treatment characteristics to men with&#xD;
           localized prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine to what extent men will choose the strengths and weaknesses of one&#xD;
           treatment over a different set of strengths and weaknesses of another treatment when&#xD;
           making a choice between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the correlation between attributes that are important to men and baseline&#xD;
           demographics, functional status, and disease risk characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete a 'discrete choice experiment' questionnaire presenting three treatment&#xD;
      options based on 8 aspects of treatment. Attributes relevant to men with prostate cancer&#xD;
      (e.g., sexual health, urinary function, return to normal activities [work, gardening, sports,&#xD;
      shopping]) that apply to surveillance, radical therapies and new minimally-invasive therapies&#xD;
      have been selected for consideration. Baseline demographics such as age,&#xD;
      working/retired/unemployed/household income, prostate cancer characteristics (PSA level,&#xD;
      Gleason grade, stage), baseline functional status (genitourinary function), and final&#xD;
      treatment choice will also be collected in order to ascertain whether there is any&#xD;
      relationship and association between patient preferences for treatment and these baseline&#xD;
      demographics. Individuals will be asked to choose between the three treatment profiles.&#xD;
