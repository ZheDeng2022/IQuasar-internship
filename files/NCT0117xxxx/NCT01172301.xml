  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition, including muscle wasting commonly occurs in children with cystic fibrosis (CF),&#xD;
      negatively influencing their quality of life and survival. At the time of a diagnosis of CF,&#xD;
      severe protein deficits can already be present. It is important to get CF children fed&#xD;
      adequately to prevent that their condition becomes worse or that recovery takes longer. Oral&#xD;
      supplementation trials showed that gains in lean body mass are difficult to achieve in CF&#xD;
      unless specific metabolic abnormalities are targeted. However, the specific needs for certain&#xD;
      food components are not clear yet in children that are ill. Therefore, more information is&#xD;
      necessary on the need for protein and certain amino acids in children with CF. Previous&#xD;
      studies support the concept of essential amino acids (EAA) as an anabolic stimulus in the&#xD;
      young and elderly and in insulin resistant states. Until yet no information is present on the&#xD;
      anabolic effects of EAA in CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore our hypothesis that a high-leucine essential amino acids mixture specifically&#xD;
      designed to stimulate protein anabolism will target the metabolic alterations of pediatric&#xD;
      subjects with CF. In the present proposal, the acute metabolic effects of this high leucine&#xD;
      essential amino acids mixture will be examined in pediatric subjects with CF and compared to&#xD;
      that of a regular balanced total mixture of essential and non-essential amino acids. The&#xD;
      principal endpoints will be the extent of stimulation of whole body protein synthesis as this&#xD;
      is the principal mechanism by which either amino acid or protein intake causes muscle&#xD;
      anabolism, and the reduction in endogenous protein breakdown. Both endpoints will be assessed&#xD;
      by isotope methodology which is thought to be the reference method.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will test the following hypothesis: A high-leucine essential amino acid&#xD;
      mixture (dose of 6.7 g) will stimulate protein anabolism to a greater extent than a standard&#xD;
      balanced mixture of total (essential and non-essential) amino acids in CF pediatric subjects.&#xD;
      The principal endpoints will be the extent of stimulation of protein synthesis rate and the&#xD;
      reduction in endogenous protein breakdown. The current project will provide information that&#xD;
      will enable us to better understand the underlying metabolic mechanisms that regulate protein&#xD;
      metabolism in pediatric subjects with CF.&#xD;
