    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether creatine will be helpful as an adjunctive&#xD;
      treatment for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) in female and male&#xD;
      Veterans. We hypothesize that Veterans receiving creatine will show decreased depressive&#xD;
      symptoms as measured by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). We will also&#xD;
      use 31-Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (31-P MRS) brain scans to compare levels of&#xD;
      neurochemicals related to energy metabolism in the brain, before-and-after treatment with&#xD;
      creatine, and between healthy controls and MDD participants.&#xD;

      This is an open-label clinical trial of the investigational drug creatine for augmentation&#xD;
      treatment of female and male Veterans, ages 18-55, with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who&#xD;
      have failed to respond to antidepressant treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitor (SSRI) drug. Based on converging preclinical and animal model research, and our&#xD;
      laboratory's prior clinical trials, we hypothesize that the nutritional supplement creatine&#xD;
      may provide benefit as an adjunctive treatment to SSRI pharmacotherapy, for Veterans with&#xD;
      treatment-resistant depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty (n=20) Veterans between the ages of 18-55 years with MDD will be recruited for&#xD;
      participation in an open-label trial of creatine augmentation. Veterans with depression will&#xD;
      have unremitted MDD, despite having had an adequate trial of an SSRI antidepressant.&#xD;
      Participants with MDD will be treated with oral creatine 5 gm daily for 8 weeks and will&#xD;
      continue taking their SSRI antidepressant. Participants will undergo brain scanning at&#xD;
      baseline, and the scans will be repeated following 8 of adjunctive creatine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neuroimaging technique utilized is Phosphorus-31 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy&#xD;
      (31P-MRS). 31P-MRS is a non-invasive method with no exposure to ionizing radiation. At the&#xD;
      magnetic field strength utilized (3 Tesla), magnetic resonance imaging is FDA-approved and is&#xD;
      not associated with irreversible or serious adverse events. Furthermore, 31P-MRS is the only&#xD;
      in vivo method for in vivo quantification of phosphorus energy metabolism, in living human&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to Veterans with MDD, twenty (n=20) healthy control (HC) participants will be&#xD;
      recruited. HCs will be Veterans between the ages of 18-55, who have no history of psychiatric&#xD;
      or substance use disorder. No treatment will be administered to HC participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HCs will undergo a single 31P-MRS scan, which will be used to measure the&#xD;
      phosphorus-bearing neurometabolites that are involved in brain energy metabolism. The&#xD;
      research team will use data from 31P-MRS scans to compare levels of high-energy phosphate&#xD;
      metabolites in MDD participants vs. healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, comparison of pre- and post-treatment 31P-MRS metabolite levels will be&#xD;
      conducted in the MDD participants, to test the hypothesis that creatine augmentation improves&#xD;
      brain energy metabolism.&#xD;
