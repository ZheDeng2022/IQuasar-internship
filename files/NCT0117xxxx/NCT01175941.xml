  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to examine the effect of alpha adrenergic stimulation of the anal canal and&#xD;
      rectum on parameters affecting the control of defecation in subjects with faecal&#xD;
      incontinence. The study will investigate the effects of rectal suppositories containing 10 mg&#xD;
      NRL001 given for seven days, once daily. Rectal compliance and median anal resting pressure&#xD;
      will be considered the primary objective of the study. A pharmacokinetic evaluation plus&#xD;
      safety and tolerability assessment including monitoring of electrocardiograms (ECGs), blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate will also be evaluated as secondary objectives.&#xD;

             electrocardiograms [ECGs] at screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with mild/moderate passive faecal incontinence based on clinical symptomology&#xD;
