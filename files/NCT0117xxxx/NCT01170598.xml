  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue, reduced quality of life and declines in physical function are common in patients&#xD;
      undergoing chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Studies in other cancer patients&#xD;
      undergoing treatment have shown that exercise improves these symptoms, but there are limited&#xD;
      studies in AML. This study of a hospital-based exercise program will help determine if&#xD;
      exercise is both feasible and helpful in improving symptoms among for AML patients undergoing&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a life-threatening haematological malignancy.&#xD;
      Initial treatment with induction chemotherapy requires 4-5 weeks of hospitalization, with a&#xD;
      risk of physical deconditioning, declines in quality of life (QOL), and significant fatigue.&#xD;
      Four pilot exercise studies have demonstrated improved fitness, strength, QOL, and fatigue in&#xD;
      patients undergoing induction, but are limited by small sample sizes, recruitment of mostly&#xD;
      younger adults, inconsistent endpoints, and design issues. Prior to conducting a large&#xD;
      multi-centre randomized controlled trial (RCT), important pilot work first needs to be done&#xD;
      to demonstrate feasibility of a randomized trial of an exercise program in AML patients&#xD;
      undergoing induction chemotherapy; to ensure safety; and to provide effect estimates of the&#xD;
      intervention on fitness and QOL/fatigue endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Primary objectives are: (1) to determine feasibility of recruitment and retention&#xD;
      of adult AML patients to a randomized trial of supervised exercise and ability of patients to&#xD;
      perform an exercise intervention in hospital; (2) to provide estimates of the effect of&#xD;
      exercise on fitness parameters. Secondary objectives are: (1) to determine effects of&#xD;
      exercise on QOL and fatigue; (2) to understand the impact of exercise on AML treatment&#xD;
      tolerability; (3) to examine safety of the exercise intervention. Methods: Thirty-five&#xD;
      patients age 18 or older with newly diagnosed or relapsed AML who are undergoing induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be recruited at Princess Margaret Hospital. Participants will perform 30-45&#xD;
      minutes of supervised aerobic and resistance exercises 4-5 days per week. Primary outcomes&#xD;
      are recruitment rate, exercise adherence rate, and impact on fitness measures (peak aerobic&#xD;
      capacity (VO2peak), grip strength, leg strength, 6-minute walk test). QOL will be measured&#xD;
      with the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core 30-item&#xD;
      questionnaire (QLQ-C30). Fatigue will be measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer&#xD;
      Therapy fatigue subscale (FACT-Fatigue). Treatment tolerability outcomes include length of&#xD;
      stay, intensive care unit admission, and the development of sepsis. Outcomes over time will&#xD;
      be assessed using mixed effects regression models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Exercise is a promising intervention for improving fitness, QOL and treatment&#xD;
      tolerability in AML patients undergoing induction chemotherapy. This pilot RCT will establish&#xD;
      feasibility and safety, as well as provide efficacy estimates that will be vital to the&#xD;
      design and conduct of a definitive multi-centre RCT of exercise in this patient population.&#xD;

    <description>The modified Bruce protocol is a walking-based treadmill test used to assess peak aerobic capacity. As the test progresses the intensity of each 3-minute work load increases. The test concludes when the participant reaches his maximal heart rate or volitional fatigue. The value attained on this test is measured in metabolic equivalents (METS). METS are a measure of exercise intensity and reflect the physical demands of an activity. In this context, a higher value achieved on the treadmill test (in METS) indicates work at a higher intensity and therefore a higher aerobic capacity.</description>

            <description>All study participants were part of the exercise group as this was a non-randomized study. Participants were approached 4-5 times per week to participate in supervised, individualized exercise sessions that incorporated a combination of aerobic, resistance and flexibility exercises. Exercise was light to moderate in intensity and each exercise session was 30-45 minutes in length.</description>
