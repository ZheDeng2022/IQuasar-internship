  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center open label study to assess the efficacy and safety of single doses of&#xD;
      canakinumab (trade name Ilaris®), a high-affinity monoclonal antibody that neutralizes IL-1β,&#xD;
      in patients with active urticarial vasculitis. Efficacy is primarily assessed by a combined&#xD;
      symptom score, the urticarial vasculitis activity score (UVAS). Following a baseline period&#xD;
      of 2 weeks, patients will be dosed with two single s.c. injections of 150 mg (consistent with&#xD;
      a total dose of 300 mg canakinumab). Visits for investigator's assessments will be scheduled&#xD;
      at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks post dose. Patient's&#xD;
      self-assessment will be performed on a daily basis throughout the study. Overall a max. of 10&#xD;
      subjects with urticarial vasculitis will be enrolled.&#xD;

    <description>Change in the mean UV activity score (UVAS) from the baseline phase (day -14 to day 0) to the last 2 weeks of the first 4 weeks treatment phase (day 15 to 28) of the study (The UVAS combines the key symptoms of UV). Daily UVAS values will be documented using DHAFs (Daily Health Assessment Forms). Values for the Sum UVAS can range from 0 to 50 per day (5 symptoms, 0-10 each). Mean Daily UVAS will be calculated by dividing the sum of the daily activity scores by 5.</description>
