    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well RO4929097 works in treating&#xD;
      patients with recurrent and/or metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer,&#xD;
      or primary peritoneal cancer. RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the antitumor activity of RO4929097 in recurrent and / or metastatic epithelial&#xD;
      ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer by progression free&#xD;
      survival rate at the end of 4 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the antitumor activity of RO4929097 through secondary endpoints including:&#xD;
      overall response rate and CA125 response rate (GCIC criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety of single agent RO4929097 in advanced platinum resistant ovarian,&#xD;
      fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore expression of Notch biomarkers in advanced platinum resistant ovarian,&#xD;
      fallopian, and primary peritoneal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore the impact of RO49097 on ascitic fluid circulating tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and&#xD;
      15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and tumor tissue samples are collected for correlative studies. Ascitic fluid may also&#xD;
      be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every month for at least 1 year.&#xD;

    <time_frame>84 days (4 courses)</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the proportion of the study population that has not had tumor progression (symptomatic, RECIST progression, CA-125 progression) or died at the completion of the cycle four mark.&#xD;
RECIST criteria for progressive disease (PD) in target lesions: &gt;= 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. In non-target lesions: Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.&#xD;
CA-125 PD is based on the progressive serial elevation of serum CA-125 according to:&#xD;
A) elevated CA-125 pretreatment &amp; normalization of CA-125 or C) CA-125 in normal range pretreatment: CA-125 &gt;= 2x ULN on 2 occasions.&#xD;
B) elevated CA-125 pretreatment that never normalizes: CA-125 &gt;= 2x nadir value on 2 occasions</description>

    <measure>Overall Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from start of treatment to time of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Response was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).&#xD;
Evaluation of Target Lesions:&#xD;
Complete response (CR) - disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.&#xD;
Partial response (PR) - at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.&#xD;
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions:&#xD;
Complete response (CR) - disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis).</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>An exploratory analysis for potential predictive biomarkers was performed on archival, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue for components of the Notch Pathway: Jagged-1 and NICD. The percentage of positive cells were scored into four categories: 0 (0%), 1 (1-33%), 2 (34-66%), and 3 (67-100%). The product of the intensity and percentage scores was used as the final score and classified as negative (0-4) or positive (5-9).</description>

             serious infections, active peptic ulcer disease, psychiatric illness, or any other&#xD;
             medical conditions that might be aggravated by treatment or limit compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently no active, second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Patients are not considered to have a &quot;current active&quot; malignancy if they&#xD;
                  have completed anti-cancer therapy and are considered by their physician to be at&#xD;
                  less than 30% risk of relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition&#xD;
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those&#xD;
             conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of RO4929097on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;
             dose are unknown; for this reason and because Notch signal pathway inhibitors are&#xD;
             known to cause interruption of the embryonic signaling pathway and may lead to serious&#xD;
             or life-threatening birth defects, including brain deformities, facial malformation,&#xD;
             heart problems, or abnormal organs; if women of childbearing potential do not abstain*&#xD;
             from sexual activity they must use two forms of contraception (i.e., barrier&#xD;
             contraception and one other method of contraception) at least 4 weeks prior to study&#xD;
             entry; women of childbearing potential can either be abstinent or use two forms of&#xD;
             contraception for the duration of study participation and for at least 12 months&#xD;
             post-treatment; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is&#xD;
             participating in this study and for 12 months after study participation, the patient&#xD;
             should inform the treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abstinent from sexual activity at least 4 weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pregnancy Testing: Women of childbearing potential are required to have a&#xD;
                  negative serum pregnancy test (with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) within&#xD;
                  10-14 days and within 24 hours prior to the first dose of RO4929097 (serum or&#xD;
                  urine); a pregnancy test (serum or urine) will be administered every 4 weeks if&#xD;
                  their menstrual cycles are regular or every 2 weeks if their cycles are irregular&#xD;
                  while on study within the 24-hour period prior to the administration of&#xD;
                  RO4929097; a positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test;&#xD;
                  prior to dispensing RO4929097, the investigator or clinical staff must confirm&#xD;
                  and document the patient's use of two contraceptive methods or abstinence, dates&#xD;
                  of negative pregnancy test, and confirm the patient's understanding of the&#xD;
                  potential of RO4929097 to cause serious or life-threatening birth defects&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female patients of childbearing potential are defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients with regular menses&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients, after menarche with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a&#xD;
                       contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Women who have had tubal ligation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female patients may be considered to NOT be of childbearing potential for the&#xD;
                  following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The patient has undergone total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral&#xD;
                       salpingo-oophorectomy or bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The patient is medically confirmed to be menopausal (no menstrual period)&#xD;
                       for 24 consecutive months&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Pre-pubertal females; the parent or guardian of young female patients who&#xD;
                       have not yet started menstruation should verify that menstruation has not&#xD;
                       begun; if a young female patient reaches menarche during the study, then she&#xD;
                       is to be considered as a woman of childbearing potential from that time&#xD;
                       forward&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to RO4929097 or other agents used in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking medications with narrow therapeutic indices that are metabolized by&#xD;
             cytochrome P450 (CYP450), including warfarin sodium (Coumadin ®) are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preclinical studies indicate that RO4929097 is a substrate of CYP3A4 and inducer of&#xD;
             CYP3A4 enzyme activity; caution should be exercised when dosing RO4929097 concurrently&#xD;
             with CYP3A4 substrates, inducers, and/or inhibitors; patients who are taking&#xD;
             concurrent medications that are strong inducers, inhibitors or substrates of CYP3A4&#xD;
             should be switched to alternative medications to minimize any potential risk; if such&#xD;
             patients cannot be switched to alternative medications, they will be ineligible to&#xD;
             participate in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome, bowel obstruction, or other condition that would&#xD;
             interfere with intestinal absorption; patients must be able to swallow tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are serologically positive for Hepatitis A, B or C, or have a history of&#xD;
             liver disease, other forms of hepatitis or cirrhosis are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia,&#xD;
             hypophosphatemia or hypokalemia defined as less than the lower limit of normal for the&#xD;
             institution, despite adequate electrolyte supplementation are excluded from this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia other than chronic, stable atrial fibrillation, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because RO4929097 is a Notch pathway&#xD;
             inhibiting agent with the potential for serious or life-threatening birth defects or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with RO4929097,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with RO4929097; these&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible&#xD;
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with RO4929097; in addition,&#xD;
             these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiovascular (within 7 days prior to start of study treatment): baseline QTc &gt; 470&#xD;
             msec (female), QTc &gt; 450 msec (male)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of risk factors for QT interval prolongation, including, but not limited&#xD;
                  to family or personal history of long QT syndrome, recurrent syncope without&#xD;
                  known etiology or sudden unexpected death&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of torsade de pointes or other significant cardiac arrhythmias or the&#xD;
                  need for concomitant meds with known potential to prolong QT interval or&#xD;
