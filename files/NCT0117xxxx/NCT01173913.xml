  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral administration has many advantages above intravenously administrated drugs for patients.&#xD;
      Up to now, oral administration of docetaxel as single agent has not been feasible due to low&#xD;
      and variable bioavailability. This low systematic exposure to docetaxel can effectively be&#xD;
      increased after co-administration of ritonavir. The department of pharmacy of the Slotervaart&#xD;
      Hospital and Netherlands Cancer Institute developed a solid oral dosage form for docetaxel,&#xD;
      ModraDoc001 10 mg capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two other novel dosage forms of docetaxel with improved pharmaceutical characteristics, have&#xD;
      been developed: ModraDoc003 10 mg tablets and ModraDoc004 10/50 mg tablets. The systemic&#xD;
      exposure after administration of those forms is now being investigated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The bioavailability of docetaxel is limited due to metabolising cytochrome P450 (CYP)&#xD;
      enzymes, which are abundantly present in the gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhibition of CYP3A4 enzymes with ritonavir (an anti-retroviral drug) has in previously&#xD;
      conducted proof-of-concept and phase I trials, proven to enhance the bioavailability of oral&#xD;
      docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral administration of docetaxel has been investigated in five clinical trials, all initiated&#xD;
      by the Netherlands Cancer Institute - Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital (NKI-AVL). The&#xD;
      department of pharmacy of the Slotervaart Hospital and Netherlands Cancer Institute developed&#xD;
      a solid oral dosage form for docetaxel, ModraDoc001 10 mg capsules. This formulation has now&#xD;
      been investigated in more than 40 patients in a first clinical study. The preliminary results&#xD;
      with ModraDoc001 10mg are promising and a linearity between systemic exposure to docetaxel&#xD;
      and the applied dose of ModraDoc001 10mg capsules is seen. In an attempt to further improve&#xD;
      and prolong the systemic exposure we will explore a twice daily dosing schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two other novel dosage forms for docetaxel, ModraDoc003 10 mg tablets and ModraDoc004 10/50&#xD;
      mg tablets, were developed. Both are spray-dried solid dispersions of docetaxel pressed in&#xD;
      tablets. The distinction between both is that ritonavir is included in the co-formulation of&#xD;
      ModraDoc004 10/50 mg tablets (10 mg docetaxel and 50 mg ritonavir). Both dosage forms will be&#xD;
      investigated in arm B to see whether these new formulations have comparable pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      characteristics of docetaxel to the capsule formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A Arm A is a dose escalation study to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)of weekly&#xD;
      bi-daily ModraDoc001 10 mg capsules. This study will be done with a classical dose escalation&#xD;
      design. The starting dose will be 40 mg BID. This dose is based on a safety of weekly 80 mg&#xD;
      single dose in the previously conducted study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B ModraDoc003 10 mg tablets and ModraDoc004 10/50 mg tablets will be investigated in arm&#xD;
      B to see whether these new formulations have comparable pharmacokinetic characteristics of&#xD;
      docetaxel to the capsule formulation od ModraDoc001 10 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another part of this study is the screening for 2 different polymorphism, C1236T (for&#xD;
      MDR1)and CYP3A4*1B. Polymorphic variants may influence the absorption and elimination of&#xD;
      docetaxel and ritonavir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm D is a dose escalation study to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)of weekly&#xD;
      bi-daily ModraDoc006 10 mg tablets. This study will be done with a classical dose escalation&#xD;
      design. The starting dose will be 20 mg BID. This dose is based on a safety of BID weekly&#xD;
      ModraDoc001 mg in the previously conducted arm A.&#xD;

    <description>The maximal tolerated dose (defined as the highest dose resulting in no more that 1/6 probability of causing a dose limiting toxicities defined in the protocol) of bi-daily ModraDoc001 10mg capsules with ritonavir will be assessed in Arm A. Weekly safety assessments for Arm A and Arm B: signs and symptoms/adverse events, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis), 12-lead ECG monitoring (Day 0, End of Th). The incidence of serious AEs (SAEs) and AE related to oral docetaxel and/or to ritonavir will be determined.</description>
