      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not CTCs can be detected in blood&#xD;
      samples taken from patients diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. The purpose is to compare&#xD;
      CTC analysis to tumor samples to look for differences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by early dissemination through the blood&#xD;
      system with the majority of patients succumbing to their disease in 9-11 months. Despite&#xD;
      evaluation of multiple new agents a platinum doublet has remained the standard of care for&#xD;
      over 25 years. We believe that the lack of understanding of the biology of SCLC has&#xD;
      contributed to our failure to advance treatment and prolong survival. Tumor and blood&#xD;
      biomarkers have been shown to be a powerful tool for increasing our understanding of the&#xD;
      complex biology of cancer and determining prognosis and response to therapies. Currently,&#xD;
      there are no validated biomarkers for response or to follow disease activity in SCLC.&#xD;
      Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) is a laboratory technique that became available&#xD;
      in the last few decades. Newer, more sensitive technology for the isolation and&#xD;
      characterization of CTCs using a rare event imaging system with automated fluorescence&#xD;
      microscopy known as CellSearch has demonstrated value in several cancers. CTCs detection by&#xD;
      this system is approved as a prognostic biomarker in metastatic breast cancer, and as a tool&#xD;
      to monitor disease in metastatic colorectal cancer and castrate resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, only one publication has reported on the presence of CTCs in SCLC. These&#xD;
      investigators used RT-PCR to amplify CK19 cDNA. CTCs were detected in 27% of patients. In our&#xD;
      preliminary study using the CellSearch system we have detected 1 or more CTCs in 11/13 (84%)&#xD;
      patient samples in various stages of their disease. Thus CTCs may be a promising biomarker&#xD;
      but we need more studies. Thus, our first goal is to determine if CTCs in SCLC can predict&#xD;
      response to chemotherapy, predict early relapse or function as a as a prognostic marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we will explore the feasibility of extracting genetic material from CTCs for&#xD;
      genomic profile that could immensely help us unravel the complex molecular pathways and gene&#xD;
      expression in SCLC, which ultimately will lead to novel drug development. Other investigators&#xD;
      have shown that gene expression profiles for CTCs may be used to distinguish normal donor&#xD;
      from advanced cancer patients and differentiate among different types of cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, SCLC kills 45,000 Americans each year. The treatment of SCLC has not changed&#xD;
      since the introduction of cisplatin and etoposide during 1970s. Research in cancer biology&#xD;
      has identified several genetic alterations that could be of therapeutic importance. Novel&#xD;
      agents that target these genetic alterations are currently in development. Patient selection&#xD;
      will be key in order to determine the activity of these agents. Understanding the biology of&#xD;
      this disease is the key to successful interventions and personalizing therapy.&#xD;
