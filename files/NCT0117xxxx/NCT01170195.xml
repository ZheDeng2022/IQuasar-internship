    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to test the effect of Licorice Root Extract- Licogen on&#xD;
      postmenopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. Specifically, the study will also test the&#xD;
      effect of the licorice extract on vaginal dryness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The estrogenic properties of glabridin, the major isoflavan in licorice root, were tested in&#xD;
      view of the resemblance of its structure and lipophilicity to those of estradiol. The results&#xD;
      indicate that glabridin is a phytoestrogen, binding to the human estrogen receptor and&#xD;
      stimulating creatine kinase activity in rat uterus, epiphyseal cartilage, diaphyseal bone,&#xD;
      aorta, and left ventricle of the heart. The stimulatory effects of 2.5-25 mg/animal glabridin&#xD;
      were similar to those of 5 mg/animal estradiol. Chemical modification of glabridin showed&#xD;
      that the position of the hydroxyl groups has a significant role in binding to the human&#xD;
      estrogen receptor and in proliferation-inducing activity. Glabridin was found to be three to&#xD;
      four times more active than 2*-O-methylglabridin and 4*-O-methylglabridin, and both&#xD;
      derivatives were more active than 2*,4*- O-methylglabridin. The effect of increasing&#xD;
      concentrations of glabridin on the growth of breast tumor cells was biphasic. Glabridin&#xD;
      showed an estrogen receptor-dependent, growth-promoting effect at low concentrations (10&#xD;
      nM-10 mM) and estrogen receptor-independent antiproliferative activity at concentrations of&#xD;
      &gt;15 mM. This is the first study to indicate that isoflavans have estrogen-like activities.&#xD;
      Glabridin and its derivatives exhibited varying degrees of estrogen receptor agonism in&#xD;
      different tests and demonstrated growth-inhibitory actions on breast cancer cells.&#xD;
