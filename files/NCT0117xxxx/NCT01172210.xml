  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A substantial percentage of individuals with bulimia nervosa (BN) also meet criteria for a&#xD;
      co-occurring substance use disorder, such as alcohol abuse or dependence; however, research&#xD;
      examining this sub-group of patients with BN is limited. Understanding characteristics common&#xD;
      to both eating and alcohol use disorders may enhance understanding of the mechanisms that&#xD;
      could contribute to the co-occurrence and perpetuation of these disorders. Individuals with&#xD;
      BN and alcohol use disorders appear to share some behavioral traits, and therefore, the&#xD;
      primary aim of the current study is to compare patients with BN with and without an alcohol&#xD;
      use disorder and normal controls on measures assessing an individual's mood and ability to&#xD;
      perform certain tasks. Participants will be asked to complete computer-administered and&#xD;
      paper-and-pencil assessments and two laboratory test meals on separate days. By probing the&#xD;
      underpinnings of BN and alcohol use disorders, the investigators can determine whether these&#xD;
      disorders have a shared diathesis, which will lay an essential foundation for future research&#xD;
      to examine biological and genetic correlates of these disorders. Finally, as little is known&#xD;
      about the treatment of patients with BN and a co-occurring alcohol use disorder, an&#xD;
      exploratory aim of the current study is evaluate the suitability and efficacy of a 20-session&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) addressing both bulimic symptoms and alcohol use.&#xD;

      examining this sub-group of patients with BN is limited. Understanding characteristics common&#xD;

      the current study is to compare patients with BN with and without an alcohol use disorder and&#xD;
      normal controls on computer-administered and paper-and-pencil assessments and in two&#xD;
      laboratory test meals (a binge meal and a normal meal) on separate days. Participants will&#xD;
      also complete self-report and interview measures of eating disorder symptoms and alcohol&#xD;
      consumption. By probing the underpinnings of BN and alcohol use disorders, we can determine&#xD;
      whether these disorders have a shared diathesis, which will lay an essential foundation for&#xD;
      future research to examine biological and genetic correlates of these disorders. Finally, as&#xD;
