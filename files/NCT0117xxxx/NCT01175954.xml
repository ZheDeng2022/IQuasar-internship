      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: A 24-week trial of adjunctive Lacosamide does not produce a decline in&#xD;
      cognitive, mood or quality of life measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the cognitive and behavioral side effects of lacosamide in patients with partial&#xD;
      epilepsy and follow them for a period of 24 weeks using a neuropsychological test battery&#xD;
      drawing on tests commonly used and designed to maximize sensitivity to drug effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if any significant changes in cognitive, mood or quality of life measures are&#xD;
      dependent upon changes in seizure severity, neurotoxicity, adverse events, or Lacosamide&#xD;
      dosage.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will examine a group of patients with partial epilepsy (chronic seizures&#xD;
      arising from one particular part of the brain) whose seizures have not been controlled. If&#xD;
      they consent to the study, they will be followed for 4 weeks to get a baseline seizure&#xD;
      frequency. The patients will take a battery of tests assessing attention, memory, cognitive&#xD;
      speed, and language, and fill out some inventories to assess their mood and quality of life.&#xD;
      They will then receive a new anti-epileptic drug, lacosamide, to add to whatever epilepsy&#xD;
      medications they are currently taking. They will be closely followed for 24 weeks with&#xD;
      regular doctor's visits to monitor their physical health and seizure control, and will&#xD;
      complete an inventory assessing the frequency and severity of their seizures. During that&#xD;
      period of time, the other medication will remain unchanged. At the end of the 24-week period&#xD;
      they will re-take the battery of cognitive tests and mood and quality of life inventories.&#xD;
      The cognitive, mood, and quality of life variables will be analyzed to determine if they&#xD;
      change for the better or worse after the course of lacosamide treatment. Any changes will&#xD;
      also be analyzed with respect to seizure frequency and severity and to adverse events or side&#xD;
      effects from the addition of the lacosamide, as well as to lacosamide dosage. The&#xD;
      investigators chose this design since it closely represents what the investigators do in&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
