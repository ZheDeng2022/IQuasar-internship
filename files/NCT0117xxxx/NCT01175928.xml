  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the NormaTec PCD, a non-invasive&#xD;
      pneumatic compression device with the patented peristaltic pulse pneumatic waveform, in the&#xD;
      treatment of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare treatment with a NormaTec PCD and a sham device to assess whether the&#xD;
      NormaTec PCD improves the signs and symptoms of DPN.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes frequently leads to decreased sensation in the legs caused by diabetic peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy (DPN). DPN is an important risk factor for the development of foot ulceration, one&#xD;
      of the most common causes for hospital admissions and lower-limb amputations among diabetic&#xD;
      patients. However, to date there are no medications currently approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration to treat DPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research project is to assess the effectiveness of a non-invasive, patented&#xD;
      peristaltic pulse pneumatic compression device (the NormaTec PCD) in a home treatment program&#xD;
      to improve the symptoms of DPN (e.g. numbness, pain, and tingling in the legs) and the&#xD;
      underlying functioning of the nerves in the legs (as determined by sensory perception&#xD;
      assessments and Nerve Conduction Studies testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective, randomized, double-blind study, subjects will be randomly placed in one&#xD;
      of two groups: a control group using a sham NormaTec PCD (&quot;placebo&quot;); and an experimental&#xD;
      group using a NormaTec PCD.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A1C â‰¤ 11%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal peroneal motor nerve conduction study where CMAP amplitude is less than 4 mV&#xD;
             bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refuses consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unlikely to be compliant with the research protocol as judged by the clinical&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neuropathy documented to be caused by something other than diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medication for neuropathic pain initiated within the previous 3 months (to avoid&#xD;
             confounding the results of the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medication for glucose control changed within the previous 3 months (to avoid&#xD;
             confounding the results of the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented DVT within the previous 3 months (since an acute DVT is a contraindication&#xD;
             for Pneumatic Medicine treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant hepatic disease as judged by the clinical investigator (that might cause&#xD;
             neuropathy unrelated to diabetes)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented cancer treatment within the past 5 years (that might cause neuropathy&#xD;
             unrelated to diabetes)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of exposure to neurotoxins or heavy metals (that might cause neuropathy&#xD;
             unrelated to diabetes)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented alcohol or drug abuse (that might cause neuropathy unrelated to diabetes)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented major psychiatric disorder (that could contribute to non-adherence to the&#xD;
             protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a major lower extremity amputation (since unable to perform bilateral&#xD;
             distal sensory perception testing of the feet and NCS on the peroneal motor nerve)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant peripheral arterial disease defined as an ankle-brachial index (&quot;ABI&quot;) &lt;&#xD;
             0.6 (to avoid critical limb ischemia and thus the high likelihood of the patient&#xD;
             requiring a major amputation in the near future with drop out from the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe lower extremity edema as judged by the clinical investigator (in order to not&#xD;
             confound the results)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  End stage DPN where the peroneal motor nerve conduction results of both legs show an&#xD;
             Amplitude = 0 mV&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently participating in another clinical trial&#xD;
