  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label Phase II study to determine the rate of improvement in response of&#xD;
      patients with previously treated multiple myeloma to imetelstat alone or in combination with&#xD;
      lenalidomide maintenance therapy. This study will include multiple myeloma patients who&#xD;
      either have achieved disease stabilization or who have achieved at least a partial response&#xD;
      (PR) but failed to achieve a complete response (CR) after cytoreductive therapy for multiple&#xD;
      myeloma; ie, have detectable but non-progressing disease and will most likely relapse.&#xD;

    <description>The safety and tolerability of imetelstat will be assessed by the incidence, nature, relatedness and severity of adverse events, laboratory abnormalities and vital signs.&#xD;
Patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias (other than lyphophenia and/or leukopenia alon) will receive addiontal safety monitoring for reversibility.</description>

&#xD;
        Willing and able to sign an informed consent Male or female, 18 years or older Confirmed&#xD;
        diagnosis of multiple myeloma (secretory disease) by International Myeloma Working Group&#xD;
        Diagnostic Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must meet one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        o Previously treated patients with multiple myeloma who achieved at least stable disease&#xD;
        but who have failed to achieve a complete response (CR) after a minimum of one&#xD;
        cytoreductive therapy for multiple myeloma and have detectable but non-progressing disease.&#xD;
        Patients must have received at least one proteasome inhibitor (eg, bortezomib) or one&#xD;
        immunomodulatory agent (eg, thalidomide or lenalidomide) or both.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients receiving lenalidomide as maintenance therapy may continue to receive this therapy&#xD;
        provided that the patient has been on this maintenance therapy for a minimum of 3 months&#xD;
        and has evidence of disease stabilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Disease stabilization will be defined as an M protein that varies ≤ 25% over the three&#xD;
        measurements or remains under 0.5 g/dL whichever is smaller.&#xD;

        administration, other than low dose aspirin prophylaxis therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Full dose anticoagulation. Prophylactic low dose administration for management of IV access&#xD;
