  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether taurolidine with heparin locking solution&#xD;
      prevents recurrence of central venous catheter related blood stream infections in&#xD;
      haemodialysis patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infections related to long-term haemodialysis catheters are associated with significant&#xD;
      morbidity. A high proportion of those people initially treated with antibiotics to clear a&#xD;
      catheter infection develop a second infection within six months, necessitating the removal&#xD;
      and replacement of the dialysis catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the efficacy of an antimicrobial catheter locking solution called&#xD;
      taurolidine with heparin in preventing a second infection within six months of a significant&#xD;
      infection. This solution will be compared with the solution used currently (heparin) which is&#xD;
      left inside the catheter between dialysis sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinical study given that antimicrobial catheter locks are thought to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of blood stream infections and the ultimate need for catheter change. However, there is&#xD;
      concern that the absence of an anticoagulant in the lock solution increases the risk of&#xD;
      catheter thrombosis, again requiring a change of catheter but for a separate reason. It is&#xD;
      unclear therefore whether a solution containing both taurolidine (an antimicrobial) and&#xD;
      heparin (an anticoagulant) will increase catheter survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will help guide the appropriate suse of locking solutions in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
