  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder with prominent&#xD;
      reciprocal social and communication impairment and restricted repetitive behavior or&#xD;
      interest. ASD is a highly heritable disease with tremendous impact on individuals, families,&#xD;
      and society. In addition to the interview instruments, self-administered rating scales are&#xD;
      commonly used in screening, assessment of symptoms' change, and evaluation of intervention&#xD;
      effects. The Social Responsiveness Scale, the Childhood Asperger's Syndrome Test, and the&#xD;
      Autism Spectrum Quotient are internationally widely used rating scales measuring autistic&#xD;
      traits in both clinical and community samples in western counties. Establishment of&#xD;
      internationally-recognized reliable and valid instruments is not only useful for clinical&#xD;
      screening, but also helpful in future functional outcomes, neurocognitive, genetic and brain&#xD;
      imaging studies.&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify the factor structures and norms of the SRS, CAST, and AQ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the concurrent validity of the SRS, CAST, and AQ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the discriminative validity of the three scales by testing the difference of&#xD;
           total scores and subscales scores of the SRS, CAST, and AQ between the ASD,&#xD;
           attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and control groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To correlate the autistic characteristics between parents and children and compare the&#xD;
           magnitude of correlations of autistic traits across the 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional questionnaire survey in school-based and clinic-based samples. The&#xD;
      participants include (1) ASD group: 200 cases with DSM-IV ASD; (2) ADHD group: 200 cases with&#xD;
      DSM-IV ADHD; (3) Normally developing control group: a school-based sample of around 1200&#xD;
      grade 1 to grade 8 students. 100 students randomly selected from school-based sample will be&#xD;
      reassessed at a 2-week interval for the test-retest reliability study. The teachers will&#xD;
      complete the SRS and SNAP-IV (for ADHD symptoms); parents will report on their children on&#xD;
      the SCQ, SRS, CAST, SNAP-IV, and CBCL, and report themselves on the SRS, AQ, and ASRI;&#xD;
      children will report on themselves using the SRS, AQ, SNAP-IV, and YSR. Parents of clinical&#xD;
      participants will be interviewed by the ADI-R or K-SADS-E to confirm their diagnosis of ASD&#xD;
      and ADHD, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that this study will reach the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish psychometric properties of the Chinese versions of SRS, CAST, and AQ for&#xD;
           future use in clinical, school, and research settings;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To obtain the preliminary information about the prevalence of ASD, and understand the&#xD;
           correlation of autistic traits in family;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To enhance the awareness of school teachers and counselors about ASD among students.&#xD;
