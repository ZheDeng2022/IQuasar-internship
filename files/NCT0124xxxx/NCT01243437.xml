  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plague is a severe, life-threatening disease. Plague occurs in focal locations worldwide, but&#xD;
      over 95% of human cases reported to WHO are by countries in Africa. The most common clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of human infection are bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic plague. Untreated&#xD;
      pneumonic or septicemic plague is fatal in over 90% of cases; untreated bubonic plague is&#xD;
      fatal in over 50% of cases. Delayed and ineffectual treatment is a main contributor to&#xD;
      elevated case fatality rates, which can be as high as 40%, and to the development of&#xD;
      pneumonic plague and plague outbreaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Streptomycin is considered the treatment of choice, and prompt administration can reduce&#xD;
      mortality to 5% or less. However, streptomycin may cause irreversible hearing loss and&#xD;
      vestibular damage, reversible renal damage, and it is contraindicated during pregnancy.&#xD;
      Tetracyclines, including doxycycline, are considered effective alternatives but they are&#xD;
      bacteriostatic and relatively contraindicated for use in children aged &lt; 8 years and pregnant&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ciprofloxacin is a relatively newer antimicrobial that is used extensively in clinical&#xD;
      practice because of its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, excellent tissue and&#xD;
      intracellular penetration, suitability for oral administration, and good overall&#xD;
      tolerability. In vitro and animal studies suggest equivalent or greater activity of&#xD;
      ciprofloxacin against Yersinia pestis when compared with streptomycin or tetracyclines.&#xD;
      However, the efficacy of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of human plague has never been&#xD;
      demonstrated, nor is it FDA approved for this indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2004, CDC has collaborated with the Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Uganda&#xD;
      Virus Research Institute (UVRI) to enhance surveillance, diagnosis, and ecological control of&#xD;
      plague in Arua and Nebbi Districts. Through these efforts, we have collected data on over&#xD;
      2,400 cases of clinically diagnosed plague occurring from 1999 through 2009. In 2008, UVRI&#xD;
      and CDC staff investigated 163 suspect plague cases: 57 (35%) had laboratory-confirmed plague&#xD;
      illness, of which 14 patients (25%) died.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because plague is a relatively rare disease that mainly affects people living in rural,&#xD;
      impoverished areas, it receives limited attention for research and development of affordable&#xD;
      and sustainable diagnostic and treatment options. However, because plague cannot be&#xD;
      eradicated, and because it causes high case fatality and has the potential for widespread&#xD;
      person to person transmission, continued research should not be neglected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this clinical trial is to conduct a randomized, open-labeled,&#xD;
      non-inferiority study comparing the safety and efficacy of ciprofloxacin to doxycycline, the&#xD;
      national treatment standard in Uganda for plague, in patients aged &gt; 8 years. The primary&#xD;
      outcome for this trial will be patient outcome 14 days from enrollment and initiation of&#xD;
      treatment. Patient outcome will be evaluated only for those patients with&#xD;
      laboratory-confirmed plague illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information gathered from this proposed study will help optimize management of naturally&#xD;
      occurring plague in humans in many countries of the world, including Uganda and the United&#xD;
      States, by providing clinicians with more choices for optimal antimicrobial treatment. This&#xD;
      is particularly true in resource limited rural regions such as Uganda where intravenous or&#xD;
      intramuscular injections are less available. Ciprofloxacin currently is being used in Uganda&#xD;
      and other plague endemic areas of the world for treatment of other infectious conditions,&#xD;
      including infectious diarrhea and lower respiratory infections. In Uganda, ciprofloxacin is&#xD;
      widely available in health facilities and local drug shops, and is affordable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plague is a life-threatening disease that requires immediate treatment with effective&#xD;
      antimicrobials. Drugs with demonstrated efficacy include streptomycin, doxycycline, and to a&#xD;
      lesser extent, gentamicin. Animal and in vitro studies suggest that fluoroquinolones,&#xD;
      including ciprofloxacin, may be effective agents for treatment of plague. However, with the&#xD;
      exception of a single case report, there are no published instances in which fluoroquinolones&#xD;
      have been used successfully to treat plague in humans. There is a critical need to evaluate&#xD;
      newer antimicrobials that have been shown to be efficacious in vitro and in animal studies,&#xD;
      used extensively in the treatment of other illnesses in humans, work by a separate mechanism&#xD;
      than antimicrobials currently used for treatment, and are widely available and affordable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to conduct a randomized, open-labeled, non-inferiority study&#xD;
      comparing the safety and efficacy of ciprofloxacin to doxycycline, the national treatment&#xD;
      standard in Uganda. This study is designed to test the following hypothesis: the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of plague in humans is not inferior to&#xD;
      doxycycline. This study will result in a better understanding of the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      ciprofloxacin for the treatment of plague in humans. Information from this study will be used&#xD;
      to expand the experience and knowledge base for the treatment of plague in humans and guide&#xD;
      national and international treatment guidelines. Information from this study also will&#xD;
      possibly add to the antiquated list of effective antimicrobials used to treat plague and&#xD;
      possibly lead to a reduction in the overall morbidity and mortality caused by plague and its&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized clinical trial provides the best design to distinguish treatment effects from&#xD;
      other effects such as bias in allocation, observation, and measurement; spontaneous changes&#xD;
      in disease course or healing; and improvement from participating in a study (i.e., placebo&#xD;
      effect). An open-labeled design is being used because the opportunities for investigators or&#xD;
      patients to bias the outcome are limited (i.e., patient randomized after enrollment and&#xD;
      mortality is objective outcome) and a double blind design would greatly increase the&#xD;
      complexity and cost of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for this trial will be patient outcome 14 days from enrollment and&#xD;
      initiation of treatment, which includes outcomes of patient recovery without complications,&#xD;
      recovery with complications, withdrawal, or death. Patient outcome will be evaluated only for&#xD;
      those patients with laboratory-confirmed plague illness. Time to defervesence and occurrence&#xD;
      of antimicrobial-associated adverse events will be evaluated as secondary outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with laboratory-confirmed plague illness and all enrolled patients, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When conducting a non-inferiority study, it is important to consider the appropriate&#xD;
      selection of a comparator treatment, non-inferiority margin (M), and analysis strategy. For&#xD;
      non-inferiority trials, it is critical to select a standard treatment that has proven to be&#xD;
      the best historically or been used in prior randomized clinical trials as the comparator&#xD;
      treatment. Of the possible options, doxycycline is most optimal choice for this trial because&#xD;
      it is the current treatment standard in Uganda (the country location of the proposed study)&#xD;
      and its treatment regimen and side effect profile are the similar to that of ciprofloxacin.&#xD;
      For this trial, the non-inferiority margin (M) is the acceptable difference between the&#xD;
      probability that ciprofloxacin cures plague as compared to the probability that doxycycline&#xD;
      cures plague. Because of the severity of illness and high case fatality rate for plague in&#xD;
      general, and the potential for pneumonic transmission with pneumonic plague, the choice of an&#xD;
      acceptable M should be no more than 10% with a most conservative choice of 2%. If we assume&#xD;
      an overall Type I error rate = 0.05, a power (power = 1 - Type II error rate) of 80%, πs =&#xD;
      0.90 and we choose M = 0.10, then the number of patients required for each study arm is well&#xD;
      over 1,000 (calculations not shown). From our previous experience with a similar trial (i.e.,&#xD;
      The safety and efficacy of gentamicin vs. streptomycin in the treatment of plague in humans,&#xD;
      CDC IRB #3700) and our current experience with surveillance data in Uganda, we anticipate&#xD;
      being able to enroll approximately 100-200 total patients per year. Therefore, we computed&#xD;
      the power using different values of M (0.02, 0.05, 0.10; where 0.02 is the most conservative&#xD;
      and 0.10 is the most forgiving but still within the accepted non-inferiority margin), to&#xD;
      represent a range of reported efficacy of the standards (table not shown). Using the table,&#xD;
      we would have approximately 61% power to detect non-inferiority of ciprofloxacin treatment&#xD;
      with a non-inferiority margin, M, = 0.10 if the true efficacy of the standard is = 90% and if&#xD;
      we were to enroll 148 patients total, for example.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will attempt to include all suspect cases of plague aged 8 years or older&#xD;
      identified through clinic-based surveillance. Most patients, including plague cases, are&#xD;
      treated at the &quot;level 3&quot; health centers, mainly due to a lack of motorized transport. Between&#xD;
      3 and 10 &quot;level 3&quot; clinics in Arua and Nebbi Districts, Uganda will be chosen to participate&#xD;
      in this study based on the reported number of cases of plague in the last 5 years and&#xD;
      logistic considerations. Only UMOH clinics will be considered for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;level 3&quot; clinics are staffed by 1-2 clinical officers and are very busy, seeing 50-150&#xD;
      patients each day. Because of the excess patient volume, the study collaborators will hire&#xD;
      and train one additional clinical officer for each collaborating clinic to work alongside the&#xD;
      UMOH clinical officer(s) stationed at the collaborating clinic so as not to impair normal&#xD;
      clinic function. The hired clinical officer will be trained on the clinical aspects of plague&#xD;
      and the study protocol, and will be responsible for evaluating suspect plague patients for&#xD;
      study enrollment, consenting patients, and providing patient treatment and monitoring per the&#xD;
      study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of suspected plague patients who consent and enroll in the study will follow&#xD;
      the national guidelines of the UMOH. The only adaptations are that, after receiving informed&#xD;
      consent, UMOH physicians will collect biologic samples and patients will be randomized and&#xD;
      receive ciprofloxacin or doxycycline. Of note, a urine pregnancy test will be conducted on&#xD;
      every female of child-bearing age at time of enrollment and randomization and antimicrobial&#xD;
      treatment will not be initiated unless the results are negative. Based on our experience&#xD;
      conducting a similar trial in Madagascar, results from the urine pregnancy test are available&#xD;
      in less than 5 minutes so this should not cause any substantial time delays. Antimicrobial&#xD;
      treatment per UMOH national guidelines will be started immediately should there be instances&#xD;
      where there are delays in obtaining consent or collecting biologic samples, or if the&#xD;
      treating physician deems it necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suspect cases of plague will be eligible and will be asked to give consent for study&#xD;
      enrollment using the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. any person, including women and persons who are minorities, who;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. must be aged 8 years or older, and;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. must have had potential exposure to rodents and/or fleas or contact with a confirmed&#xD;
           plague case, and;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. must have a fever of at least 38ºC that developed rapidly, and have at least one of the&#xD;
           following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. One or more buboes, defined as a tender lymph node swelling &gt; 1cm in diameter, or;&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Clinical suspicion of pneumonic plague (e.g. prostration, cough, increased&#xD;
                respiratory rate, hemoptysis and/or purulent sputum), or&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Clinical suspicion of cutaneous plague (lesion)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Clinical suspicion of plague and epidemiologic link with other cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with suspected plague illness will be considered ineligible for the study and will&#xD;
      be excluded from study enrollment using the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Any women who is pregnant, or;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Any woman who is breast-feeding, or;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Any person aged &lt; 8 years of age, or;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Any patient with:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  signs of plague meningitis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  hypotension unresponsive to fluid therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  an illness severity score of &gt; 16 at time of enrollment (see below)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  known allergy to ciprofloxacin or doxycycline&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  taken tetracyclines, quinolones, gentamicin, streptomycin,&#xD;
                trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or chloramphenicol in the 24 hours preceding study&#xD;
                enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll suspected plague cases during the high transmission season between September&#xD;
      and April, 2010 through 2012. Based on enrollment for a similar study performed previously by&#xD;
      these investigators in Madagascar and Uganda (unpublished data, CDC) and given the existing&#xD;
      epidemiological data on plague in Uganda, we anticipate recruitment of between 125 and 200&#xD;
      suspected cases of plague per year, where approximately 40% to 50% of cases will have a&#xD;
      confirmed plague illness, with a 20-30% case-fatality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored daily. Participants may voluntarily withdraw from this study for&#xD;
      any reason at any time. The protocol and consent forms must be approved by all three&#xD;
      supervising IRBs (i.e., US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Uganda Virus Research&#xD;
      Institute Scientific Ethics Committee, and Uganda National Council for Science and&#xD;
      Technology) prior to starting the trial. A Data Safety and Monitoring Board will review all&#xD;
      serious adverse events and interim and final trial data to ensure patient safety and good&#xD;
      trial conduct.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspect cases of plague will be eligible and will be asked to give consent for study&#xD;
             enrollment using the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. any person, including women and persons who are minorities, who;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. must be aged 8 years or older, and;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. must have had potential exposure to rodents and/or fleas or contact with a&#xD;
                  confirmed plague case, and;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. must have a fever of at least 38ºC that developed rapidly, and have at least one&#xD;
                  of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One or more buboes, defined as a tender lymph node swelling &gt; 1cm in diameter, or;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical suspicion of pneumonic plague (e.g. prostration, cough, increased respiratory&#xD;
             rate, hemoptysis and/or purulent sputum), or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical suspicion of cutaneous plague (lesion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical suspicion of plague and epidemiologic link with other cases&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with suspected plague illness will be considered ineligible for the study and&#xD;
             will be excluded from study enrollment using the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any women who is pregnant, or;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any woman who is breast-feeding, or;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any person aged &lt; 8 years of age, or;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient with:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  signs of plague meningitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  hypotension unresponsive to fluid therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  an illness severity score of &gt; 16 at time of enrollment (see below)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  known allergy to ciprofloxacin or doxycycline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  taken tetracyclines, quinolones, gentamicin, streptomycin,&#xD;
             trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or chloramphenicol in the 24 hours preceding study&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or aged &lt; 8 years will be excluded because&#xD;
        doxycycline has a relative contraindication for use in these populations due to drug&#xD;
        deposition in calcifying areas of bones and teeth, enamel hypoplasia, and decreased linear&#xD;
        skeletal growth rate. [22, 23] Please see section 10.2 for additional background describing&#xD;
        the reasoning to exclude patients from these populations. Please see section 3.5 for the&#xD;
        specifics regarding the timing of urine pregnancy testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The illness severity score is a composite measure adapted from the APACHE-II and Glasgow&#xD;
        Coma scores that estimates the severity of a patient's illness at enrollment. Because most&#xD;
        clinic locations are remote with little or no laboratory capacity, the illness severity&#xD;
        score utilizes only non-biochemical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will not be tested for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and known or suspected&#xD;
        HIV-positive patients will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because this study will be conducted in a remote region of Uganda where no prisons are&#xD;
        located, the enrollment of prisoners is not applicable to our study. If for some unforeseen&#xD;
        reason a prisoner presents to a study clinic location for treatment of suspected plague,&#xD;
        the prisoner will be excluded from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All study resources will be available and treatment following the UMOH national plague&#xD;
        treatment guidelines will be offered to patients with suspected plague at the UMOH&#xD;
        collaborating clinics who are not eligible for enrollment or who declined to consent.&#xD;
