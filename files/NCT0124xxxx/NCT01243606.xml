      Anxiety disorders are common, chronic, costly, debilitating to quality of life, and are more&#xD;
      prevalent than any other class of disorders in every country in the world where surveys have&#xD;
      been taken. Deepening understanding of the nature of anxiety and related emotional disorders&#xD;
      during the last decade has revealed that commonalities in etiology and latent structure among&#xD;
      these disorders supersedes differences. At the same time, examination of extant single&#xD;
      diagnosis psychological treatment protocols (SDPs) for these disorders underscores&#xD;
      mechanistic similarities. These findings suggested the possibility of distilling a set of&#xD;
      psychological procedures that would comprise an innovative Unified Protocol for&#xD;
      Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP), and this protocol has now been&#xD;
      developed. If efficacious, the UP may represent a more efficient and possibly more effective&#xD;
      strategy which would render treatment implications of comorbidity, not otherwise specified&#xD;
      (NOS) and subdefinitional threshold anxiety disorder conditions moot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators now propose an evaluation of the efficacy of the UP in a group of patients&#xD;
      with heterogeneous anxiety disorders by way of rigorous comparisons to existing evidence&#xD;
      based SDPs benchmarked against a wait list control condition, using both statistical&#xD;
      equivalence and superiority analyses. Additional aims include determining the durability of&#xD;
      the UP relative to comparison conditions after treatment discontinuation, and ascertaining&#xD;
      the differential impact of treatments on disorder specific symptoms vs. higher-order&#xD;
      temperamental variables. Further analyses will indicate if changes in these higher order&#xD;
      temperamental variables mediate long-term outcome as preliminary data suggests, and if this&#xD;
      mechanism of action differs among treatments.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate efficacy of the recently developed Unified&#xD;
      Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP). This protocol takes&#xD;
      advantage of recent advances in our understanding of the nature of anxiety disorders, as well&#xD;
      as emerging knowledge of the process of regulation and change in anxious behavior, in order&#xD;
      to distill and refine basic principles of successful psychological treatments for anxiety&#xD;
      disorders. It is expected that this approach will simplify training and dissemination,&#xD;
      provide better coverage for comorbid conditions, cover &quot;not otherwise specified&quot; (NOS) and&#xD;
      sub-definitional threshold presentations, possibly improve efficacy particularly in the long&#xD;
      term, and perhaps also shed further light on the nature of anxiety disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A heterogeneous sample of 250 patients meeting diagnostic criteria for at least one of four&#xD;
      anxiety disorders: Social Phobia (SAD), Panic Disorder with or without Agoraphobia (PD/A),&#xD;
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) will be randomized&#xD;
      to one of three treatment cells: (1) the Unified Protocol (UP); (2) a single diagnosis&#xD;
      psychological treatment protocol (SDP); or (3) Wait List (WL). A minimum of 50 patients from&#xD;
      each of the 4 principal diagnostic categories will be included in the randomization to ensure&#xD;
      adequate representation of each anxiety disorder. The study will consist of two phases: (1) a&#xD;
      12 or 16 week acute treatment phase (or 16 week WL) and (2) a 12-month follow-up phase,&#xD;
      during which active treatments will be discontinued and patients will be followed to assess&#xD;
      the long-term effects of treatment (outcome measures are discussed below). Patients&#xD;
      randomized to the WL condition will not enter the post-treatment period. Rather, they will be&#xD;
      immediately assigned to their choice of either UP or SDP treatment at the end of the sixteen&#xD;
      week waiting period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All assessment and treatment procedures will be conducted at the Center for Anxiety and&#xD;
      Related Disorders (CARD) at Boston University, which is one of the largest research clinics&#xD;
      devoted to anxiety and related emotional disorders in the world. Total duration for&#xD;
      participation in the study will not exceed 18 months total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major aims of this proposal are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate the efficacy of the UP applied to a group of patients with heterogeneous&#xD;
      anxiety disorders as compared to a group receiving existing evidence-based single diagnosis&#xD;
      treatment protocols (SDPs) benchmarked against a wait list control condition (WL) to&#xD;
      determine the treatment responsiveness of the sample on common measures of outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate the efficacy of both the UP and SDPs relative to a benchmark WL condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Determine long-term efficacy of UP relative to SDPs over a 1-year period following&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Examine the relative effects of each active treatment approach (UP &amp; SDPs) on comorbid&#xD;
      anxiety and depressive disorder severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 5: Ascertain the relative effects of each active treatment on higher-order temperamental&#xD;
      indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 6: Determine if change in higher order temperamental variables mediates long term&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, every 4 weeks during a 16 week treatment or waitlist period, 6-month follow-up, 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The ADIS is a semi-structured diagnostic interview designed to establish reliable DSM anxiety, mood, somatoform and substance use disorders. For each current diagnosis, interviewers assigned a 0-8 clinical severity rating (CSR) that indicates their judgment of the degree of distress and impairment associated with the disorder (0=none to 8=very severely disturbing/disabling). The information derived from the interview using the ADIS allows clinicians to determine differential diagnoses and gain a clear understanding of the level and severity of each diagnosis.</description>

    <description>These widely used clinician-rated instruments assess global severity and improvement from pre-treatment baseline on 7-point scales. The CGI-S and CGI-I will be used to define clinical response.</description>

    <description>The SIGH-A and SIGH-D were developed to create a structured format for administering the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS; Hamilton, 1959) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD; Hamilton, 1960).
