  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate and compare the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of 2&#xD;
      sprinkle capsule formulations of rabeprazole sodium when administered without food to healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of 1 formulation of rabeprazole sodium will be&#xD;
      evaluated when administered with food to healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (the volunteer will know the&#xD;
      treatment/drug they are taking), single-dose study of 2 formulations of rabeprazole sodium in&#xD;
      healthy adult volunteers. Rabeprazole sodium is a drug used to treat patients with&#xD;
      Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), a condition where the esophagus (tube from throat to&#xD;
      stomach) becomes irritated or inflamed as a result of acid that backs up into the esophagus&#xD;
      from the stomach. All volunteers will receive 3 doses of study drug; each dose of study drug&#xD;
      will be separated by at least 7 days. Blood samples will be collected from volunteers during&#xD;
      the study to measure the concentration of study drug. Approximately 78 healthy volunteers&#xD;
      will be enrolled and will participate in the study for a total of approximately 39 days.&#xD;
      During the study, the healthy volunteer will make a total of approximately 4 visits to the&#xD;
      study center. The 4 visits will include an initial screening visit and 3 visits to receive&#xD;
      study drug. Volunteers will be required to stay at the study center for at least 12 hours&#xD;
      before study drug administration and up to approximately 24 hours after study drug&#xD;
      administration to have study procedures performed and blood samples collected to measure the&#xD;
      concentrations of rabeprazole and its thioether metabolite (a substance produced when&#xD;
      rabeprazole is metabolized in the body) in the plasma (ie, the clear liquid portion of&#xD;
      blood). Volunteers will be monitored for safety throughout the study. Healthy volunteers will&#xD;
      receive a single dose of study drug in 3 treatment periods. In each treatment period, healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will receive one 10 mg capsule of rabeprazole sodium or two 5 mg capsules of&#xD;
      rabeprazole sodium. The contents of study drug capsules will be sprinkled on 1 tablespoon of&#xD;
      applesauce and administered orally (by mouth) to healthy volunteers in the morning who have&#xD;
      fasted (not eaten) overnight and to those who have eaten a standardized breakfast.&#xD;
