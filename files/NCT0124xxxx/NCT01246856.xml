  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with breastcancer in the past, were treated with TAC. These last years, there&#xD;
      is more and more focus on the effects of chemotherapy, particularly in children treated with&#xD;
      this. One of these effects is damage to the heart muscle, which ultimately might affect the&#xD;
      pump-function of the heart . In adults, the effect of treatment with TAC on the heart, has&#xD;
      not been previously investigated. The possibility exists that the adverse reactions in&#xD;
      children are found in adults also could occur. Therefore we have initiated this trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the lack of data on the incidence of subclinical cardiotoxicity after treatment with&#xD;
      TAC we want to assess whether subclinical cardiovascular damage is present in adult patients&#xD;
      with breast cancer who have completed treatment with (neo)adjuvant TAC one year previously,&#xD;
      using MIBG (meta-iodobenzylguanidine) scintigraphy, novel echocardiographic techniques and&#xD;
      blood biomarkers. Following the study by Lipshultz et al. we expect to find at least in 25%&#xD;
      of the patients signs of subclinical cardiovascular damage with at least one of the three&#xD;
      techniques.(11) If at least 10% is observed we will conclude that it is useful to further&#xD;
      pursue the use of these techniques for the detection of subclinical cardiotoxicity in a next&#xD;
      clinical study which will be powered to assess the predictive value of these techniques for&#xD;
      the development of clinical heart failure. If a lower percentage is observed we will conclude&#xD;
      that it is not useful to further pursue the use of these techniques for the detection of&#xD;
      subclinical cardiotoxicity.&#xD;
