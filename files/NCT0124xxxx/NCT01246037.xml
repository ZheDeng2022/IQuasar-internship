      The main question of this study is: 'Is selective beta-blocker treatment safe and effective&#xD;
      in reducing sympathetic overdrive, thereby improving RV function and remodeling in patients&#xD;
      with iPAH?'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the determination of RVEF, the investigators will explore how beta-blocker&#xD;
      therapy affects sympathetic overdrive, remodeling of the RV, single beat elastance, exercise&#xD;
      capacity and mechanical efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 iPAH patients will be randomized to either Bisoprolol- or placebo-treatment in a&#xD;
      double-blinded fashion. A cross-over trial design will be used to increase the power of the&#xD;
      study and to assess long-term effects of Bisoprolol-treatment and -withdrawal. The medication&#xD;
      will be given in an escalating dose regimen (as described in the 'farmacotherapeutisch&#xD;
      kompas', www.fk.cvz.nl) and treatment will be monitored along the guidelines of the American&#xD;
      Heart Association.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study aimed to provide a proof of concept of the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      beta-blocker treatment in PAH-associated right ventricular failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol of the proposed double blinded cross over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reasons for not choosing an initial open phase 1 study, but to start directly with a&#xD;
      placebo controlled study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Although the drug is considered contraindicated in the studied patient population, it is&#xD;
           very common for PAH patients to receive beta-blocker therapy in an uncontrolled way;&#xD;
           without reports of serious side effects until now&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dose titration in the study will be performed on the basis of side-effects and at this&#xD;
           moment the investigators cannot predict the optimal dose which is both safe and&#xD;
           efficacious. Therefore, safety assessment can only be performed in combination with the&#xD;
           assessment of pharmaceutical effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, 30 idiopathic PAH patients (NYHA II-III) will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either the placebo group or beta-blocker therapy. For the randomization and study&#xD;
      blinding the investigators will use a VUMC computer based procedure in close collaboration&#xD;
      with the VUMC pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first 4 months of study, the dose of the drug will be gradually increased; the&#xD;
      titration scheme is based on the 'farmacotherapeutisch kompas' (described below) and&#xD;
      monitored according to the ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines. Up titration will be performed under the&#xD;
      responsibilities of an experienced heart failure cardiologist and pulmonologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENTS Time points 1, 3 and 5 (6 months periods): this includes a complete assessment&#xD;
      of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical assessment: physical examination, NYHA class, ECG, routine lab including&#xD;
           NT-proBNP and urine tests for proteinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging of right ventricular function: the primary measure of this study will be right&#xD;
           ventricular ejection fraction measured by means of MRI. Additional MRI and&#xD;
           echocardiographic measurements will be performed. (the complete study protocols are&#xD;
           added as supplements).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Right Heart Catheterization (performed under local anesthesia): Measurements of&#xD;
           pressures in the pulmonary artery, right ventricle and right atrium, while patients are&#xD;
           breathing room air and at end-expiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise capacity by means of a maximal incremental cycle testing (CardioPulmonary&#xD;
           Exercise Test) to measure maximal work load, VO2 max, anaerobic threshold, heart rate&#xD;
           response, oxygen pulse and ventilatory efficiency. And by means of 6 minute walking&#xD;
           distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart Rate Variability (HRV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nuclear scanning: a comprised PET protocol will be performed to measure 11C-acetaat,&#xD;
           oxygen-15-labeled water (H215O) and ¹¹C-HED uptake in the right ventricle. A summary of&#xD;
           the protocol is added as a supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UP-TITRATION PHASE (first 4 months; either on placebo or Bisoprolol): patients will be&#xD;
      monitored every second week under supervision of an experienced pulmonologist, specialized in&#xD;
      PAH, and a cardiologist, specialized in chronic heart failure during a visit to the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic. If no contra-indications are found the dose will be increased to the next&#xD;
      step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will start with a dosage of 1,25 mg Bisoprolol once daily. Every two weeks&#xD;
      dosage is increased by 1,25 mg, until maximum dosage of 10 mg once a day is reached, or as&#xD;
      high as tolerated by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing the dosage will be stopped, or if needed the dosage will be reduced, in case of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  systolic systemic pressure &lt; 90 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical progression in heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinically relevant bradycardia or &lt;60b/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  progression of complaints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  drop in 6 minute walk distance &gt; 15% The titration procedure for the placebo will be the&#xD;
           same as for titration of Bisoprolol. The dosage of the medication will be altered for&#xD;
           maximal four months and after this the patients will use a stable dose for the rest of&#xD;
           the six month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every clinical visit will at least contain a clinical assessment, assessment of NYHA class, 6&#xD;
      minute walk distance, ECG and a Minnesota quality of life questionnaire. Every fourth week&#xD;
      NT-proBNP, kidney- and liver functions will be assessed. In addition, the patient will be&#xD;
      instructed to use a diary to record his/her symptoms and body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STABLE PHASE: It is expected that up to 4 months are required to reach an acceptable dose of&#xD;
      Bisoprolol. After this up-titration phase, the patient will be followed closely during the&#xD;
      remaining part of the six month period, using a stable medication dose. The monitoring&#xD;
      includes continuation of the diary, monthly visits to the outpatient clinic including the&#xD;
      measurements as described in the up-titration phase and a telephone call every 4 weeks in&#xD;
      between office visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CROSS OVER After six months new measurements will be done. Thereafter the medication will be&#xD;
      tapered down in a two week period and than finally stopped. This will be done to prevent the&#xD;
      patients for possible side effects (rebound tachycardia) of stopping their medication. The&#xD;
      same tapering down procedure will be performed after the third set of measurements.&#xD;
