      In the last years, important advances have been done in the treatment and prevention of&#xD;
      esophageal variceal bleeding. Experts agree that the combination of pharmacological and&#xD;
      endoscopic therapy should be the first line therapy in the acute bleeding episode; whereas&#xD;
      TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) is considered a rescue therapy.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, some patients would require different therapies to act as a &quot;bridge&quot; until&#xD;
      definitive therapy can be instituted. Balloon tamponade (using the Sengstaken tube)&#xD;
      represents, up to now, the most widely used temporary &quot;bridge&quot; to TIPS. However, balloon&#xD;
      tamponade is associated with a high incidence of serious adverse events. Recently, the use of&#xD;
      self-expanding metal stents have been introduced in the treatment of acute variceal bleeding&#xD;
      showing a very high hemostatic efficacy with no adverse events. The present study is directed&#xD;
      to compare the efficacy free of adverse events and mortality of self-expanding metal stents&#xD;
      vs balloon tamponade in patients with variceal bleeding refractory to medical and endoscopic&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND Acute variceal bleeding (AVB) carries a 20% death rate during the acute episode&#xD;
      and nearly 50% related-mortality during the first year after the episode. (1). Prognostic&#xD;
      factors of AVB include: the severity of bleeding, the degree of liver failure and the&#xD;
      development of complications other than bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, AVB therapy must: achieve primary hemostasis and prevent and treat both&#xD;
      hypovolemia and related complications. After hemodynamic stabilization, upper endoscopy&#xD;
      should be done to confirm the diagnosis and start specific therapy, that is to say: 1/&#xD;
      vasoactive drugs (terlipressin or somatostatin); and 2/ endoscopic therapy (variceal banding&#xD;
      ligation). These two combined therapies achieve control of AVB in 80% of the cases (2).&#xD;
      Nevertheless, in the remaining 20%, the AVB is not controlled requiring balloon-tamponade as&#xD;
      a bridge to definitive hemostatic therapies such as TIPS or surgical shunts(3). The&#xD;
      Sengstaken-Blakemore tube is the most widely used balloon tamponade. In experienced hands it&#xD;
      provides bleeding control rates up to 90%. It should only be used by skilled staff in&#xD;
      intensive care facilities because fatal complications may arise in more than 20% of cases.&#xD;
      The main complications are: aspiration pneumonia, esophageal rupture, asphyxia due to balloon&#xD;
      migration, esophageal ulcers, tongue or nose or lips necrosis, arrythmia and chest pain.&#xD;
      These complications are time-related, therefore, balloon tamponade never must remain inflated&#xD;
      more than 24h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a self-expandable esophageal stent has been introduced as an alternative to&#xD;
      esophageal balloon tamponade in AVB (4). Twenty patients with AVB not controlled with&#xD;
      combined endoscopic and pharmacological therapy were retrospectively included in the study.&#xD;
      The patients received a self-expandable metal esophageal stent (SX-Ella-Danis, Czesc&#xD;
      Republic). The stent was placed without complications in all cases achieving a 100% success&#xD;
      in the control of AVB. Two to 14 days after, the stents were retired. The authors observed no&#xD;
      case of severe stent-related complications and no rebleeding episodes (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data suggest that self-expandable esophageal stent could represent a safe and effective&#xD;
      option to temporary treat patients with AVB refractory to medical and endoscopic therapy. In&#xD;
      addition, and theoretically, esophageal stent could be associated with a lower incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events than balloon tamponade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial hypothesis are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of esophageal stents in AVB refractory to medical and endoscopic therapy is&#xD;
           associated with a higher efficacy in absence of adverse events than balloon tamponade&#xD;
           using the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The two hemostatic methods are correctly positioned in more than 90-95% of the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's tolerability (absence of chest pain, dysphagia or food intolerance) increases&#xD;
           with the use of esophageal stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The applicability of definitive hemostatic therapy, such as TIPS or combined&#xD;
           pharmacological and endoscopic eradicative therapy or surgical shunts, is higher with&#xD;
           the use of esophageal stents that with that of the Sengstaken tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint combines absence of bleeding + absence of severe adverse events probably&#xD;
      related to the study devices + survival during the first 15 days after inclusion in the study&#xD;
      or at hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients to compare are those with liver cirrhosis and AVB not controlled with combined&#xD;
      pharmacological and endoscopic therapy (see definitions). Those patients will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive a self-expandable esophageal stent (SX-Ella-Danis) or balloon tamponade with a&#xD;
      Sengstaken-Blakemore tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of bleeding at day 15th, 42nd and at 6 months from inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival at day 15th, 42nd and at 6 months from inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transfusional requirements (packed red cells, platelets and fresh frozen plasma).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individual adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analgesia and sedation requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Applicability of definitive hemostatic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of hospital resources (TIPS, derivative surgery or additional endoscopic therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies used to calculate the sample size are shown as references 7 to 22. None of these&#xD;
      studies has considered a combined end-point such as in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As shown, the incidence of adverse events varied over time, the highest incidence being&#xD;
      observed in the most recent studies. In summary, we have considered that 55% of the patients&#xD;
      receiving esophageal balloon tamponade will achieve our primary end-point. To increase this&#xD;
      figure to 90% in the group receiving esophageal prothesis, with an 0.05 alpha error and a&#xD;
      0.20 beta error, the study must include 46 patients (23 per arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. The data will be compared by&#xD;
      using Student t test or Chi-squared as needed. Probability and survival curves will be&#xD;
      constructed by using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the Mantel-Cox test. Logistic&#xD;
      regression will be used to identify independent predictors of survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis was planned after the inclusion of 28 patients (60% of the overall size).&#xD;
      The study will be finished if the interim analysis shows significant statistical differences&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.02) or futility (lack of differences).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study will include all patients with cirrhosis admitted to the hospital because an&#xD;
        acute esophageal variceal bleeding defined according to Baveno II criteria (5) and who will&#xD;
        achieve the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to control bleeding despite pharmacological (somatostatin 3 or 6 mg/12h iv or&#xD;
             terlipressin, 2mg/4h iv) AND endoscopic therapy (esophageal banding ligation&#xD;
             preferably or sclerotherapy). Failure to control bleeding was defined, according to&#xD;
             Baveno IV criteria (6), as evidence of continuous digestive bleeding and any of the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hematemesis (or naso-gastric aspirate &gt; 100 ml of fresh blood) &gt; 2h after the&#xD;
                  start of combined pharmacological and endoscopic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Decrease in hemoglobin values &gt; 3g vs previous values (without blood&#xD;
                  transfusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Massive bleeding. Acute variceal bleeding uncontrolled despite pharmacological therapy&#xD;
             started at any moment, with no need of previous endoscopic therapy. Uncontrolled&#xD;
             bleeding is defined as an upper digestive bleeding in which no hemodynamic stability&#xD;
