  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care therapy for DLBCL in the relapsed setting is RICE with the plan for the&#xD;
      patient to proceed to transplant. This protocol will add Revlimid to the first 7 days of the&#xD;
      RICE therapy and again after transplant as maintenance. To improve over all outcome and&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis is that combining lenalidomide with standard of care (RICE) may increase overall&#xD;
      response rate thus increasing the number of patients able to proceed with autologous stem&#xD;
      cell transplant. This in turn may translate into improved overall survival and progression&#xD;
      free survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-Stage, phase I/II, single-arm, open-label study. The first and second stage of&#xD;
      the study will assess the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide, rituximab, Ifosfamide,&#xD;
      etoposide, and carboplatin (RICER) for the treatment of DLBCL patients in first relapse. The&#xD;
      third stage of the study will assess the safety and efficacy of post-ASCT lenalidomide&#xD;
      maintenance in patients with DLBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stage I of the study, escalating doses of lenalidomide (10, 15, 20, and 25 mg daily x 7&#xD;
      days on Days 1-7) along with RICE therapy will be given to cohorts of subjects in a standard&#xD;
      3+3 design (see section 5.4.2 for dose escalation schema) until the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) has been determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stage II, all subjects will be given RICE plus the MTD of lenalidomide. The starting dose&#xD;
      of lenalidomide in Stage II will be modified for reduced renal function as outlined in&#xD;
      Section 5.4.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both stage I and stage II, subjects who have stable disease or progression of disease&#xD;
      after 2 cycles of RICER will be taken off study. Subjects who achieve &gt; PR to 2 cycles of&#xD;
      RICER will receive a third cycle followed by stem cell collection and ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle is 14 days. Delays in initiating a new cycle are allowed up to 14 days for Stages&#xD;
      I and II. The planned number of cycles is 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the second cycle, restaging with PET and CT scans is performed. Patients with&#xD;
      progressive disease are removed from the study, chemosensitive patients (CR/Cru and PR)&#xD;
      proceed with third cycle of RICER. Stem cell collection will be completed within 10-14 days&#xD;
      after third cycle of RICER. HDCMT-autoSCT will be performed after patient recovers from stem&#xD;
      cell collection toxicities. HDCMT (high dose chemotherapy) followed by autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplant involves administration of chemotherapy with BEAM (BCNU, Etoposide, Ara-C,&#xD;
      Melphalan) followed by infusion of autologous stem cells. Involved-field radiation to the&#xD;
      sites of bulky disease will be allowed prior to HDCMT-SCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage III, after recovery from aSCT, but not to exceed 90 days all eligible subjects will&#xD;
      receive lenalidomide maintenance therapy (po daily on Days 1-21 q28 days) for up to 1 year.&#xD;
      Delays in initiating a new cycle up to 28 days are allowed in Stage III. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for progression- free survival and overall survival for up to 2 years. The starting&#xD;
      dose of lenalidomide maintenance treatment will be based on calculated creatinine clearance&#xD;
      within 28 days prior to the start of lenalidomide maintenance&#xD;
