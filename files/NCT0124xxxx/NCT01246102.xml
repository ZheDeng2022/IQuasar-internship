  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The experimental drug AT13387 has been shown to have some anticancer effects against tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking a protein that affects other proteins inside certain cancer cells, and&#xD;
      helps to prevent the cancer cells from reproducing and spreading. AT13387 has not been tested&#xD;
      in humans, and researchers are interested in investigating whether it can be used to treat&#xD;
      solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To investigate the safety and effectiveness of AT13387 in individuals with solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have solid tumors that have not responded to&#xD;
      standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, as well&#xD;
           as blood tests and tumor imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AT13387 will be given in 28-day cycles of treatment. Participants will receive AT13387&#xD;
           twice a week (2 days in a row) for the first 3 weeks of the cycle, followed by a fourth&#xD;
           week without the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have regular blood and urine samples, imaging studies, eye&#xD;
           examinations, and tumor biopsies to monitor the effects of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will continue treatment with AT13387 unless serious side effects develop or&#xD;
           the tumor stops responding to treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AT13387 is a synthetic Hsp90 inhibitor that has demonstrated improved characteristics&#xD;
           over other Hsp90 inhibitors. AT13387 has a long tumor retention half-life and prolonged&#xD;
           inhibitory effect on its known oncogenic client proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AT13387 has demonstrated activity against multiple cancer cell lines and tumor&#xD;
           xenografts in pre-clinical models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the safety and tolerability of AT13387 administered on a QDx2 every week, 3 weeks&#xD;
           out of 4 scheduled, in adults with refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AT13387 administered on a QDx2 every week,&#xD;
           3 weeks out of 4 schedule, in adults with refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AT13387 administered on a QDx2 every week, 3&#xD;
           weeks out of 4 schedule, in adults with refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess pharmacodynamic (PD) markers of Hsp90 inhibition and modulation of Hsp90 client&#xD;
           proteins by AT13387 in tumor tissue, serum, and PBMCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Study participants must have histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy that has&#xD;
      progressed or recurred after at least one line of chemotherapy, or for which no standard&#xD;
      treatment option exists. Participants enrolling in the expansion phase must have disease&#xD;
      amenable to biopsy with willingness to undergo pre- and post-treatment biopsies (Remove the&#xD;
      HER 2 archival tissue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will follow an accelerated titration design 2B with initial dose levels&#xD;
           increased in 100% increments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The accelerated phase ends when one patient experiences a dose-limiting toxicity or two&#xD;
           patients experience Grade 2 drug-related toxicity during the first cycle; when dose&#xD;
           level 3 is reached; or at first instance of Grade 2 ocular toxicity in any cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AT13387 will be administered intravenously, over 1 hour, on 2 consecutive days, 3 out of&#xD;
           4 weeks, every 28 days (i.e., on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of each 28-day cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PK and PD studies will be conducted in cycle 1 only. Once the MTD is established, 10&#xD;
           additional patients, will be entered at the MTD to further define toxicity and perform&#xD;
           PD studies at this dose; pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies will be mandatory for&#xD;
           these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scans will be performed at baseline and every 2 cycles for restaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 37 patients may be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study participants will be offered optional participation in an ongoing NCI imaging&#xD;
           study at baseline with a repeat scan following the last dose of AT13387 in cycle 1.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically documented (confirmed at the Laboratory of&#xD;
             Pathology, NCI) solid tumor malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable, for which&#xD;
             standard curative measures do not exist, or have failed at least one line of standard&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have completed any chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or biologic therapy&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 4 weeks prior to entering the study (6 weeks for nitrosoureas&#xD;
             or mitomycin C).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any prior administration of a study&#xD;
        drug in an exploratory IND/Phase 0 study. Patients must have recovered to eligibility&#xD;
        levels from prior toxicity or adverse events. Patients receiving bisphosphonates for any&#xD;
        cancer are eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
             currently available on the use of AT13387 in patients &lt; 18 years of age, children are&#xD;
             excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to&#xD;
             2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal or adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/microL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/microL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine &lt;1.5 times ULN; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Measured creatinine greater than or equal to 60 mL/minute for patients with&#xD;
                  clearance creatinine levels greater than or equal to 1.5 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of AT13387 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and for 2 months after completion of study. Women&#xD;
             of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 72 hours of&#xD;
             enrollment in order to be eligible. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately. Because there is an unknown but potential risk to nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with AT13387, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with AT13387.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  During the expansion phase of the protocol, patients must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Disease amenable to biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Willingness to undergo pre- and post-treatment biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
