  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kala azar (KA) or visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is endemic in several districts of Bangladesh&#xD;
      with the highest incidence in Mymensingh, Pabna and Tangail districts. ICDDR,B is involved in&#xD;
      a project for improving the surveillance of KA in Trishal, Mymensingh since 2005. Improvement&#xD;
      of case detection is necessary for both surveillance purposes and better control. The aims of&#xD;
      this pilot study are to assess some newer techniques for diagnosis of KA using blood and&#xD;
      urine samples of suspected cases; and evaluate response to treatment with sodium&#xD;
      stibogluconate to which resistance has been reported in India, considered to be a part of the&#xD;
      same zone harboring the disease agent Leishmania donovani and transmitted by the same vector&#xD;
      Phlebotomas argentipes (sand-fly). No data is currently available on response to sodium&#xD;
      stibogluconate in KA patients in Bangladesh. Although a number of new drugs have been&#xD;
      evaluated in the treatment of KA in India and Kenya, no trial has so far been conducted in&#xD;
      Bangladesh. A team of researchers from GlaxoSmithKline (UK) had recently visited Bangladesh&#xD;
      to evaluate if it would be possible to conduct a Phase-III clinical trial with sitamaquine.&#xD;
      They interacted with scientists of ICDDR,B and expressed their interest to help develop&#xD;
      ICDDR,B's capacity in order to include Bangladesh as one of the sites for the planned,&#xD;
      multi-centre, Phase-III trial of sitamaquine; India and Nepal are two other possible sites&#xD;
      for the trial. The aims of the proposed study are to train physicians and laboratory&#xD;
      personnel in preparation for the future drug trial(s) on KA as well as to compare different&#xD;
      tests for its diagnosis that might improve case detection at the field level and used for&#xD;
      research purposes. The investigators will also examine in greater detail the different&#xD;
      Leishmania species circulating in the area of Mymensingh and whether treatment failure and&#xD;
      occurrence of Post Kala azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) is associated with certain species.&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To develop capacity to evaluate newer regimens for treatment of kala azar&#xD;
      in Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate novel diagnostic tests for kala azar including rK39 dipstick test in serum;&#xD;
           KATEX in urine; and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in blood and clinical samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate response to treatment with 28 injections of SAG using PCR in blood samples&#xD;
           and clinical samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To transfer the mini-exon PCR-RFLP technique to ICDDR,B and to characterize the most&#xD;
           prevalent Leishmania species in the area of Mymensingh and their response to standard&#xD;
           treatment with SAG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. We will also analyze whether certain genotypes are associated with the occurrence of&#xD;
           PKDL and whether the mini-exon PCR is a suitable marker for monitoring the intra and&#xD;
           interspecies genetic evolution of Leishmania species.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients for the proposed study were selected from three upazilla health complexes in&#xD;
      Mymensingh per discussion with the government agencies working in these areas. If necessary,&#xD;
      we would go for active surveillance to enroll required number of subjects for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 200 consecutive cases (age &gt;5 years) meeting the following diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
      KA were enrolled into the study: (i) fever for &gt;2 weeks; (ii) at least one of the the&#xD;
      following criteria- splenomegaly, darkening of the skin, and weight loss; and (iii) a&#xD;
      positive rK39 dipstick test. Exclusion criteria will include: (1) children under five years&#xD;
      of age, (2) pregnant women, and (3) patients who are suffering simultaneously from any other&#xD;
      serious illness which is unrelated to kala azar. Patients (or their parents/guardians in the&#xD;
      event of minors) meeting the above criteria, was explained about the risk of treatment with&#xD;
      SAG and the risk involved in splenic aspiration procedures by expert physicians. Informed&#xD;
      consent (verbal or written) was then obtained from the patients (or their parents/guardians&#xD;
      in the event of minors) before inclusion into the study. One hundred healthy individuals&#xD;
      living in the same area were enrolled as controls for evaluating PCR and other diagnostic&#xD;
      tests of KA. Our field workers visited houses in the community and collect blood samples from&#xD;
      the healthy volunteers with their informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures and assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Splenic aspiration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Splenic aspiration was performed in 200 consecutive patients who had been presented with&#xD;
      clinical features of KA with a positive rK39 dipstick test. Splenic aspiration was performed&#xD;
      for confirmation of diagnosis on study day 1, and then again on day 29 to assess cure from&#xD;
      the disease. Thus, when a subject was found to be positive by rK39 dipstick test, standard&#xD;
      pre-procedure tests for splenic aspiration e,g. hemoglobin estimation, bleeding time,&#xD;
      clotting time, and platelet counts, were performed. Splenic aspiration was performed only in&#xD;
      those who were not severely anemic (Hb ≥ 6 mg/dl), and had platelet counts of &gt;50,000/micro&#xD;
      liter of blood. Prothrombin time was also be checked before splenic aspiration and those with&#xD;
      a PT more than 4 seconds prolonged were not be eligible for the study. All necessary&#xD;
      treatment was provided in the event of hemorrhage following the procedure, including blood&#xD;
      transfusion. If necessary, the patients also be transported to Mymensingh Medical College&#xD;
      Hospital, for more specialized treatment and support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Bangladesh, intramuscular administration of sodium antimony gluconate (SAG; Albert David&#xD;
      Ltd., India), in a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight, with a maximum dose of 850 mg/day, for&#xD;
      twenty eight days is the current standard treatment for patients with KA. The pulse and&#xD;
      respiratory rates, blood pressures, and temperature were monitored at 12 hourly intervals&#xD;
      during this treatment period. EKG were performed if clinically indicated. The treatment was&#xD;
      stopped if signs of severe toxicity (cardiotoxicity, renal failure, etc) develop, and the&#xD;
      patient had been treated with standard dose of amphotericin B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalization: All patients under treatment was offered to stay at Community-based Medical&#xD;
      College Hospital for the entire period of treatment with SAG. The patients had been&#xD;
      hospitalized for treatment with amphotericin B in case of treatment failure or toxicity with&#xD;
      SAG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up: At the end of treatment, the patients was evaluated for cure by physical&#xD;
      examination and splenic aspiration. The subjects had been following for six months as shown&#xD;
      in Scheme-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic tests to be evaluated&#xD;
&#xD;
      rK39 dipstick test A finger-prick blood specimen was collected in capillary tubes for rK39&#xD;
      dipstick test. This method is rapid and time saving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parasitological diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Splenic aspirate was used for parasitological diagnosis. A slide of splenic aspirates was&#xD;
      prepared for Giemsa staining. Two lab technicians from ICDDR,B was trained on staining&#xD;
      techniques and reading of the slides. Randomly selected slides had been sent to reference&#xD;
      labs elsewhere for Quality Control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA of Leishmania donovani in the collected blood samples had been detected using the methods&#xD;
      described by Salotra et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection and DNA isolation: Collected blood specimen was transported to the&#xD;
      Parasitology Laboratory of ICDDR,B, and transferred to 4°C and processed generally on the&#xD;
      same day. DNA was extracted from 0.2 ml of blood using a QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCR amplification: DNA from cultured parasites (1 ng) and from clinical samples (100 ng) were&#xD;
      taken for amplification using the LdI primers described above. The reaction mixture (50 µl)&#xD;
      contained 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, a 200 µM concentration of each&#xD;
      deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 50 ng of each primer, and 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Gibco&#xD;
      BRL). Each reaction mixture was overlaid with mineral oil, and amplification was performed in&#xD;
      a thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer, Warrington, Great Britain) programmed for 40 cycles of&#xD;
      denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 45°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 2 min,&#xD;
      preceded by an initial denaturation of 2 min at 94°C. Final extension was for 3 min at 72°C.&#xD;
      Products was analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5&#xD;
      µg/ml) in TAE buffer (0.04 M Tris acetate, 0.001 M EDTA) and photographed under UV&#xD;
      illumination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mini-exon PCR-RFLP: The mini-exon PCR-RFLP had been developed by the Swiss Tropical Institute&#xD;
      (STI) (Marfurth et al. 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation and Outcome Variable(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of 200 cases and 100 controls is based on practical considerations for&#xD;
      meeting the primary objective of capacity development and the study is not formally powered&#xD;
      for hypothesis testing. The emphasis for investigating sensitivity and specificity of the new&#xD;
      diagnostic tests will be on presenting descriptive statistics and confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensitivity (proportion of correctly identified true positive results) and specificity&#xD;
      (proportion of correctly identified true negative results) was calculated for each diagnostic&#xD;
      test, and 95% confidence intervals for these proportions had been calculated using Wilsons&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The positive and negative predictive values was also be calculated using the method described&#xD;
      by Altman et al. The positive predictive value is the proportion of patients with a positive&#xD;
      result for the experimental diagnostic test who are correctly diagnosed by parasitological&#xD;
      examination. Similarly the negative predictive value is the proportion of patients with a&#xD;
      negative diagnostic test result who are correctly diagnosed by parasitological examination.&#xD;
      The 95% CI for the positive and the negative predictive values had been determined. These&#xD;
      parameters would allow the comparison of each diagnostic test with the 'gold standard'&#xD;
      parasitological examination.&#xD;
