    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given&#xD;
      together with cytarabine in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML). Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system&#xD;
      in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving lenalidomide together with cytarabine may&#xD;
      kill more cancer cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide following intermediate dose&#xD;
      ARA-C (cytarabine) in relapsed/refractory AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate immune reconstitution in patients in complete remission (CR) treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the efficacy of the regimen in the expanded group treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 6-26 and cytarabine intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      3 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks and then every 3&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
