  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the 2009-2010 immunization campaign against pandemic H1N1, some people reported having&#xD;
      allergic-like reactions (anaphylaxis(a shock-like reaction), hives, swelling, etc.). A&#xD;
      vaccine allergy may be more or less severe or intense. Patients may have skin reactions (rash&#xD;
      with or without itching), respiratory problems (cough, spasm of the airways), angioedema&#xD;
      (swelling) of various body parts (face, eyelids, throat etc.) and circulatory problems (low&#xD;
      blood pressure or shock). Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can sometimes be&#xD;
      fatal. Other people vaccinated against pandemic H1N1 had an oculo-respiratory syndrome.&#xD;
      Oculo-respiratory syndrome (ORS) is also a reaction to the influenza vaccine, which includes&#xD;
      symptoms such as bilateral conjunctivitis (red eyes) with swelling of the face or respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms (chest tightness, coughing, a sensation of throat closure, difficulty swallowing,&#xD;
      hoarseness, wheezing or difficulty breathing). The investigators know that ORS is not a true&#xD;
      allergic reaction. Because many signs and symptoms of ORS are similar to those observed&#xD;
      during an allergic reaction, it is often difficult to distinguish ORS from an allergic&#xD;
      reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare three groups of patients: those who had allergic-like reactions,&#xD;
      those who had ORS and vaccinated individuals who had no such adverse events. Pregnant women&#xD;
      cannot participate in this study. The study has three goals. First, the investigators want to&#xD;
      determine, among those who had allergic-like reactions after influenza vaccination, what&#xD;
      proportion (percentage) of these people are actually allergic to the vaccine or its&#xD;
      components. Second, among those who are not allergic to the vaccine, which other processes&#xD;
      may have caused these symptoms. Finally, the investigators will try to identify whether there&#xD;
      are features that distinguish patients who have a true allergic reaction from those affected&#xD;
      by ORS, and those that had no adverse events.&#xD;

        During the 2009-2010 immunization campaign against pandemic H1N1, the Canada has immunized&#xD;
        most of its population with a dose-sparing adjuvanted vaccine produced by GlaxoSmithKline&#xD;
        (GSK). Following the vaccination, some people reported having allergic-like reactions&#xD;
        (anaphylaxis, oculo-respiratory syndrome and allergy). This study will compare three groups&#xD;
        of patients (cases): those who had allergic-like reactions, those who had anaphylaxis and&#xD;
        those who had ORS post vaccination to vaccinated individuals who had no such adverse events&#xD;
        (controls).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There will be three groups of cases. For all groups of cases, patients will be&#xD;
             included if the time of onset of their first symptoms has been within 24 hours after&#xD;
             vaccination and if they are between 10 and 64 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anaphylaxis: these patients will have to meet at least level 3 of diagnostic certainty&#xD;
             according to the Brighton Collaboration criteria for anaphylaxis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergic-like reactions: These patients will have to have displayed at least one sign&#xD;
             or symptom of an allergic reaction (any of the minor or major criteria of anaphylaxis)&#xD;
             but will exclude patients with conjunctivitis who will belong to the ORS group (see&#xD;
             below).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ORS cases: According to the Public Health Agency case definition, these patients&#xD;
             should have presented a bilateral conjunctivitis plus ≥1 of the seven respiratory&#xD;
             symptoms (cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing,&#xD;
             hoarseness or sore throat) that started within 24 hrs of vaccination, with or without&#xD;
             facial oedema (no restriction for duration)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Controls will be individuals between 10 and 64 years of age who received the pH1N1&#xD;
             vaccine but did not present any of the above mentioned adverse events after their&#xD;
             vaccine (anaphylaxis, allergic like reactions and SOR).&#xD;
