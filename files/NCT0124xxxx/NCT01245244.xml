      The aim of the current project is to use a model of painful stimulation of skin, muscles and&#xD;
      internal organs, where it is possible to measure activity in the brain centers that process&#xD;
      pain simultaneously. Magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography are combined to&#xD;
      optimize the anatomical and physiological description of brain activation. During&#xD;
      administration of morphine we will identify how different brain areas are affected. This&#xD;
      knowledge will be used to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Understand the mechanisms of morphine to a greater extent than is possible today,&#xD;
      including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to investigate the mechanisms of morphine versus placebo on pain signals in the spinal&#xD;
           cord and brain. This is done by a combination of experimental pain models,&#xD;
           neurophysiological and imaging techniques (EEG and fMRI). This can be achieved as both&#xD;
           subjective and objective measures of the analgesic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to examine morphines effect on communication between the centers of the brain that are&#xD;
           involved in painprocessing .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. modeling of morphine pharmacokinetics (the understanding of what the body does to the&#xD;
           drug, such as. concentration in the blood and the brain), since this is central to&#xD;
           understand the pharmacodynamics (the description of what the drug does to the body and&#xD;
           thus the effect it has).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to identify biomarkers that can predict whether healthy subjects respond to morphine by&#xD;
           experiencing an analgesic effect.&#xD;

      The tests will consist of one main study (I) and one sub-study (i):&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) Experiments in the painlaboratory in the gastroenterology clinic, where 40 healthy&#xD;
      subjects will be examined with different pain tests i) Experiments in the MRI scanner, where&#xD;
      only 20 of the 40 from the main study will be investigated in a more simple pain model. The&#xD;
      individuals who also participate in MRI studies, will consist of those who first sign up&#xD;
&#xD;
      An equal distribution of men and women is wanted. The trial will be a double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled crossover study in which all subjects will be investigated on two seperate&#xD;
      days and receive respectively placebo or morphine in random order&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin will be stimulated with thermal and electrical stimuli. Stimulated by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thermal stimuli by the skin stimulated with heat with an approved termotester (Medoc&#xD;
           termotest) or with cold, by a hand or foot immersed in ice water. This harmless ice&#xD;
           water test is further possible to evaluate DNIC (diffuse noxious Inhibitory controls)&#xD;
           which is part of the pain system descending inhibitory system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrical stimulation of the skin will be done by: 1) to the skin of the forearm&#xD;
           stimulated electrically through two small surface electrodes (each approx. One cm2).&#xD;
           There are stimulated to pain threshold, 2) via surface electrodes placed under the foot.&#xD;
           This activates the nociceptive avert reflex as recorded by electrodes placed on the leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The muscles can be stimulated by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • mechanical stimuli by pressing the muscle with an approved pressure algometer (Somedic&#xD;
      produktion AB, Sweden). There is an upper limit for the pressure to avoid injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone associated pain can be studied by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • mechanical stimuli by pressing the right shin bone 15cm below the patella, medial of the&#xD;
      tibia. Pressed with a handheld trykalgometer (Type 2, Somedic produktion AB, Sweden) with a&#xD;
      probe size of 2mm in diameter until trial participants reach their pain tolerance threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visceral stimuli Stimuli to the rectum will be performed through the probe specifically&#xD;
      designed for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mechanical stimuli will be applied by water filling a balloon which is glued on the&#xD;
           probe. The balloon on the probe is extended to moderate pain. The expansion is done by&#xD;
           slowly filling the balloon with 37 degrees hot water.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thermal stimuli will be applied by flushing the balloon with hot water (60 ° C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrical stimuli will be applied by stimulation of the mucosa with weak electrical&#xD;
           currents (Less than 80 mA) through electrodes on the probe. This stimulus is also used&#xD;
           for recording of evoked brain potentials.&#xD;
