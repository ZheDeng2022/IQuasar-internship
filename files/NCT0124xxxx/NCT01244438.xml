  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, non-randomized, single arm study to assess the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of FP-1039 given by weekly intravenous (IV) administrations in advanced&#xD;
      endometrial cancer patients with FGFR2-specific mutations. FP-1039 will be dosed weekly&#xD;
      starting at a dose of up to 16 mg/kg.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FP-1039 will be administered intravenously over 30 minutes once a week. All enrolled subjects&#xD;
      will be monitored for the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity. Subjects with no evidence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity after 4 doses of FP-1039 may continue to receive&#xD;
      weekly treatment provided there continues to be no evidence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Dosing will be discontinued if a subject has evidence of disease&#xD;
      progression. Disease will be assessed approximately every 2 months.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    Study FP1039-002 was not feasible. The original assumption was at least 5% of patients screened&#xD;
    would qualify, but after screening 70 patients, none qualified.&#xD;

          5. Estimated life expectancy of at least 16 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Measurable or evaluable disease by physical or radiologic examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must have recovered from the adverse effects of prior therapy at the time of&#xD;
             enrollment to ≤ Grade 1 (excluding alopecia)&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. History of organ, bone marrow, or stem cell transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
