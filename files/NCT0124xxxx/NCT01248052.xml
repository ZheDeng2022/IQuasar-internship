    <textblock>
      This is a two part study (Parts A and B), the purpose of which is to determine the safety of&#xD;
      LY2979165 in healthy people, and any side effects that might be associated with it, and to&#xD;
      understand how the body handles LY2979165. In addition, Part B, will also look at levels of&#xD;
      LY2979165 in spinal fluid. Doses investigated will be in the range of 20-1000 mg.&#xD;
