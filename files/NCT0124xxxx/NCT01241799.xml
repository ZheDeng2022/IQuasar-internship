      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy&#xD;
      (EUS-FNA) in patient with pancreatic masses with and without the use of a stylet in place&#xD;
      within the biopsy needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients undergoing an EUS FNA for pancreatic indications, patients having a fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration biopsy (FNA) without the internal stylet will have a greater diagnostic yield&#xD;
      compared to those with the internal stylet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS-FNA is an increasingly important means of obtaining tissue samples from lesions within&#xD;
      the thorax and abdomen. In experienced hands EUS-FNA is a safe alternative to more invasive&#xD;
      procedures such as mediastinoscopy or laparoscopy. EUS-FNA can be used for sampling suspected&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic masses or cysts, submucosal gastric lesions, peripancreatic,&#xD;
      perigastric or mediastinal lymph nodes and in some cases adrenal or liver masses. Therefore,&#xD;
      it is a powerful tool for both diagnosis and tumour staging. For example, for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which is a common indication for EUS-FNA, the sensitivity&#xD;
      varies from 75 to &gt;90%, with a specificity of 82-100% and a mean accuracy of 85%. Improving&#xD;
      the diagnostic yield may lead to an earlier diagnosis with a reduced number of investigations&#xD;
      and earlier institution of treatment for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FNA needle system consists of a 22 or 19 gauge needle which is manipulated by a handle&#xD;
      piston that attaches to the biopsy channel of the endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) linear scope.&#xD;
      The tip of the needle has grooves to disperse ultrasound waves making the tip of the needle&#xD;
      easily seen. The sample is taken by inserting a specially designed needle into the area of&#xD;
      interest under EUS guidance. Inside the needle is a removable stylet with a rounded or&#xD;
      bevelled tip to facilitate the passage of the needle into the tissue. The usual practice is&#xD;
      for the stylet to be extracted after the needle has been passed into its optimum position&#xD;
      within the tissue and for it to be re-inserted before each pass. However, a recent&#xD;
      prospective trial with 111 patients, published in abstract form, found this approach was&#xD;
      associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of adequate samples compared to&#xD;
      when the stylet was removed before passing the needle. Although there was no significant&#xD;
      difference in the diagnostic yield between the two groups this study raises the issue that&#xD;
      the stylet left in place is to the detriment of the tissue sample and, ultimately, may reduce&#xD;
      the diagnostic yield or increase the number of passes needed to obtain a satisfactory sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One limitation to this study includes the heterogenous patient population. Yields of EUS-FNA&#xD;
      vary considerably depending on the type of tissue being biopsied. The second limitation is&#xD;
      that consecutive patients were randomized to having the stylet removed versus having the&#xD;
      stylet not removed at the time of FNA. There is no control group from which to compare the&#xD;
      two groups. An improvement in the study design would be to have each patient to be their own&#xD;
      control group. Successive passes of the FNA needle can increase the bloodiness of the sample,&#xD;
      so randomization of the order in which each group is done will help eliminate potential bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is clear from the current published literature that removing the stylet increases the&#xD;
      cellularity of the sample. However, this increased cellularity may be the result of more&#xD;
      contamination from the GI tract through which the FNA needle needs to pass in order to get an&#xD;
      extra-luminal sample. Blood or a traumatic FNA can also lead to increased cellularity that&#xD;
      can compromise diagnostic accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic yield depends on both adequacy of the sample and enough cells from the lesion to&#xD;
      interpret. A preliminary result based on an air dried slide often can lead to fewer FNA&#xD;
      passes if a diagnosis can be made. If this is not possible, a cell block preparation is made&#xD;
      from all the washings from the EUS-FNA needle. No study has examined the diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
      of these two types of samples using an EUS-FNA needle with and without the stylet within the&#xD;
      same patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if the diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA is increased if the stylet is removed from&#xD;
      the FNA needle compared with leaving it in place.&#xD;

      Research Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients referred for EUS who are also likely to require FNA will be screened for study&#xD;
      eligibility by way of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After informed consent has been&#xD;
      obtained patients will be randomized to 2 different groups by random number generation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stylet in FNA first, Stylet out FNA second&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stylet out FNA first, Stylet in FNA second As each method of tissue sampling will be&#xD;
           used for all patients they will effectively act as their own controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients randomized to the first group the stylet in is left in place within the needle&#xD;
      for the first three passes of the needle into the area to be sampled. A new 22 gauge EUS FNA&#xD;
      is then used to obtain the FNA with the stylet out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients randomized to the second group a 22 gauge EUS FNA needle with the stylet out is&#xD;
      used for the first three passes. A new needle with the stylet in is subsequently used for&#xD;
      further sampling. Three passes will be done for each FNA biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient the sample adequacy, the number of bloody passes and the number of passes&#xD;
      required to obtain an adequate sample will be recorded by the cytopathology technician. Each&#xD;
      tissue sample will be prepared and analysed by experienced on-site cytopathology staff, who&#xD;
      will be blinded to the group allocation of the respective patients. A positive or negative&#xD;
      diagnosis will be recorded when the final cytology result is available. At the end of the&#xD;
      study period a comparison between the two groups will be made in relation to the parameters&#xD;
      outlined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of our study will be the number of samples with a positive diagnosis in&#xD;
      each group. Secondary end-points will be the number of bloody passes, the sample adequacy and&#xD;
      the number of passes needed to obtain an adequate sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome will be represented as a proportion of FNA samples that have a positive&#xD;
      diagnosis. The effect size between the stylet in FNA and stylet out FNA is expected to be&#xD;
      30%. This is at a significance level of p= 0.05 and 80% power. The number of patients in each&#xD;
      arm is therefore 36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of methodology All patients who are referred for a pancreatic EUS and are likely&#xD;
      to require an FNA will be identified and screened for eligibility for entry into the study&#xD;
      according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Those patients who are seen in the office&#xD;
      prior to an EUS appointment will be invited to enter the study by a research nurse or&#xD;
      research assistant not involved with the procedure. They will be provided with written and&#xD;
      verbal information on the study prior to making their decision. For patients who are referred&#xD;
      directly for an EUS-FNA from another physician and who are not seen in the office beforehand&#xD;
      a written invitation to enter the study will be sent in advance. This will provide detailed&#xD;
      information on the research proposal as well as a helpline number which patients can use to&#xD;
      contact one of the study co-ordinators for further advice. A follow up phone call to patients&#xD;
      will be made by a study co-ordinator before they attend for the EUS; the initial contact&#xD;
      letter will outline when this call will be made, and by whom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients elect to enter into the study informed consent will be obtained prior to&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of procedures In patients randomized to the first group, under intravenous sedation,&#xD;
      a linear endoscopic ultrasound examination is performed. The pancreatic mass is identified by&#xD;
      endoscopic ultrasound and using a 22 gauge EUS FNA needle with the stylet in is used for the&#xD;
      first pass. The stylet is then withdrawn and 10cc of suction is applied to the FNA needle. A&#xD;
      sample is obtained by moving the needle in and out of the lesion for a minimum of 15 times.&#xD;
      The sample is then collected for cytopathology. The stylet is replaced in the needle and&#xD;
      another pass is performed by the same technique. Three passes will be done for each FNA&#xD;
      biopsy. A new 22 gauge EUS FNA is then used to obtain the FNA with the stylet out by the same&#xD;
      technique as outlined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients randomized to the second group, under intravenous sedation a linear endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound examination is performed. The pancreatic mass is identified by endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound and using a 22 gauge EUS FNA needle with the stylet out is used for the first&#xD;
      pass. The stylet is then withdrawn and 10cc of suction is applied to the FNA needle. A sample&#xD;
      is obtained by moving the needle in and out of the lesion for a minimum of 15 times. The&#xD;
      sample is then collected for cytopathology. The stylet is replaced in the needle and once&#xD;
      loaded into position, the stylet is removed prior to starting another pass performed by the&#xD;
      same technique. Three passes will be done for each FNA biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events that can potentially occur include oversedation (1:500), pancreatitis&#xD;
      (1:1000), perforation (1:5000), and bleeding (extremely rare with only one reported case in&#xD;
      press) For each patient the sample adequacy, the number of bloody passes and the number of&#xD;
      passes required to obtain an adequate sample will be recorded by the cytopathology&#xD;
      technician. Each tissue sample will be prepared and analysed by experienced on-site&#xD;
      cytopathology staff, who will be blinded to the group allocation of the respective patients.&#xD;
      A positive or negative diagnosis will be recorded when the final cytology result is&#xD;
      available. At the end of the study period a comparison between the two groups will be made in&#xD;
      relation to the parameters outlined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within one day, all patients will be contacted to determine if any adverse events have&#xD;
      occurred.&#xD;
