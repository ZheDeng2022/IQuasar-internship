    <textblock>
      One important goal in anesthetic management during ocular surgery is to provide adequate&#xD;
      control of intraocular pressure (IOP). An increase in IOP may be catastrophic in patients&#xD;
      with glaucoma or a penetrating open-eye injury. Accurate assessment of IOP is particularly&#xD;
      important in infants and children with definite or suspected glaucoma undergoing examination&#xD;
      under anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic regimens in this surgical field commonly consist of short-acting anesthetic&#xD;
      agents, such as sevoflurane. Sevoflurane is known to reduce the IOP. During pediatric ocular&#xD;
      surgery, the inspired sevoflurane concentration varies continuously and may have an impact&#xD;
      over the IOP that could affect the conduct of surgery. In this study the investigators wish&#xD;
      to evaluate whether variations in sevoflurane concentration do affect the IOP.&#xD;

      Introduction One important goal in anesthetic management during ocular surgery is to provide&#xD;
      adequate control of intraocular pressure (IOP). An increase in IOP may be catastrophic in&#xD;
      patients with glaucoma or a penetrating open-eye injury. Accurate assessment of IOP is&#xD;
      particularly important in infants and children with definite or suspected glaucoma undergoing&#xD;
      examination under anesthesia (EUA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an ongoing debate over the effect of anesthetic agents on the IOP. Anesthetic&#xD;
      regimens in this surgical field commonly consist of short-acting anesthetic agents, such as&#xD;
      propofol and sevoflurane, usually combined with short-acting analgesics, such as remifentanil&#xD;
      [1-3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both propofol and sevoflurane are known to reduce the IOP [4-7]. Previous studies have&#xD;
      compared these two anesthetics protocols in order to determine which provides superior&#xD;
      control of the IOP. Propofol produced significantly lower IOP measurements compared to&#xD;
      sevoflurane (both combined with remifentanil), in cataract surgery [8], whereas in&#xD;
      non-ophthalmic surgery propofol and sevoflurane caused a comparable decrease in IOP [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sevoflurane, an inhalational anesthetic, has a rapid onset of action, faster recovery time&#xD;
      and lower incidence of reported side effects in pediatric patients [10], and is also suitable&#xD;
      for inhalation induction because it does not irritate the airway [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      During pediatric ocular surgery, the inspired sevoflurane concentration is normally maximal&#xD;
      at induction of anesthesia (approximately end-tidal concentration of 7%), and it is&#xD;
      thereafter reduced or discontinued to achieve an end-tidal sevoflurane concentration of &lt;0.1%&#xD;
      by the completion of skin closure. In between these time points the inhaled end-tidal&#xD;
      concentration gradually decreases and may have an impact over the IOP that could affect the&#xD;
      conduct of surgery. A prospective randomized clinical trial compared the effects of ketamine&#xD;
      and sevoflurane on IOP during the eight minutes after induction of anesthesia (in 2-minute&#xD;
      intervals) in children with suspected or diagnosed glaucoma undergoing EUA [5]. During these&#xD;
      8 minutes the IOP decreased significantly only in the sevoflurane group. This finding&#xD;
      contradicted claims that measurements immediately after induction are relatively unaffected&#xD;
      by anesthetics, and suggested that variations in sevoflurane concentration do affect the IOP.&#xD;
      To this end there is no data in the literature to support or disprove this finding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective To assess the effect of different end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations on the&#xD;
      IOP in children with healthy eyes undergoing extraocular procedures, i.e., strabismus&#xD;
      correction and tear duct probing and irrigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis We believe that variations in the end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations have&#xD;
      no significant effect on the IOP of healthy eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a prospective randomized trial of 21 children undergoing ocular surgery.&#xD;
      Informed consent will first be obtained from the parent or legal guardian. After induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia and before onset of surgery, IOP will be measured in both eyes under four&#xD;
      different concentrations of inhaled sevoflurane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative anesthetic management Anesthetic management will be performed by a trained&#xD;
      pediatric anesthesiologist. All patients will be premedicated with 0.5 mg/kg (up to 15 mg)&#xD;
      midazolam P.O. 30min before surgery. No significant change in IOP has been reported for&#xD;
      midazolam [11]. Induction of anesthesia will be carried out with sevoflurane 8% in 100%&#xD;
      oxygen carrier gas. After induction of anesthesia, laryngeal mask will be inserted, and&#xD;
      sevoflurane end-tidal concentrations will be adjusted according to the study protocol and&#xD;
      assigned group (see &quot;patient allocation and assessment&quot;). No other systemic anesthetic agents&#xD;
      will be used during IOP measurements. IOP measurements will be performed after induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia. Thereafter, maintenance of anesthesia will be carried out with either spontaneous&#xD;
      ventilation at one to two minimal alveolar concentration of sevoflurane (2 to 4%) in 100%&#xD;
      oxygen, or mechanical ventilation, as commonly used in pediatric surgery. Standardized&#xD;
      intraoperative monitoring will be employed for all subjects by an anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative surgical management Routine strabismus correction or tear duct probing and&#xD;
      irrigation procedures will be performed on each subject, as described elsewhere [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient allocation and assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consented patients will be randomly (by means of computer-generated assignment of random&#xD;
      numbers) allocated to one of three groups (n=7 in each group). In each group IOP will be&#xD;
      measured and recorded under four different predetermined end-tidal sevoflurane&#xD;
      concentrations: 7%, 5%, 2%, 0.5%. The order of concentrations will differ between the groups,&#xD;
      to eliminate the effect of exposure time:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 7%, 5%, 2%, 0.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 7%, 2%, 5%, 0.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 7%, 0.5%, 5%, 2% IOP will be measured by the ophthalmologist via both TonoPen XL and&#xD;
           Schioz devices. Measurements will be taken from each eye alternatively for three&#xD;
           consecutive readings, at each of the abovementioned concentrations. There is no known&#xD;
           risk at IOP reading. At the same times, the anesthesiologist will record systolic and&#xD;
           diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) and heart rate (HR), End Tidal CO2, via iMDsoft&#xD;
           software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we will collect demographic data (e.g., age, gender, weight) for each patient.&#xD;
      Routine post operative follow up will be performed.&#xD;
