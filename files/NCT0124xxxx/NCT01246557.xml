  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite certain notable progress, treatment of patients with Chronic Lymphatic Leukemia (CLL)&#xD;
      is still disappointing. Although thanks to the use of treatment of (immune) chemotherapy,&#xD;
      mainly based on fludarabine, rituximab and alemtuzumab, the rate of complete response (CR)&#xD;
      has increased from minus 10% observed when clorambucil was the core of the therapy to a&#xD;
      60-70%, with time all patients relapse and most of them die at the end due to the disease or&#xD;
      to involvements related to the treatment. Progress when understanding the CLL biology have&#xD;
      cleared a series of aspects: 1) there is a significant proportion of CLL cells actively&#xD;
      copying themselves, contrary to the opinion that most of CLL cells are in G0 phase of the&#xD;
      cell cycle; 2) Immune regulatory mechanism basically measured by T cells and NK cells have an&#xD;
      important role in the continuous accumulation of CLL cells in the body; 3) Cells of the&#xD;
      stroma are essential to maintain survival of CLL cells through a series of cytokines or&#xD;
      chemokines. Under the light of this evidence, it is worth studying new treatment modes&#xD;
      directed not only to CLL cells but also to the microenvironment and immune functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide is being investigated as treatment for several oncologic indications including&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndromes, multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Within the scope of&#xD;
      CLL, it has been proved that lenalidomide is active in patients with relapsing / treatment&#xD;
      resistant CLL patients. Forty five patients with relapsing CLL, 51% resistant to fludarabine,&#xD;
      where included in a phase II study and were treated orally with 25 mg of lenalidomide on days&#xD;
      1 to 21 of a cycle of 28 days. The total response rate was of 47% with up to a 9% of complete&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone is being investigated in multiple myeloma&#xD;
      and has revealed as a highly efficient treatment in relapsing/ treatment resistant patients&#xD;
      as well as in those newly diagnosed. Bearing in mind that both drugs, lenalidomide and&#xD;
      dexamethasone, are clinically active in CLL the investigators have designed a study with this&#xD;
      combination in relapsing or treatment resistant patients following treatments containing&#xD;
      fludarabine which do not meet the requirements for an intensive rescue treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given initial doses of 10 and 25 mg of lenalidomide daily may be associated with tumor lysis&#xD;
      cases, it is proposed a low initial dose of lenalidomide in the first cycle 2.5mg., with&#xD;
      further increases to prevent the occurrence of tumor lysis syndrome&#xD;
