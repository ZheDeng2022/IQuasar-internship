      This is a randomized trial to test a brief single session risk reduction counseling&#xD;
      intervention on HIV and STI behavioral outcomes in Cape Town South Africa.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This 5 year study will conduct a randomized clinical trial of a gender and culturally&#xD;
      tailored theory-based behavioral risk reduction intervention for men and women who are&#xD;
      receiving sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnostic and treatment services from STI&#xD;
      treatment providers in South Africa. As many as one in five South Africans is HIV positive&#xD;
      and there are an estimated 1,500 new HIV infections in South Africa each day. The&#xD;
      experimental intervention in this study was developed by South African and US investigators&#xD;
      and pilot tested in South Africa. The intervention is grounded in the experience of South&#xD;
      African health service provider, empirical research on AIDS-related stigmas, and elements of&#xD;
      a social cognitive theory of health behavior change. The intervention consists of a single&#xD;
      60-minute risk reduction counseling session delivered within the context of STI services.&#xD;
      Participants will be STI clinic patients over age 18 that have been treated for a previous&#xD;
      STI. Participants will be baseline assessed and randomized to receive either (a) the 60 min&#xD;
      theory-based and culturally tailored risk reduction intervention or (b) a time and contact&#xD;
      matched standard of care HIV and health education session. Participants will be followed for&#xD;
      12 months post intervention. Assessments will be conducted using computer assisted interviews&#xD;
      (ACASI). The randomized trial will determine the efficacy of the risk reduction intervention&#xD;
      for South African men and women receiving STI clinic services. Outcome analyses will include&#xD;
      differences between conditions on new STI diagnoses over 12 months. We will also test the&#xD;
      mediating effects of attitudes and beliefs on intervention outcomes. Results of this research&#xD;
      will therefore test a clinic-based HIV prevention intervention model that is urgently needed&#xD;
      in South Africa.&#xD;
