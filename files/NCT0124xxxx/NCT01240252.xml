  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to find out why too much fat in your blood stream may cause&#xD;
      insulin resistance in your muscles. Insulin is the hormone, produced normally by your body,&#xD;
      which causes your blood sugar to return to normal after you eat.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is an early event in the pathogenesis of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, obesity, and other conditions associated with the Metabolic Syndrome. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the extent to which the inflammatory response to lipids is present&#xD;
      in naturally occurring insulin resistance. We will test the hypothesis that skeletal muscle&#xD;
      from insulin resistant volunteers is characterized by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increased concentrations of circulating proinflammatory cytokines without changes in&#xD;
           cytokine expression in muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increased inflammatory response in muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increased infiltration of inflammatory cells into skeletal muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Changes in expression of proteasome genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty five subjects will be studied in total. Three groups will be studied. One group will&#xD;
      consist of 15 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus The second group will consist of 15 age,&#xD;
      gender, and body composition matched overweight or obese subjects (27 &lt; BMI &lt;36) with normal&#xD;
      glucose tolerance. The third group will consist of 15 age and gender matched nonobese control&#xD;
      subjects (BMI &lt; 27).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two visits in the study, a screening visit and the study visit. At visit 2 the&#xD;
      subject will report to the study site having fasted since the night before, discuss the study&#xD;
      and provide written consent, and provide a history and physical exam. Screening tests include&#xD;
      a 12-lead resting EKG, complete blood chemistry and complete blood count (CBC), glycated&#xD;
      hemoglobin (HbA1c), and a lipid profile. If the results of these tests show that the subject&#xD;
      is eligible to participate in the study, a second visit will be scheduled. On the same day as&#xD;
      the screening visit, the patient will have an oral glucose tolerance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 3 months of the screening visit, the subject will return after an overnight fast for a&#xD;
      euglycemic clamp study and 2 muscle biopsies. Diabetic subjects will have oral medications&#xD;
      discontinued for 3 days before study (metformin and thiazolidinedione treatment will be&#xD;
      excluded). Patients taking insulin will have neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) discontinued&#xD;
      the evening before study, and Glargine will be discontinued the morning and evening on the&#xD;
      day before study. An antecubital catheter will be placed for infusion of substances.&#xD;
      Deuterated glucose will be used to determine the rates of basal and insulin stimulated&#xD;
      glucose uptake. A hand vein will be catheterized and placed in a heated box to arterialize&#xD;
      venous blood for measurement of arterial glucose concentrations. One hour later, a&#xD;
      percutaneous biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle will be performed. Biopsy specimens&#xD;
      (75-150 mg) will be frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored in liquid nitrogen until&#xD;
      they are processed. One hour after the muscle biopsy (two hours after the start of deuterated&#xD;
      glucose), a primed-continuous (80 milliunits (mU)/(m^2 per min)) insulin infusion will be&#xD;
      started and continued for 120 minutes to quantify the effects of insulin on glucose disposal.&#xD;
      Throughout the insulin infusion, an infusion of 20% glucose will be adjusted to maintain&#xD;
      euglycemia. Plasma glucose in the diabetics will be allowed to fall during the insulin&#xD;
      infusion to euglycemia, where it will be maintained. A second muscle biopsy will be performed&#xD;
      in the contralateral leg at the conclusion of the insulin infusion.&#xD;
