      Background and Rationale: Mobility impairment is one of the main correlates of decreased&#xD;
      levels of participation in daily and social activities. Mobility disability is often&#xD;
      remediable through the use of assistive technology, of which the wheelchair is arguably the&#xD;
      most widely used and recognizable form. Statistics suggest over 250,000 Canadians use&#xD;
      wheelchairs, the majority of whom are older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobility impairment often has psychological consequences that may independently restrict&#xD;
      functioning and participation. Confidence is one such consequence, and according to Bandura's&#xD;
      Social Cognitive Theory, is the belief individuals have in their ability to perform&#xD;
      behaviours to achieve desired outcomes. Furthermore, previous findings have accounted for no&#xD;
      more than 40% of the variance of factors influencing wheelchair mobility and participation.&#xD;
      It is likely that confidence in wheelchair use may account for some of that variance. Recent&#xD;
      findings show that approximately 40% of wheelchair users report having low confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because confidence is client-specific and modifiable, treatment strategies to address low&#xD;
      confidence in using a wheelchair may lead to greater participation among older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The overall goal of this research project is to evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      Wheelchair Skills Training Program on confidence with using a manual wheelchair in a group of&#xD;
      non-wheelchair users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the efficacy of the Wheelchair Skills Training Program on improving confidence&#xD;
           with using a manual wheelchair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the efficacy of the Wheelchair Skills Training Program on improving wheelchair&#xD;
           performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore the immediate effect of exposure to wheelchair skills (an outcome measure) on&#xD;
           confidence using a manual wheelchair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants who take part in the Wheelchair Skills Training Program will have&#xD;
           significant improvements in confidence with using a manual wheelchair compared with&#xD;
           those in the control group, as measured by the Wheelchair Use Confidence Scale&#xD;
           (WheelCon)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants who receive the Wheelchair Skills Training Program will have significant&#xD;
           improvements in wheelchair performance compared to the control group, as measured by the&#xD;
           Wheelchair Skills Test (WST).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All participants will have significant improvements in confidence using a manual&#xD;
           wheelchair after exposure to wheelchair skills (during baseline assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method: This study will use 2 concurrent Randomized Controlled Trials to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of the Wheelchair Skills Training Program in younger and older adults. Trial 1&#xD;
      and Trial 2 will employ different recruitment approaches for targeting younger versus older&#xD;
      adults and different inclusion criteria with regard to age of the participants. Otherwise the&#xD;
      research design, protocol and procedures will be the same. Upon completion of data&#xD;
      collection, the data will be pooled and stratified by age (younger adult, older adult) for&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobility impairment is the primary form of reported disability and is also one of the main&#xD;
      correlates of decreased levels of participation in daily and social activities, which is an&#xD;
      important determinant of quality of life. Mobility disability is often remediable through the&#xD;
      use of assistive technology, of which the wheelchair is arguably the most widely used and&#xD;
      recognizable form. Statistics suggest over 250,000 Canadians use wheelchairs the majority of&#xD;
      whom are older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sudden health events such as mobility impairment often have psychological consequences that&#xD;
      may independently restrict functioning and participation. Confidence is one such consequence,&#xD;
      and according to Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory, is the belief individuals have in their&#xD;
      ability to perform behaviours to achieve desired outcomes. Furthermore, previous findings&#xD;
      have accounted for only 33% and 40% of the variance of factors influencing wheelchair&#xD;
      mobility and participation respectively. It is likely that confidence in wheelchair use may&#xD;
      account for some of that variance. Confidence in using a wheelchair is an emerging and novel&#xD;
      research construct that has the potential for significant impact on healthy and successful&#xD;
      aging, and on health services aimed towards the maintenance of functional autonomy among&#xD;
      older adults. It is conceptualized as the belief individuals have in their ability to use a&#xD;
      wheelchair, and recent findings show that approximately 40% of wheelchair users have low&#xD;
      confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because confidence is client-specific and modifiable, treatment strategies to address low&#xD;
      confidence in using a wheelchair may lead to greater mobility and social participation among&#xD;
      older adults. Bandura postulates four sources of information to modify confidence: 1)&#xD;
      enactive mastery; 2) vicarious learning; 3) verbal persuasion; and 4) physiological/&#xD;
      affective states. Enactive mastery, or experiential learning, is perhaps the most influential&#xD;
      source of information. Enactive mastery has been shown to positively alter many forms of&#xD;
      confidence including those related to balance, and performance of activities of daily living.&#xD;
      In fact, qualitative responses from a community-based study stated that wheelchair users&#xD;
      reported increased confidence after completing the Wheelchair Skills Training Program. It is&#xD;
      thus plausible that wheelchair skills training may positively influence an older adult's&#xD;
      confidence in their ability to use a wheelchair. However, this relationship has not yet been&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The overall goal of this research project is to evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      Wheelchair Skills Training Program on confidence with using a manual wheelchair in younger&#xD;
      and older able-bodied adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the efficacy of the Wheelchair Skills Training Program on improving confidence&#xD;
           with using a manual wheelchair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the efficacy of the Wheelchair Skills Training Program on improving wheelchair&#xD;
           performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore the immediate effect of exposure to wheelchair skills on confidence using a&#xD;
           manual wheelchair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the difference in confidence using a manual wheelchair between younger and&#xD;
           older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants who take part in the Wheelchair Skills Training Program will have&#xD;
           significant improvements in confidence with using a manual wheelchair compared with&#xD;
           those in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants who receive the Wheelchair Skills Training Program will have significant&#xD;
           improvements in wheelchair performance compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Confidence with using a manual wheelchair will improve after exposure to wheelchair&#xD;
           skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Younger adults will have significantly higher confidence using a manual wheelchair&#xD;
           compared to older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method: Concurrent Randomized Controlled Trials in a group of younger (Trial 1) and&#xD;
      older (Trial 2) adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial 1- Participants: Undergraduate and graduate, able-bodied students will be recruited&#xD;
      through the University of British Columbia using letters of information, posters, and&#xD;
      word-of-mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 20 (10 intervention, 10 control)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial 2- Participants: Able-bodied community living, older adults Sample Size: 20 (10&#xD;
      intervention, 10 control)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial 1 and Trial 2- Design: Parallel group, randomized controlled trial. Procedures:&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained from interested participants. Demographic information and&#xD;
      information about anxiety and depression, cognitive functioning, and risk propensity will be&#xD;
      collected. Participants will then be randomly allocated to either a Wheelchair Skills&#xD;
      Training Program (WSTP) or a Control group using a table of random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete baseline and follow-up measures for confidence using a manual&#xD;
      wheelchair and wheelchair performance. Participants in the intervention group will complete&#xD;
      the WSTP, while participants in the control will just receive one phone call or email from&#xD;
      the study investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Demographic information, anxiety and depression, cognitive functioning,&#xD;
      and risk propensity will be analyzed using descriptive statistics. The change in confidence&#xD;
      with using a manual wheelchair between groups (WSTP and Control) will be analyzed using a&#xD;
      2X3X2 repeated measures ANOVA. The change in confidence with using a manual wheelchair&#xD;
      between groups (WSTP and Control) will be analyzed using a 2X2X2 repeated measures ANOVA. All&#xD;
      data will be analyzed using SPPS Version 15.0, with alpha equal to 0.05.&#xD;
