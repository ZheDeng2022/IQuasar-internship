    <textblock>
      The congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), also known as the Ondine syndrome, is&#xD;
      a very rare genetic disorder. In contrast with healthy people, patients do not increase&#xD;
      breathing in response to an excess of carbon dioxide (CO2). As a consequence, they do not&#xD;
      breath sufficiently, or even stop breathing, during sleep. Their survival depends only on&#xD;
      mechanical respiratory assistance, all life long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently published two cases of recovery of a response to CO2 in patients taking&#xD;
      desogestrel as a contraceptive pill. The goal of the study is therefore to assess the&#xD;
      hypothesis that desogestrel will restore a respiratory response to CO2 in CCHS patients and&#xD;
      allow them to breath sufficiently during sleep without mechanical assistance.&#xD;

      Rationale of the study The congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), also called&#xD;
      Ondine syndrome or Ondine's curse, is a rare orphan disease associated with mutations of the&#xD;
      PHOX 2B gene. It is characterized by an absence or a deep reduction in the ventilatory&#xD;
      response to hypercapnia and hypoxia. As a consequence, life-threatening hypoventilation or&#xD;
      apneas occur during sleep and, in some patients, also during wakefulness. Survival thus&#xD;
      depends on mechanical ventilatory assistance (or on phrenic pacing), all life long. There is&#xD;
      no pharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have fortuitously observed two cases of recovery of ventilatory response to hypercapnia in&#xD;
      patients taking desogestrel, a very potent progestin, as a contraceptive treatment (&quot;Straus,&#xD;
      C., et al. Respir. Physiol. Neurobiol. 2010 ; 171 : 171-174&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the research project stems from these observations. It assumes that&#xD;
      desogestrel will restore a chemosensitivity to hypercapnia in Ondine patients that will allow&#xD;
      them to breath sufficiently without mechanical ventilatory assistance during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the study will be to assess whether a treatment with desogestrel will&#xD;
      restore a ventilatory response to hypercapnia. The secondary goal will be to evaluate whether&#xD;
      this response will allow the patients to be weaned from mechanical ventilatory assistance&#xD;
      during sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study will take place in one unique hospital, the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in&#xD;
      Paris, France. It will be conducted in volunteer pubescent female patients. Patients with&#xD;
      contra-indications to desogestrel will not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ventilatory response to hypercapnia will be assessed through the rebreathing method and&#xD;
      through a blinded procedure specifically designed for the study. Sleep and breathing during&#xD;
      sleep will be assessed through polysomnography. Blood gas analysis as well as hormonal and&#xD;
      ionic analysis of the blood will be performed. The ventilatory response to hypoxia will also&#xD;
      be assessed. Changes in cerebral activation will be looked for using functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Patients will be first assessed with all the tests mentioned in the above paragraph,&#xD;
      except fMRI. Polysomnography will be performed under mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who will not take any contraceptive oral treatment with estrogens or progestin and&#xD;
      whose response to hypercapnia will be low enough will immediately continue the study. An fMRI&#xD;
      will be performed and the patients will be prescribed desogestrel 75 µg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who will be under an oral contraceptive treatment with estrogens or progestin will&#xD;
      have to stop it and to use mechanical contraception (condom). All the patients taking an oral&#xD;
      contraceptive treatment will be assessed after having stopped these drugs, with all the tests&#xD;
      mentioned in the &quot;methods&quot; paragraph, except fMRI. Polysomnography will be performed under&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. If their ventilatory response to hypercapnia will be low enough an&#xD;
      fMRI will be performed and the patients will be prescribed desogestrel 75 µg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be assessed under treatment with desogestrel. If the slope of the&#xD;
      ventilatory response to hypercapnia is more than 1L/min/mmHg, an attempt of weaning from&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation during sleep will replace the usual polysomnography under mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. The patients will be admitted in an intensive care unit where they will sleep&#xD;
      without ventilatory assistance. Polysomnographic recordings will be performed with a portable&#xD;
      device. In case of prolonged hypopneas or apneas or in case of arterial desaturation,&#xD;
      patients will be awakened and mechanical ventilation will be resumed. The attempt of weaning&#xD;
      will be regarded as a failure. In the absence of those criteria, the weaning will be regarded&#xD;
      as a possible success. However, the investigators will not prescribe to the patient to sleep&#xD;
      without ventilatory assistance. Their attending physician will have to take the final&#xD;
      decision regarding this issue.&#xD;
