  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a mental health problem usually starting in the late teens/early twenties,&#xD;
      and often lasting many years. The standard medication ('antipsychotics') for this problem is&#xD;
      usually helpful, and if taken continually can keep people well, reducing the likelihood of&#xD;
      further episodes. However, in up to one in three people with schizophrenia, the illness does&#xD;
      not show much improvement with antipsychotic medication. For some of these 'resistant'&#xD;
      illnesses, one particular antipsychotic, clozapine, can work well, but one disadvantage is&#xD;
      the risk of a severe blood side effect which means that regular blood testing is necessary.&#xD;
      If the response to clozapine treatment is disappointing, there is some evidence that adding&#xD;
      another antipsychotic can sometimes produce more improvement. However, it seems that the&#xD;
      added antipsychotic may need to be taken by the person for at least 10 weeks in order to work&#xD;
      well. The investigators plan to test carefully the possible benefits and problems when the&#xD;
      antipsychotic amisulpride or a dummy tablet ('placebo') is added to clozapine for 12 weeks in&#xD;
      people whose schizophrenia illness has not been helped much by any antipsychotic medication&#xD;
      on its own, and who are now taking clozapine, but again with not much improvement. The&#xD;
      investigators have chosen amisulpride because its pharmacological action may be complementary&#xD;
      to that of clozapine, and also it is less likely than some other antipsychotics to compound&#xD;
      some of the characteristic side effects of clozapine, such as sedation, weight gain and other&#xD;
      metabolic problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjunctive amisulpride or placebo will be randomly assigned. The investigators expect that&#xD;
      adding amisulpride will be more likely to cause an improvement than adding placebo. But the&#xD;
      investigators should learn more about the risks and side effects of combining these two&#xD;
      medications. Also, the investigators should gain a greater understanding of the possible&#xD;
      benefits of adding another antipsychotic to clozapine in relation to particular problem&#xD;
      symptoms, and a person's ability to live and work in the community.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This 12-week, placebo-controlled RCT will be conducted in secondary care, specifically mental&#xD;
      health services, at UK centres. The health technology to be assessed is the augmentation of&#xD;
      clozapine treatment with another second-generation antipsychotic, amisulpride, which will be&#xD;
      compared with placebo: 400mg amisulpride or 1 matching placebo capsule for the first 4 weeks,&#xD;
      then the option of titrating up to 800mg amisulpride or 2 matching placebo capsules for the&#xD;
      remaining 8 weeks. The study will be double-blind, with medication supplied as identical&#xD;
      capsules containing either 400mg amisulpride or placebo. The optimum dose of clozapine at&#xD;
      entry and subsequent augmentation will be achieved through a flexible dosing regimen whereby&#xD;
      treating psychiatrists will be able to flexibly alter dose regimens to maximise clinical&#xD;
      risk-benefit ratios; there will be opportunities for clinical titration of clozapine dose at&#xD;
      two and six weeks. Any direct pharmacokinetic effect on clozapine levels will be assessed by&#xD;
      pre- and post-augmentation plasma levels of clozapine, samples being taken at baseline and at&#xD;
      the end of the 12 weeks. Recommended pharmacovigilance procedures will be followed.&#xD;
      Clinicians will be asked not to prescribe any additional medication during the course of the&#xD;
      study, and will be reminded of the drugs with potential adverse interactions, as mentioned in&#xD;
      the SPCs for clozapine and amisulpride. Medication adherence will be assessed by 'pill count'&#xD;
      and clozapine/norclozapine plasma level ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic improvement will be assessed in terms of overall symptom severity, but also using&#xD;
      broader, clinically-relevant outcome measures of social and occupational function and target&#xD;
      symptoms and/or behaviours as well as overall health status and utility. Side effects will be&#xD;
      systematically assessed. The costs and outcomes for a cost effectiveness acceptability and&#xD;
      net benefit analysis will also be measured. The primary economic measure will be the&#xD;
      incremental cost effectiveness ratio of clozapine augmentation, estimated as the net cost of&#xD;
      clozapine augmentation divided by net QALY of clozapine augmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four months will be allowed for recruitment of participants, plus 3 months for the&#xD;
      final follow-up assessments.&#xD;
