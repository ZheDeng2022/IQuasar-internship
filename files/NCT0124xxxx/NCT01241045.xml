    <textblock>
      100 Pregnant women, in mid-trimester, with a medical indication for termination of pregnancy&#xD;
      will be approached to participate in this study Methods:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A formal consent from the women under study with full notification and explanation of&#xD;
           the methods, importance of the study and possible unwanted effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During the pre-selection visit, exclusion and inclusion criteria will be applied.&#xD;
           Baseline investigations; Blood sugar, Serum Glutamate Oxaloacetate Transaminase (SGOT),&#xD;
           Serum Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT), S. Creatinine, and Complete Blood Count&#xD;
           (C.B.C.) and Coagulation profile (PTT, serum fibrinogen level) will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Following admission, all patients will undergo complete clinical examination and&#xD;
           detailed medical history will be obtained. Each patient will have a Case Record Form&#xD;
           (CRF) in which the following data will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient initials.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient number (according to the randomization schedule).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age, height, weight,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Known allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Past medical and surgical history (no longer present).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medications taken within the last 4 weeks and discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Concomitant illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Concomitant medications which will not be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical examination: including full gynaecologic assessment including vaginal and&#xD;
                speculum examination with recording of vaginal and cervical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The vaginal Ph will be measured using Universal indicator paper pH (1-14) before digital&#xD;
           vaginal examination. Through speculum examination, the indicator will be held with an&#xD;
           artery forceps against the vaginal wall-high up in the vagina-until it becomes wet.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Color change of the strip will be immediately compared with the colorimetric scale and&#xD;
           the measurement will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be divided into 2 groups:-&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 1:-those with Ph&lt;5. (n=50).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 2:-those with Ph &gt; or=5. (n=50).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Each group is subdivided into another two groups:-&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 1A (n=25). - Group 1B (n=25).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 2A (n=25). - Group 2B (n=25).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. All the women in group 1A and group 2A will receive intravaginal misoprostol tablets&#xD;
           moistened with 3 ml of 5% acetic acid, and all the women in group 1B and group 2B will&#xD;
           receive intravaginal misoprostol tablets moistened with water, 400 micrograms every 4&#xD;
           hours for a maximum of 5 doses within 24 hours. If the patient will not have adequate&#xD;
           uterine contractions, the same regimen will be repeated over the following 24 hours, and&#xD;
           if no response will be achieved, this will be considered a failure of therapy, and&#xD;
           another method will be used like large doses of oxytocin or cervical dilatation by&#xD;
           foley's catheter no.16.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. assessment will be though the occurrence of uterine contraction and progress of abortion&#xD;
           with induction -termination interval as a primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The investigator will supervise application of the medication dose by dose. Subjects&#xD;
           withdrawn from the study before the onset of spontaneous labor&#xD;
