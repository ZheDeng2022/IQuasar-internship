  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High joint load during walking has been linked to cartilage degradation. Biomarkers, found in&#xD;
      the blood and urine, are protein fragments released after cartilage degradation&#xD;
      characteristic of OA. They have the potential to enable direct and immediate disease state&#xD;
      monitoring and identification of early cartilage changes. Little is known about the&#xD;
      association of biomarkers with joint load or if exercise aimed at reducing joint load changes&#xD;
      biomarker levels, thus reducing the risk of OA progression. This study will provide novel&#xD;
      information on these relationships and will guide future intervention studies. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that certain biomarkers will be highly correlated with joint&#xD;
      loading during walking and that the levels of these biomarkers in the blood and urine will&#xD;
      decrease following an exercise intervention aimed at cartilage unloading.&#xD;

      Participants will be tested twice (baseline and 11 weeks later) where they will undergo gait&#xD;
      and strength analyses by the same blinded assessor, complete self-report questionnaires, and&#xD;
      have blood and urine samples drawn. Participants will then be randomized into either: (i)&#xD;
      exercise; or (ii) usual care (no additional treatment). Those in the exercise group will&#xD;
      complete 10-weeks of strengthening targeting lower limb muscles. Once weekly, they will&#xD;
      consult with the study physiotherapist (MAH) at UBC to ensure proper performance and safe&#xD;
      progression of exercises. Participants will be given cuff weights and resistance bands to&#xD;
      complete exercises at home five times per week. Exercise compliance will be monitored using&#xD;
      log books. All participants will be encouraged to maintain their usual treatment regimen&#xD;
      (except for exercises completed by the exercise group), but will document any unexpected&#xD;
      alterations such as medication changes or physician visits.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the exercise group will receive a lower limb strengthening program consisting of 6 exercises targeting the quadriceps, hamstrings, and hip abductor groups. They will perform these exercises at home 4 times per week (3 sets of 10 repetitions per exercise). Over the course of the intervention, each participant will consult with the physiotherapist a total of 5 times (once per week in weeks: 1,2,3,5, and 8) to ensure proper performance of exercises and safe progression of resistance.</description>
