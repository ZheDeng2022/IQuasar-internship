      This phase I clinical trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of vorinostat when&#xD;
      given together with paclitaxel and carboplatin in treating patients with metastatic or&#xD;
      recurrent solid tumors and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Vorinostat may stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used&#xD;
      in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving&#xD;
      vorinostat together with paclitaxel and carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: An administrative decision was made by NCI to halt further study of vorinostat in this&#xD;
      specific patient population as of February 1, 2013. No patients remain on vorinostat. Going&#xD;
      forward this study will determine the safety and tolerability of the paclitaxel and&#xD;
      carboplatin combination in this patient population.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of vorinostat in combination with paclitaxel and&#xD;
      carboplatin in solid tumor patients with HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *NOTE: An administrative decision was made by Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) to&#xD;
      halt further study of vorinostat in this specific patient population as of February 1, 2013,&#xD;
      and no patients remain on vorinostat. The primary objective going forward will determine the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of the paclitaxel and carboplatin combination in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To preliminarily assess response rates of the therapeutic combination in lung, head and&#xD;
      neck, and esophageal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the pathological characteristics of non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome&#xD;
      (AIDS) defining cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the presence and oncogenic activity of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection&#xD;
      in tumor tissues and to correlate HPV infection with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To investigate possible pharmacokinetic interactions between paclitaxel and&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy in persons with HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of vorinostat followed by an expansion&#xD;
      cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily on days 1-5 and paclitaxel intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 3. Treatment repeats every 21&#xD;
      days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during course 1&#xD;
      for pharmacokinetic studies and HIV viral load analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: An administrative decision was made by CTEP to halt further study of vorinostat in this&#xD;
      specific patient population as of February 1, 2013. No patients remain on vorinostat. The&#xD;
      primary objective going forward will determine the safety and tolerability of the paclitaxel&#xD;
      and carboplatin combination in this patient population, without vorinostat. The information&#xD;
      pertaining to vorinostat is for historical purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 3 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have known HIV infection and histologically confirmed solid malignancy&#xD;
             that is metastatic or unresectable and is therefore incurable; although the focus of&#xD;
             this trial will be on upper aerodigestive cancers (non-small cell lung cancer, head&#xD;
             and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and non-gastroesophageal junction esophageal&#xD;
             cancer), patients with other incurable solid tumor with disease potentially sensitive&#xD;
             to carboplatin and/or taxanes (including but not limited to salivary gland cancer,&#xD;
             gastric cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or anal cancer, BUT excluding Kaposi&#xD;
             sarcoma), will be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Up to 1 prior systemic therapy regimen will be permitted for palliative treatment of&#xD;
             metastatic or unresectable relapsed disease; however, previous chemotherapy delivered&#xD;
             with curative-intent (i.e., chemoradiotherapy or adjuvant [postoperative] chemotherapy&#xD;
             at a time disease was considered potentially curable) will be permitted; prior taxane&#xD;
             (including paclitaxel or docetaxel) and/or platinum exposure will be permitted;&#xD;
             however, patients must not experience disease progression within 3 months of&#xD;
             platinum-based therapy; at least 4 weeks must have elapsed since prior chemotherapy or&#xD;
             radiation therapy, 6 weeks if the last regimen included carmustine (BCNU) or mitomycin&#xD;
             C; toxicities from prior anticancer therapy must have recovered to =&lt; Grade 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serologic documentation of HIV infection at any time prior to study entry, as&#xD;
             evidenced by positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), positive Western&#xD;
             Blot, or any other federally approved licensed HIV test; a positive HIV viral load&#xD;
             prior to study entry will also be permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 50%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase&#xD;
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT)(serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt;&#xD;
             2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 50&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additionally, serum magnesium and potassium must be within institutional normal&#xD;
             limits, and a CD4 count &gt; 100/mcL will be required within 2 weeks of study&#xD;
             participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of at least one measureable tumor lesion is required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participating patients must receive medically appropriate care and treatment for HIV&#xD;
             infection, including antiretroviral medications, when clinically indicated, and should&#xD;
             be under the care of a physician experienced in HIV management; with the exception of&#xD;
             treatment with zidovudine and stavudine, patients will be eligible regardless of&#xD;
             antiretroviral regimen (no antiretroviral therapy, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase&#xD;
             inhibitors [NNRTI]-based therapy, or protease inhibitor based therapy), provided there&#xD;
             is no intention to initiate therapy or the regimen has been stable for at least 4&#xD;
             weeks with no intention to change the regimen within 8 weeks following study entry;&#xD;
             the exact regimen used for HIV therapy will be captured on Case Report Forms; as&#xD;
             study-specific (antiretroviral therapy-based) strata fill, however, only patients&#xD;
             fitting the remaining open strata will be accrued&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because histone deacetylase inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in&#xD;
             this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry, during the duration of study participation, and for&#xD;
             at least 3 months following study completion; should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately; women of child-bearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 7 days before initiation of study drug dosing; post menopausal&#xD;
             women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing&#xD;
             potential; (Note: A woman of childbearing potential is one who is biologically capable&#xD;
             of becoming pregnant; this includes women who are using contraceptives or whose sexual&#xD;
             partners are either sterile or using contraceptives)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document;&#xD;
             as the correlative studies are critical to the clinical and scientific value of the&#xD;
             trial, CD4 count/HIV viral load determinations will be required, and participation in&#xD;
             the tumor-based correlative studies will be strongly recommended; additionally,&#xD;
             investigators MUST request sample donation to the AIDS Cancer Specimen Resource&#xD;
             (ACSR); however, the patient may refuse sample donation; patients accrued to the&#xD;
             expansion phase of the study will be required to undergo pharmacokinetic sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must in the opinion of the Investigator be capable of complying with this&#xD;
             protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events (toxicities not improved to =&lt; Grade 1) due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier; additionally, patients experiencing disease&#xD;
             progression within 3 months of platinum-based therapy will be excluded from trial&#xD;
             participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to availability of effective first- and second-line therapies (as well as&#xD;
             disease-specific clinical trials), patients with diagnosis of active Kaposi sarcoma&#xD;
             will be excluded from study participation; however, persons with other active&#xD;
             malignancy with prior history of Kaposi sarcoma can be considered for participation at&#xD;
             the discretion of the Study Chair&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to the study agents used in study (including hypersensitivity to&#xD;
             paclitaxel, Cremophor, or platins)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects assigned to take vorinostat, inability to take oral medications;&#xD;
             vorinostat capsules must be administered whole; note: this criterion does NOT apply to&#xD;
             subjects treated on the Expansion Cohort (accruals post February 1, 2013)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As ketoconazole may inhibit paclitaxel metabolism, patients receiving ketoconazole for&#xD;
             any treatment indication are ineligible; patients receiving any other medications or&#xD;
             substances that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 enzymes will be eligible;&#xD;
             however, use all such medications or substances must be documented in the Case Report&#xD;
             Forms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects assigned to take vorinostat, prior exposure to vorinostat or other known&#xD;
             histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors for cancer therapy; patients should not have&#xD;
             taken valproic acid, another histone deacetylase inhibitor, for at least 2 weeks prior&#xD;
             to study enrollment; note: this criterion does NOT apply to subjects treated on the&#xD;
             Expansion Cohort (accruals post February 1, 2013)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Since zidovudine and stavudine have potential for severe hematological toxicity&#xD;
             potentially overlapping with toxicities of the study therapy, treatment with these&#xD;
             agents will be disallowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to potential toxicity associated with study therapy (particularly with&#xD;
             paclitaxel), patients with peripheral neuropathy &gt; Grade 1 will be excluded from study&#xD;
             participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, opportunistic infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable&#xD;
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements; patients with HIV infection will be&#xD;
             eligible provided they meet the criteria specified; patients with known Hepatitis B&#xD;
             infection should be screened for active disease prior to study participation; patients&#xD;
             with chronic Hepatitis C infection will be eligible at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study and women who become pregnant while on&#xD;
             study must be immediately discontinued; women who are breastfeeding will not be&#xD;
             eligible for study participation&#xD;
