    <textblock>
      MK-2206 is a newly discovered drug that may slow or stop cancer growth. This drug has been&#xD;
      used in other research studies, and information from those other research studies suggests&#xD;
      that MK-2206 may help to slow or stop the growth of malignant gliomas. In addition, MK-2206&#xD;
      has the capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a&#xD;
      separation of circulating blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS); and although it serves as a protective barrier, it can often interfere with&#xD;
      potentially beneficial treatments reaching the brain successfully. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators hope that because MK-2206 can successfully cross the blood-brain barrier, it&#xD;
      will be more effective in patients. The purpose of this study is to see how well MK-2206&#xD;
      works in patients with malignant gliomas and will be conducted in two parts: Part 1 and Part&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study will investigate the effects of MK-2206 on Akt signaling in tumor tissue.&#xD;
      Ten patients with recurrent GBM who require reoperation will receive a short pre-operative&#xD;
      course of MK-2206. After recovery from surgery, patients will resume MK-2206 until disease&#xD;
      progression or the development of unacceptable toxicities. Part 2 of this trial will be&#xD;
      initiated only AFTER analysis of Part 1 data shows drug penetration into tumor tissue; if&#xD;
      there is no significant drug penetration into the tumor and/or there is no reduction of pAkt&#xD;
      levels, progression to Part 2 of the trial will be halted. The primary goal of Part 2 is to&#xD;
      determine the therapeutic efficacy of MK-2206 as measured by 6-month progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS6). In Part 2, 40 participants with GBM and 18 with anaplastic glioma will be&#xD;
      treated with MK-2206 weekly at a dose selected on the basis of an ongoing phase 1 study.&#xD;
      Treatment duration will be measured in 4-week cycles. Participants will remain on treatment&#xD;
      until tumor progression, as long as there are no unacceptable toxicities. Responses will be&#xD;
      assessed by clinical examinations every 4 weeks and MRI scans every 8 weeks.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Participants will have the following tests and procedures within 2 days before the first&#xD;
           dose of MK-2206: medical history, physical examination, blood tests, urine tests and&#xD;
           EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in Part 2 of this research study may also have optional FDG-PET imaging&#xD;
           done. If the participant agrees, they will have two PET scans performed; one within a&#xD;
           week before beginning study drug, and another within 3 days after starting study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in Part 1 will take MK-2206 orally prior to surgery on days 1-8 (with&#xD;
           surgery after the MK-2206 dose on day 8). They will have an EKG within 4-8 hours after&#xD;
           their first dose of MK-2206, and again on Day 8. During surgery, a sample of the tumor&#xD;
           will be taken for research. The tumor tissue will be analyzed to measure the level of&#xD;
           MK-2206 in the tumor and to study the effect of the drug on the tumor. Genetic tests&#xD;
           will be done on the tumor tissue to determine if the tumor's genetic profile can predict&#xD;
           response to treatment. You will also have 3 teaspoons of blood drawn to measure the&#xD;
           level of MK-2206 in the blood. An assessment of the participant's tumor by MRI or CT&#xD;
           scan will be done within 96 hours of surgery to determine how much of the tumor has been&#xD;
           removed. One to 4 weeks after surgery (within 14 days of the last MRI/CT scan), MK-2206&#xD;
           treatment will restart at the same schedule as before surgery (weekly dosing). Within 2&#xD;
           days prior to restarting MK-2206 the following tests and procedures must be completed:&#xD;
           medical history, physical examination, blood tests, urine test and EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in both groups will receive MK-2206 by mouth once a week (Days 1, 8, 15,&#xD;
           and 22). Participants will receive an EKG within 4-8 hours after their first dose of&#xD;
           MK-2206 (for Part 1 participants, this is day 1 pre-surgery; for Part 2 participants,&#xD;
           this is day 1 of the first cycle of treatment). Participants will receive an EKG weekly&#xD;
           during their first cycle of treatment with MK-2206. The following tests and procedures&#xD;
           are required within 2 days before the start of each subsequent 4-week cycle of MK-2206&#xD;
           treatment: medical history, physical examination, blood tests, urine test, and EKG. Each&#xD;
           treatment cycle lasts 4 weeks during which time participants will be taking the study&#xD;
           drug once a week. In addition, patients will also need the following tests/procedures&#xD;
           performed during treatment cycles: medical history and physical examination on Day 15&#xD;
           (+/- 2 days) of Cycles 1 and 2 and blood tests weekly during Cycle 1 and on Day 15 (+/-&#xD;
           2 days) of cycle 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessments of the tumor by MRI will be performed within one week prior to the start of&#xD;
           each odd-numbered cycle, starting with cycle 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants can continue to receive study drug until their disease worsens or develop&#xD;
           unacceptable side effects.&#xD;
