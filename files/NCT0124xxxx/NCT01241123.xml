  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Fast-track&quot; or &quot;enhanced recovery&quot; programs, which are the new standardized accelerated&#xD;
      clinical pathways for post-operative care for colorectal surgeries, have three goals: to 1)&#xD;
      quicken the return of bowel function (as evidenced by passage of flatus and stool), 2)&#xD;
      decrease the length of hospital stays, and 3) decrease the rate of overall complications.&#xD;
      Aside from several components, or interventions that can vary from institution to&#xD;
      institution, these programs share three common modalities: early oral feeding, protocol pain&#xD;
      management regimens less dependent on opioid use, and early mobilization (i.e. ambulation).&#xD;
      Evidence-based practice has shown that the modalities individually contribute significantly&#xD;
      to the program goals except for post-operative ambulation, which has not been shown to&#xD;
      increase bowel function although it contributes to decreased pulmonary complications and&#xD;
      early discharge of patients. Still, surgeons continue to advocate for early ambulation to aid&#xD;
      in the return of bowel function despite the lack of clear evidence supporting this notion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a randomized, prospective clinical trial exploring the impact that&#xD;
      post-operative ambulation has on the outcome of colorectal surgeries, particularly on the&#xD;
      return of bowel function and the length of hospital stay. With the use of pedometers to&#xD;
      measure physical activity, the investigators will subject patients to either the current&#xD;
      traditional post-operative care or one with an aggressive ambulation regimen. Through the use&#xD;
      of radiopaque markers, the investigators hope to correlate increased ambulation with&#xD;
      increased gastrointestinal motility function to prove the impact of early ambulation on&#xD;
      post-operative care.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject patients are those who will undergo colorectal surgeries at NMCP. Colorectal&#xD;
             surgery is defined as any surgery involving the gastrointestinal tract from the&#xD;
             ileocecal valve to the dentate line and includes all laparoscopic approaches. This&#xD;
             surgery includes, but is not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ileocecetomy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Partial colectomy (including right, left, and sigmoid colectomies)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hartmann procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abdominal colectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Proctocolectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Colostomy formation or takedown&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Low anterior resection&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abdominoperineal resection&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reasons for subject exclusion are non-ambulatory conditions are conditions whereby a&#xD;
             subject cannot walk or move from place to place. Examples of non-ambulatory conditions&#xD;
             include but are not limited to: severe vasculopathy with limiting claudication (leg&#xD;
             pain when ambulating due to poor blood flow) of less than 100 meters, all wheelchair&#xD;
             bound conditions (anatomically missing both legs without adequate prosthesis, severely&#xD;
             limiting pulmonary disease, neurologic disorders - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,&#xD;
             severe multiple sclerosis, paraplegia), fractured leg bones requiring temporary and/or&#xD;
             permanent use of a walking aid or any congenital disorders limiting ambulation&#xD;
             (osteogenesis imperfecta, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy). Any patient who takes&#xD;
             Alvimopan (Entereg Â®) will be excluded or terminated from the study. Alvimopan is an&#xD;
             FDA-approved drug that accelerates bowel motility and is used to prevent and/or treat&#xD;
             post-operative ileus. In addition, patients with underlying gastrointestinal motility&#xD;
             issues, gastroparesis, chronic constipation, etc or who may have complications who may&#xD;
             not be able to ambulate during the hospital course (i.e. prolonged intubated&#xD;
             postoperatively) will be excluded as well. Pregnant women will also be excluded from&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
