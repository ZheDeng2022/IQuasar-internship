      Spinal cord injury (SCI) usually affects young people and causes severe bowel and bladder&#xD;
      dysfunction. Recently, the concept of a surgically created somat-sensory reflex arch for&#xD;
      bladder dysfunction in SCI has been introduced. The concept is promising, not just for&#xD;
      bladder but also for bowel dysfunction. However, well designed studies need to be performed&#xD;
      before recommending the procedure to a large number of patients worldwide. In this study we&#xD;
      perform multidisciplinary studies providing necessary information about the clinical outcome&#xD;
      of the somato-sensory reflex arch in adult SCI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In a &quot;western setting&quot; the somato-sensory reflex arch can be created in adult SCI&#xD;
           patients with only minor morbidity and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Somato-sensory reflex arch reduces bladder and bowel symptoms in SCI patients.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal cord injury has a profound impact on the lives of those affected. Quality of life is&#xD;
      restricted not only by immobility but also by severe neurogenic bladder and bowel&#xD;
      dysfunction. For example, 66% of SCI patients have to empty their rectum digitally, 75%&#xD;
      suffer from faecal incontinence and 9% spend more than 60 minutes each time they defecate.&#xD;
      Neurological impairment due to SCI is permanent and the average age at injury is only 28&#xD;
      years. The longevity of individuals with SCI is approaching that of the general population&#xD;
      and, accordingly, most patients have to live for several decades with severe bladder and&#xD;
      bowel symptoms. It is estimated that the number of individuals with SCI in Denmark is 3.000&#xD;
      and each year 10.000 persons in the European Union sustain a SCI. Even though clean&#xD;
      intermittent catheterization has successfully reduced mortality due to urinary tract&#xD;
      infections or reflux and though several new treatment modalities for neurogenic bowel&#xD;
      dysfunction have been introduced, both bladder and bowel dysfunction still rank among the top&#xD;
      three causes of impairment of quality of life after SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Somato-sensory reflex arch:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept was pioneered by professor Xiao. Animal studies and basic clinical research were&#xD;
      performed in the United States and later human clinical studies have been done in Wuhan,&#xD;
      China. The surgical procedure principle can briefly be summarized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All spinal nerves have an anterior efferent root and a posterior afferent root. For the&#xD;
      somato-sensory reflex arch (or &quot;Xiao procedure&quot;) the posterior (afferent or sensory) root of&#xD;
      the 5th lumbar nerve (L5) is kept while the anterior root is cut and anastomosed to the&#xD;
      anterior root of a lower segment, usually the third sacral segment (S3). Thereby, a new&#xD;
      reflex arch has been created from the skin of the leg through the sensory part of L5 to the&#xD;
      spinal cord and further through the anastomosis via S2 or S3 to the bladder and bowel. Strong&#xD;
      stimuli at the L5 dermatome, i.e. scratching or electrical stimulation, will then initiate&#xD;
      voiding (6,7). Effects of the somato-sensory reflex arch on neurogenic bowel dysfunction have&#xD;
      not been studied, but clinical experience indicates that bowel management is substantially&#xD;
      facilitated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Xiao procedure introduces a completely new concept for management of spinal cord lesions&#xD;
      and it has been greeted with optimism worldwide. The number of patients operated in China&#xD;
      alone is now more than 3.000 and centres in the United States, Germany and Israel have&#xD;
      introduced or modified it. Furthermore, centres in Australia, Finland and Denmark plan to&#xD;
      introduce it within the present year. There are, however, serious concerns that need to be&#xD;
      addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up has only been done in very few patients and physiological studies after&#xD;
      the procedure are equally few and small.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of the very large number of patients operated in China logistic or cultural factors&#xD;
      have prohibited effective follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minor improvement in bladder and bowel function may be important to a Chinese patient&#xD;
      without access to other treatment but it is unknown whether the Xiao procedure will be an&#xD;
      advantage to patients in a western healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mode of action of the somato-sensory reflex arch is very incompletely studied and the&#xD;
      mode of action on bowel function not studied at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the widespread use of somato-sensory reflex arch we find it of utmost importance that&#xD;
      well designed studies with validated or even objective endpoints are performed. Results of&#xD;
      such studies will have an international impact in either defining indications for a&#xD;
      completely new treatment principle or, otherwise, in preventing the widespread use of an&#xD;
      ineffective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In March 2009 the core members of our multidisciplinary study team went on a study tour to&#xD;
      Wuhan, China. In Wuhan a staggering number of 600 patients had the somato-sensory reflex arch&#xD;
      procedure performed in 2008. Based on experience from our visit we pose the following&#xD;
      hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In a &quot;western setting&quot; the somato-sensory reflex arch can be created in adult SCI&#xD;
           patients with only minor morbidity and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Somato-sensory reflex arch reduces bladder and bowel symptoms in SCI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal cord injured patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internationally, two indications for the somato-sensory reflex arch are emerging:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with bladder dysfunction due supraconal SCI (above the conus medullaris) and&#xD;
      Children with bladder dysfunction due to spinal bifida. Most children with spinal bifida have&#xD;
      motor incomplete lesions and, accordingly, the surgical procedure carries a risk of&#xD;
      long-lasting or even permanent loss of motor function - typically loss of dorsiflexion of the&#xD;
      foot. Whether results from the procedure justify that risk remains to be determined. In&#xD;
      contrast, patients with motor complete supraconal SCI, and thereby complete loss of voluntary&#xD;
      muscle function below the level of injury, do not run that risk. Therefore, it has been&#xD;
      decided that patients in group a) above will be offered the procedure at the Department of&#xD;
      Neurosurgery NK, AUH. Initially, 20 patients will undergo the procedure. As the method is&#xD;
      new, surgery and follow-up will be performed under strict monitoring with emphasis on&#xD;
      neurophysiologic testing and potential complications. Approval will be obtained from the&#xD;
      Ethics Committee, patients will be very carefully informed by the neurosurgeon (Dorte&#xD;
      Clemmensen) and informed consent will be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relatively minor surgical procedure has been described in previously. In summary: A&#xD;
      hemilaminectomy of L5-S1 is performed. By means of neurophysiology testing the 5th lumbar&#xD;
      root and 2nd or 3rd sacral roots are identified on one side. The perineurium is opened and&#xD;
      the motor roots are separated from the sensory. The motor roots are transsected and a&#xD;
      microanastomosis is created between L5 and S2 or S3. After surgery sprouting occurs and after&#xD;
      12-18 months the reflex arch is functional. Time till clinical effect is therefore also 12-18&#xD;
      months. The advantage of the procedure is that it is performed through a hemilaminectomy of&#xD;
      only two segments and the surgical stress in relatively small. The patients are expected to&#xD;
      be in their habitual condition within 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post surgical monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through informal contacts it has been agreed that complications and basic functional results&#xD;
      from three centres about to adopt the procedure (Melbourne, Australia; Helsinki, Finland; and&#xD;
      Aarhus, Denmark) will be recorded in a standardized way. Preliminary principles for&#xD;
      assessment have been agreed upon and other centres introducing the procedure in the future&#xD;
      will be invited to participate. This will allow comparison of results between centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study A). Detailed assessment of functional results of the somato-sensory reflex arch To&#xD;
      patients the main concern is whether the procedure is safe and reduces symptoms. Detailed and&#xD;
      internationally accepted evaluation forms for adult SCI patients have recently been&#xD;
      developed. The so called International Spinal Cord Injury Data Sets have been endorsed by the&#xD;
      International Spinal Cord Organisation (ISCoS) and the American Spinal Cord Association&#xD;
      (ASIA). Information within the data sets are mainly symptom based but for lower urinary tract&#xD;
      function urodynamic assessment is included and for bowel function radiographically determined&#xD;
      colorectal transit time is included. From the bowel function data sets the most commonly used&#xD;
      scores for bowel dysfunction, including the Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score, developed at&#xD;
      our unit, can be computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing the surgical procedure will be assessed using the basic and extended&#xD;
      lower urinary tract data sets and the bowel function data sets before surgery and 18 months&#xD;
      after. Before&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the investigations above, we aim at publishing the following sub-studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A1). Prospective study of urodynamic function and bladder symptoms before and after&#xD;
      somato-autonomic reflex arch in spinal cord injury patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A2). Prospective study of colorectal symptoms before and after somato-autonomic reflex arch&#xD;
      in spinal cord injury patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A3). Prospective study of colorectal transit times and rectal wall properties after&#xD;
      somato-autonomic reflex arch in spinal cord injury patients.&#xD;
