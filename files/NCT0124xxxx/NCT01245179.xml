  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out about the safety and effects of a&#xD;
      drug called panobinostat when given to adults with sickle cell disease. Panobinostat is a pan&#xD;
      histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. HDAC inhibitors have been shown to significantly&#xD;
      increase hemoglobin F induction, which is well documented to improve outcomes in sickle cell&#xD;
      disease. HDAC inhibitors are also known to potently inhibit cell-specific inflammation, which&#xD;
      is a primary contributor to the debilitating effects of sickle cell disease. Given the&#xD;
      relevance of these mechanisms of action in SCD, panobinostat may prove to contribute&#xD;
      significantly to the management of SCD patients, a population in critical need of further&#xD;
      effective treatment options.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-arm, open-label, Phase I, dose-escalation study of Panobinostat administered&#xD;
      via different dosing schedules. In each schedule, this study is designed to determine the MTD&#xD;
      (maximum tolerated dose) and DLT (dose limiting toxicities) of panobinostat as a single&#xD;
      agent, and to characterize the safety and tolerability of panobinostat in adult patients with&#xD;
      sickle cell disease who have failed to respond to hydroxyurea therapy (clinically or&#xD;
      hematologically) or are intolerant of or refuse hydroxyurea therapy. The study consists of a&#xD;
      Screening Phase, Treatment Phase, and Post-Treatment Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened for eligibility within 28 days of baseline visit (Day 1). Screening&#xD;
      assessments will include informed consent, physical exam, vital signs (height, weight, blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate, height, weight, and respirations), review of medical history, review of&#xD;
      concomitant medications, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, and laboratory&#xD;
      assessments. Screening laboratory assessments will include the following: CBC with&#xD;
      differential, reticulocytes, complete chemistry panel, LDH, serum ferritin, thyroid function&#xD;
      testing, Hb F percentage, F-cells, viral serology, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, and serum&#xD;
      pregnancy in all females of childbearing potential. Approximately 15 ml (1 tablespoon) of&#xD;
      blood will be collected at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Treatment Phase is twelve weeks in duration. Each subject will be assigned to a specified&#xD;
      dose level and dosing schedule and will remain with the assigned regimen, if tolerated,&#xD;
      throughout the twelve-week period. Patients at a given dosing regimen must complete at least&#xD;
      4 weeks of treatment before treatment decisions are made for subsequent participants.&#xD;
      Regardless of specific dosing assignment, all subjects will take study drug thrice weekly&#xD;
      (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) throughout the duration of the 12-week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first three patients to enroll in the study will be assigned to a dose level of 15 mg&#xD;
      panobinostat, with continuous thrice weekly treatment for the entire 12-week treatment&#xD;
      period. Based on how well this regimen is tolerated, the next group of three subjects will&#xD;
      either be assigned the same regimen or a reduced, intermittent schedule of three weeks on&#xD;
      treatment followed by one week off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment decisions will continue accordingly, after each group of three subjects is treated&#xD;
      with a given regimen. Six patients must be treated safely at a given dosing regimen before&#xD;
      enrollment can advance to the next, higher level. Once the Maximum Tolerated Dose is&#xD;
      determined, all subsequent patients will be enrolled to that regimen, with a total of up to&#xD;
      18 subjects enrolled. The four dosing regimens to be explored are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 15 mg MWF 3 weeks on, 1 week off (only needed if starting regimen requires dose&#xD;
           de-escalation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 15 mg MWF every week (starting dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 20 mg MWF 3 weeks on, 1 week off&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 20 mg MWF every week During the Treatment Phase, safety and efficacy assessments will be&#xD;
           performed at specified times, and will include: physical examination, vital signs&#xD;
           (weight, blood pressure, heart rate, height, weight, and respirations), adverse events&#xD;
           assessment, ECG, quality of life questionnaire (ASCQMe), and laboratory assessments.&#xD;
           Treatment Phase lab assessments are to be performed at specified visits and include CBC&#xD;
           with differential, reticulocytes, complete chemistry panel, LDH, serum ferritin, Hb F&#xD;
           percentage, F-cells, thyroid function testing, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, and urine&#xD;
           pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential. Approximately 15 ml (3 teaspoons) of&#xD;
           blood will be collected at each treatment visit. Every four weeks, an additional 5 ml of&#xD;
           blood will be collected for inflammatory markers and protein biomarkers, for a total of&#xD;
           20 ml. On Day 1 (pre-treatment) and Day 85 (post-treatment), when additional samples are&#xD;
           collected for genetic/ mechanistic studies, total volume collected is 25 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug will initially be dispensed at the baseline visit and every four weeks thereafter.&#xD;
      Study drug accountability should be assessed at every visit. All baseline assessments will be&#xD;
      completed prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up visit will be performed 4 weeks after end of treatment. Follow-up assessments&#xD;
      will include: physical examination, vital signs, adverse events assessment, ECG, and&#xD;
      laboratory assessments (CBC with differential, reticulocytes, complete chemistry panel, LDH,&#xD;
      Hb F percentage, F-cells, and inflammatory markers). Approximately 15 ml (3 teaspoons) of&#xD;
      blood will be collected at the follow-up visit.&#xD;
