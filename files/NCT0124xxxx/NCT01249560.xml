    <textblock>
      The objective of the antiretroviral treatment is to inhibit the viral replication,&#xD;
      estimated(appreciated) by the measure of the viral plasmatic load(responsibility). In this&#xD;
      inhibition of the viral replication usually joins an immune reconstruction [ 1 ].&#xD;
      Nevertheless, a viro-immunological dissociation, i.e. an undetectable viral&#xD;
      load(responsibility) and an absence of immune reconstruction, is regularly observed. It is&#xD;
      now turned out that an undetectable viral load(responsibility) does not correspond to the&#xD;
      total absence of viral replication and that it is possible to detect of the intracellular&#xD;
      pro-viral DNA . Raltegravir ®, because of its mode of action(share) inhibiting the&#xD;
      integration of the pro-viral DNA in the chromosomes of the infected cells(units) , could&#xD;
      decrease the intracellular reservoir of monocyte-macrophages, improve the homeostasis, so&#xD;
      optimizing the cooperation lymphocytes T - macrophages. Several experimental data suggest&#xD;
      that the regression of the abnormalities of cellular interactions, and the rate of apoptose&#xD;
      abnormally raised(abnormally brought up) by cells(units) T at the patients in&#xD;
      viro-immunological dissociation, could be obtained .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims at measuring the impact of Raltegravir ® on the viral reservoirs lymphocyte&#xD;
      and monocyte, to quantify the expression of the molecules of costimulation, the&#xD;
      source(spring) of intercellular interactions lymphocytes - monocytes, and to measure the rate&#xD;
      of apoptose of the cells(units) T.&#xD;

    <description>To illustrate the cause and effect relationship between the abnormalities of the distribution(casting) of the molecules of co-activation and the rate of apoptose, we compare also 2 groups: a first group of patients with a rate of apoptose normal ( n=10 ), and another group of patients having a rate of apoptose aggravated ( n=10 ).&#xD;
20 eligible patients will receive their treatment to J1 and will be estimated for the residual concentration of the raltegravir ®, the antiretroviral activity, the tolerance and the observance at the treatments of the study in the visits of evaluation of M1, M2, M3, M6, M12, and / or in case of premature stop(ruling) of the try(essay). Every visit will give rise to a clinical evaluation of the patient. The arisen of unwanted events</description>
