      This is an open-label phase Ib multi-institution trial that evaluates the safety&#xD;
      profile/tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor effect of BKM120 (a PI3K inhibitor) and&#xD;
      endocrine therapy combination and BEZ235 (a PI3K/ mTOR inhibitor) and endocrine therapy&#xD;
      combination in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast&#xD;

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose of BKM120 or BEZ235 given in combination with endocrine therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose for each of the arms will be defined as the highest dose tested in which a DLT is experienced by 0 out of 3 or 1 out of 6 patients among the dose levels. The first cohort of patients (3 patients) in each arm will be started at dose level 1, and each patient will be observed for 4 weeks on the specified dose.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients with Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after off-treatment date</time_frame>
    <description>The overall PFS data will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with the 95% confidence interval. The Cox proportional hazards model will be applied to investigate potential prognostic factors, such as disease free interval after completion of adjuvant endocrine therapy on the time to event data. The adjusted p-values as well as the adjusted 95% confidence intervals from the Cox model will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Rate (RR)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after off-treament date</time_frame>
    <description>All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those who received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the response rate.</description>
