      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the Athena project is to develop an ostomy product that is softer and more&#xD;
      flexible in order to improve the comfort for people with a stoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present investigation aims at testing how well the new Athena base plate adhere to&#xD;
      perspiring skin both with and without mechanical exposure (cycling) since the ability to&#xD;
      adhere under normal daily activity is an important quality for Coloplast products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigation is an explorative investigation where the adherence of Athena on perspiring&#xD;
      skin is evaluated. Due to the explorative nature of the study it has not been possible to&#xD;
      define specific success criteria up front. However, the adherence qualities of Athena may not&#xD;
      be significantly reduced compared to SenSura.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of men, one group with a colostomy and one group without a colostomy, are&#xD;
      included. The men should be cardiovascular fit, be able to cycle for 1 hour at moderate&#xD;
      intensity and with Athena and SenSura base plates applied on the back and stomach. The&#xD;
      adhesion of the base plates are tested before and after the physical activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population consists of two groups. Group A: Men in the age of 50-70 without a stoma who&#xD;
      have volunteered. Group B: Men with a colostomy who have volunteered. Both groups should be&#xD;
      cardiovascular fit (cardio investigated), and be willing to cycle for 1 hour at moderate&#xD;
      intensity on an exercise bike.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Athena test products are non-CE marked, non-sterile, 1-piece ostomy products with a flat&#xD;
      custom cut base plate, a closed bag size midi or maxi with the intended use of collecting&#xD;
      faeces from the colostomy. The comparator product is a Coloplast SenSura, 1-piece ostomy&#xD;
      product with a closed bag. SenSura is CE-marked and launched on the market.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the Athena project is to develop an ostomy product, for people with a colostomy,&#xD;
      with better comfort than other normal ostomy products. This has been attempted through&#xD;
      development of a soft and flexible base plate that follows the contours of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the aim of Coloplast to gain knowledge about whether the Athena base plate can adhere&#xD;
      to peristomal skin to the same degree as the SenSura base plate in situations of perspiration&#xD;
      both with and without mechanical exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint Calculation of the area of the base plate that has detached from the skin.&#xD;
      The area is based on a visual evaluation of Athena and SenSura adhesives measured on the skin&#xD;
      of the stomach after 1 hour of cycling at moderate intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registration of the weight of the adhesive after physical activity on the bike and after&#xD;
           1 hour in a warm room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the effects on the skin measured as number of skin cells on the adhesive&#xD;
           after use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss of liquid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peel test (tractive force) of the adhesive on the skin of the stomach (mechanical&#xD;
           exposure and perspiration).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peel test (tractive force) of the adhesive on the skin of the back (perspiration without&#xD;
           the mechanical exposure).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculation of the area that has detached from the skin based on a visual evaluation of&#xD;
           the adhesives on the skin of the back (perspiration without mechanical exposure).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mechanical evaluation of the area of the adhesive that no longer adhere to the skin on&#xD;
           both the stomach and on the back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoint(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test of health (is evaluated by the responsible physician and cardiologist).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test of fitness (fitness rating).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unexpected clinical occurrence (adverse events, AE) / Serious unexpected clinical&#xD;
           occurrence (serious adverse events, SAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria of success The investigation is an explorative investigation where the adherence of&#xD;
      Athena on perspiring skin is evaluated. Due to the explorative nature of the study it has not&#xD;
      been possible to define specific success criteria up front. However, the adherence qualities&#xD;
      of Athena may not be significantly reduced compared to SenSura.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the clinical study Study design The investigation is designed as a randomized&#xD;
      control study with 2 groups: A and B. Group A includes 15 healthy men in the age of 50-70&#xD;
      years who have volunteered. Group B includes 15 men with a colostomy who have volunteered.&#xD;
      All persons included should have a healthy cardiovascular system (see below) allowing them to&#xD;
      accomplish one hour of cycling at moderate intensity. Both screening and test will take place&#xD;
      at the Physicians Test Centre (Lægernes Test Center), Skodsborg Strandvej 215 A, 2942&#xD;
      Skodsborg, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 participants will be invited for screening. Those who are evaluated as suitable will be&#xD;
      invited to proceed in the investigation. If more than 15 men without a stoma or more than 15&#xD;
      men with a stoma are evaluated as suitable for the test then the additional persons will be&#xD;
      invited to register on a waiting list and they will be informed about participation in the&#xD;
      investigation if needed. If less than 15 men without a stoma or 15 men with a stoma are&#xD;
      evaluate as suitable then the investigation will proceed with the persons available. There&#xD;
      will be no further recruitment of additional subjects after the screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clinical Protocol is signed by the responsible investigator at the Physicians Test Centre&#xD;
      before the test will take place. The responsible investigator and other physicians who will&#xD;
      act as investigators will receive thorough information about the investigation. Before&#xD;
      recruitment of subjects the investigators will be trained in how to inform the subjects about&#xD;
      the investigation and how to fill in the CRF (Case Report Form)(inclusive training in how to&#xD;
      perform the different tests of adhesive qualities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of screening the subjects will be examined by an investigator with regard to&#xD;
      health and fitness. The examination will take place at the Physicians Test Centre. The&#xD;
      examination will also include an interview regarding life style. The cardiological data will&#xD;
      be evaluated by a cardiologist. Persons will be invited for another one or two test days if&#xD;
      the investigator finds that the person is able to do one hour of cycling at moderate&#xD;
      intensity without risk and otherwise comply with the inclusion criteria.&#xD;

    <description>The area of the adhesive that was detached from the skin based on visual evaluation of the Athena and Sensura adhesives on the stomach after 1 hour of cycling at moderate intensity. The evaluation was done by marking the detached areas at the baseplate on a transparent wound tracing sheet with a permanent marker. Subsequently the areas were measured by scanning the tracing sheet and calculating the area with the use of Imagepro image macro which calculates the result in cm^2</description>

        <description>The area of the adhesive that was detached from the skin based on visual evaluation of the Athena and Sensura adhesives on the stomach after 1 hour of cycling at moderate intensity. The evaluation was done by marking the detached areas at the baseplate on a transparent wound tracing sheet with a permanent marker. Subsequently the areas were measured by scanning the tracing sheet and calculating the area with the use of Imagepro image macro which calculates the result in cm^2</description>
