      IRB4729 Study Hypothesis: Is there a significant difference in the hard and soft tissue&#xD;
      response comparing immediate with delayed implant after tooth removal, with immediate&#xD;
      provisionalization, in maxillary anterior sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine and compare the crestal bone levels as the primary&#xD;
      endpoint variable for implants placed and temporized in extraction sites, to implants placed&#xD;
      into extraction sites after the extraction site has been grafted and healed for 4 months, all&#xD;
      immediately restored with an anatomic provisional restoration.&#xD;

    <description>An evaluation of crestal bone level changes when implants are placed into extraction sites. Levels will be measured on standardized digital radiographs of the implants using their threads as a monitor of magnification and a preextraction reference in the measurement.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients will be willing to be present for examination two times a year for at&#xD;
             least three years, as well as maintenance cleaning twice a year 3 months prior to the&#xD;
             data collection visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients will be free of uncontrolled diabetes (any type, existing malignancy, and&#xD;
             will not be receiving any therapy that suppresses their immune system, such as&#xD;
             radiation, chemotherapy, or chronic steroid usage&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Need for extraction of a single rooted maxillary central or lateral incisor, canine,&#xD;
             or premolar, with no signs of acute infection (purulent exudate, erythema, pain and&#xD;
             swelling).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will have bone present on all surfaces of the tooth within 3mm of the&#xD;
             gingival margin of the planned restoration, in order to provide sufficient bone to&#xD;
             circumferentially cover the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  all patients will have adequate space for satisfactory restoration of the edentulous&#xD;
             space.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  each patients dentition will be free of active periodontal disease or exhibit&#xD;
             controllable periodontal disease such that their teeth will clinically be non-mobile&#xD;
             and have probing depths less than 3mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All prospective sites will have at least 2mm of attached or keratinized gingiva.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The crestal bone width should be enough to accommodate either a 3.75mm diameter&#xD;
             implant for the central incisor, canine, and premolar sites or a 3.25 mm diameter&#xD;
             implant for the lateral incisor tooth sites. Bone heights should be at least 14mm for&#xD;
             accommodation of the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with labial dehiscence defects greater than 3mm from the proposed gingival&#xD;
             margin of the planned restoration will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who cannot come for follow up due to conflicts of schedules will not be&#xD;
             accepted into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with advanced cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, liver disease that place them&#xD;
             in an ASA III or IV rating will be excluded. Post-menopausal women with known&#xD;
             osteoporosis as determined by their medical internist, will be excluded. Patients with&#xD;
             known alcohol abuse will be excluded.&#xD;
