  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure what effect the study drug XL765 (SAR245409) or the&#xD;
      study drug XL147 (SAR245408) has on tumor tissue in subjects with recurrent glioblastoma (GB)&#xD;
      who are candidates for surgical resection. XL765 (SAR245409) and XL147 (SAR245408), the two&#xD;
      investigational agents examined in this study, XL147 (SAR245408) is a potent inhibitor of PI3&#xD;
      Kinase (PI3K) and XL765 (SAR245409) is a dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor. In preclinical&#xD;
      studies, inactivation of PI3K has been shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis&#xD;
      (programmed cell death) in tumor cells.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. The subject has histologically confirmed diagnosis of primary GB for which the subject&#xD;
