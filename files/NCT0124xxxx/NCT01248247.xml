  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different people have different biomarkers (chemical &quot;markers&quot; in the blood that may be&#xD;
      related to your reaction to study drugs). If researchers know about your biomarkers before&#xD;
      you receive treatment, they may be able to prescribe a treatment that is better suited to&#xD;
      your body's specific needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if drug or drug combinations based on&#xD;
      your biomarkers can help to control NSCLC. The safety of these drug combinations will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erlotinib hydrochloride, MK-2206, AZD6244, and Sorafenib are targeted therapies. Targeted&#xD;
      therapy is a type of drug that blocks the growth of cancer cells by interfering with specific&#xD;
      targeted molecules needed for tumor growth, rather than by simply interfering with rapidly&#xD;
      dividing cells (for example with traditional chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 4&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will take erlotinib alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will take erlotinib and MK-2206.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 3, you will take AZD6244 and MK-2206.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 4, you will take sorafenib alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group you are in will be assigned by a computer. The results of your screening tests will&#xD;
      be used to determine (and may limit) which of the 4 groups you may be eligible to be assigned&#xD;
      to. Your likelihood of being in any 1 group over another may also be affected by how well&#xD;
      that treatment has done in earlier study participants. Your study doctor will tell you which&#xD;
      group you have been assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will take erlotinib hydrochloride by mouth 1 time every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will take MK-2206 by mouth 1 time every week. You will take&#xD;
           erlotinib hydrochloride by mouth 1 time every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 3, you will take MK-2206 by mouth 1 time per week. You will take&#xD;
           AZD6244 by mouth 1 time every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 4, you will take sorafenib by mouth 2 times every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you will take erlotinib hydrochloride (Groups 1 and 2), you should take the tablets in the&#xD;
      morning. You should take the drug 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal, with no more than 7&#xD;
      ounces of water. If you forget to take a dose, the last missed dose should be taken as soon&#xD;
      as you remember, as long as it is at least 12 hours before the next dose. The next day, you&#xD;
      should take the scheduled dose at the usual time. You should try not to vomit for at least 30&#xD;
      minutes after taking the drug. If you feel nauseated before or after taking the erlotinib,&#xD;
      you should take an anti-nausea drug. You may take an extra dose of erlotinib if you vomit&#xD;
      within 30 minutes after taking the tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 2, you should take MK-2206 at about the same time each week with about 1&#xD;
      cup (8 ounces) of water. You must take MK-2206 at least 2 hours before or at least 2 hours&#xD;
      after any food or a meal. You should not make up any missed doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 3, you should take MK-2206 at about the same time each week with about 1&#xD;
      cup (8 ounces) of water. You must take MK-2206 at least 2 hours before or at least 2 hours&#xD;
      after eating. You should not make up any missed doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you will take AZD6244 (Group 3), you should take the study drug in the morning before you&#xD;
      eat or drink anything. You can eat breakfast 1 hour after you take the dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you will take sorafenib, you must take your doses 12 hours apart. You will take 2 tablets&#xD;
      each morning, and again each evening. Sorafenib should be taken with about 1 cup of water on&#xD;
      an empty stomach (either 1 hour before a meal or 2 hours after a meal). If you feel nauseated&#xD;
      before or after taking the medication, anti-nausea medications should be used. If you miss a&#xD;
      dose, you should skip it and take the next scheduled dose at the right time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your medication should be stored at room temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study visit schedule is described below. In certain cases, with the permission of your&#xD;
      doctor, the study visits may occur up to 7 days earlier or later than described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital&#xD;
           signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be&#xD;
           having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If your doctor thinks it is&#xD;
           needed, you may have to have these blood tests more often.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of every odd-numbered cycle (Cycles 3, 5, 7, and so on):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT scan and/or MRI of the chest (and abdomen if the doctor thinks it is&#xD;
           needed) to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI of the brain (if the doctor thinks it is needed)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Tests for Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During screening, on Day 1 of Cycle 2, and at the end-of study visit, you will have an&#xD;
           eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 1 you will have an ECG before taking your study medication and then&#xD;
           again about 4 hours after you take your study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Tests for Group 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During screening, on Day 1 of Cycle 2, and at the end-of study visit, you will have an&#xD;
           eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Cycle 2 (Week 6 of being on study drug), on Day 1 of Cycle 4, and then every 3&#xD;
           months, you will have a multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan and/or echocardiogram to&#xD;
           check your heart function. You will have these tests more often if the doctor thinks it&#xD;
           is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 1 you will have an ECG before taking your study medication and then&#xD;
           again about 4 hours after you take your study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue to take the study drug(s) for as long as you are benefitting. You will be&#xD;
      taken off study if the disease gets worse or if you have intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When you go off study for any reason, you will have an end-of-study. This visit may occur up&#xD;
      to 7 days earlier or later. The following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital&#xD;
           signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be&#xD;
           having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT scan and/or MRI of the chest (and abdomen if the doctor thinks it is&#xD;
           needed) to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG (Group 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a follow-up evaluation performed 4 weeks ± 7 days after therapy is&#xD;
      discontinued. This evaluation may be a visit or contact by phone by the research personnel.&#xD;
      If you are in Group 3, you will have a MUGA scan and/or echocardiogram to check your heart&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be called every 3 months for up to 3 years and asked about any cancer treatments you&#xD;
      may be receiving. This phone call will take about 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Erlotinib is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      treatment of NSCLC that has gotten worse. Sorafenib is approved in renal cell cancer and&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Sorafenib has also has also been evaluated in unselected advanced&#xD;
      patients with NSCLC both alone or with chemotherapy in the first-time treatment of patients .&#xD;
      MK-2206, and AZD6244 are not FDA-approved or commercially available. At this time, they are&#xD;
      only being used in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 450 patients will take part in this multicenter study. Approximately 350 will be&#xD;
      enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

             of long QT interval syndrome) including heart failure that meets New York Heart&#xD;
             Association (NYHA) class II or above or require use of a concomitant medication that&#xD;
             can prolong the QT interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects who have abnormal K+ or Mg++ levels will be excluded if these levels cannot&#xD;
             be corrected to within normal range with adequate supportive treatment prior to study&#xD;
             drug initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects whose tumor harbors an EGFR mutation are excluded unless the subject failed&#xD;
             treatment with EGFR TKIs in which case the subject can be randomized to Arms 2, 3, and&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Drug Specific Eligibility Criteria based on Treatment Arms- Subjects are excluded from&#xD;
             the erlotinib monotherapy arm if they have progressed on prior EGFR TKI therapy; from&#xD;
             the AKT inhibitor arm(s) if they have received prior AKT inhibitor therapy; from the&#xD;
             MEK inhibitor arm if they have received prior MEK inhibitor therapy; and from&#xD;
             Sorafenib arm if they have previously received the drug or have prior history of&#xD;
             clinically significant hemoptysis or bleeding diathesis as per principal investigator&#xD;
