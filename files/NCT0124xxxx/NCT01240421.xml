      This expanded access program is an open-label, multi-center study, which will consist of a&#xD;
      PreTreatment Phase and a Treatment Phase. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer who fulfill the eligibility criteria will be treated. The program will continue in&#xD;
      each country until eribulin is approved, reimbursed and launched in that country, or&#xD;
      termination of the program by the Sponsor.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's oncologist must have documented experience in a prior eribulin clinical&#xD;
             trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has progressed on or&#xD;
             after the last anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with, ineligibility for, or commercial unavailability of each of the&#xD;
             following therapies:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Anthracyclines, taxanes, and capecitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Ixabepilone, in countries where this agent is marketed&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Trastuzumab, for Her-2 positive disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Hormonal therapy, in hormone receptor-positive disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. All other commercially available therapies, e.g. gemcitabine or vinorelbine, used&#xD;
                  for the treatment of advanced breast cancer (see NCCN guidelines)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status greater than or equal to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate kidney function: serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL or&#xD;
             creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 40 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow function: absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1.5&#xD;
             x 10^9/L, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10 g/dL (can be corrected by growth&#xD;
             factor or transfusion), and platelet count greater than or equal to 100 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate liver function: total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of&#xD;
             normal (ULN), alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate&#xD;
             aminotransferase less than or equal to 3 x ULN (or less than or equal to 5 x ULN in&#xD;
             case of liver metastases). If alkaline phosphatase is greater than 3 x ULN (in absence&#xD;
             of liver metastases) or greater than 5 x ULN (in presence of liver metastases) AND&#xD;
             patient also is known to have bone metastases, the liver specific alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
             must be used to assess liver function instead of total alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the treatment protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provision of written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

             effective method of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligibility for any other eribulin study open in the same region&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Existing anti-cancer therapy-related toxicities of grade 2 or more, except that&#xD;
             alopecia and grade 2 neuropathy are acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of congestive heart failure with New York Heart Association Classification&#xD;
             greater than grade II, unstable angina, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months&#xD;
             or serious cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Electrocardiogram with QTc interval of greater than or equal to 500 msec based upon&#xD;
             Bazett's formula (QTcB)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Investigator believes the patient to be medically unfit to receive eribulin or&#xD;
             unsuitable for any other reason&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (positive B-hCG test) or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to eribulin or any of the excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Brain or subdural metastases, unless local therapy has been completed and use of&#xD;
             corticosteroids for this indication has been discontinued for at least 4 weeks before&#xD;
             starting treatment in this protocol. Any signs (eg, radiologic) and/or symptoms of&#xD;
             brain metastases must be stable for at least 4 weeks before starting the treatment&#xD;
             protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of or concomitant medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             would compromise the patient's ability to safely complete the treatment protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus positivity, as neutropenia caused by eribulin&#xD;
             treatment may make such patients particularly susceptible to infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meningeal carcinomatosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary lymphangitic involvement resulting in pulmonary dysfunction requiring active&#xD;
             treatment, including use of oxygen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any of the following treatments within the specified period before the&#xD;
             start of treatment: 1) Any investigational drug within 4 weeks; 2) Chemotherapy,&#xD;
             radiation, biological or targeted therapy within 2 weeks; 3) Hormonal therapy within 1&#xD;
             week.&#xD;
