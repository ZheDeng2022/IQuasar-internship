  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and the hand is the most frequently&#xD;
      affected site.Interphalangeal (IP) joints (the small joints of the fingers) are often&#xD;
      involved causing pain, progressive loss of hand function and deformity. Deviation, or bending&#xD;
      to the side, of IP joints (IPJs) with significant functional and cosmetic consequences for&#xD;
      the individual is common. There are no drugs which can slow the disease process so there is&#xD;
      reliance on symptomatic treatment such as pain relief and hand therapy. Joint thermoplastic&#xD;
      splinting (moulded plastic splints that are custom-made) is employed by hand therapists in&#xD;
      other settings, but to the investigators knowledge no studies have formally investigated the&#xD;
      effect of splinting in IP OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By resting inflamed tissues and correcting joint alignment, a beneficial role for splinting&#xD;
      in IP OA is likely. In this study, the investigators want to test whether thermoplastic&#xD;
      splinting of deviated IP joints due to OA will 1) improve joint alignment 2) ameliorate soft&#xD;
      tissue inflammation, and whether as a consequence 3) pain and overall hand function will be&#xD;
      improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with hand OA with 'affected' IP joints (symptoms from OA associated with deviation of&#xD;
      the joint on X-ray)will be recruited from a specialist hand osteoarthritis clinic. Initially&#xD;
      this will be for distal IP (DIP) joints. In the intervention group (30 patients), an&#xD;
      'intervention' joint for splinting will be identified as the most painful deviated DIP joint&#xD;
      in the past week leading up to enrolment. Up to 3 other 'affected' DIP joints on either hand&#xD;
      will not be splinted but will be monitored as 'control' joints. In the control group (15&#xD;
      patients), an affected joint will be monitored but not splinted. Assessment of joint pain,&#xD;
      hand function by a hand therapist, deformity (by X-ray)and joint inflammation will take place&#xD;
      at baseline, during and at the end of splinting period of 3 months, and also at 6 months,to&#xD;
      assess whether any changes are persistent. In this way, the efficacy of splinting of IP&#xD;
      joints in OA will be assessed.&#xD;
