  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the growing public health concerns of seasonal influenza and H1N1 in the United States,&#xD;
      the primary means by which this can be addressed is with prevention, namely, vaccination&#xD;
      against the influenza virus. The only individuals not able to receive this vaccination in the&#xD;
      primary care provider's office are those patients with egg allergies and, in rare&#xD;
      circumstances, individuals with allergies to other components of the vaccine. Current&#xD;
      guidelines allow for the administration of the influenza vaccine to patients with egg allergy&#xD;
      using vaccines with low egg protein (ovalbumin) content or by using skin testing followed by&#xD;
      a 5-dose desensitization protocol. Since this is impractical to perform in the primary care&#xD;
      office and cumbersome for allergists, many egg-allergic patients simply do not receive the&#xD;
      influenza vaccine, leaving them more vulnerable to the disease and more likely to become a&#xD;
      source of contagion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have suggested that influenza vaccination using a 1-2 dose protocol may be&#xD;
      safe. This fact is due in large part to the low ovalbumin (egg protein) content in modern&#xD;
      influenza vaccines. All studies of influenza vaccination in egg-allergic patients have been&#xD;
      done using intramuscular trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). However, the&#xD;
      trivalent live-attenuated, cold-adapted influenza vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered&#xD;
      intranasally, has a lower published ovalbumin content than the injectable vaccines,&#xD;
      suggesting that it may also be well-tolerated by egg-allergic patients. According to several&#xD;
      studies, LAIV may be more efficacious than TIV in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the goal of the investigators to evaluate the safety of immunizing egg-allergic&#xD;
      individuals with the LAIV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with egg allergy will be recruited into the study. Since the trivalent&#xD;
      live-attenuated, cold-adapted influenza vaccine (LAIV) contains the lowest amount of egg&#xD;
      protein of all available influenza vaccines on the market, those who are eligible to receive&#xD;
      the intranasal formulation (LAIV group) (ie age 2-49y, not asthmatic) will receive FluMist;&#xD;
      others will receive the intramuscular injection in a single dose without skin testing (TIV&#xD;
      group). All subjects will be monitored for 30 minutes post-vaccine for any signs/symptoms of&#xD;
      an immediate allergic reaction. Subjects will also be followed-up by phone 24-48 hours after&#xD;
      administration to assess for any delayed allergic reaction. Data will be collected for one&#xD;
      entire Influenza season (2010-2011).&#xD;

Children aged 6 months-8 years who received a seasonal vaccine for the first time during 2009-2010 but who received only 1 dose should receive 2 doses, rather than 1, during 2010-2011. In addition, for the 2010-11 influenza season, children aged 6 months-8 years who did not receive at least 1 dose of an influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine should receive 2 doses of a 2010-11 seasonal influenza vaccine, regardless of previous influenza vaccination history. For all children, the second dose of a recommended 2-dose series should be administered 4 or more weeks after the initial dose.</description>
