  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis contributes to nearly 20% of all hospital deaths and is the leading cause of death on&#xD;
      non-coronary intensive care units. Contamination of the patient environment is common with&#xD;
      organisms such as MRSA, VRE and C.difficile remaining viable for days or weeks on a variety&#xD;
      materials and surfaces. Up to 90% of patient notes and charts on critical care may be&#xD;
      contaminated with potential pathogens including MRSA and it has been shown that healthcare&#xD;
      workers may contaminate hospital paperwork with organisms originating from patients. Cellomed&#xD;
      is a triclosan based laminate which has been shown to possess antimicrobial activity against&#xD;
      MRSA, E.Coli, Enterococcus, Stenotrophomonas and Klebsiella. The study presented for&#xD;
      consideration aims to compare levels of contamination between critical care observation&#xD;
      charts coated with either a 'standard' matt or antimicrobial Cellomed laminate. It is&#xD;
      proposed that paperwork laminated with Cellomed may exhibit reduced levels of contamination&#xD;
      and decrease the potential for cross infection on critical care and potentially other areas&#xD;
      of the hospital in which clinical paperwork is handled.&#xD;

      Although hand hygiene remains an important intervention in reducing the incidence of&#xD;
      nosocomial infection, poor compliance may limit its impact especially in critical care units&#xD;
      when clinical demands on staff are high. Although focused programmes to improve compliance&#xD;
      have been shown to produce good results this may not be sustained in the longer-term. Hand&#xD;
      hygiene only reduces and does not completely eliminate hand contamination and therefore&#xD;
      transmission of hand microbes to the near-patient environment including paperwork will&#xD;
      inevitably occur. It is recommended that healthcare professionals undertake hand hygiene&#xD;
      after interacting with the patient environment even if contact with the patient has not taken&#xD;
      place. In practice this may not occur as the potential for the environment to act as a&#xD;
      reservoir may not be realised by healthcare workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors reviewing physiological trends on critical care observation charts often move between&#xD;
      bed-spaces without touching patients or undertaking hand hygiene. Since doctors exhibit the&#xD;
      lowest level of compliance with hand hygiene programmes, it is likely to be difficult to&#xD;
      persuade them to undertake additional manoeuvres before and after handing paperwork as has&#xD;
      been recommended. Effective cleaning and disinfection of the near-patient environment should&#xD;
      occur concurrently to hand hygiene programmes in order to reduce transmission. Critical care&#xD;
      observation charts in Darlington Memorial Hospital are paper-based, located in near-patient&#xD;
      hand-touch zones and are therefore prone to contamination. It is proposed that treated&#xD;
      paperwork may exhibit reduced levels of contamination; decreasing the potential for cross&#xD;
      infection resulting from an area of the near-patient hand-touch environment that has received&#xD;
      little attention in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently published research (2009) has reported that up to 90% of critical care observation&#xD;
      charts may be contaminated with potential or actual pathogens. It is on critical care where&#xD;
      nosocomial infections potentially have the most devastating effect. Cellomed is a triclosan&#xD;
      based laminate that has been available since 2008 through Celloglas, a UK company&#xD;
      specialising in decorative and other print finishes. Celloglas claim the laminate possesses&#xD;
      anti-microbial activity citing three reports from Ciba laboratories (Switzerland), Scientific&#xD;
      Services (UK) and Manchester University (UK). All tests have shown activity against MRSA and&#xD;
      E.Coli with the most recent test reporting additional activity against Enterococcus,&#xD;
      Stenotrophomonas and Klebsiella when compared to control. To date there have been no studies&#xD;
      of Cellomed carried out in the clinical environment. Cellomed can be applied to any hospital&#xD;
      paperwork through a lamination process. It is proposed that 'treated' paperwork will exhibit&#xD;
      reduced levels of contamination when used in the clinical environment compared with standard&#xD;
      patient documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, randomised study comparing percentage increases in bacterial&#xD;
      total viable count on critical care observation charts coated with one of two different&#xD;
      materials; standard matt or Cellomed antibacterial laminate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-hundred of our standard white critical care observation charts will be provided to&#xD;
      Celloglas (Leeds, UK). 100 of these will be laminated with standard matt (group 1) and 100&#xD;
      with anti-microbial Cellomed (group 2). The two types of charts will be separately packaged&#xD;
      by Celloglas, labelled and delivered to lead investigator at Darlington Memorial Hospital.&#xD;
      The packages will be opened on a sterile work surface and the lead investigator will number&#xD;
      the charts in a random order determined by an Excel spreadsheet. Randomisation will be&#xD;
      restricted to ensure 100 charts remain in each group. The lead investigator will record which&#xD;
      chart type is assigned to each number for analysis purposes. The charts will be used by the&#xD;
      critical care nursing staff in the assigned order to ensure the random sequence is&#xD;
      maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observation charts to be studied will be stored on the critical care unit and all&#xD;
      existing non-laminated white charts removed. The observation charts will thereafter be used&#xD;
      in the normal way as defined by nursing practice; blue charts for patient admissions and&#xD;
      white charts for each 24 hour period thereafter commencing at 8 am. On placement and after 24&#xD;
      hours of use, a standardised section of the patient observation area will be swabbed by one&#xD;
      of the data collection researchers. The standardised area is defined as the section of the&#xD;
      chart that is most comprehensively completed during the patient episode and is therefore most&#xD;
      likely to become contaminated through use. Both data collection researchers will be fully&#xD;
      aware of the standardised area prior to commencement of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White charts are used to standardise the length of time each chart is in place between pre-&#xD;
      and post- clinical use swabs (white charts present at 8 am have been in use for exactly 24&#xD;
      hours). Blue charts are used between patient admission and 8 am which is a variable length of&#xD;
      time and therefore not suitable for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All swabs will be taken by one of two data collection researchers using a standard technique&#xD;
      agreed before data collection commences. One dry sterile cotton swab will thoroughly sample&#xD;
      the specified area of white charts at 8 am. These charts will have been in use for 24 hours&#xD;
      and therefore the swab casing will be marked with the chart identifying number, bed space&#xD;
      number and the word 'post'. A new white patient observation chart will then be placed in the&#xD;
      bed space by nursing staff and the same area swabbed using an identical method. The swab&#xD;
      casing will be marked with the chart identifying number, the bed space number and the word&#xD;
      'pre'. Over a 24 hour period, each chart will therefore have two swabs taken; one pre- and&#xD;
      one post- clinical use. The only exception to this will be on the first and the last day of&#xD;
      the study when only pre- and post- swabs will be taken respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swabs will be immediately delivered to the laboratory and inoculated onto 'plates' to permit&#xD;
      bacterial and fungal growth. Following 24 hours of incubation at 37 degrees Celsius in air,&#xD;
      plates will be analysed for total viable count and specific bacteria identified using&#xD;
      standard techniques within our accredited microbiology laboratory. Additional analysis for&#xD;
      resistance of isolated Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococci will take place using British&#xD;
      Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) standard techniques. All data relating to total&#xD;
      viable counts and specific bacteria will be retained by the Data Collection Researchers until&#xD;
      the study period has been concluded. No interim data will be generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to compare the two groups total viable counts following 24 hours of&#xD;
      clinical use and to compare the number of separately identified organisms. Unpublished&#xD;
      laboratory tests show that total viable counts increases with manual handling of either&#xD;
      laminate and it is therefore assumed that TVCs will increase from baseline for both types of&#xD;
      observation chart following 24 hours of clinical use. Due to the claimed continuous&#xD;
      expression of antimicrobial activity, there is the potential for baseline counts to be lower&#xD;
      in the Cellomed group on receipt from the lamination factory. In addition, it cannot be&#xD;
      assumed that the baseline contamination will be identical for charts between or within the&#xD;
      two groups. It is therefore proposed to define the primary outcome measure as the percentage&#xD;
      increase in total viable count from pre- 24 hour levels as measured before clinical use. The&#xD;
      null hypothesis for the primary outcome measure is that there will be no difference in the&#xD;
      percentage increase from baseline for total viable counts between the two groups following 24&#xD;
      hours of clinical use on the critical care unit. The alternative hypothesis is that Cellomed&#xD;
      laminate results in a lower percentage increase in bacteria compared to standard matt&#xD;
      laminate. The secondary outcome measure is to compare the number of different types of&#xD;
      specific organisms identified during the laboratory analysis. The null hypothesis for the&#xD;
      secondary outcome is that there will be no difference in the number of different types of&#xD;
      specific organisms between the two groups following 24 hours of clinical use on the critical&#xD;
      care unit. The alternative hypothesis is that Cellomed laminate results in fewer different&#xD;
      types of specific organisms compared to standard matt laminate.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All 200 of the specifically prepared, laminated white observation charts present on&#xD;
             critical care will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  White critical care charts in place at the time of a patient discharges will be&#xD;
             excluded from analysis. This is due to the fact they would not have been in place for&#xD;
             the full 24 hours and would not be available to have the 2nd swab sample taken. Blue&#xD;
             observation charts are excluded since they are used for a variable period of time&#xD;
             between patient admission and 8 am.&#xD;
