  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is one of the most prevalent and fatal diseases in intensive care units&#xD;
      .unfortunately, therapeutic approach to sepsis has remained unchanged for many years.&#xD;
      Nowadays, the role of cytokines in pathogenesis of sepsis is obvious. Continuous elevated&#xD;
      levels of various cytokines in severe sepsis could result in uncontrolled inflammation&#xD;
      status. Breaking of inflammatory cascade may lead to improvement in survival. It seems that&#xD;
      modulation of inflammation is one of the strategic plans to conquest sepsis. Therefore,&#xD;
      elimination of bacterial toxins and pro-inflammatory cytokines from the systemic circulation&#xD;
      by plasmapheresis supposed to be rational approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have done several attempts to clarify the efficacy of plasmapheresis in sepsis&#xD;
      treatment. However because of inconsistent results, routine use of this procedure in patients&#xD;
      with severe sepsis remains controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present survey is to determine the effect of plasmapheresis on plasma levels&#xD;
      of main pro-inflammatory cytokines and evaluate its therapeutic efficacy in improvement of&#xD;
      outcome and treatment of severe sepsis.&#xD;

      24-48 hours) that will do with speed of 60-120 ml/min through of central venous catheter.&#xD;

        7. Infusion of heparin 500 u/h Demographic characters of patients (age, sex, weight, BMI)&#xD;
           will record. Central venous, arterial line and Foley catheter will insert. For all of&#xD;
           patients will do follow assays daily: CVP, BP, ABG, BUN, Cr, Na, K, CBC, PLT, PT, PTT,&#xD;
           U/A, P, Ca, Mg, Chest X Ray. LFT and Alb&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level of biomarkers evaluate at 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 14th day of study. In P group,&#xD;
      evaluation will do before and after of plasmapheresis. Biomarkers include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. TNF-α (early release cytokine)(plasma)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. IL-1 (early release cytokine)(plasma)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. IL-6 (pro &amp; anti-inflammatory cytokine)(plasma) Patient will evaluate for 14 days or&#xD;
           until death. Patient's morbidity will record until 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of morbidity will do by scoring systems:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TISS score (Therapeutic intervention scoring system): for evaluation of severity of&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SOFA score (Sepsis- related organ function assessment): for evaluation of organ&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ADL score (Activities of daily living) Recorded information will analyze by t- test for&#xD;
           quantitative variables and χ 2 square for qualitative variables, with α = 0/05.&#xD;

    <description>Plasmapheresis was done every 24-48 hours and continues up to five times. Blood samples were collected 30 minutes before and after each session of plasmapheresis to determine sequential changes in plasma levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. During each exchange session a volume of 25-30 ml/kg bodyweight of patient's plasma was exchanged with equal volume of 20% human albumin diluted with normal saline solution. Before and after plasmapheresis, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), platelet count and serum calcium level were checked. calcium gluconate 10% (10 ml) was administered even if patient had normal serum calcium in order to prevent hypocalcaemia due to administration of citrate. All drugs except for vasopressors were stopped during procedure.</description>
