  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) in Australia is approximately 5%-8%,&#xD;
      with up to one third of all parous women who develop type 2 diabetes having a previous&#xD;
      history of GDM. Research to determine strategies to delay or prevent the development of or&#xD;
      progression to diabetes is vital, particularly in population groups that are at higher risk,&#xD;
      such as GDM, and overweight women (BMI&gt;=25). Currently, follow-up or post-partum support for&#xD;
      women who develop GDM is limited to advice to complete a 6 week post-partum oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test to exclude overt diabetes, to be repeated annually. A pilot randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) conducted at Mater Mothers Hospital suggested that a post-partum&#xD;
      intervention designed to increase physical activity in women with previous GDM may be&#xD;
      feasible. A recent study in the United States recruited women with recent GDM into an RCT&#xD;
      where the control group received usual care and the intervention group received a web based&#xD;
      walking program. Although the results of this study are limited, they did show an increase in&#xD;
      pedometer steps/day between baseline and end of study. Dietary intervention has been proven&#xD;
      to increase probability of weight loss, so a strategy of combining both a pedometer and&#xD;
      nutrition based program may prove to be more successful for long term improvement of a&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle to prevent type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: A pedometer based intervention to encourage physical activity, combined&#xD;
      with nutrition coaching in women with recent GDM and BMI &gt;= 25 will result in increased&#xD;
      weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity and increased physical activity when compared with&#xD;
      standard care.&#xD;
