    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if ofatumumab can help to control&#xD;
      CLL/SLL that has not yet been treated. The safety of this drug will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ofatumumab is designed to bind to the surface of some of the white blood cells (B-cells). It&#xD;
      may destroy cancer cells that come from B-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive a &quot;loading dose&quot;&#xD;
      (a lower dose given first, to lower the risk of a bad reaction to the study drug) of&#xD;
      ofatumumab by vein on Day 1 of Cycle 1. The loading dose is less than one-third (1/3) of the&#xD;
      normal dose. You will then receive the normal dose over 4 hours 1 time each week (+/- 3&#xD;
      days). The doses may be given more slowly, if your doctor thinks it is needed. All doses of&#xD;
      the study drug will be given at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and glucocorticoids (steroids such as prednisolone) will be given&#xD;
      by vein 30 minutes to 2 hours before you receive ofatumumab to help prevent side effects. You&#xD;
      will also take pills of acetaminophen (Tylenol) to help prevent side effects. If no side&#xD;
      effects occur, these &quot;pre-medications&quot; may be reduced or not given after the second infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time each week, before you receive ofatumumab:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about how you are feeling, about any side effects you may be having,&#xD;
           and about any changes in your health since the last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drug until Day 50, as long as the doctor thinks it is in&#xD;
      your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets&#xD;
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, if you develop hepatitis B, or if you decide to go&#xD;
      off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of your last treatment or after you stop receiving the study drug for any reason,&#xD;
      the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about how you are feeling, about any side effects you may be having,&#xD;
           and about any changes in your health since the last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for hepatitis&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 3 months (+/- 2 weeks) after the end-of-treatment visit, the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about how you are feeling, about any side effects you may be having,&#xD;
           and about any changes in your health since the last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, as well as CT scans of the chest,&#xD;
           abdomen, and pelvis, to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for hepatitis&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 months (+/- 4 weeks) after the end-of-treatment visit for 6 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about how you are feeling, about any side effects you may be having,&#xD;
           and about any changes in your health since the last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for hepatitis&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every year (+/- 4 weeks) after the end-of-treatment visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about how you are feeling, about any side effects you may be having,&#xD;
           and about any changes in your health since the last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, as well as CT scans of the chest,&#xD;
           abdomen, and pelvis, to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Ofatumumab is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      use in the treatment of CLL. The use of ofatumumab as an early treatment for patients with&#xD;
      CLL/SLL who have not received other treatment is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 44 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
