  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of UCBT to treat&#xD;
      patients with lymphoid hematological diseases and to see if this treatment can decrease the&#xD;
      incidence of leukemia relapse, GVHD and infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients have a type of blood cell disorder that is very hard to cure. This treatment&#xD;
      that is being used in this trial is known as a stem cell transplant. This treatment might&#xD;
      help the patient live longer without the disease. It uses much stronger doses of drugs and&#xD;
      radiation to kill the diseased cells that could be given without the transplant. We also&#xD;
      think that the healthy cells from the donor may help fight any diseased cells left after the&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the transplant to take place, we will administer stem cells from a 'donor' whose cells&#xD;
      best 'match' the patient's. In this study umbilical cords will be the source of the stem&#xD;
      cells. Before the transplant, two very strong drugs plus total body irradiation will be given&#xD;
      to as preconditioning. This treatment will kill most of your blood-forming cells in the bone&#xD;
      marrow. The patient will then get then healthy stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has the disease in the central nervous system (CNS), they will receive&#xD;
      radiation to the head and spine before starting the conditioning. This is to try to get&#xD;
      disease control in the CNS. Radiation will not be given for children under 2 yrs old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, many umbilical cord blood units are available in public banks for transplantation&#xD;
      in patients lacking bone marrow donors. UCB transplants (UCBT) may offer several advantages&#xD;
      over adult bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplants, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. rapid availability,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. absence of donor risk,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. low risk of transmissible infectious diseases,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. low risk of acute GvHD (Graft vs. Host Disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three main causes of death after umbilical cord blood transplantation for these kind of&#xD;
      disorders are graft failure, infection and disease relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we are trying to address these three problems:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help improve engraftment we will add the drug Fludarabine to Cytoxan and total body&#xD;
      irradiation. Fludarabine is a very strong medicine. We will try to decrease infections and&#xD;
      reduce leukemia relapse by using fludarabine instead of antithymocyte globulin (ATG).&#xD;

      After the eligible criterion for treatment has been met and a suitable UCB stem donor has&#xD;
      been found, the patient will have a central line placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After placement of the central line, the following chemotherapy will be given to after&#xD;
      admission to the hospital and before the infusion of the umbilical cord blood stem cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  9 - 6 days before the infusion: Total Body Irradiation (TBI) in two fractions (&quot;doses&quot;)&#xD;
           per days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 - 2 days before the infusion: Cytoxan given daily for 4 days, over 1 hour as an&#xD;
           intravenous infusion. Mesna will be given per standards. Mesna is a drug given to&#xD;
           decrease the side effects of Cytoxan. It will be given daily as an intravenous infusion&#xD;
           while the patient receives the Cytoxan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 - 2 days before the infusion: Fludarabine given daily for 3 days over 1 hour as an&#xD;
           intravenous infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cell transplant (intravenous infusion of the UCB stem cells) - defined as day 0 of the&#xD;
      treatment. All other &quot;numbered&quot; days relate to this infusion date. For example, Day 1 is the&#xD;
      first day after the stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following medications will be given to help decrease side effects from the chemotherapy&#xD;
      and UCB infusion: Cyclosporine A (CSA) will be given starting 3 days prior to the stem cell&#xD;
      infusion. It will be given daily over 2 hours every 12 hours, after the infusion and then&#xD;
      tapered if no GVHD is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) will start on the day the stem cell infusion is&#xD;
      completed and will continue daily for 45 days, unless the patient develops GvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous immunoglobulin's (IVIG) will be given monthly until GVHD therapy is stopped and&#xD;
      there is evidence that the patient's body is producing antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Evaluations: Various study evaluations will be performed before and during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up: After year 1, the patient will be asked to return to the clinic once a year for&#xD;
      consultations and bone marrow tests. A follow up bone marrow biopsy and aspirate will be done&#xD;
      1 and 2 years after transplant. Consultations with specialists will be similar to the ones&#xD;
      the patient had before the transplant.&#xD;

             leukocyte antigen) matched or mismatched / related or unrelated) with a lymphoid&#xD;
             hematologic malignancy (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, hodgkin/non-hodgkin lymphoma)&#xD;
             unlikely to be cure by standard chemotherapy. This includes patients who have relapsed&#xD;
             after standard chemotherapy treatments and patients in first remission with&#xD;
             unfavorable prognostics features.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Related or Unrelated Umbilical Cord Blood Unit with 0-1 antigen mismatch, Total&#xD;
             Nucleated cell dose of greater than or equal to 4 x 10^7/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lansky/Karnofsky scores greater than or equal to 60&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative pregnancy test (if applicable)&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled infections. For bacterial infections, patients must be&#xD;
             receiving definitive therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for 72 hours&#xD;
