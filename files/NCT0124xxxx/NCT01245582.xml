      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the efficacy of SECOX regimen by adding oxaliplatin plus capecitabine to&#xD;
      sorafenib versus sorafenib alone as palliative treatment for unresectable HCC patients to&#xD;
      prolong overall survival (OS) for advanced HCC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy of SECOX regimen with Sorafenib alone for progression free&#xD;
           survival (PFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy of SECOX regimen with Sorafenib alone for response rate (RR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the overall safety profile of SECOX regimen in comparison of Sorafenib alone&#xD;

      For each patient, the study consists of a baseline period of screening up to 2 weeks, a&#xD;
      treatment period with 2 weeks as one study treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be randomly assigned to receive either SECOX (Sorafenib, Oxaliplatin with&#xD;
      Capecitabine) or Sorafenib alone every 2 weeks until disease progression, intolerable&#xD;
      toxicity, or patient's refusal of further study treatment. There will be a 30-day follow-up&#xD;
      visit after the last study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be follow-up every 2 months until death is observed during post-treatment&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;
