  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to study immune memory generated against the yellow fever&#xD;
      (YFV) vaccine in participants who have previously received the vaccine. Volunteers will not&#xD;
      receive vaccine shots; only immune responses to previous yellow fever vaccination will be&#xD;
      studied. The study involves one or multiple blood draws.&#xD;

      The goal of this study is to characterize immune memory in humans who have previously&#xD;
      received yellow fever vaccine. The project is designed to study the magnitude and persistence&#xD;
      of both humoral, and cell-mediated immune memory generated post-vaccination. Since aging has&#xD;
      an effect on the immune system (eg. decreased thymic output, replacement of hematopoietic&#xD;
      cells in the bone marrow with adipocytes), the researchers will analyze the young adults&#xD;
      (aged 18-45 years) and the older vaccinees (55 years or older) in separate groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the phenotypic and functional characterization of memory T cell responses to&#xD;
           yellow fever vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine neutralizing antibody titer after yellow fever vaccination&#xD;
