      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the UpSpring Milkscreen Alcohol Test works to&#xD;
      detect alcohol in breast milk that will be donated during this study. This research is being&#xD;
      done because the sponsoring company, UpSpring, wants to determine if this test will work and,&#xD;
      if it does, how well it will work to detect levels of alcohol in breast milk.&#xD;

      MilkScreen™ Home Test for Alcohol in Breast Milk is intended as an OTC test for the presence&#xD;
      of alcohol in breast milk. This study will obtain data to demonstrate the agreement of&#xD;
      MilkScreen™ compared to the reference method, head space Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry&#xD;
      (GC-MS) for alcohol content and will additionally provide validation of the usability of the&#xD;
      device by the intended users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a minimum of 50 lactating mothers who will come into a center in small&#xD;
      groups in a contrived social setting like a wine tasting. Upon completion of informed consent&#xD;
      and demonstration of meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria, subjects will be tested with&#xD;
      disposable breathalyzer test and baseline breast milk samples provided. The baseline breast&#xD;
      milk samples will be tested with the test article by the subject. Aliquots from the same&#xD;
      samples will be prepared for testing by an outside lab with GC-MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to provide baseline demographics such as height and weight, days since&#xD;
      birth of child, race/ethnicity, and information about any prescription or OTC drugs, herbal&#xD;
      compounds or vitamins they have taken in the previous 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be provided with up to 3 alcoholic beverages over the course of a three to four&#xD;
      hour period. At prescribed time intervals following consumption, subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      provide a breast milk sample and to submit to a breathalyzer test. Each breast milk sample&#xD;
      will be tested by the subject with the test article following the labeling instructions only&#xD;
      and the sample will also be aliquoted into tightly sealing, low head space sample containers&#xD;
      for method comparison testing by an outside lab with GC-MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to drink at least one drink, but may ingest up to two additional&#xD;
      alcoholic beverages during the course of the study. Each subject's blood alcohol content&#xD;
      (BAC) will be monitored before each additional drink is provided and will not be allowed to&#xD;
      consume additional drinks if their BAC as measured by the disposable breathalyzer device&#xD;
      exceeds 0.10% (100 mg/dL). All drinks will be prepared such that they contain alcohol&#xD;
      consistent with a standard alcoholic drink, as defined by the National Institute on Alcohol&#xD;
      Abuse and Alcoholism (12 ounces of beer, 8-9 ounces of malt liquor, 5 ounces of table wine,&#xD;
      or 1.5 ounces of liquor). Subjects will be asked to self report whether they finished their&#xD;
      drink at the point when samples are taken. Subjects will be provided with transportation to&#xD;
      and from the study site using designated non-drinking drivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of breast milk taken both prior to and following the ingestion of alcohol will be&#xD;
      coded and thereby blinded to the lab. The lab will run GC-MS on each specimen and will report&#xD;
      the results to the Sponsor. This data will be compared with the data reported by each subject&#xD;
      and analyzed to demonstrate that the MilkScreen™ Home Test for Alcohol in Breast Milk agrees&#xD;
      to a high degree to the reference method, GC-MS, to support the test article's intended use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to complete a questionnaire on the usability of the labeling&#xD;
      instructions on MilkScreen™ Home Test for Alcohol in Breast Milk to demonstrate that&#xD;
      consumers can use the directions properly to test their breast milk for the presence of&#xD;
      alcohol and properly interpret the results.&#xD;
