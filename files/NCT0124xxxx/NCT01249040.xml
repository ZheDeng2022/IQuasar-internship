      The purpose of this study is to investigate and compare different treatment programs for&#xD;
      frozen shoulder by evaluating changes in pain scale and shoulder range of motion(ROM) before&#xD;
      and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators define frozen shoulder as shoulder pain with ROM limitation,shoulder&#xD;
      arthrography demonstration of at least two of the following criteria:(1)reduced joint volume&#xD;
      under 10ml; (2)irregular capsular margin;(3)diminished or absent axillary recess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afer define diagnosis of frozen shoulder ,patients are randomly assigned to different&#xD;
      Subgroups for different treatment programs.Each subgroup consists of ten patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment program performed for 6 consecutive courses with each course consists of 6&#xD;
      days.Total 36 treatment days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment programs and grouping as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1:Physical modalities + therapeutic exercise Group 2:Physical modalities + therapeutic&#xD;
      exercise+ intra-articular injection of steroid Gouup 3:Therapeutic exercise Before&#xD;
      treatment,after each consecutive course (6days) of treatment,and at the end of treatment&#xD;
      program, the investigators evaluate the range of motion and muscle strength of shoulder&#xD;
      flexion,external rotation,abduction and internal rotation. Severity of shoulder pain also&#xD;
      evaluated by pain scale before and after treatment program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ROM before and after treatment program is compared by paired t-test.The ROM change before&#xD;
      and after treatment in different groups compared by analysis of variance(ANOVA). The ROM&#xD;
      change after consecutive treatment courses(6 days) are compared by multivariate ANOVA.Pain&#xD;
      scale before and after treatment is compared by paired t-test.&#xD;

      (A) Diagnosis: Patients with shoulder pain onset within 6 months are included in our study to&#xD;
      evaluate shoulder range of motion (ROM) in flexion, external rotation,abduction and internal&#xD;
      rotation by goniometer(9).Restriction in ROM is noted.Cases with possible diagnosis of frozen&#xD;
      shoulder is arranged to receive shoulder arthrography(10,11,12)which is performed by the&#xD;
      administration of contrast media(2ml) into joint space,followed by injection of air.Injection&#xD;
      is discontinued when resistance is felt.The joint space capacity is defined as the total&#xD;
      volume of contrast media and air that could be injected without resistance.All procedures are&#xD;
      conducted by the same well experienced radiologist to keep measurement reproducible.The&#xD;
      arthrographic findings should met at least two of the following criteria for final diagnosis&#xD;
      of frozen shoulder:(1)joint space capacity less than 10ml;(2)irregularity of capsular margin;&#xD;
      (3)diminished or absent axillary recess.Once frozen shoulder is confirmed,the patient is&#xD;
      randomly arranged to receive a specific treatment program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (B) Treatment program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment program and grouping arranged as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1:Physical modalities + therapeutic exercise Group 2:Physical modalities + therapeutic&#xD;
      exercise+ intra-articular injection of steroid Gouup 3:Therapeutic exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
      (C) Sample size estimation: We assume α=0.05,power=1-α=0.95,from previous&#xD;
      literature(10),change of ROM in flexion, abduction, external rotation, internal rotation&#xD;
      before and after treatment was estimated as 40,40,40,20 degrees respectively,,standard&#xD;
      deviation was 10,15,10,10 degrees respectively.Therefore,standard effective size was&#xD;
      4,2.6,4,2 respectively.From applied linear statistical models(13)fourth edition,1996,if&#xD;
      α=0.05 sample size estimated as 5,7,5,10 Respectively.Therefore,sample size in each group is&#xD;
      estimated as 10.&#xD;
