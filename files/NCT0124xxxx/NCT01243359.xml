    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of sunitinib malate when given&#xD;
      together with bevacizumab in treating patients with kidney cancer or advanced solid&#xD;
      malignancies. Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth or by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of&#xD;
      tumor to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing&#xD;
      substances to them. Giving sunitinib malate together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sequential sunitinib (sunitinib malate) with&#xD;
      bevacizumab in patients with clear cell kidney cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the objective response rate of sequential sunitinib with bevacizumab in&#xD;
      patients with clear cell kidney cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the pharmacodynamic change in standardized uptake values (SUV) peak and tumor&#xD;
      perfusion using fluorine F 18 fluorothymidine positron emission tomography (FLT-PET)/computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scans at baseline, during sunitinib exposure, and during bevacizumab exposure&#xD;
      (during sunitinib withdrawal period) in patients with renal cell and other solid&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize changes in the ratio of free: bound plasma vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (VEGF) in patients treated with sequential sunitinib with bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sunitinib malate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) on days 1-28 and bevacizumab intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over 30-90 minutes on day 29. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed renal cell; or other&#xD;
             solid malignancy (excluding lymphoma) that is metastatic or unresectable and for which&#xD;
             no standard curative therapy exists; for the renal cell cancer subset, a component of&#xD;
             clear cell histology is required (a minimum of 6 subjects with clear cell kidney&#xD;
             cancer will be enrolled per treatment stratification; additional subjects enrolled per&#xD;
             imaging cohort will allow &quot;other&quot; solid tumors)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;=&#xD;
             20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;= 2 times the slice width with spiral CT&#xD;
             scan (i.e. 10 mm if the CT slice width is 5 mm, 14 mm if the CT slice width is 7 mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum calcium =&lt; 12.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total serum bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase&#xD;
             [SGOT]))/alanine aminotransferase (ALT)(serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])&#xD;
             =&lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal, unless subjects have liver metastases,&#xD;
             in which case both AST and ALT must be =&lt; 5 × institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x normal institutional limits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance (measured) &gt;= 50 mL/min/1.73m^2 for patients with creatinine&#xD;
             levels above 1.5 x normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urine protein should be screened by urine analysis for urine protein creatinine (UPC)&#xD;
             ratio; for a UPC ratio &gt; 0.5, a 24-hour urine protein should be obtained and the level&#xD;
             should be &lt; 1,000 mg for eligibility; Note: UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation&#xD;
             of the 24 hour urine protein excretion; A UPC ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a&#xD;
             24-hour urine protein of 1 gram; UPC ratio is calculated by the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  [urine protein]/[urine creatinine] (if both urine protein and creatinine reported&#xD;
                  as mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  [(urine protein) x 0.088]/[urine creatinine] (if urine creatinine is reported in&#xD;
                  mmol/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients being evaluated for the imaging cohort need to be willing to undergo&#xD;
             planned pharmacodynamic assessments, including serial PET imaging, plasma markers, and&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and for at least 6 months after the completion of&#xD;
             bevacizumab therapy; all women of childbearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test prior to receiving sunitinib; should a woman become pregnant or suspect&#xD;
             she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
             physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breastfeeding is not allowed while on study and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation; the duration of such precautions after discontinuation of bevacizumab&#xD;
             should take into consideration the half-life of bevacizumab (average 21 days, range&#xD;
             11-50 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, experimental therapy within 4 weeks&#xD;
             (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who&#xD;
             have not recovered (to grade =&lt; 1 or baseline) from clinically significant adverse&#xD;
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier (alopecia excluded);&#xD;
             clinical significance to be determined by investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior treatment with any other VEGF signaling pathway&#xD;
             inhibitors (e.g., bevacizumab, sorafenib, pazopanib, AZD2171, PTK787, VEGF Trap, etc.)&#xD;
             are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to sunitinib or bevacizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with QTc prolongation (defined as a QTc interval greater than or equal to 500&#xD;
             msec) or other significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities (per investigator&#xD;
             discretion) are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require use of therapeutic doses of Coumarin-derivative anticoagulants&#xD;
             such as warfarin are excluded, although doses of up to 2 mg daily are permitted for&#xD;
             prophylaxis of thrombosis; Note: full-dose low-molecular weight heparin (or other&#xD;
             blood thinners) will be excluded as well given potential for bleeding with this&#xD;
             regimen; prophylactic doses of low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) will be allowed if&#xD;
             prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) is =&lt; 1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any condition (e.g., gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an&#xD;
             inability to take oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical&#xD;
             procedures affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease) that impairs their&#xD;
             ability to swallow and retain sunitinib tablets are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have blood pressure (BP) no greater than 140 mmHg (systolic) and 90 mmHg&#xD;
             (diastolic) for eligibility; initiation or adjustment of BP medication is permitted&#xD;
             prior to study entry provided that the average of three BP readings at a visit prior&#xD;
             to enrollment is less than 140/90 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack within&#xD;
                  12 months prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, stable/unstable angina,&#xD;
                  symptomatic congestive heart failure, or coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft&#xD;
                  or stenting within 12 months prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serious and inadequately controlled cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Significant vascular disease (e.g. aortic aneurysm, history of aortic dissection)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of pulmonary embolism within the past 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Class III or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA)&#xD;
                  functional classification system&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any of the following conditions are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serious or non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal&#xD;
                  abscess within 6 months prior to day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because sunitinib is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) liver&#xD;
             enzyme, the eligibility of patients taking medications that are potent inducers or&#xD;
             inhibitors of that enzyme will be determined following a review of their case by the&#xD;
             principal investigator; every effort should be made to change medication regimens to&#xD;
             include only those that do not affect CYP3A4, particularly patients who are taking&#xD;
             enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant agents; any identified agent must be stopped at least 2&#xD;
             weeks prior to study registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of agents with proarrhythmic potential (including but not limited to: terfenadine,&#xD;
             quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, sotalol, probucol, bepridil, haloperidol,&#xD;
             risperidone, indapamide, and flecainide) are not permitted during the study; a&#xD;
             comprehensive list of agents with proarrhythmic potential can be found at&#xD;
             http://azcert.org&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Steroid use is not recommended during sunitinib treatment unless absolutely necessary&#xD;
             (e.g., for treatment of adverse events or protocol-required premedication) because&#xD;
             many steroids (e.g., prednisone, prednisolone, dexamethasone, etc.) effectively lower&#xD;
             sunitinib exposure through CYP3A4 interactions; patients currently using steroids must&#xD;
             be discussed with investigator prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a pre-existing thyroid abnormality who are unable to maintain thyroid&#xD;
             function in the normal range with medication are ineligible; patients with a history&#xD;
             of hypothyroidism are eligible provided they are currently euthyroid&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded because of their poor&#xD;
             prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would&#xD;
             confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing&#xD;
             or active infections or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant (positive pregnancy test) women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with sunitinib malate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving&#xD;
             combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of a bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Invasive procedures defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 28&#xD;
                  days prior to day 1 therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Core biopsy within 7 days prior to day 1 therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  It is also appropriate to exclude subjects for whom there is the reasonable&#xD;
                  possibility that they will require major surgical procedures during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity of Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other&#xD;
             recombinant human antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects with lung cancer, the following exclusions apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lung carcinoma of squamous cell histology (mixed tumors will be categorized by&#xD;
                  the predominant cell type unless small cell elements are present, in which case&#xD;
                  the patient is ineligible; sputum cytology alone is not acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of hemoptysis (bright red blood of 1/2 teaspoon or more per episode)&#xD;
                  within 3 months prior to study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Current, ongoing treatment with full-dose warfarin or its equivalent (i.e.,&#xD;
                  unfractionated and/or low molecular weight heparin)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Current or recent (within 10 days of enrollment) use of aspirin (&gt;325 mg/day) or&#xD;
                  chronic use of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of thrombotic microangiopathy are excluded&#xD;
