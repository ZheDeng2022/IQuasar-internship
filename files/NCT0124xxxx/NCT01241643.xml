  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II multicenter, open-labeled, controlled, randomized study assessing weekly&#xD;
      doses of Interleukin-7 (CYT107)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess repeated cycles of 3 weekly injections of CYT107 in&#xD;
      patients immune non-responders infected with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty patients will be recruited to study the biological activity and safety of repeated&#xD;
      cycles of CYT107 at 20 µg/kg/week over 2 weeks, for a maximum of 4 cycles within 21 months&#xD;
      and a maximum of 3 cycles within 12 months. The entire study will cover a period of 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study visits the following may be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical history, physical examination, blood test every visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EKG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  chest X-Ray&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  liver/spleen ultrasound&#xD;
