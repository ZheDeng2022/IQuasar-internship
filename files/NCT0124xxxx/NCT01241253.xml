  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study uses a randomized, placebo-controlled experimental design consisting of 4 different&#xD;
      test treatments matched on carbohydrate (CHO) content. The three beans are similar in their&#xD;
      CHO content amount for ½ cup at ~20 grams CHO. Each of the bean varieties will be served in a&#xD;
      ~½ cup serving size with ~ ½ cup of plain steamed white rice (30 grams CHO) for a total of 50&#xD;
      grams of CHO per meal for each of the three test treatments. The 4th placebo or control&#xD;
      treatment consists of ~ 7/8 cup of rice alone, an amount consistent with the CHO content of&#xD;
      the test meals. Most diabetic meal plans recommend no more than 45-60 grams of CHO per meal.&#xD;
      Fifty grams of CHO is a standard amount for glycemic response testing in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypotheses were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The test meals containing the three bean types in combination with white rice will&#xD;
           decrease the participants' glycemic response when eaten as part of a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The reduction in post-prandial glycemia will not differ between bean types in the&#xD;
           elicited responses among individuals with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

      The 4 test treatments will be administered randomly on a different morning, at least one week&#xD;
      apart. Participants will be required to consume the entire test treatment meal in 7 minutes&#xD;
      while being observed. All test foods will be purchased from local markets. Capillary blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected (~50µl) at time 0 (fasting) and at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes&#xD;
      post-treatment (timing of the post-treatment blood draws started at time 0 [post-treatment],&#xD;
      which is when the participant finishes consuming the treatment meal). Venous blood draws for&#xD;
      insulin assessment will also be acquired at fasting and then every hour for the three hour&#xD;
      study period. Anthropometric measures such as weight, height and waist circumference will be&#xD;
      collected at screening and at the start of each test day. Thirteen hours before testing,&#xD;
      participants will eat a control meal to reduce variation in glycemic responses on test days&#xD;
      due to varying dietary intakes. This control meal will be selected by each participant before&#xD;
      the start of the study. They will be provided a gift card to the chain restaurant to use to&#xD;
      purchase their own meal. Since subjects serve as their own controls, the meals must be&#xD;
      identical before each test draw. Participants will complete 24 hour recall food records the&#xD;
      morning of each test day to provide information related to dietary protocol compliance.&#xD;
