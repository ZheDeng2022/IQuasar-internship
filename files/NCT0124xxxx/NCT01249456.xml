      Title of study: An observational, multicenter study on the safety and efficacy of Femara®&#xD;
      (Letrozole) as an extended adjuvant treatment in breast cancer patients who completed&#xD;
      adjuvant Tamoxifen or Toremifen treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major objective of the study is to assess safety and efficacy of Femara® in women who had&#xD;
      undergone resection of a primary breast cancer and subsequently received prior adjuvant&#xD;
      tamoxifen or toremifen therapy for 5 years in real-life condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims at the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify unknown adverse reactions, especially serious adverse reactions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate incidence and descriptions of adverse reactions under the routine drug use&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify factors that may affect the safety of Femara®&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify factors that may affect the efficacy of Femara®&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This will be an open-label, multi-center, single-arm, observational phase IV&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of centers &amp; patients: Approximately 610 (planned No. of patients for total study&#xD;
      period) patients from 4 centers will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Postmenopausal early breast cancer patients who have finished adjuvant treatment&#xD;
      with Tamoxifen or Toremifen for 5 years after curative surgery as &quot;indications&quot; described in&#xD;
      local product labeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational drug: Femara® will be administered orally as described in &quot;dose &amp;&#xD;
      administration&quot; of local product labeling up to 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: FPFV May. 2006, LPFV Dec. 2011. Study drug will be administered for up to 3&#xD;
      years with renewal of contract on yearly basis.&#xD;
