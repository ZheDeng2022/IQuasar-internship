      Schnitzler syndrome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schnitzler syndrome is a rare disabling autoinflammatory syndrome characterized by a chronic&#xD;
      urticarial rash and monoclonal gammopathy, accompanied by intermittent fever, arthralgia or&#xD;
      arthritis or bone pain. Diagnostic criteria have been established. The disease never remits&#xD;
      spontaneously. Although there is no standard of care, there have been promising developments&#xD;
      in therapeutic options, especially anti-interleukin-1 therapy. Anakinra, a synthetic analogue&#xD;
      of the endogenous interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, has caused rapid clinical remission in&#xD;
      24 patients with Schnitzler syndrome. However, to sustain remission, continuous daily&#xD;
      administration (100 mg sc) is required. The level of monoclonal protein does not decrease.&#xD;
      Side effects of anakinra include painful injection site reactions and neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interleukin-1 and the autoinflammatory diseases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a key proinflammatory cytokine mediating local and systemic responses to infection and&#xD;
      tissue injury, interleukin-1 can induce a range of responses, including fever, pain&#xD;
      sensitization, bone and cartilage destruction, and the acute-phase inflammatory response. The&#xD;
      so-called autoinflammatory diseases are mediated entirely by interleukin-1; reducing&#xD;
      interleukin-1 activity brings about a rapid and sustained remission. Autoinflammatory&#xD;
      diseases include relatively uncommon disorders such as familial Mediterranean fever, adult&#xD;
      and juvenile Still's disease, the hyper-IG D syndrome, Behçet's syndrome, the&#xD;
      cryoporin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor&#xD;
      antagonist (DIRA) and Schnitzler's syndrome. Some common conditions such as gout and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, are also likely to be autoinflammatory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canakinumab:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canakinumab (Ilaris, Novartis Pharma) is a fully human anti-interleukin-1-bèta monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody. Treatment with subcutaneous canakinumab (150 mg) once every 8 weeks was associated&#xD;
      with a rapid remission of symptoms in the great majority of children and adults with CAPS.&#xD;
      Serum inflammatory markers quickly returned to normal. In general, the side effects seen in&#xD;
      this small study (35 patients) were not serious, though suspected infections ware&#xD;
      significantly more prevalent in patients receiving canakinumab than in those receiving&#xD;
      placebo. The prolonged duration of action of canakinumab and low incidence of injection-site&#xD;
      reactions may confer certain advantages over other interleukin-1 inhibitors (anakinra and&#xD;
      rilonacept), since both are frequently associated with injection-site reactions, and both&#xD;
      require more frequent administration (daily for anakinra and weekly for rilonacept).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canakinumab was approved for the treatment of CAPS by the US Food and Drug Administration in&#xD;
      June 2009 and by the European Medicines Agency in October 2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canakinumab is currently being evaluated for its potential in the treatment of systemic-onset&#xD;
      juvenile idiopathic arthritis, diabetes mellitus, and difficult-to-treat gouty arthritis.&#xD;

      Description of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objective: To evaluate if canakinumab 150mg every 8 weeks can induce and&#xD;
           maintain clinical remission in patients with the Schnitzler syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To test if canakinumab 150mg can induce a complete clinical response at Day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess if addition canakinumab 150mg given at Day 7 for patients demonstrating&#xD;
                only a partial response can induce a complete clinical response at Day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate if canakinumab 300mg every 8 weeks can maintain clinical remission in&#xD;
                those patients who required canakinumab 150 mg additional dose on Day 7 and&#xD;
                achieved clinical remission at Day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate the safety of canakinumab treatment in patients with the Schnitzler&#xD;
                syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels during the treatment&#xD;
                period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although no standard therapy has been established for the Schnitzler syndrome, given the&#xD;
      rarity of this auto-inflammatory syndrome, reports on the use of Anakinra, a synthetic analog&#xD;
      of the endogenous interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, have been encouraging. However, side&#xD;
      effects (including local infusion site reactions and neutropenia) and the need for daily sc&#xD;
      administration have hampered its use. The anti-interleukin-1-inhibitor canakinumab may&#xD;
      constitute an effective and more convenient alternative.&#xD;

At Day 7, patients who show an improvement, but not a clinical remission, will be given another 150 mg (or 2 mg/kg for patients weighing &lt;40 kg) injection and continue at 300 mg (or 4 mg/kg for patients weighing &lt;40 kg) every 8 weeks beginning at Week 8.&#xD;
Patients who show no improvement of symptoms and signs of Schnitzler's syndrome will not receive any additional canakinumab dose and will be offered corticosteroid therapy.

If a patient flares twice during the study, physician may optionally change the dosing frequency to every 4 weeks.</description>
