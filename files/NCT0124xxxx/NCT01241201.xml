  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) bacteria adhere to the mucosa of the&#xD;
      proximal intestines. There it produces an toxin which presents a local and relevant challenge&#xD;
      to the intestines. This is proposed to give an indication of general resistance and/or the&#xD;
      local resistance of the intestines. The sequel of events of mucosal inflammation will be&#xD;
      characterized in this study. In addition we will evaluate the effects of probiotics by&#xD;
      comparing the infection symptoms and by measuring faecal weight and mucus in faeces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of probiotics on the&#xD;
      sequels of ETEC administration as intestinal permeability, inflammation and clinical signs as&#xD;
      total faecal output, relative faecal dry weight and mucin excretion in faeces. In addition,&#xD;
      the sequels of the mucosal inflammation will be characterized and biomarkers will be&#xD;
      searched.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study population: 36 Healthy male volunteers; age &gt;= 21 and &lt;= 40 years. Intervention: One&#xD;
      group receives twice daily two sachets containing 450 billion live freeze-dried lactic acid&#xD;
      bacteria per sachet and the other group receives twice daily two placebo sachets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study is designed as a randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind study. Study substance (probiotics) and placebo will be given during 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is the percent change in faecal dry&#xD;
      weight and total faecal output between the probiotics group and the placebo group. In&#xD;
      addition, intestinal permeability, inflammation and other clinical symptoms will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: In this study healthy male volunteers will be challenged with an attenuated ETEC&#xD;
      strain after three weeks of either probiotics or placebo. This infection will lead to a mild&#xD;
      traveller's diarrhoea in the subjects during approximately three days maximally. Sequels of&#xD;
      this infection and the effects of commercially available probiotics compared to placebo will&#xD;
      be followed up. The subjects will therefore collect their faeces on several days, record&#xD;
      their defecation pattern and gastro-intestinal complaints during four weeks, undergo a&#xD;
      physical examination and five venapunctions, and visit our facilities in total on 8 days&#xD;
      (excluding two pre-study visits). The oral administration of probiotics in a healthy&#xD;
      population is not associated with risk.&#xD;
