      Physician-based primary care has thus far failed to address the obesity epidemic. In this&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial of 200 obese patients with heart disease risk factors, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the impact of nurse and dietitian case management on weight loss&#xD;
      and weight maintenance, as an adjunct to physician care. In addition, the investigators will&#xD;
      test the incremental benefit of an environmental support strategy using community health&#xD;
      workers to help patients navigate their home and neighborhood environments to achieve weight&#xD;
      loss. The innovative intervention model developed and evaluated in this project has the&#xD;
      potential to provide a blueprint for successful primary care-based obesity services&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an epidemic in the U.S., with a third of adults obese. Obesity exerts enormous&#xD;
      impact on the nation's health and economy largely through its effect on coronary heart&#xD;
      disease (CHD) risk factors: 3 in 4 obese Americans have at least one CHD risk factor&#xD;
      reversible through weight loss. Working within acute care-centered systems, most clinicians&#xD;
      are unsuccessful in helping their patients lose weight or prevent weight gain. A promising&#xD;
      and well-studied approach is integrated care delivered by nurse and dietitian case managers&#xD;
      (CMs). Nonetheless, clinical prevention services (including CM) may be less effective if&#xD;
      provided in isolation from patients' living environments that so often reinforce caloric&#xD;
      excess and physical inactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This application leverages our extensive expertise in developing and disseminating effective&#xD;
      CM programs (Heart to Heart, R01 HL070781). We will implement an obesity-focused CM program&#xD;
      that focuses on established behavioral weight loss and maintenance strategies and&#xD;
      evidence-based CHD prevention targets. We also will test the additional benefit of structured&#xD;
      &quot;environmental support&quot; (ES) carried out by community health workers that will bridge the gap&#xD;
      between the clinic and patients' homes and neighborhood. Our Specific Aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implement innovative, primary care-based CM and CM+ES interventions in a randomized&#xD;
           clinical trial. We will conduct this trial at a San Mateo Medical Center (SMMC) health&#xD;
           center serving an ethnically diverse, low-income population. We will randomize 200 obese&#xD;
           adults with at least one obesity-related CHD risk factor over 18 months to usual primary&#xD;
           care (40 patients), CM alone (80), or CM+ES (80). Intervention patients in will receive&#xD;
           an intensive weight loss and CHD risk intervention for 12 months, followed by 12 months&#xD;
           of maintenance intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the CM and CM+ES for improving BMI&#xD;
           and CHD risk factors, relative to usual care and each other. Our PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS is&#xD;
           that patients managed through CM+ES will experience greater reductions in BMI over&#xD;
           24-months than those in CM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Transition the favored intervention to a sustainable program, supported by the County,&#xD;
           as well as explore opportunities for broader dissemination to other County and&#xD;
           non-County systems. A business case for dissemination based on our findings will be&#xD;
           critical in seeking this investment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will develop and test two novel models of care design to support sustained&#xD;
      weight loss. Given the failure of current mechanisms to address obesity and elevated CHD&#xD;
      risk, these models have the potential to provide a blueprint for primary care-based obesity&#xD;
      services that can reduce this nation's burden of obesity, especially for low-income&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
