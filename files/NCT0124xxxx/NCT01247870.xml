    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a tablet medication, called&#xD;
      metformin, in flare-ups (exacerbations) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that metformin may effectively control the blood sugar level during&#xD;
      COPD exacerbations. This is important because there is evidence that a high blood sugar level&#xD;
      during exacerbations may be linked with a worse prognosis. The investigators also think that&#xD;
      metformin may have other potentially useful effects on inflammation, antioxidant levels, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of steroid treatment, and recovery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Does metformin lower the blood sugar level in patients suffering from exacerbations of&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide, and a major cause of ill health. In the&#xD;
      UK, it affects some 3.7 million people and causes over 30,000 deaths per year. It is usually,&#xD;
      but not always, caused by smoking. Most people affected are over 65-years-old. Sufferers&#xD;
      experience progressively worsening cough, sputum production, breathlessness and exercise&#xD;
      limitation. This is punctuated by 'flare-ups' (exacerbations), when their symptoms worsen&#xD;
      substantially. Approximately 25% of patients hospitalised for exacerbations die within a&#xD;
      year, and over 50% within 5 years. There is a pressing need for new and improved treatments&#xD;
      for COPD exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the effect of metformin, a tablet medication, in COPD exacerbations.&#xD;
      Metformin has been in common use for over 50 years in patients with diabetes, to lower the&#xD;
      blood sugar level. In COPD exacerbations, the blood sugar level is often high, and the higher&#xD;
      it is, the more likely the patient will have a poor outcome. This led us to speculate that&#xD;
      lowering the sugar level with metformin may improve outcomes from COPD exacerbations.&#xD;
      However, COPD and diabetes are quite different diseases, and the investigators do not know&#xD;
      whether metformin will work as a sugar-lowering medicine in COPD exacerbations. The&#xD;
      investigators need to confirm this before the investigators can perform larger studies to&#xD;
      assess its effect on outcomes such as readmission and mortality rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test this medicine in a 1-month trial in patients hospitalised for&#xD;
      COPD exacerbations. The target sample size is 69 patients, with a minimum of 48 patients&#xD;
      required for primary endpoint analysis. Two-thirds of the patients will take metformin, and&#xD;
      one-third a dummy (placebo) tablet. Neither the patients nor the researchers know who is&#xD;
      taking which. The investigators will measure their sugar levels by regular finger-prick&#xD;
      tests, and then compare the average readings in the two groups. The investigators will also&#xD;
      assess the medicine's effects on other markers of blood sugar level, and carry out additional&#xD;
      exploratory investigations on the effect of the medicine on clinical outcomes, markers of&#xD;
      inflammation, and markers of oxidative/carbonyl stress and steroid responsiveness.&#xD;
