      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several surgical procedures in which irrigation fluids are used to enable vision&#xD;
      and treatment in body cavities, such as hysteroscopy, arthroscopy and cystoscopy. Several&#xD;
      solutions are used for irrigation: normal saline, glycin, mannitol, sorbitol and others.&#xD;
      Post-operative complications, as visual disturbances, confusion and other neurologic symptoms&#xD;
      were attributed to irrigation fluid absorption, water intoxication and hyponatremia, and are&#xD;
      refered to as &quot;TURP syndrome&quot; when appearing following transurethral prostatectomy (TURP).&#xD;
      Historically, a reduced serum sodium concentration has been used to diagnose absorption of&#xD;
      electrolytes-free irrigating fluid during urologic procedures. However, neurologic symptoms&#xD;
      following transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) do not correlate with blood sodium level,&#xD;
      moreover, Hyponatremia may not be the sole or even the primary cause of the neurological&#xD;
      manifestations of TURP syndrome. Other techniques were suggested for evaluating the volume of&#xD;
      irrigation solution absorption though none is used routinely in the clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous Lithotripsy (PCNL) is a procedure used to treat patients with nephrolithiasis.&#xD;
      In this procedure irrigation fluid is administered into the kidney and urinary tract&#xD;
      collecting system. The solution used is normal saline. In earlier studies there was no&#xD;
      evidence for absorption of the irrigation fluids, though medical literature on this issue is&#xD;
      limited. However, minute changes in electrolytes and acid-base balance may indicate the&#xD;
      opposite is true. Indeed, the volume of irrigation and duration of the procedure may have an&#xD;
      effect as well. According to the investigators hypothesis, the change in Ph and reduction in&#xD;
      base content in patients undergoing PCNL may be the result of irrigation fluid absorption,&#xD;
      since chloride from the normal saline is known to cause such effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This is an observational prospective study of consecutive 200 adult patients&#xD;
      undergoing elective surgery of PCNL in the investigators operating rooms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect data that is taken from the patient's file and routine&#xD;
      management of these patients: age, gender, weight, pre-operative blood tests including:&#xD;
      electrolytes, creatinine, hematocrit, ph, bicarbonate, base, length of the procedure, volume&#xD;
      and type of irrigation fluids used, volume and type of intravenous fluids used.&#xD;
      Post-operative blood tests will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare pre and post-operative blood tests, especially ph,&#xD;
      bicarbonate, base content, sodium. The investigators will analyse statistically the&#xD;
      correlation between the change of each parameter (delta X) and the volume of irrigation&#xD;
      fluids used during the surgery.&#xD;
