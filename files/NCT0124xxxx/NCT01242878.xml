  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder of the red blood cell. It is now the&#xD;
      commonest genetic disorder in the UK and of childhood stroke, with up to 40% of children&#xD;
      having a stroke (clinical or picked up on a scan) by school age. Patients are prone to&#xD;
      develop acute crises necessitating hospital admission and resulting in long-term&#xD;
      complications. Such events result in considerable morbidity, disability and mortality with&#xD;
      its consequent burden on patients, families, the health service and society as a whole.&#xD;
      Doctors have very little ability to predict who will get ill and when and so it is very&#xD;
      difficult to known when and how to administer treatments. Furthermore there is very little in&#xD;
      the way of treatments available and the mainstay of prevention is a chronic blood transfusion&#xD;
      programme which is expensive, requires time off work and school and can be fraught with&#xD;
      complications. This, in a population who is frequently educationally and socially&#xD;
      disadvantaged at the outset. Recent evidence in sickle cell disease and other diseases that&#xD;
      have similar underlying processes, points towards the importance of microparticles&#xD;
      (circulating broken pieces of cells) and the coagulation system as being important. By&#xD;
      comparing levels of these particles and molecules in patients with those found in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and with other measures known to be important, this study hopes to identify their&#xD;
      role so as to improve the management of these patients and potentially to lead the way for&#xD;
      new therapies. Participants will be required to donate a small amount of blood (1 teaspoon in&#xD;
      the very young, two in older children and adults). The investigators aim to take this sample&#xD;
      where possible when people are having a blood test in any case.&#xD;

      Purpose and design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Why is it needed? The purpose of this study is to try and identify a measurable&#xD;
           parameter to act as a disease indicator in sickle cell disease. The reason such a&#xD;
           parameter is needed is that although patients seem to have the same genetic defect, they&#xD;
           can have enormously different outcomes ranging from mild illness to stroke, catastrophic&#xD;
           chest disease, kidney failure and death. Currently we have no real tools to properly&#xD;
           prognosticate. This means it is difficult to know when to intervene in an illness and&#xD;
           when to scale down and stop treatment. The repercussions of not intervening in a timely&#xD;
           manner can be catastrophic and it is known that children who develop stroke have future&#xD;
           ongoing and progressive intellectual deficits. The identification of a disease indicator&#xD;
           could have potential for therapeutic innovation in the future. This is important as much&#xD;
           of the current treatments are blunt, expensive and not always effective. In addition&#xD;
           there is a paucity of treatment options for the clinician and those that are available&#xD;
           e.g. blood transfusion are expensive socially and financially, have medical&#xD;
           complications and are realistically not available for the majority of people who have&#xD;
           sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Why microparticles and coagulation markers? An excellent candidate for the role of&#xD;
           disease prognosticator is coagulation markers and microparticles. Microparticles and&#xD;
           coagulation markers have been shown by members of this investigative group to be&#xD;
           elevated in sickle cell disease and in other paediatric vascular diseases. There has&#xD;
           been a lot of interest in the haematology world of late in these particles with papers&#xD;
           and presentations and all the international conferences - EHA (European Haematology&#xD;
           Association), BSH (British Society of Haematology) and ASH (American Society of&#xD;
           Hematology), though these have been performed on small selected groups, frequently on&#xD;
           adults only and only rarely with any sort of controls. What has not been done so far is&#xD;
           to compare these levels to ethnically matched people or to measure these in children&#xD;
           with sickle cell disease. This is remiss as it is known that the vascular changes occur&#xD;
           right from the beginning of life with children have symptoms and signs of vasculopathy&#xD;
           often by 6 months of age and with up to 40% having had some sort of stroke by school&#xD;
           entry. What also has been omitted is performing these tests in a larger cohort and&#xD;
           comparing with the variety of current measures of disease severity and measure of&#xD;
           vasculopathy. It is only with this kind of information can we make proper inferences&#xD;
           about the importance of these measures and go on to develop studies where these are used&#xD;
           as disease prognosticators and one day even as a target for therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Why here and now? Here and now presents a perfect opportunity for this study. Dr&#xD;
           Trompeter is the author of the study and will be coordinating the study. She is&#xD;
           currently a locum Consultant Haematologist at UCLH and a Specialist Registrar in&#xD;
           Haemoglobinopathies at Guy's and St Thomas' and has been looking after the in- and&#xD;
           out-patients with sickle cell disease at these sites. She has also been involved in&#xD;
           ongoing studies in sickle cell disease at these sites as an investigator. Furthermore&#xD;
           she has worked in a similar clinical capacity at both UCLH and The Whittington Hospital&#xD;
           and has built up a good rapport and working relationship with staff, patients and their&#xD;
           families at these sites. She is registered for a PhD at UCL and has already performed&#xD;
           these assays as part of the original ongoing study in adults with sickle cell disease,&#xD;
           which has papers published and soon to be submitted. These sites in combination&#xD;
           represent one of the largest cohort of sickle cell patients in the country. The centres&#xD;
           have been externally audited as part of the sickle peer review and have had their&#xD;
           considerable qualities assessed and lauded. They have the capacity, ability and habit of&#xD;
           measuring all the other parameters of interest in this study as a matter of routine&#xD;
           clinical care. The clinicians have enormous experience and rapport with their patients&#xD;
           but also have a considerable research repertoire. The Professors and scientists in this&#xD;
           study have all demonstrated their immense knowledge and expertise in the fields of&#xD;
           sickle cell disease and vasculopathy and are internationally renown, leading many&#xD;
           important related studies. They have provided much of the support and scientific&#xD;
           rationale to the designing of this study. The investigators are well known to the sickle&#xD;
           community and its representatives and the author has spoken with patients groups who&#xD;
           persistently express a desire for medical advancement and showed a real interest and&#xD;
           support for this study. This conglomeration of sites, clinicians, experts and patients&#xD;
           represents the most exciting opportunity for advancing the understanding of sickle cell&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be identified by the Investigator (who is part of their normal care&#xD;
           team) from the in- or out-patient setting as having met the inclusion criteria. Patients&#xD;
           with sickle cell disease attend dedicated clinics and are well known to the&#xD;
           investigators. The consent procedures are described below. There will be no payment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the case of the patients, they will then progress to have their scheduled blood test&#xD;
           as part of their normal clinic care, onto which a further blood sample (1 teaspoon in&#xD;
           the case of small children, 2 teaspoons in the case of older children and adults) will&#xD;
           be obtained for the purpose of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are two groups of healthy volunteers - adults and children. They should be&#xD;
           ethnically matched. The majority of the adults can be identified from the sickle clinic&#xD;
           setting as family members attending with their patient relative. These people have the&#xD;
           additional advantage of knowing their sickle status. There are also many ethnically&#xD;
           matched members of staff or other people attending the hospital that may want to be&#xD;
           involved in the study. Some adult volunteers will have a blood sample for the purpose of&#xD;
           the study only, others will be having blood tests in any case and the study sample being&#xD;
           taken in addition, if they do not know their sickle status they will be tested. They&#xD;
           will consent separately for this and the information given back to them regarding this&#xD;
           second test. Separate consent will also be taken for reporting to them and their G.P.&#xD;
           also. Ethnically matched children healthy volunteers will be identified from the in and&#xD;
           outpatient setting. They are extremely likely to know their sickle status in any case&#xD;
           because of the national screening programme. Children will only participate in the study&#xD;
           if they are having a blood tests in any case.&#xD;
