      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is a rare fast-growing lung tumor that is associated with&#xD;
      other, rare tumor types. Most cases of PPB appear in children younger than 6 years of age.&#xD;
      Recently, it has been shown that this condition can be inherited (e.g., mutation of the&#xD;
      DICER1 gene). Researchers are studying both clinical and genetic aspects of this newly&#xD;
      described condition. They are interested in collecting further medical history and genetic&#xD;
      information on individuals and close relatives of individuals who have PPB or other rare&#xD;
      associated tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study individuals with a personal or a family history of pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB)&#xD;
      or other rare tumors that can be associated with PPB (e.g., cystic nephroma, nasal&#xD;
      chondromesenchymal hamartoma, ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, ocular medulloepithelioma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals who have been diagnosed with PPB and/or PPB-related tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Close blood relatives (e.g., parents, siblings, grandparents) of individuals who have&#xD;
           been diagnosed with PPB and/or PPB-related tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interested participants can enroll or inquire about this study by calling&#xD;
           1-800-518-8474.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to complete family history and medical history&#xD;
           questionnaires. They will complete the questionnaire if they are at least 18 years of&#xD;
           age, or another person will complete the questionnaire if the key family member is too&#xD;
           young to do so on his or her own.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to sign a medical record release form to allow researchers to&#xD;
           examine detailed medical history information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may be asked to have a physical examination and imaging studies, provide&#xD;
           blood and saliva samples, or provide tumor tissue from prior biopsies or cancer&#xD;
           surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Annually, participants will update the family history and individual information&#xD;
           questionnaires to document important changes in medical history, and will also update&#xD;
           the medical record release form. Participants may be asked to provide additional cheek&#xD;
           lining cells and/or blood samples, as well as tumor tissue from any new or planned&#xD;
           biopsies or tumor surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this protocol.&#xD;

      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DICER1-Related Pleuropulmonary Blastoma Cancer Predisposition Syndrome: A Natural History&#xD;
      Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multidisciplinary natural history study with self-administered questionnaires,&#xD;
      clinical/epidemiologic/genetic evaluations, clinical and research laboratory tests, review of&#xD;
      medical records, cancer surveillance, and biospecimen acquisition. In 2009, Hill and&#xD;
      colleagues identified heterozygous germline disease-associated variants in DICER1, a gene&#xD;
      which encodes a crucial component of the microRNA processing machinery, in patients with&#xD;
      familial pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB). This disorder represents the first reported cancer&#xD;
      predisposition syndrome that is due to altered microRNA biogenesis, and its discovery&#xD;
      presents a unique and extraordinary opportunity for CGB and DCEG to play a substantial role&#xD;
      in the development of this new area, one which is virtually certain to have etiologic&#xD;
      ramifications far beyond those related to PPB itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish a cohort of patients with PPB and/or specific neoplasms of the&#xD;
           DICER1-related tumor risks (cystic nephroma, nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma, ovarian&#xD;
           Sertoli-Leydig cell and other sex cord-stromal tumors, ocular medulloepithelioma, Wilms&#xD;
           tumor, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, pineoblastoma, others to be defined), in order to&#xD;
           determine the frequency of DICER1 germline disease-associated variants in these patients&#xD;
           and their family members. This will also allow us to identify DICER1 disease-associated&#xD;
           variant-negative patients who will be crucial for future gene discovery efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize the clinical phenotype of, and study the incident and prevalent cancer&#xD;
           rates in, these patients and their family members, for all cancers combined, and for&#xD;
           each type of cancer, and to identify and confirm the specific types of cancer and benign&#xD;
           neoplasms associated with this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify differences between patients with a germline disease-associated variant in&#xD;
           DICER1 (or another gene(s) from this pathway) who do develop cancer and those who do not&#xD;
           develop cancer. These differences may include genotype/phenotype/cancer susceptibility&#xD;
           differences, modifier genes (gene-gene interactions) and environmental risk factors&#xD;
           (gene-environment interactions). The latter two may be informative for modification of&#xD;
           cancer risk in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To develop evidence-based management guidelines for cancer prevention and risk-reduction&#xD;
           strategies for patients with PPB and other DICER1-related tumors and their family&#xD;
           members prior to and after obtaining answers to the questions/objectives above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate various parameters related to psychosocial and behavioral issues resulting&#xD;
           from being a member of a family at increased risk of PPB and other DICER1-related&#xD;
           tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To create a biospecimen repository of carefully annotated tissue samples for use in&#xD;
           subsequent etiologically-oriented translational research projects. These samples&#xD;
           comprise an invaluable resource for current and future studies related to the etiology&#xD;
           of, and outcomes following, the various neoplasms that are now known, or later found to&#xD;
           be, part of the DICER1-related tumor risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints: include all cancers, with specific attention to those currently thought to&#xD;
      be part of the DICER1-related tumor risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: include non-malignant health issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals with PPB and other DICER1-related tumors and their relatives of interest&#xD;
           (parents, siblings, grandparents, other family members at increased risk) at any age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals in the general population with one or more of the unique tumors reported in&#xD;
           patients and families with PPB, cystic nephroma, ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors,&#xD;
           ocular medulloepithelioma, and nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma, and other related&#xD;
           conditions that will be identified under objective 2. Relatives of these patients will&#xD;
           be eligible for study enrollment as well (e.g., parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts,&#xD;
           uncles, cousins, disease-associated DICER1 variant carriers, other family members at&#xD;
           increased risk).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single site for enrollment (NIH Clinical Center). The NIH Clinical Center provides the ideal&#xD;
      infrastructure for this type of study, including travel for patients and extramural experts,&#xD;
      funding for resource intensive imaging and laboratory tests, and the ability to translate&#xD;
      information from the bench to the bedside and back to the bench.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to be an open-ended natural history study with anticipated enrollment&#xD;
      of 20-50 patients per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed in the field for the duration of the study; these participants&#xD;
      are in the Field Cohort. Some participants will be invited and seen at the clinical center as&#xD;
      long as they are willing to do so; these participants are in the Clinical Center cohort. Then&#xD;
      they will continue to be followed in the field for the duration of the study.&#xD;
