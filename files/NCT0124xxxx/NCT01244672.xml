  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the frequency and severity of postoperative( after&#xD;
      surgery) pain between two surgical techniques for treating severe hemorrhoids. The two&#xD;
      techniques are called: transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization (THD) and standard surgical&#xD;
      excision (removal) of the hemorrhoids&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The THD technique involves using ultrasound equipment to identify the arteries that are&#xD;
      feeding blood into the hemorrhoids. Once located, stitches are placed around those arteries&#xD;
      to cut off the blood supply to the hemorrhoids, which destroys them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the standard surgical excision technique, the hemorrhoids are removed by cutting them out&#xD;
      with a scalpel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both techniques are widely used in many hospitals today. However, there have been no formal&#xD;
      studies comparing the two techniques regarding outcomes, particularly regarding pain after&#xD;
      the procedure. We plan to enroll 60 patients in this study here at Stony Brook; 30 patients&#xD;
      will have THD and 30 will have the standard surgical excision of hemorrhoids.&#xD;

    <description>This is a modification of the Milligan-Morgan technique, whereby the incisions are totally or partially closed with absorbable running suture. A retractor is used to expose the hemorrhoidal tissue, which is then removed surgically. The remaining tissue is either sutured or is sealed through the coagulation effects of a surgical device.</description>

    <description>Transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization will be performed using an endoscopic ultrasonic probe. Approximately 7-8 hemorrhoidal arteries will be ligated at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 o'clock position as previously described in the literature. The ligation will be performed using a vicryl suture. The ultrasonic probe locates the arterial signal.</description>
