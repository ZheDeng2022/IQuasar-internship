      The investigators hypothesized that the early treatment of PDA with ibuprofen doses higher&#xD;
      than those actually recommended might increase the closure rate in preterm infants with&#xD;
      gestational age &lt;29 weeks without increasing the occurrence of associated adverse effects. To&#xD;
      assess this hypothesis the investigators planned a multicenter randomized controlled study to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of the current ibuprofen regimen to that of a high-dose regimen in&#xD;
      closing PDA.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The patency of ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a frequent complication in preterm infants&#xD;
      suffering from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and 60% to 70% of preterm infants of &lt;28&#xD;
      weeks' gestation receive medical or surgical therapy for a PDA [1]. Neonates with a&#xD;
      left-to-right shunt through the ductus complicating their RDS have higher respiratory&#xD;
      failure, lower survival rate, and increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH),&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) [2]. Therefore, closure&#xD;
      of PDA is indicated before a significant left-to-right shunting occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patent ductus arteriosus can be treated effectively with intravenous indomethacin and&#xD;
      ibuprofen, leading to permanent ductal closure in 60% to 80% of infants [3-5]. However,&#xD;
      preterm infants treated with ibuprofen experience lower serum creatinine values, higher urine&#xD;
      output, and less undesirable decreased organ blood flow and vasoconstrictive adverse effects&#xD;
      than indomethacin-treated patients [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Sperandio et al. reported that high-doses of indomethacin (1 mg/kg: fivefold the&#xD;
      usual dose) were safe and effective in closing PDA in 98.5% of infants with gestational age &lt;&#xD;
      33 weeks, and demonstrated that the closure rate of PDA was related to the cumulative dose of&#xD;
      given indomethacin [6]. Moreover, Desfrere et al. demonstrated that the currently recommended&#xD;
      dose regimen of ibuprofen (10-5-5 mg/kg/day) is associated with a low estimated probability&#xD;
      (30.6%) of closing PDA in infants while a high-dose regimen (20-10-10 mg/kg/day) might be&#xD;
      associated with a greater, although unsatisfactory, probability (54.8%) of closing PDA,&#xD;
      without relevant side affects [7]. Furthermore, Hirt et al., based on pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      findings, proposed increasing the dose regimen of ibuprofen during the postnatal period from&#xD;
      10-5-5 mg/kg/day in preterm infants &lt;70 h of age to 14-7-7 mg/kg/day in infants 70-108 h of&#xD;
      age and 18-9-9 mg/kg/day in infants 108-180 h of age [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies [6-8] suggest that the failure of pharmacologic PDA closure might be due to the&#xD;
      inadequacy of the standard dose regimen because of large interindividual pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic variations in premature infants during treatment for PDA [9,10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that the early treatment of PDA with ibuprofen doses higher&#xD;
      than those actually recommended might increase the closure rate in preterm infants with&#xD;
      gestational age &lt;29 weeks without increasing the occurrence of associated adverse effects. To&#xD;
      assess this hypothesis the investigators planned a multicenter randomized controlled study to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of the current ibuprofen regimen to that of a high-dose regimen in&#xD;
      closing PDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients Four tertiary neonatal intensive care units participated in the&#xD;
      trial (the Careggi University Hospital of Florence, the Sant'Anna University Hospital of&#xD;
      Turin, the Regional Hospital of Bozen, the IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico of Milan). The&#xD;
      study was approved by the medical ethics committee of each center. Neonates were enrolled&#xD;
      after written informed consent was obtained from their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria for enrolment were a gestational age &lt;29 weeks; an echocardiographic evidence of&#xD;
      significant PDA; an age of 12 to 24 hours; and RDS necessitating respiratory support.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were major congenital anomalies; life-threatening infection or hydrops&#xD;
      fetalis; pulmonary hypertension; death before the conclusion of the first course of&#xD;
      ibuprofen; urine output below 1 ml per kilogram of body weight per hour during the preceding&#xD;
      12 hours (with the exception of the first dose); a serum creatinine concentration of &gt;1.5&#xD;
      mg/dL (129 Î¼mol per liter); a platelet count of &lt;50,000/mm3; a tendency to bleed, as revealed&#xD;
      by hematuria, blood in the endotracheal aspirate, gastric aspirate, or stools, and oozing&#xD;
      from puncture sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The infants in each unit were randomly assigned to a treatment group by means of&#xD;
      cards in sealed opaque envelopes. Each infant received three doses of intravenous ibuprofen&#xD;
      (Pedea, Orphan Europe, Paris, France) either according to the standard regimen: an initial&#xD;
      dose of 10 mg/kg, followed by two doses of 5 mg/kg each, after 24 and 48 hours; or at&#xD;
      high-dose regimen: an initial dose of 20 mg/kg, followed by two doses of 10 mg/kg each, after&#xD;
      24 and 48 hours. The treatment was started at 12 to 24 hours of age and the medication was&#xD;
      infused continuously over a period of 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the ductus arteriosus was still patent after the randomly assigned treatment in a&#xD;
      patient in either group a second course of ibuprofen at high-dose (20-10-10 mg/kg/day) was&#xD;
      given as nonrandomized treatment, starting 24 hours after the last dose of the first course.&#xD;
      If there was a contraindication to the second pharmacologic treatment, or if this therapy&#xD;
      also failed to promote ductal closure, subsequent pharmacological and/or surgical treatment&#xD;
      of PDA was at the discretion of the each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plasma ibuprofen concentration was measured in blood samples obtained 15 minutes after&#xD;
      the first dose of ibuprofen and 24 hours after the last dose 6 using high-pressure liquid&#xD;
      chromatography (HPLC), as previously described [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography The first heart ultrasound examination was performed at 12 to 24 hours of&#xD;
      age to ascertain the normality of cardiac anatomy, to rule out the possibility of congenital&#xD;
      heart disease with &quot;ductus dependent&quot; pulmonary or systemic blood flow and pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension, and to evaluate the PDA. The diagnosis of hemodynamically significant PDA&#xD;
      requiring treatment was made by echocardiographic demonstration of a ductal left- to-right&#xD;
      shunt, with a left atrium to aortic root ratio &gt;1.3 or a ductal size &gt;1.5 mm 12. In enrolled&#xD;
      patients echocardiography was repeated after each dose of ibuprofen (12-24 hours after the&#xD;
      last dose of the assigned treatment) and at 7+1, 15+2, 30+2 days of life to detect a possible&#xD;
      re-opening of PDA. All echocardiographic studies were performed by physicians who were&#xD;
      unaware of the infants' treatment assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid intake was guided by the body weight, serum sodium concentrations and serum osmolality.&#xD;
      Daily fluid intake started with 70-80 ml per kilogram and was increased by 10-20 ml/kg/day up&#xD;
      to 150 mL/kg at the end of the first week of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For treatment of RDS, infants received oxygen-therapy, respiratory supports (nasal continuous&#xD;
      positive pressure, patient-triggered ventilation, high frequency oscillatory ventilation),&#xD;
      and rescue surfactant treatment (Curosurf, Chiesi Farmaceutici Spa, Parma, Italy: first dose:&#xD;
      200 mg/kg; following dose: 100 mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gestational age, birth weight, sex, type of delivery, antenatal steroid treatment and main&#xD;
      maternal pregnancy pathologies (preterm non-induced labor, hypertensive disorders, premature&#xD;
      rupture of membranes, abruptio placentae, intrauterine growth restriction), highest FIO2 and&#xD;
      mean airway pressure (MAP) values, type and duration of respiratory support, need of&#xD;
      surfactant; daily fluid intake during the 1st week of life, and need of dopmine/dobutamine or&#xD;
      plasma for hypotension were recorded for each infant. Serum creatinine was dosed at 1, 3, and&#xD;
      7 days of life, while daily urine output was measured through its collection in adhesive&#xD;
      urine bags during the 1st week of life. Oliguria was defined as a urine output &lt;1 ml/kg/h&#xD;
      during a 24-hour collection period. Moreover, platelet count was measured at 1, 3, and 7 days&#xD;
      of life and bleeding disorders (as revealed by hematuria, blood in the endotracheal aspirate,&#xD;
      gastric aspirate, or stools, and oozing from puncture sites) were recorded during the 1st&#xD;
      week of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each infants were reported: the occurrence of ICH and ICH and periventricular hemorrhage&#xD;
      (PVL) [13,14], BPD [15], retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) [16], NEC [17], sepsis [18],&#xD;
      mortality and duration of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the successful rate in&#xD;
      closing PDA using ibuprofen. The investigators considered ibuprofen failure to be the lack of&#xD;
      PDA closure at the end of the first course of ibuprofen in both the standard and high-dose&#xD;
      regimen groups. On the basis of the data and in agreement with data from the literature 3-5,&#xD;
      the investigators assumed a failure rate of 25% in the group treated with the standard&#xD;
      ibuprofen regimen. Thus, to detect as statistically significant a decrease of failure rate of&#xD;
      20 % (to 5%) in the group treated with the high ibuprofen regimen, the investigators&#xD;
      calculated that a sample size of at least 34 infants in each group was necessary at a power&#xD;
      of 0.80 and Î±=0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical characteristics of the two groups were described by mean values and standard&#xD;
      deviation, or median values and range, or by rate and percentage. The t-test, Wilcoxon&#xD;
      rank-sum test, and Fisher's exact test were used to compare continuous normally distributed&#xD;
      data, nonparametric continuous data, and categorical data, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints were the evaluation of the effectiveness of the high-dose ibuprofen&#xD;
      course in closing PDA refractory to the first ibuprofen course; possible association between&#xD;
      dose regimen, occurrence of adverse effects, and ibuprofen plasma level; comparison of the&#xD;
      incidence of ICH, PVL, ROP, NEC, BPD, sepsis, death and hospital stay duration in the two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple logistic regression was performed to assess the influence of predictive factors on&#xD;
      the rate of PDA after the 1st ibuprofen course; the factors the investigators analyzed were&#xD;
      gestational age, sex, birth weight, use or nonuse of antenatal glucocorticoid, highest FIO2&#xD;
      and MAP values, assignment to standard or high-dose ibuprofen regimen group. Effect estimates&#xD;
      are expressed as relative risk (RR) with profile likelihood-based 95% confidence limits.&#xD;
