      Research Question: Does replacing Sugar Sweetened (SS) beverages with water consumption&#xD;
      promote a decrease in triglycerides blood levels over 9 months in overweight women? The&#xD;
      primary outcome variable is the triglycerides blood level. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      will consider as secondary outcome variables the following parameters of metabolic syndrome:&#xD;
      weight, fasting insulin and glucose, HOMA, HDL-cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure, and waist circumference. The investigators will also consider as an outcome&#xD;
      variable glycosylated (or glycated) hemoglobin (HbA1c).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Two groups randomized controlled trial, with an intervention group (water and&#xD;
      education provision) and control group (education provision only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to recruit young adult women aged &gt;18-&lt;45 y who are overweight or&#xD;
      obese (BMI &gt;25 and &lt;39), and consume at least 250 calories per day from caloric beverages&#xD;
      (e.g., includes soft drinks, juices, sports drinks, sweetened tea or coffee, and alcoholic&#xD;
      beverages) The intervention group (water and education provision) will be compared with a&#xD;
      control condition (education provision only). The intervention has been proposed to be&#xD;
      carried out for 9 months period with objective measurements of body weight and fat, total&#xD;
      cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, fasting blood glucose, HbA1C, hydration status, blood pressure,&#xD;
      and 24 hrs dietary recalls at baseline, 3,6 and 9 months&#xD;

      Study subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to recruit young adult women aged 18-45 y who are overweight or&#xD;
      obese (BMI &gt;25 and &lt;39), with fasting triglyceride level &gt; 150 mg/dl, and consume at least&#xD;
      250 calories per day from caloric beverages (e.g., includes soft drinks, juices, sports&#xD;
      drinks, sweetened tea or coffee, and alcoholic beverages). It is important to note that this&#xD;
      is the average intake from caloric beverages for Mexican adolescent and adult women and&#xD;
      represents the average Mexican adolescent and young woman behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Participants will be recruited at a private weight-reduction clinic in&#xD;
      Cuernavaca, Morelos (study site). Women will be invited to participate through local&#xD;
      advertisements. Potential participants will be screened in order to evaluate if they fulfill&#xD;
      the selection criteria of caloric beverages, BMI and triglyceride levels. Subsequently, in&#xD;
      order to identify women with a high sweetened-beverage consumption women selected during the&#xD;
      fist screening will be followed during a one-month period (referred to as the screening stage&#xD;
      from now on), prior to recruitment into the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening stage This stage will consist in one month period of follow-up of women who have&#xD;
      fulfilled the BMI, age, triglyceride and other selection criteria. During this period, three&#xD;
      simplified 24-hr beverage-oriented dietary recalls (2 during week days and one weekend) will&#xD;
      be collected approximately 7-10 days apart from each other. These 24 hr-recalls will&#xD;
      exclusively seek to evaluate high caloric intake coming from sweetened caloric beverages.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators will evaluate the consumption of all commercial and homemade&#xD;
      caloric sweetened beverages (including juices, &quot;aguas frescas&quot;, coffee and tea with added&#xD;
      sugar). The investigators will also measure triglyceride levels in a blood drop collected&#xD;
      through finger prick, at the study site. The specimen collection process will be quick, and&#xD;
      with minimal discomfort for the participants. The investigators will use special lancet and a&#xD;
      couple of drops of blood will be taken from a nick of a finger and deposited onto special&#xD;
      analytic strip. Finally, a pregnancy test will be performed at the first visit for&#xD;
      confirmation purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon conclusion of the screening stage eligible participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either the intervention or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that the intervention will require participant's time involvement, throughout the&#xD;
      intervention period all participants will receive a $15 compensation plus snacks at each&#xD;
      follow-up visit. This sum was established based on the estimated cost of a time taken for&#xD;
      work to attend visits and the cost of transportation to and from the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group (water provision) will be compared with a control condition (control&#xD;
      group). The intervention has been proposed to be carried out for 9 months period with&#xD;
      objective measurements of body weight and fat, total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose, HbA1C, hydration status, blood pressure, and 24 hrs dietary recalls at baseline, 3,6&#xD;
      and 9 months. Body weight will be also assessed at other times during the study. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects, identified during the screening stage, will be randomly assigned either to receive&#xD;
      water or to the control group. Boyh groups will be identical in all, except for the water&#xD;
      deliveries and promotion of reducing the intake of sweetened caloric beverage and their&#xD;
      substitution by an increase in water promotion. In order to pursuing this, specific&#xD;
      counseling targeting to rationale and strategies for replacing caloric beverages to promote&#xD;
      weight loss will be provided to the intervention group. In order to ensure that participants&#xD;
      are not aware to the study group which they belong to (intervention or control group), the&#xD;
      investigators will provide both groups with the same counseling in nutrition topics, except&#xD;
      regarding the water consumption information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention description (Water group) and contacts: The goal for subjects assigned in the&#xD;
      water group will be to reduce to a minimum or null the intake of caloric beverages, including&#xD;
      carbonated (fizzy) and non-carbonated (still) beverages, coffee and tea with sugar, milk or&#xD;
      cream added, juice drinks, soy beverages, and sugar sweetened &quot;aguas frescas&quot;, , energy&#xD;
      drinks, and smoothies. Participants will be instructed to drink water, replacing the caloric&#xD;
      beverages mentioned above. Subjects assigned to this group will receive biweekly home&#xD;
      deliveries of water during the 9 month of the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to answer the research questions outlined above, adherence to the beverage reduction&#xD;
      recommendations must be strongly promoted. To support the modification of beverage intake in&#xD;
      the intervention group, participants will take part on monthly face to face treatment&#xD;
      meetings will be held with trained dietician and or weight loss interventionists. These&#xD;
      meetings will be held at convenient times and will be conducted on an individual basis as&#xD;
      well as for groups of 8 to 10 participants . Participants will be weighed at each monthly&#xD;
      meeting and weekly beverage consumption data will be collected. The individual and group&#xD;
      meetings will cover rationale and strategies for replacing caloric beverages to promote&#xD;
      weight loss. During the meetings challenges associated with the proposed behavior change and&#xD;
      potential solutions will be discussed, and behavioral modification strategies to promote&#xD;
      compliance will also be addressed. In addition, the weight loss interventionists and/or&#xD;
      trained dieticians will call participants in a biweekly basis in order to maintain&#xD;
      enthusiasm, ask for water supply status, and help solving challenges faced during the week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Water/Beverage Provision:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To insure water availability, bottled water will be home delivered during the intervention&#xD;
      period and/or available for pick-up at the monthly follow-up visits. Based on the work of&#xD;
      Ebbeling et al.( ), the investigators plan to provide between 2 to 3 liters of water per&#xD;
      person per day with 2 additional servings per day being provided to account for possible&#xD;
      consumption of other family members, though this will be discouraged. Another option the&#xD;
      investigators have identified in order to address the issue of consumption of the water&#xD;
      provided by other family members is to provide an additional water dispenser for the&#xD;
      household and additional large bottle of water for participants. The investigators will&#xD;
      insure that participants receive the adequate serving sizes to fit their needs, for instance&#xD;
      adequate bottle size to take water to workplace or other places. The qualitative component of&#xD;
      the study will allow us to ascertain the size and number of water bottles to be provide to&#xD;
      each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will meet with the Bonafont, Mexico, marketing team to discuss&#xD;
      how consumers use water and bottle size issues. This will be invaluable not only in the&#xD;
      selection of beverage sizes but also in the design of the water consumption nutrition&#xD;
      promotion programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group and contacts: Like the water group, the subjects in the control group will&#xD;
      receive general nutrition advice not related to weight or food intake. They will not be&#xD;
      granted specific information on reducing caloric beverage intake information related to&#xD;
      beverage consumption and health. Participants in this group will be contacted following the&#xD;
      same contact schedule and frequency as intervention group participants.&#xD;
