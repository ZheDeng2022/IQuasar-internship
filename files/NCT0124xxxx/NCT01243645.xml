      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biofeedback techniques have demonstrated their uselfulness in the treatment of maculopathies.&#xD;
      We wanted to evaluate the efficacy of visual rehabilitation by means of two different types&#xD;
      of biofeedback techniques in patients with age related macular degeneration (AMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients bilaterally affected by AMD were enrolled with a mean age of 76,38±8,77 yrs.&#xD;
      Patients were randomly divided in two groups: Group A was treated with an acoustic&#xD;
      biofeedback, Group B with luminous biofeedback of a black and white checkerboard flickering&#xD;
      during the examination. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmological examination.&#xD;
      Rehabilitation consisted in 12 training sessions of 10 minutes for each eye performed once a&#xD;
      week for both groups. Statistical analysis was performed using t- test. P values less than&#xD;
      0.05 were considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: visual acuity at the end of rehabilitation had improved, but this result was not&#xD;
      statistically significant (p=0.054), reading speed showed a significant statistical&#xD;
      improvement (p=0.031), as well as the fixation stability (p=0.0023) and single point mean&#xD;
      retinal sensitivity value (p=0.044).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: visual acuity improvement at the end of rehabilitation was statistically significant&#xD;
      (p=0.048), reading speed showed a statistically significant improvement (p=0.024), as well as&#xD;
      fixation stability (p=0.0012) and mean single point retinal sensitivity value (p=0.027).&#xD;
      Final results for both groups were compared and patients in group B showed results which were&#xD;
      statistically more significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A contrast rich flickering biofeedback stimulus showed a statistically significant&#xD;
      improvement in training the patients to modify their preferred retinal locus (PRL) in&#xD;
      comparison to acoustic biofeedback. It is possible that increased involvement of the various&#xD;
      retinal cell populations with visual stimuli create more efficient ganglion cell response&#xD;
      that better utilize the residual retinal function.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We enrolled 30 patients (18 women and 12 men), ranging in age from 56-89 with a mean&#xD;
             of 76.38 ±8.77, bilaterally affected by neovascular AMD from the Medical Retina Unit&#xD;
             of the Department of Ophthalmology, University La Sapienza of Rome, Polo Pontino, A.&#xD;
             Fiorini Hospital from August 2009 to July 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of neovascular AMD was based on a complete ophthalmological examination including&#xD;
        anterior and posterior segment biomicroscopy, Fluorescein Angiography (Heidelberg HRA2 FA&#xD;
        module Heidelberg Germany), spectral domain OCT (Heidelberg HRA-2 OCT module Heidelberg&#xD;
        Germany), microperimetry with MP-1 (NIDEK Technologies Padua Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other eye diseases (i.e. glaucoma, myopia, retinal detachment, etc),&#xD;
             uncooperative patients and patients with media opacities were excluded.&#xD;
