    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety of islet transplantation when&#xD;
      performed after kidney transplantation, which may provide more normal control of blood sugar&#xD;
      without the need for insulin shots. Islets are special clusters of cells within the pancreas&#xD;
      that produce insulin. These cells will be obtained from cadaver (non-living) donors and given&#xD;
      to subjects by vein.&#xD;

             procedures of the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical history compatible with T1D with disease onset &lt; 40 years of age and&#xD;
             insulin-dependence for &gt; 5 years at the time of enrollment, and a sum of subject age&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Absent stimulated c-peptide (&lt; 0.3 ng/mL) in response to a MMTT [Boost® 6 mL/kg body&#xD;
             weight (BW) to a maximum of 360 mL; another product with equivalent caloric and&#xD;
             nutrient content may be substituted for Boost®] measured at 60 and 90 min after start&#xD;
             of consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are &gt; or at 3 months post-renal transplant who are taking appropriate&#xD;
             calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) based maintenance immunosuppression ([tacrolimus alone or&#xD;
             in conjunction with sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, myfortic, or azathioprine; or&#xD;
             cyclosporine in conjunction with sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, or myfortic] ±&#xD;
             Prednisone &lt; 10 mg/day)or subject will receive islets transplant within 72hours after&#xD;
             kidney transplantation (islets and kidney are from the same donor)&#xD;
&#xD;

             than the average creatinine determination performed in the 3 previous months prior to&#xD;
             islet transplantation, until rejection, obstruction or infection is ruled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             antibodies detected by Luminex Single Antigen/specificity bead assay including weakly&#xD;

             the renal donor (i.e. presumed de novo).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For female subjects: Positive pregnancy test, presently breast-feeding, desires to be&#xD;

             the study or within 4 months after discontinuation or unwillingness to use effective&#xD;
             measures of contraception. Oral contraceptives, Norplant®, Depo-Provera®, and barrier&#xD;
             devices with spermicide are acceptable contraceptive methods; condoms used alone are&#xD;
             not acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence or history of active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, or&#xD;
