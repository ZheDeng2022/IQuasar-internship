      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Over the 4 days prior to the randomization visit, the patient has a mean score greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 5 (of 10) for &quot;Average Pain Over the Past 24 Hours&quot; for the pain in&#xD;
             the affected leg as assessed by the 11-Point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS-11) captured&#xD;
             in the electronic diaries. The patient must have valid (non-missing) data for at least&#xD;
             3 out of the 4 days, and the mean score must be at least 5 without rounding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a current diagnosis of lumbosacral radicular pain. Pain must radiate&#xD;
             into the leg in a dermatomal/myotomal distribution consistent with the diagnosis of&#xD;
             lumbosacral radicular pain in the suspected involved nerve root. Based on history and&#xD;
             medical records (if available), the duration of the current episode of pain must be&#xD;
             between 6 and 52 weeks duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis must be confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (or existing computed&#xD;
             tomography [CT] or MRI related to the symptoms present at screening) performed within&#xD;
             6 months prior to screening and demonstrating disk herniation at a location consistent&#xD;
             with the clinical symptoms of radicular pain. Other incidental pathology is permitted&#xD;
             as long as it is asymptomatic and believed not causal of the primary diagnosis of&#xD;
             lumbosacral radicular pain at the specific spinal level as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have at least 1 of the following: a positive straight leg raise&#xD;
             (L5-S1), positive femoral stretch test (L3-L4), or other positive test result upon&#xD;
             physical examination that is consistent with the presence of nerve root irritation at&#xD;
             the nerve root suspected to be involved in the diagnosed lumbosacral radicular pain at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Herniation must affect L3-L4, L4-L5, or L5-S1 and must be consistent with clinical&#xD;
             presentation of the current episode of lumbosacral radicular pain as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant or progressive sensory impairment or motor impairment (such&#xD;
             as foot drop) must be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the investigator, and must&#xD;
             in each case receive written approval of the Sponsor prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There must be confirmation that the patient does not have an active tuberculosis&#xD;
             infection at screening. The patient should have either a negative QuantiFERON®-TB Gold&#xD;
             blood test or negative tuberculin skin test (TST) result at screening; however if&#xD;
             QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test or TST is positive, a chest radiogram may be used to&#xD;
             determine whether a patient has an active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is willing to keep all analgesic medication and other therapy usage (such&#xD;
             as physiotherapy, acupuncture, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [TENS])&#xD;
             stable or decreased during the study and use only the rescue pain medication as needed&#xD;
             and as specified by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is in good health (with the exception of the condition under study) as&#xD;
             determined by a medical and psychiatric history, medical examination, ECG, serum&#xD;
             chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and serology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (ie, not surgically sterile or 2 years&#xD;
             postmenopausal), must use a medically accepted method of contraception and must agree&#xD;
             to continue use of this method for the duration of the study and for 30 days after&#xD;
             participation in the study, and have a negative pregnancy test at screening.&#xD;
