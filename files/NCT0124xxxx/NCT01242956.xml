      The study hypothesizes superiority of the video-based training (observation combined with&#xD;
      motor exercise, &quot;video&quot;) over motor exercise alone (&quot;non-video&quot;) and standard rehabilitation&#xD;
      (&quot;standard&quot;).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The clinical study is a multicenter, open, randomized, controlled, paralleled group trial&#xD;
      with three investigative arms. The study recruits at least 375 first stroke patients with&#xD;
      certain motoric disabilities that are randomly assigned to either one experimental condition&#xD;
      or one of two control conditions. Every individual patient participates for 31 (+/- 1) weeks&#xD;
      in the trial (see fig. 1), the whole study is planned to last at least for 3 years. The&#xD;
      recruitment and treatment of patients will last for 17 months during the trial. Patients&#xD;
      undergo a baseline assessment for screening purposes and during the course of participation&#xD;
      three further assessments of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. These endpoints will&#xD;
      refer to the degree of recovered objective and subjective physical abilities due to the&#xD;
      experimental treatment in comparison to the control comparators. Studies' hypotheses claim&#xD;
      that the experimental treatment will lead to effects on the motoric abilities superior the&#xD;
      effects elicited by the control treatments.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hospitalized patient: discharge from rehabilitation within the following week;&#xD;
             outpatient: insult between 6 weeks and 2 years in the past (controlled via medical&#xD;
             history).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age between 30 and 80 years, since older patients could probably not exercise the&#xD;
             stamina necessary for a participation throughout the whole time course of the&#xD;
             treatment (controlled via discharge letter from hospitalized patients, and note from&#xD;
             the general practitioner from outpatients, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  First clinically evident stroke so that the patient has no history of stroke related&#xD;
             trainings and treatments (controlled via medical history).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ischemic cortical or subcortical lesions in middle cerebral artery territory resulting&#xD;
             mainly in defined motoric impairments (controlled via medical history).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Upper limb paresis (controlled via standard neurological examination).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minimal movement ability of the paretic limb (controlled by MRC index ≥2 and ≤4: hand&#xD;
             extension against gravity at wrist = 20° and at metacarpophalangeal and&#xD;
             interphalangeal joints of each of the fingers = 10°) to participate in the treatments'&#xD;
             physical training tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If medication is needed: stable concomitant medication (controlled via discharge&#xD;
             letter from hospitalized patients, and note from the general practitioner from&#xD;
             outpatients, respectively)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent to participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Brain stem infarction. These lesion site results in further impairments that could&#xD;
             interfere with treatment (controlled via discharge letter from hospitalized patients,&#xD;
             and note from the general practitioner from outpatients, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired level of consciousness that could prevent patient to understand and follow&#xD;
             instructions throughout the intervention, and further result in inabilities to hold&#xD;
             attentiveness and concentration to the treatment (controlled via standard neurological&#xD;
             examination).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe aphasia that could prevent patient to understand and follow instruction&#xD;
             throughout the intervention (controlled by administration of the Token test, TT, &gt; 11&#xD;
             incorrect reactions).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dementia that could lead to impaired abilities to follow instructions (controlled by&#xD;
             administration of the Mini-Mental-State Examination, MMSE, score &lt; 26).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Depression that could result in major difficulty of the patients motivational&#xD;
             compliance to follow instructions and to participate in the interventions' tasks&#xD;
             throughout the treatment (controlled by administration of the Beck Depression&#xD;
             Inventory, BDI, score &lt; 15).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Apraxia that could lead to impaired abilities to follow instructions (controlled by&#xD;
             administration of the Florida Apraxia Screening Test, FAST, &lt; 10 correct re-actions&#xD;
             and/ or &gt; 10 incorrect reactions).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neglect that could lead to impaired abilities to participate in the treatments&#xD;
             observational tasks (controlled by administration of the Albert's Neglect Test, &gt; 1&#xD;
             line unchecked).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe psychiatric disorder, severe pulmonary or cardiovascular disease, or epilepsy&#xD;
             that could lead to reduced abilities to participate in the treatments' task&#xD;
             (controlled via discharge letter from hospitalized patients, and note from the general&#xD;
             practitioner from outpatients, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe joint deformity of arthritic origin that could reduce the patients abilities in&#xD;
             tasks demanding a functional physical execution thus resulting in the masking of&#xD;
             possible training effects (controlled via standard neurological examination).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Motor problems not primarily unilateral or excessive pain in major affected limb that&#xD;
             could reduce the patients abilities in tasks demanding a functional physical execution&#xD;
             thus resulting in the masking of possible training effects (controlled via standard&#xD;
             neurological examination).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  People who are accommodated in an institution by court or administrative order&#xD;

             interfere with the assessment of the safety, tolerability and efficacy, e.g. current&#xD;
             bone fractures of the stroke affected limb. (controlled via discharge letter from&#xD;
             hospitalized patients, and note from the general practitioner from outpatients,&#xD;
