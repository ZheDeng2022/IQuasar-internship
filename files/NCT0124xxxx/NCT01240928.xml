             confound the study results, interfere with the patient's participation for the full&#xD;
             study duration, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the treating Investigator&#xD;

         15. Pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the study&#xD;

&#xD;
         17. Known history of Hepatitis B or C or active Hepatitis A&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Symptomatic ascites or pleural effusion. Patient who is clinically stable following&#xD;
             treatment for these conditions is eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
