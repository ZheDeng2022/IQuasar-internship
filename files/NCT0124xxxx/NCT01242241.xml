  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity in children,as in adults,has rapidly become a public health concern. Studies in&#xD;
      adults have shown that obesity, now considered to be a disease state, is a modifier of the&#xD;
      effect of drugs on the body as well as how the body handles the drug.The anesthetic&#xD;
      management of obese children poses a variety of significant challenges which include&#xD;
      determination of the appropriate dose of anesthetic intravenous agents. Dosing of most drugs&#xD;
      is calculated based on the effective dose in 50% of patients but the more practical and&#xD;
      required information is the effective dose in 95%(ED95%)of patients. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to determine the effective dose in 95% of patients(children). The hypothesis is the ED95 of&#xD;
      propofol in obese children will be higher than that of non-obese children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects were fasted in keeping with our institutional NPO guidelines and had IV access&#xD;
      established in the upper extremity in the pre-anesthesia area. No pre-induction sedative&#xD;
      drugs were administered. Routine ASA monitors were applied and in cooperative children, a&#xD;
      bispectral index (BIS) monitor pad (Aspect Medical Systems, Inc., Shattuck, MA) was applied&#xD;
      over the forehead. Each child was given a water-filled syringe to hold tightly in the hand&#xD;
      contralateral to the IV site. Lidocaine 1 mg/kg IV (maximum of 60 mg) was administered to&#xD;
      decrease pain with propofol injection. A predetermined sequential dose of propofol (Diprivan,&#xD;
      APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC, Schaumburg, IL) was administered IV rapidly over 10 seconds,&#xD;
      followed by a normal saline flush.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biased Coin Design An independent observer blinded to the propofol dose tested for lash&#xD;
      reflex at 20 seconds, and also recorded the vital signs; level of sedation, using the&#xD;
      University of Michigan sedation scale (UMSS)10; and the BIS values at 20, 60, and 120 seconds&#xD;
      after propofol administration, along with the time the patient dropped the handheld syringe.&#xD;
      The study was terminated after 120 seconds and additional propofol administered if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both nonobese and obese patients were studied in parallel using the biased coin design (BCD),&#xD;
      in which a certain number of dose levels (k levels) are chosen with a fixed constant&#xD;
      interval. In the absence of dose-ranging data in obese children, we chose a low starting dose&#xD;
      of 1.0 mg/kg for the first patient in both groups to avoid missing a desired response in this&#xD;
      patient population. If the desired effect (loss of lash reflex at 20 seconds) was not&#xD;
      observed, the next patient in the assigned group received the next higher dose of propofol in&#xD;
      predetermined increments (0.25 mg/kg) from the previous dose. If the desired effect was&#xD;
      observed, the next patient in the same assigned group was randomized with a 0.95 probability&#xD;
      to receive the same dose or a 0.05 probability to receive the next lower dose (also in 0.25&#xD;
      mg/kg decrements).&#xD;

    <measure>Dose of Propofol That Caused Loss of Consciousness in 95% (ED95) of Obese and Non-obese Children</measure>
    <time_frame>20 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>Propofol is administered over 10 seconds. 20 seconds after adminstration, loss of consciousness is assessed by the presence or absence of a lash reflex. The dose responsible for loss of lash reflex/consciousness in 95% of patients was determined in mg/kg.</description>

    <measure>Depth of Sedation</measure>
    <time_frame>30 seconds, 1 minute, and 2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>After propofol administration, the patient was assessed for depth of sedation at 30 seconds, 1 minute, and 2 minutes using the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS) and Ramsay Sedation Scale. UMSS assesses the level of alertness on a five-point scale ranging from 1 (wide awake) to 5 (unarousable with deep stimulation). Ramsay Sedation Scale assesses the level of sedation on a six-point scale ranging from 1 (Patient is anxious and agitated or restless, or both) to 6 (Patient exhibits no response).</description>

        <title>Dose of Propofol That Caused Loss of Consciousness in 95% (ED95) of Obese and Non-obese Children</title>
        <description>Propofol is administered over 10 seconds. 20 seconds after adminstration, loss of consciousness is assessed by the presence or absence of a lash reflex. The dose responsible for loss of lash reflex/consciousness in 95% of patients was determined in mg/kg.</description>
