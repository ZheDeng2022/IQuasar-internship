  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well radiation therapy works in treating&#xD;
      patients with stage 0-II breast cancer. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high&#xD;
      dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to&#xD;
      normal tissue.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the cosmesis, acute toxicity and late toxicity in patients treated with&#xD;
      accelerated partial breast irradiation delivered with proton radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the convenience of accelerated partial breast irradiation and quality of life&#xD;
      during accelerated partial breast irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the in-breast tumor control rates in patients treated with accelerated&#xD;
      partial breast irradiation delivered with proton radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare dosimetry to alternate treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 10 weeks of last breast cancer surgery, patients undergo accelerated partial breast&#xD;
      irradiation (APBI) delivered with proton radiation twice daily (BID) for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year,&#xD;
      and 18 months, then annually for 10 years.&#xD;

    <measure>Patient-Reported Cosmesis Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported cosmesis score on the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcomes Scale (BCTOS) at 1 year. Cosmesis scores range from 1 (excellent) to 4 (poor), and scores of 3 (fair) or more indicate adverse cosmetic outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of CTCAE Grade 3+ Confluent Moist Desquamation</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 6 weeks of radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of CTCAE grade 3+ confluent moist desquamation estimated within 6 weeks of radiation therapy with a 90% credible interval. If we observe CTCAE grade 3+ confluent moist desquamation in only 20 patients, then our 90% credible interval will be 7% to 13%.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Patients with Local Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of patients with local failure at 10 years estimated with an exact 95% confidence interval. If there is 1 patient with local failure at 10 years, and researchers have follow-up on all patients at 10 years, then the upper limit of the exact 95% confidence interval will be 2.8%. If researchers don't have 10 years of follow-up on all patients researchers will use the product-limit estimator of Kaplan and Meier (1958) to estimate the local failure rate at 10 years.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must consent to be in the study and must have signed an approved consent&#xD;
             form conforming with federal and institutional guidelines&#xD;

          -  The patient must have stage 0, I, or II breast cancer; if stage II, the tumor size&#xD;
             must be 3 cm or less&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On histological examination, the tumor must be ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or&#xD;
             invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast&#xD;

          -  Surgical treatment of the breast must have been lumpectomy; the margins of the&#xD;

             of surgical margins is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gross disease must be unifocal with pathologic (invasive and/or DCIS) tumor size 3 cm&#xD;
             or less; (patients with microscopic multifocality are eligible as long as total&#xD;
             pathologic tumor size is 3 cm or less)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with invasive breast cancer are required to have axillary staging which can&#xD;
             include sentinel node biopsy alone (if sentinel node is negative), sentinel node&#xD;
             biopsy followed by axillary dissection or sampling with a minimum total of 6 axillary&#xD;
             nodes (if sentinel node is positive), or axillary dissection alone (with a minimum of&#xD;
             6 axillary nodes); axillary staging is not required for patients with DCIS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The target lumpectomy cavity must be clearly delineated and the target lumpectomy&#xD;
