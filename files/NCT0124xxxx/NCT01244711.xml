      The hypothesis of this study is that symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia; and&#xD;
      indices of psychosocial function will all improve, while BZ use will decrease significantly&#xD;
      during a twelve-week trial period of substituting quetiapine for benzodiazepines.&#xD;

      1.1 Background Numerous patients having depression or anxiety appear to use benzodiazepines&#xD;
      chronically and respond incompletely to conventional antidepressants. These patients are more&#xD;
      likely to request or incur frequent changes of medication because of non-response, incomplete&#xD;
      response or intolerance. The hypothesis of this study is that symptoms of anxiety, depression&#xD;
      and insomnia; and indices of psychosocial function will all improve, while BZ use will&#xD;
      decrease significantly during a twelve-week trial period of substituting quetiapine for&#xD;
      benzodiazepines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Rationale for this study The scientific rationale for this derives from a combination of&#xD;
      clinical observation and a review of the literature. Anecdotal clinical experience with&#xD;
      numerous patients having depression or anxiety suggested to me that patients with chronic&#xD;
      benzodiazepine use were less likely to respond or remit with conventional antidepressants and&#xD;
      more likely to request or incur frequent changes of medication because of non-response,&#xD;
      incomplete response or intolerance. Although most of these patients were not drug abusers and&#xD;
      the doses they took were within ranges recommended in the package inserts for these drugs&#xD;
      (e.g., 5-20mg/ day of diazepam or equivalent), they were &quot;dependent&quot; in the sense that they&#xD;
      took the BZ daily or almost daily, would not give it up in spite of &quot;good responses&quot;&#xD;
      (although often with residual symptoms of anxiety or insomnia) to antidepressants or mood&#xD;
      stabilizers, and were determined to get their prescription refills on time and often upset if&#xD;
      they could not. I hypothesized that chronic benzodiazepine use created circadian or ultradian&#xD;
      cycles of sedation, which might be experienced as fatigue or amotivation, and withdrawal,&#xD;
      which might be experienced as anxiety or insomnia. Patients often tinkered with the doses and&#xD;
      timing of the doses in an attempt to smooth out these cycles. The current study will&#xD;
      determine whether symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia; and indices of psychosocial&#xD;
      function improve, while BZ use decreases during a twelve-week trial period of substituting&#xD;
      quetiapine for benzodiazepines. This would be a proof of concept study in a unique&#xD;
      subpopulation with MDD or GAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary objective For MDD:The primary efficacy measures will be&#xD;
      change from baseline to endpoint in the MADRAS and the change in mean daily benzodiazepine&#xD;
      dose in diazepam equivalents during the past week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For GAD: The primary efficacy measures will be change from baseline to endpoint in the HAM-A&#xD;
      and the change in mean daily benzodiazepine dose in diazepam equivalents during the past&#xD;
      week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Secondary objectives Secondary efficacy measures will include response and remission&#xD;
      rates and self-rated scales of symptoms and psychosocial function (the IDS-SR for depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, the SAS-SR for social/vocational function and the Q-LES-Q for quality of life).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. STUDY PLAN AND PROCEDURES 3.1 Overall study design and study plan Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed to assure a stable regimen of antidepressant medications and BZ for at least 8&#xD;
      weeks. Patients will then be treated with flexible doses of quetiapine-ER up to 300mg/day for&#xD;
      8 weeks. Dosing will begin with Seroquel 50 mg. at bedtime and will escalate weekly to&#xD;
      Seroquel 100mg., Seroquel-XR 200mg. and Seroquel-XR 300 mg depending on clinical response and&#xD;
      side effects. BZ doses will be gradually tapered at the equivalent of 5mg/day/week of&#xD;
      diazepam equivalents where possible. This is not a forced titration schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Rationale for study design, doses and control groups The design is an open-label, proof&#xD;
      of concept study. The dosing is based on my prior clinical experience with this patient&#xD;
      population. There are no control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Treatments 3.4.1 Identity of investigational product and comparators Seroquel-XR 50 mg.,&#xD;
      Seroquel-XR100mg., Seroquel-XR 200mg. and Seroquel-XR 300 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4.2 Doses and treatment regimens Dosing will begin with Seroquel-XR 50 mg. at bedtime and&#xD;
      will escalate weekly to Seroquel-XR 100mg., Seroquel-XR 200mg. and Seroquel-XR 300 mg&#xD;
      depending on clinical response and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Pre-study, concomitant and post-study treatment(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prohibited medication during the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potent cytochrome P450 inhibitors (including but not limited to ketoconazole,&#xD;
           itraconazole, fluconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, troleandomycin, indinavir,&#xD;
           nelfinavir, ritonavir, fluvoxamine and saquinavir)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  potent cytochrome P450 inducers (including but not limited to phenytoin, carbamazepine,&#xD;
           barbiturates, rifampin, St. John's Wort, and glucocorticoids)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any psychotropic besides quetiapine, antidepressant or benzodiazepine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other medication, which is considered necessary for the subject's safety and well-being, may&#xD;
      be given at the discretion of the investigator(s). The administration of all medication&#xD;
      (including investigational products) must be recorded in the appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. OUTCOME AND VARIABLES 4.1 Primary Variable For MDD: The primary efficacy measures will be&#xD;
      change from baseline to endpoint in the MADRAS and the change in mean daily benzodiazepine&#xD;
      dose in diazepam equivalents during the past week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For GAD: The primary efficacy measures will be change from baseline to endpoint in the HAM-A&#xD;
      and the change in mean daily benzodiazepine dose in diazepam equivalents during the past&#xD;
      week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Secondary Variables Secondary efficacy measures will include response and remission rates&#xD;
      and self-rated scales of symptoms and psychosocial function (the IDS-SR for depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, the SAS-SR for social/vocational function and the Q-LES-Q for quality of life).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Efficacy Variable(s) For MDD: The primary efficacy measures will be change from baseline&#xD;
      to endpoint in the MADRAS and the change in mean daily benzodiazepine dose in diazepam&#xD;
      equivalents during the past week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For GAD: The primary efficacy measures will be change from baseline to endpoint in the HAM-A&#xD;
      and the change in mean daily benzodiazepine dose in diazepam equivalents during the past&#xD;
      week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An overdose is not regarded as an AE. All symptoms associated with the overdose should&#xD;
      however be reported as AEs. For further information regarding overdose, see section 11.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an&#xD;
      investigational product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive&#xD;
      medication. For further details regarding pregnancy, see section 11.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.1.3 Reporting of serious adverse events Investigators and other site personnel must&#xD;
      inform the FDA, via a Medwatch form, of any unexpected and possibly Study Drug-related&#xD;
      serious adverse events (SAEs) according to the FDA reporting requirement timelines. The&#xD;
      Investigator must also inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives of any SAE that occurs&#xD;
      in the course of the study within one day (ie, immediately but no later than the end of the&#xD;
      next business day) of when he or she becomes aware of it. The investigator must also report&#xD;
      follow-up information on SAEs within one day. A copy of the MedWatch report must be faxed to&#xD;
      AstraZeneca at the time the event is reported to the FDA. Reporting to the FDA is recommended&#xD;
      regardless of whether an IND is required for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the Investigator shall provide AstraZeneca with a report of all other SAEs that&#xD;
      did not qualify for expedited reporting to the FDA (e.g., considered to be expected and/or&#xD;
      not related) on at least a quarterly basis in order for AstraZeneca to meet its regulatory&#xD;
      reporting obligations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the Study is blinded, the Institution shall provide AstraZeneca with the code break&#xD;
      information with the initial SAE report or a copy of the randomization schedule at the start&#xD;
      of the Study, so that AstraZeneca may un-blind SAE reports to the extent necessary to meet&#xD;
      global regulatory reporting requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete written SAE report must be sent with a cover page indicating the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Name (Seroquel); this is an Investigator Sponsored Study (ISS) Research (Protocol) and&#xD;
      AstraZeneca Tracking Number [IRUSQUET0483] Principal Investigator's IND number assigned by&#xD;
      the FDA (if applicable) Principal Investigator's full name and address Unblinding information&#xD;
      (if applicable) Send by way of fax to Seroquel ISS Safety Representative (302) 885-3043&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a non-serious AE becomes serious, this and other relevant follow-up information must also&#xD;
      be provided to AstraZeneca and the FDA within 1 day as described above. All SAEs have to be&#xD;
      reported to AstraZeneca, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational&#xD;
      product. All SAEs will be documented. The investigator is responsible for informing the IRB&#xD;
      and/or the Regulatory Authority of the SAE as per local requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.2 Other safety measurements and variables Safety assessments will include vital signs at&#xD;
      each visit and hematology, chemistries, pregnancy testing and urine drug screening prior to&#xD;
      and at the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5 Volume of blood sampling and handling of biological samples The total volume of blood&#xD;
      that will be drawn from each subject in this study is as follows: 30 cc 5. DATA MANAGEMENT We&#xD;
      will develop standardized paper forms for collecting all data needed on study subjects&#xD;
      including eligibility, demographic and other baseline data, sequential clinical assessments,&#xD;
      dosing information, side effects, and outcome measures. all data required to explore the&#xD;
      study hypotheses will be collected and entered into a database in the appropriate format for&#xD;
      data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 6.1 Description of analysis&#xD;
      populations All analyses will be conducted on the intention-to-treat population. 6.2 Method&#xD;
      of statistical analysis The Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be applied to the mean scores&#xD;
      available at weeks 0 vs. endpoint for the primary outcome measures: MADRS, HAM-A &amp; daily BZ&#xD;
      dose, and for the secondary outcome measures IDS-SR, SAS-SR and Q-LES-Q respectively to test&#xD;
      the questions of whether there is a difference from pre- to post-quetiapine treatment.&#xD;
      Separate tests will be conducted for the two diagnostic groups (MDD and GAD), but there is no&#xD;
      intent to compare the two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportions of a priori-defined responders and remitters during the study will be&#xD;
      reported in descriptive statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Determination of sample size NA The N of 20 per group is dictated by budget and&#xD;
      feasibility considerations. This is a pilot study with no control or comparison groups. Under&#xD;
      a 2-tailed α value of .05, we will have the power to detect a large effect size.&#xD;
