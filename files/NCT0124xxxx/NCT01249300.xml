      Introduction Patients with stroke may be silent aspirators or at risk for laryngeal&#xD;
      penetration or aspiration because of abnormal oropharyngeal functioning and thus are at risk&#xD;
      for aspiration pneumonia and its serious effects. By providing identification of the&#xD;
      components of the abnormal swallow, and comparing swallowing across tasks, the investigators&#xD;
      may avoid aspiration and can instruct patients on preventative or compensatory swallowing&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Oral examination-A neurologist and speech pathologist examine the patient's swallowing&#xD;
           function. The patient is interviewed about difficulties with food intake, chewing and&#xD;
           swallowing during meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ultrasound examination-Ultrasound creates image of areas inside the body using sound&#xD;
           waves. With the patient in a sitting position, a 3/4-inch transducer (device for&#xD;
           transmitting and receiving sound waves) is placed under the chin to visualize epiglottis&#xD;
           movements during swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Modified barium swallow-While standing or sitting, the patient swallows 1/2 teaspoon of&#xD;
           flavored barium (a radioactive substance) six times (a total of 3 teaspoons), while the&#xD;
           tongue and pharynx (tube leading from the mouth to the esophagus) are scanned and&#xD;
           videotaped at the same time epiglottis movement will be trace with ultrasound. The&#xD;
           barium is given in three consistencies-thin, medium and thick (pudding-like).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will study the oral, pharyngeal and upper esophageal phases of swallow&#xD;
      using videofluoroscopy and correlate with ultrasound tracing of epiglottis movement in&#xD;
      patients with stroke conditions. Most of the previous studies of swallowing have utilized&#xD;
      diagnostic imaging technique to provide a complete swallowing assessment, but limited&#xD;
      capabilities for screening large population of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA: The Stroke Center inpatients and outpatients with known or suspected&#xD;
      dysphagia can be included for study as well as patients who are admitted specifically for&#xD;
      this protocol. (Difficulty swallowing food or pills,changed swallowing ability,coughing or&#xD;
      choking when eating, shortness of breath during swallowing, food backing up into the mouth or&#xD;
      nasal passage, fever or voice changes after swallowing, pain when swallowing, unexplained&#xD;
      loss of weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients who are severely demented or severely compromised will be&#xD;
      excluded if they do not have sufficient cognitive ability to follow directions.&#xD;
      Non-ambulatory patients will be excluded if they cannot be braced or supported within the&#xD;
      fluoroscopy unit. Highly agitated individuals will also be excluded if they are unable to&#xD;
      remain confined in the equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic Methods The Student t test will be used to analyze the difference in epiglottis&#xD;
      movements during swallowing amongst different phases. Levene's test for equality of variances&#xD;
      will be applied to examine the variability of epiglottis movements during swallowing between&#xD;
      the groups. All statistical analysis will be performed with SPSS.&#xD;
