      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Previous studies have suggested that smoking cigarettes affects the number of receptors in&#xD;
      the brain for nicotine, a chemical present in cigarette smoke. The receptors play a role in&#xD;
      an individual's ability to think and concentrate. Many people with schizophrenia and similar&#xD;
      disorders smoke, and research suggests that smoking may temporarily improve concentration and&#xD;
      focus in individuals with schizophrenia. Researchers are interested in studying both current&#xD;
      smokers and nonsmokers with schizophrenia to determine whether smoking affects the number of&#xD;
      nicotine receptors in the brains of people with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the distribution and volume of nicotine receptors in the brains of individuals&#xD;
      with schizophrenia who are either nonsmokers or current smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia&#xD;
           and are either nonsmokers or current smokers (at least 10 cigarettes per day for the&#xD;
           past year).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current smokers must be able to give up smoking for 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves an initial screening visit and up to five study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the screening visit, participants will have two sessions in which they will&#xD;
           complete questionnaires about thoughts, memory, and smoking habits. Smokers will also&#xD;
           have nicotine blood and carbon monoxide breath levels taken during these sessions,&#xD;
           before and after smoking a cigarette.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have sessions with imaging studies (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging)&#xD;
           to provide baseline measurements for later tests, and will also have tests to measure&#xD;
           brain electrical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a positron emission tomography (PET) scanning session to examine&#xD;
           the nicotine receptors in the brain. Participants will need to stay overnight&#xD;
           (nonsmokers) or for 2 nights (smokers) as an inpatient before the session. The PET scan&#xD;
           session will take up to 6 hours, although participants will only be in the scanner for&#xD;
           up to 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a follow-up phone call with study researchers 1 week after the&#xD;
           PET scanning session.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the distribution and volume of distribution (Vt)&#xD;
      in vivo of Beta2* acetylcholine receptors (Beta2* nAChR) in schizophrenic smokers and&#xD;
      nonsmokers and compare this to published data from normal healthy subjects who are smokers&#xD;
      and nonsmokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be volunteers with a diagnosis of schizophrenia aged 18 to 50 years. The&#xD;
      proposed sample size is 10 per group: nonsmokers or ex-smokers and smokers for a total of 20&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One PET study lasting up to 8 hours after combination of bolus and continuous infusion&#xD;
      administration of 2[(18)F] FA-85380. Smokers will be abstinent for at least 48 hrs. Subjects&#xD;
      will also undergo a structural MRI scan for purposes of registration of PET scan data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from 20 schizophrenic patients (10 smokers and 10 nonsmokers) will be compared to&#xD;
      published data from healthy controls. Total volume of distribution (VT) which is a measure of&#xD;
      receptor density and distribution of Beta2 nAChR* will be determined in Schizophrenic smokers&#xD;
      and nonsmokers and differences in these values will be compared to published values for the&#xD;
      differences in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor density in healthy smokers and nonsmokers&#xD;
      (Mukhin et al., 2008) Also, receptor distribution and VT will be correlated with levels of&#xD;
      smoking and symptom profiles in the schizophrenic patients studied.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age: Subjects will be male and female volunteers aged 18 to 50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contact: All subjects must have a stable point of contact and must agree to participate in&#xD;
        one PET study and one MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Smoking group: must smoke at least 10 cigarettes per day for at least the last year. They&#xD;
        should have experience with abstaining from smoking for at least 48 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Nonsmoking group: Subjects in the non-smoking group must be nonsmokers or have smoked less&#xD;
        than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and have ceased smoking at least two years before the&#xD;
        start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis: Each volunteer will have a diagnosis of schizophrenia using DSMIV criteria. Each&#xD;
        subject will have the following information available for diagnostic consideration:&#xD;
        Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I), a general psychiatric&#xD;
        interview for past illness characteristics and family history, information from 2-3 months&#xD;
        of independent clinician observation including current detailed mental status evaluations&#xD;
        using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Schedule for the Assessment of Positive&#xD;
        and Negative Symptoms (SAPS/SANS), and Schedule for Deficit Syndrome (SDS). An assessment&#xD;
        of impulsivity will also be done (Patton, 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Comorbidity: No subject with a current axis I diagnosis other than schizophrenia will be&#xD;
        allowed. No subject with known claustrophobia will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medications: Study participants will continue to take their antipsychotic medications that&#xD;
        they have been taking for at least 3 months prior to the study. Haldol, risperidone and&#xD;
        olanzapine will be allowed because of their lack of significant effect on the density of&#xD;
        beta2* nACh receptors after prolonged administration to rats (Haldol; Breese et al., 2000;&#xD;
        risperidone and olanzapine; personal communication, Mukhin, also SFN abstract).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Weight: Anyone weighing more than 300 lbs is excluded from the study. The purpose of this&#xD;
        exclusion is the weight limit of the PET scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of Drug Abuse: Participants reporting current or having a significant history of&#xD;
        illicit drug abuse will be excluded from the study. Subjects may use moderate amounts of&#xD;
        alcohol and caffeine and smoke an occasional marijuana cigarette, but must not be dependent&#xD;
        on alcohol, caffeine or marijuana. No alcohol or marijuana for at least 72 hours prior to&#xD;
        scanning. No smoking for 48 hrs before the PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current Medication Use: Participants will continue to use their prescription medications.&#xD;
        The following hypertension medications will be exclusionary: Indapamide, spironolactone,&#xD;
        clonidine, guanfacine, methyldopa, propranolol. Over the counter medications are not&#xD;
        exclusionary, however, subjects will not be allowed to use over the counter medications in&#xD;
        the week prior to their PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CNS disease: History of known structural brain abnormalities (e.g., neoplasm, subarachnoid&#xD;
        cysts), cerebrovascular disease, infectious disease (e.g., abscess), history of head trauma&#xD;
        (defined as documented loss of consciousness for 5 min or greater), history of seizures as&#xD;
        an adult, sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cardiovascular, pulmonary, or systemic disease: Untreated hypertension known arrhythmia,&#xD;
        symptomatic or known coronary artery disease; history of endocarditis, cerebral embolism,&#xD;
        obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, active tuberculosis, known endocrine disease&#xD;
        (derangements in adrenal, thyroid, bone or reproductive function) known chronic renal or&#xD;
        hepatic dysfunction, known HIV seropositive, known current autoimmune disease involving the&#xD;
        CNS, type I diabetes mellitus. Subjects with type II diabetes mellitus will be allowed if&#xD;
        their Hb A1C is less than 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Special considerations for female subjects. Female participants who are planning to become&#xD;
        pregnant, currently pregnant or nursing will not be allowed to participate in this study&#xD;
        because of potential damage to the fetus or baby from the radiation. In addition, women of&#xD;
        child bearing age who are sexually active are required to use an effective form of birth&#xD;
        control for the duration of the study. Effective forms of birth control include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, injectable hormones, vaginal ring&#xD;
             hormones),&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. surgical sterility (tubal ligation or hysterectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. IUD&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Diaphragm with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Condom with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female subjects will be given a serum pregnancy test (quantitative beta HCG) within 24&#xD;
        hours of the PET study. Menstrual cycle phase or sex has not been shown to affect receptor&#xD;
        availability (Cosgrove et al., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Radiation exposure: Any subject who has participated in any research studies in which&#xD;
        he/she received a radiation exposure that would result in combination with the present&#xD;
        study, in a total effective radiation exposure (from research studies) exceeding 5.0 rem in&#xD;
        a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children under the age of 18 will be excluded to avoid unnecessary exposure to radiation to&#xD;
        these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Presence in body of metallic implants or materials that could be moved by the magnet of the&#xD;
        MRI scanner: pacemakers, surgical implants, aneurysm clips, dental braces, bullet(s) or&#xD;
        other metallic materials.&#xD;
