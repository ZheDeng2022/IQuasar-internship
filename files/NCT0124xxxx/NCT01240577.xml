      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The experimental drug IPdR is broken down in the body to IdUrd, which has been given to&#xD;
      patients to find out if it can improve radiation therapy. IdUrd has to be given through a&#xD;
      vein; therefore this new drug (IPdR) has been made which can be taken by mouth. Researchers&#xD;
      are interested in determining whether IPdR should also be studied to find out if it can&#xD;
      improve radiation therapy. The current study is to find out if people absorb the drug given&#xD;
      by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the levels of drug and its breakdown products in the blood following a single&#xD;
      dose of IPdR by mouth. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with cancer (solid tumors or&#xD;
      lymphomas) that have not responded to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves an initial dosing visit, one day of admission to the hospital for&#xD;
           blood work, and a follow-up visit 14 days later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, as well&#xD;
           as blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive a single dose of IPdR, and will provide multiple blood and&#xD;
           urine samples for 24 hours after administration of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fourteen days after receiving IPdR, participants will have another physical examination&#xD;
           and additional blood and urine tests to evaluate how IPdR has been broken down by the&#xD;
           body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer treatment will not be provided as part of this protocol.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The nucleoside analog iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd, NSC 39661) has shown promising activity&#xD;
           as a radiosensitizer in preclinical models and has been evaluated in Phase I/II clinical&#xD;
           trials. The extent of radiosensitization is directly related to the incorporation of&#xD;
           IdUrd into tumor DNA as a replacement for thymidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IPdR (NSC 726188) is an orally administered prodrug of IdUrd with a better therapeutic&#xD;
           index in preclinical models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This first in human study of IPdR will evaluate whether IPdR is absorbed and what plasma&#xD;
           levels of IPdR and its major metabolite, IdUrd, are achieved after a single oral dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure plasma concentrations of IPdR, IdUrd, and IdUrd metabolites after a single oral&#xD;
           dose of IPdR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety of administering a single oral dose of IPdR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age and have histologically confirmed&#xD;
      solid tumors or lymphoid malignancies refractory to at least one line of standard treatment&#xD;
      or for which no standard therapy is available. Patients should have adequate organ function&#xD;
      and no disease-associated symptoms requiring immediate therapy or intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive a single oral dose of IPdR on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The initial IPdR dose will be 150 mg; dose escalation will be in 100% increments to a&#xD;
           maximum of 2400 mg. One patient will be accrued to each dose level until we reach the&#xD;
           highest dose level. Six patients will be accrued at dose level 5 (2400 mg).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically documented (confirmed at the Laboratory of&#xD;
             Pathology, NCI) solid tumors or lymphoid malignancies that are refractory to at least&#xD;
             one line of standard treatment or for which no standard therapy is available. Patients&#xD;
             with lymphoid malignancies may be enrolled if they have disease for which standard&#xD;
             therapy is currently not indicated. Patients should not have disease-associated&#xD;
             symptoms requiring immediate therapy or intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy must have been completed greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 2 weeks prior to enrollment (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C), and&#xD;
             the patient must have recovered to eligibility levels from prior toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Patients under 18 years of age are excluded&#xD;
             because of their inability as a protected population to give appropriate consent to&#xD;
             this non-therapeutic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to&#xD;
             60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/microL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/microL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin less than 1.5 times institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 3.0 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine less than 1.5 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR:&#xD;
&#xD;
        --creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min for patients with creatinine&#xD;
        levels greater than or equal to 1.5 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  IPdR is a nucleoside analog and therefore potentially teratogenic. Women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for 30 days&#xD;
             after study drug administration. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for&#xD;
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to IPdR administration to the mother,&#xD;
             nursing mothers should not receive IPdR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing uncontrolled&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, GI conditions limiting absorption, serious skin conditions, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
