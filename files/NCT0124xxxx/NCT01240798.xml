    <textblock>
      People report feeling sad and low (depression) or worried (anxiety) appear more likely to&#xD;
      subsequently suffer a heart attack, or angina. However it is not known whether depression or&#xD;
      anxiety actually causes heart disease. If these mental health problems and heart disease were&#xD;
      cause and effect this has important implications for world health. Previous research on this&#xD;
      topic has had several limitations. First, most studies have studied heart disease as if it&#xD;
      were one thing. There is a need for studies which distinguish different types of heart&#xD;
      disease (e.g. different types of heart attack, angina) which may be linked to mental health&#xD;
      problems in different ways. Second, it is not clear whether symptoms of heart disease come&#xD;
      before the depression or anxiety or the other way round? Much of the available research&#xD;
      cannot look at this in detail because they rely on data from occasional snapshots of study&#xD;
      populations rather than a continuous record. The investigators propose to use the linkage of&#xD;
      the national registry of coronary events to general practice records in the GPRD, which will&#xD;
      allow us to address these limitations. The investigators research will help us understand&#xD;
      better whether mental health problems cause the onset of different types of coronary disease.&#xD;

      This study is part of the CALIBER (Cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke&#xD;
      studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the NIHR and Wellcome&#xD;
      Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia&#xD;
      National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (GPRD) and other resources. The overarching&#xD;
      aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary&#xD;
      phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a&#xD;
      contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref&#xD;
      09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      To elucidate the role of depression and anxiety in the aetiology and prognosis of specific&#xD;
      acute and chronic coronary disease phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary disease and depression are major causes of mortality and morbidity globally and so&#xD;
      the public health impact of a causal association between the two is profound1. But our&#xD;
      meta-analysis of 22 aetiologic cohort studies (4016 events) the presence of depression was&#xD;
      associated with a 70% increased risk of CHD events. This systematic review, and others,&#xD;
      identified several limitations of existing research, including a) clinical phenotype&#xD;
      resolution: broad aggregates of CHD, rather than specific coronary phenotypes, b) small size,&#xD;
      with insufficient event numbers to compare risks in women and men, c) temporal resolution:&#xD;
      Single time point of exposure to depression (usually prevalent); unclear temporal relation&#xD;
      between the onset of symptoms of depression and the onset of symptoms associated with&#xD;
      coronary disease and lack of studies assessing whether exposure to depression prior to the&#xD;
      onset of any symptomatic coronary disease influences the prognosis (future progression) of&#xD;
      coronary disease once established, d) incomplete and inconsistent assessment of potential&#xD;
      confounders or mediators: unclear role of social deprivation, smoking, alcohol and other&#xD;
      behaviours which may confound the association; unclear role of detection, treatment and&#xD;
      control of cardiovascular risk among patients with depression and lack of consideration of&#xD;
      co-existing psychiatric morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational study, using cohort and case series analyses in initially healthy populations,&#xD;
      and among patients with specific manifestations of coronary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have ample statistical power for our main hypotheses. For example we will estimate a&#xD;
      relative risk for the effect of depression (vs not) on STEMI, and compare this with the&#xD;
      relative risk for the effect of depression vs not on non-STEMI. Assuming depression exposure&#xD;
      prevalence of 10%, 500 linked cases of each type and alpha of 0.01, we will be able to&#xD;
      distinguish a relative risk of, say 1.7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Our overall analytic approach involves the distinction between different&#xD;
      coronary disease phenotypes which form the endpoints of aetiologic, and the start-points of&#xD;
      prognostic, analyses and between different temporal patterns of evolution of risk.&#xD;
      Furthermore we will consider the separate, and joint, effects of depression and anxiety,&#xD;
      distinguishing between a solitary measure and the cumulative impact of serial measures, on&#xD;
      the specific coronary disease phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A structured Statistical Analytic Protocol detailing how we will analyse the data and to what&#xD;
      extent analytic choices are pre-specified, can be made available on request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected value of results&#xD;
&#xD;
      This provides an opportunity to investigate large scale the association of depression with&#xD;
      specific coronary syndromes comes from the linkage of GPRD to MINAP.&#xD;

        The study population will include all adults (18+) in GPRD registered in up-to-standard&#xD;
        practices with at least 1 year of up to standard follow up. Analyses will focus on the ~200&#xD;
        practices which have consented to linkage with HES and MINAP. Essentially we will define an&#xD;
        aetiological cohort - whole population - free of any coronary syndrome at start of follow&#xD;
        up. Patients within this cohort are followed for the aetiologic endpoint of a first&#xD;
        specific coronary syndrome (see below). This aetiologic endpoint is the prognostic&#xD;
        start-point; such patients will then be followed for subsequent specific coronary syndromes&#xD;
        and death. We will focus analyses on patients with at least a year follow up data before&#xD;
        and their endpoint. As in a conventional cohort study we will define according to exposure&#xD;
        history.&#xD;
