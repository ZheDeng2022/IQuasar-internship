      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A brain circuit called the default network is the brain circuit that is active when the&#xD;
      brain is at rest; that is, when individuals are not concentrating on specific tasks. Previous&#xD;
      research has shown that the default network functions differently in people with&#xD;
      schizophrenia and Alzheimer s disease, and may contribute to the problems with memory and&#xD;
      concentration that can affect people who have these conditions. Studies have also shown that&#xD;
      nicotine affects the default network, but more research is needed on the ways in which&#xD;
      nicotinic receptors may change activity in these regions and thereby affect individuals&#xD;
      ability to concentrate on specific tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine whether and how nicotine and mecamylamine, a drug that blocks nicotinic&#xD;
      receptors, affect the default network in nonsmokers in ways that improve thinking and&#xD;
      concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy, right-handed volunteers between 21 and 50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteers must not have used any kind of tobacco product in the past 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves an initial screening visit, a training visit, and three testing&#xD;
           visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, as well&#xD;
           as blood and urine samples and questions about smoking history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an initial training session to practice the tasks that will be&#xD;
           done during magnetic resonance imaging scans at the testing visits. These tasks will&#xD;
           test participants concentration and memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have three test sessions with the following combinations of study&#xD;
           drugs: (1) a nicotine patch and a placebo capsule, (2) a placebo patch and a capsule of&#xD;
           mecamylamine, or (3) a placebo patch and capsule. Different combinations will be given&#xD;
           at each visit, and participants will not know which one they receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will perform the same concentration and memory tasks at each testing visit,&#xD;
           and will provide a blood sample after each visit to determine levels of nicotine and&#xD;
           mecamylamine.&#xD;

      Objective: To evaluate the potential of manipulating activity in the so-called default&#xD;
      network of resting brain function by nicotinic ligands. Default network activity modulates&#xD;
      cognitive functioning, and effects of nicotine thereon may motivate smoking behavior. In the&#xD;
      future, this mechanism could become a novel approach to improving cognition in disease&#xD;
      populations that show dysfunction of this network, such as schizophrenia or Alzheimer s&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 27 healthy non-smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject fMRI study, evaluating regional&#xD;
      brain activation and cognitive functions under conditions of transdermal nicotine (7 mg/day),&#xD;
      oral mecamylamine (a nicotinic antagonist, 7.5 mg), and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Activity and functional connectivity of default regions during cognitive&#xD;
      task performance, measures of cognitive task performance, measures of subjective state, and&#xD;
      plasma concentrations of nicotine, nicotine metabolites and mecamylamine.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Age 21 through 55. We want to avoid exposing a maturing brain to centrally active&#xD;
                  substances that it has not previously been exposed to (non-smokers), and to&#xD;
                  increase sensitivity for measuring drug effects by minimizing population&#xD;
                  inhomogeneity related to both cognitive decline with normal aging (Verhaeghen and&#xD;
                  Salthouse 1997, De Luca et al. 2003) and to ongoing brain maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Did not consume cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars, or other tobacco or&#xD;
                  nicotine-containing products more than 20 times in lifetime, and did not use any&#xD;
                  nicotine-containing product at all within the last two years.&#xD;

             Mecamylamine-related risks).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Left-handed or ambidextrous.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Pregnant as determined by urine test, or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. History or current diagnosis of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
