      The study aims to investigate the role of candidate biomarkers in the prognosis of Essential&#xD;
      Hypertension. In the prognosis part of the study, patients with confirmed hypertension are&#xD;
      enrolled. The outcome is unstable angina, coronary revascularization, acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, ischemic cerebral infarction, hemorrhagic&#xD;
      cerebral infarction, transient ischemic attack, doubling of serum creatinine or end-stage&#xD;
      renal disease (defi ned as eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1·73 m² or need for chronic dialysis) and&#xD;
      all-cause mortality.&#xD;
