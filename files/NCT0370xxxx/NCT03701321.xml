      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of venetoclax when given&#xD;
      together with daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone, and how well they work in treating&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as venetoclax and dexamethasone, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as daratumumab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bortezomib may stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving venetoclax with&#xD;
      daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone may work better in treating patients with relapsed&#xD;
      or refractory multiple myeloma compared to standard of care treatment, including&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicities and the recommended phase II dose of venetoclax&#xD;
      in combination with daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone for patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the safety of venetoclax&#xD;
      (VEN) in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd). (Phase I) III. To compare&#xD;
      efficacy of DVd-VEN versus DVd as measured by minimal residual disease negative rate after 8&#xD;
      cycles of therapy. (Phase II) IV. To inform the role of t(11;14) as a biomarker in a&#xD;
      subsequent evaluation of the regimen. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare rates of very good partial response between arms. II. To assess improvement in&#xD;
      progression-free and overall survival with the addition of VEN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the safety of VEN in combination with DVd and compare overall toxicity rates&#xD;
      between arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess association of cycle 8 minimal residual disease (MRD) status with overall and&#xD;
      progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To estimate the impact of t(11;14) status on very good partial response, overall and&#xD;
      progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure treatment exposure and adherence. II. To estimate time to progression with the&#xD;
      addition of VEN. III. To measure MRD levels longitudinally and assess the kinetics of&#xD;
      relapse. IV. To assess association of MRD status after 8 cycles with survival outcomes. V. To&#xD;
      evaluate agreement and discordance between methods determining disease-free status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of venetoclax followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I:&#xD;

      1 of subsequent cycles, bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-8,&#xD;
      dexamethasone orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-8, and venetoclax PO once daily&#xD;
      (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM D: Patients receive venetoclax PO QD on days 1-21, daratumumab IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of&#xD;
      cycles 1-3 and on day 1 of subsequent cycles, bortezomib SC on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles&#xD;
      1-8, and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-8. Cycles repeat every 21 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM E: Patients receive daratumumab IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-3 and on day 1 of&#xD;
      subsequent cycles, bortezomib SC on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-8, and dexamethasone PO on&#xD;
      days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-8. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 10 years.&#xD;

             risk of fetal harm by the chemotherapeutic agents prescribed in this protocol. All&#xD;
             females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 7 days&#xD;
             prior to registration to rule out pregnancy. A female of childbearing potential is any&#xD;
             woman, regardless of sexual orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation,&#xD;
             who meets the following criteria: 1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not&#xD;
             undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 3) has not been naturally&#xD;
             postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing&#xD;
             potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the&#xD;
             preceding 24 consecutive months).&#xD;

             males must use an accepted and highly effective method(s) of contraception or abstain&#xD;
             from sexual intercourse for the duration of their participation in the study and for 3&#xD;
             months after the last dose of daratumumab or 30 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             venetoclax, whichever is longer. Male patients must also agree not to donate sperm for&#xD;
             the duration of their participation in the study for 3 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             daratumumab or 30 days after the last dose of venetoclax whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE I (ARMS A, B, C) - STEP 1: Patients must not have &gt; grade 2 neuropathy and/or a&#xD;
             syndrome characterized by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  PHASE I (ARMS A, B, C) - STEP 1: Patients must not be seropositive for hepatitis B&#xD;
             (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]). Patients with&#xD;
             resolved infection (i.e., patients who are HBsAg negative but positive for antibodies&#xD;
             to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antigen [anti-HBs]) must be screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#xD;
             measurement of hepatitis B virus (HepB) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels. Those who&#xD;
             are PCR positive are not eligible. Patients with serologic findings suggestive of HepB&#xD;
             vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of&#xD;
             prior HepB vaccination, do not need to be tested for HepB DNA by PCR. Patients with&#xD;
             HepB core antibody (cAb) positive but HepB sAg negative, as well as HepB PCR negative,&#xD;
             are eligible but will need to be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE I (ARMS A, B, C) - STEP 1: Patients must not be seropositive for hepatitis C&#xD;
             (except in the setting of a sustained virologic response [SVR], defined as aviremia at&#xD;
             least 12 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE II (ARMS D, E) - STEP 1: ECOG performance status of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE II (ARMS D, E) - STEP 1: Patients must have been diagnosed with symptomatic&#xD;
             relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Relapsed/refractory myeloma is defined as a disease which becomes&#xD;
                  non-responsive or progressive on therapy or within 60 days of the last treatment&#xD;
                  in patients who had achieved a minimal response (MR) or better on prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE II (ARMS D, E) - STEP 1: t(11;14) status must be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE II (ARMS D, E) - STEP 1: Patients must not have bortezomib refractory disease.&#xD;
             Prior lenalidomide refractory patients are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE II (ARMS D, E) - STEP 1: Patients must have been treated with 1 or more lines of&#xD;
             therapy. 1 prior line of systemic therapy is defined as 1 or more planned cycles of&#xD;
             single agent or combination therapy, as well as a planned series of treatment regimens&#xD;
             administered in a sequential manner (e.g. lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone&#xD;
             induction therapy for 4 cycles followed by autologous stem cell transplantation and&#xD;
             then lenalidomide maintenance therapy would be considered 1 line of prior therapy).&#xD;
             Auto stem cell transplant is allowed provided the patient is 100 days out from stem&#xD;
             cell infusion. Patients must not have had prior venetoclax. Allogeneic SCT patients&#xD;
             are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHASE II (ARMS D, E) - STEP 1: Patients must have measurable disease as defined by&#xD;
             having one or more of the following, obtained within 14 days prior to randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  &gt;= 0.5 g/dL monoclonal protein (M-protein) on serum protein electrophoresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  &gt;= 200 mg/24 hours (hrs) of monoclonal protein (M-protein) on a 24 hour urine&#xD;
                  protein electrophoresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Involved free light chain &gt;= 10 mg/dL AND abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa to&#xD;

             performed within 14 days prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: UPEP (on a 24 hour collection) is required, no substitute method is&#xD;
                  acceptable. Urine must be followed monthly if the baseline urine M-spike is &gt;=&#xD;
                  200 mg/24 hr. Please note that if both serum and urine m-components are present,&#xD;
                  both must be followed in order to evaluate response.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: The serum free light chain test is required to be done if the patient does&#xD;
                  not have measurable disease in the serum or urine. Measurable disease in the&#xD;
                  serum is defined as having a serum M-spike &gt;= 0.5 g/dL. Measurable disease in the&#xD;
                  urine is defined as having a urine M-spike &gt;= 200 mg/24 hr.&#xD;
