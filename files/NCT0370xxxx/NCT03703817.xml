    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) Version 1.4</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (during approximately 20 months of data collection and observation)</time_frame>
    <description>TSQM version 1.4: participant rated 14 items with 4 domains. Scores for item 1 to 3, 9 to 11 and 14 ranged from 1=extremely dissatisfied to 7=extremely satisfied. Items 5 to 8, 12, 13 ranged from 1=extremely dissatisfied to 5=not at all dissatisfied. Item 4 was scored as: 0=No, 1=Yes. Effectiveness measured as ([{sum of item 1 to 3} - 3]/18)*100; if 1 question (Q) was missing: ([{sum of item 1 to 3} -2]/12)*100. Side-effect measured as if item 4=No, score=100; if not then ([{sum of item 5 to 8} -4]/16)*100; if 1 Q was missing: ([{sum of item 5 to 8} -3]/12)*100. Convenience measured as ([{sum of item 9 to 11} -3]/18)*100; if 1 Q was missing: ([{sum of item 9 to 11} - 2]/12)*100. Global satisfaction as ([{sum of item 12 to 14} -3]/14)*100; if item 12 or 13 was missing: ([{sum of item 12 to 14} -2]/10)*100; if item 14 was missing: ([{sum of item 12 and 13} -2]/8)*100. All domains had scale of 0 (no satisfaction) to 100 (best level of satisfaction), higher score=greater satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-3 Level (EQ-5D-3L) Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (during approximately 20 months of data collection and observation)</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-3L assess health-related quality of life. It has 5 dimensions: mobility (M), self-care (SC), usual activities (UA), pain/discomfort (PD) and anxiety/depression (AD). Each dimension has 3 levels. For mobility, self-care and usual activities: 1= no effects, 2= sometimes affected, 3= very affected. For pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression: 1= none, 2= sometimes, 3= often. EQ-5D-3L index was calculated using formula = 1 - (0.0081 + [0.1140 * M2 + 0.6274 * M3 + 0.0572 * SC2 + 0.2073 * SC3 + 0.0615 * UA2 + 0.2812 * UA3 + 0.0581 * PD2+ 0.2353 * PD3 + 0.0675 * AD2 + 0.2351 * AD3]). In this formula, abbreviated form for dimension is followed by level, for example M2 = mobility level 2. Values were set to 1 if level was 2 or 3 for M2, SC2, UA2, PD2, AD2 or M3, SC3, UA3, PD3, AD3 respectively, else set to 0. Total score ranged from -0.27 to 1. Higher scores indicate better health.</description>

    <measure>European Quality of Life-Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (during approximately 20 months of data collection and observation)</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-VAS is a standardized tool for measuring overall health. EQ-VAS recorded the participant's self-rated health on a vertical, VAS on a scale ranging from and 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). Higher scores indicated better health state.</description>

        <description>TSQM version 1.4: participant rated 14 items with 4 domains. Scores for item 1 to 3, 9 to 11 and 14 ranged from 1=extremely dissatisfied to 7=extremely satisfied. Items 5 to 8, 12, 13 ranged from 1=extremely dissatisfied to 5=not at all dissatisfied. Item 4 was scored as: 0=No, 1=Yes. Effectiveness measured as ([{sum of item 1 to 3} - 3]/18)*100; if 1 question (Q) was missing: ([{sum of item 1 to 3} -2]/12)*100. Side-effect measured as if item 4=No, score=100; if not then ([{sum of item 5 to 8} -4]/16)*100; if 1 Q was missing: ([{sum of item 5 to 8} -3]/12)*100. Convenience measured as ([{sum of item 9 to 11} -3]/18)*100; if 1 Q was missing: ([{sum of item 9 to 11} - 2]/12)*100. Global satisfaction as ([{sum of item 12 to 14} -3]/14)*100; if item 12 or 13 was missing: ([{sum of item 12 to 14} -2]/10)*100; if item 14 was missing: ([{sum of item 12 and 13} -2]/8)*100. All domains had scale of 0 (no satisfaction) to 100 (best level of satisfaction), higher score=greater satisfaction.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D-3L assess health-related quality of life. It has 5 dimensions: mobility (M), self-care (SC), usual activities (UA), pain/discomfort (PD) and anxiety/depression (AD). Each dimension has 3 levels. For mobility, self-care and usual activities: 1= no effects, 2= sometimes affected, 3= very affected. For pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression: 1= none, 2= sometimes, 3= often. EQ-5D-3L index was calculated using formula = 1 - (0.0081 + [0.1140 * M2 + 0.6274 * M3 + 0.0572 * SC2 + 0.2073 * SC3 + 0.0615 * UA2 + 0.2812 * UA3 + 0.0581 * PD2+ 0.2353 * PD3 + 0.0675 * AD2 + 0.2351 * AD3]). In this formula, abbreviated form for dimension is followed by level, for example M2 = mobility level 2. Values were set to 1 if level was 2 or 3 for M2, SC2, UA2, PD2, AD2 or M3, SC3, UA3, PD3, AD3 respectively, else set to 0. Total score ranged from -0.27 to 1.

        <description>EQ-VAS is a standardized tool for measuring overall health. EQ-VAS recorded the participant's self-rated health on a vertical, VAS on a scale ranging from and 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). Higher scores indicated better health state.</description>

        <population>The propensity score method (greedy matching method) was used in analysis of the outcome measure. The purpose of the propensity score was to create conditions similar to those of randomized trials by balancing the covariates in participants between the groups. It reduces multidimensional covariates into a one-dimensional score. Here, 'Overall Number of Participants Analyzed' signifies number of participant evaluable for this outcome measure derived from propensity score method.</population>
