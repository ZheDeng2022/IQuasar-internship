  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research has potential to dramatically improve care for emotionally distressed&#xD;
      mothers of newborns hospitalized on the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Clinical NICU&#xD;
      nurses are well-positioned to provide emotional support in the form of Listening Visits.&#xD;
      Specifically, these nurses are easily accessible to NICU mothers, are often the most trusted&#xD;
      professional on the healthcare team, they are knowledgeable about the newborn's medical&#xD;
      conditions, and, finally they are already skilled in the art of warm communication. This&#xD;
      intervention should not only improve depressive outcomes in emotionally distressed NICU&#xD;
      mothers but also indirectly impact maternal perception of nurse support which is in turn&#xD;
      related to depression symptoms and patient satisfaction, as well as infant length of stay by&#xD;
      accelerating maternal readiness for infant discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infant admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is an extremely stressful&#xD;
      postpartum outcome, as evidenced by data showing significant depressive symptoms in some 63%&#xD;
      of new NICU mothers. Thus, as part of a Family-Centered Care philosophy, focus on the&#xD;
      emotional well-being of the mother (and indeed the entire family) should be widely adopted by&#xD;
      NICU nursing units. In current clinical practice, however, the emotional well-being of NICU&#xD;
      mothers is often ignored. At best, NICU mothers are screened for depression and if indicated,&#xD;
      referred to a mental health professional. The extremes of no treatment and full-on mental&#xD;
      healthcare comprise an inadequate approach for treating mothers dealing with a normative&#xD;
      reaction to a stressful event. In alignment with the Nurse Parent Support Model, the&#xD;
      investigators propose the implementation of Listening Visits as a cost-effective&#xD;
      nurse-delivered supportive approach, proven to relieve moderately severe depressive symptoms&#xD;
      in mothers of term infants. In the NICU setting, Listening Visits were first implemented in a&#xD;
      phase-1 feasibility trial conducted by this research team. In that first trial, Listening&#xD;
      Visits were delivered by a doctoral level nurse practitioner and showed promise as means to&#xD;
      reduce distress in NICU mothers. A Listening Visit program for emotionally distressed NICU&#xD;
      mothers is innovative because it is a cost-effective approach that uses resources that are&#xD;
      largely in place, to serve a persistent unmet need in a vulnerable postpartum population. By&#xD;
      having nurses provides support, the concept of emotional distress in NICU mothers is&#xD;
      normalized. This new application of Listening Visits also directly aligns with the NINR&#xD;
      emphasis on promoting coping to prevent compromising mood states. The promising results of&#xD;
      the feasibility trial now must be challenged with a control group comparison to definitively&#xD;
      attribute maternal improvements to Listening Visits. Thus the objective of the proposed&#xD;
      research is to conduct a Phase 2 pilot RCT to evaluate Listening Visits provided by&#xD;
      bachelor's-level NICU nurses as compared with the care currently provided by the NICU social&#xD;
      work team. The investigators will assess the relative effectiveness of Listening Visits vs.&#xD;
      standard care on depressive symptoms. 50 women will be randomized into this trial. Because&#xD;
      outcomes of infants will be obtained, the IRB has required that they be enrolled by their&#xD;
      mothers as subjects so that data on their outcomes can be obtained. However they are not&#xD;
      receiving the intervention. Due to the pandemic, recruitment for the RCT was halted. The&#xD;
      protocol was modified to an open trial design, in which women received Listening Visits from&#xD;
      a NICU nurse via zoom. The goal is to enroll 20 women.&#xD;
