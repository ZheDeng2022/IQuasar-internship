  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if an investigational treatment will allow kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients to better accept their new kidney and stop immunosuppressive medicines.&#xD;
      This study is for kidney transplant recipients who receive a kidney from a sibling donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational treatment is started after kidney transplant. It begins with a regimen of&#xD;
      a drug called rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) combined with radiation therapy (known as&#xD;
      total lymphoid irradiation, or TLI) to the lymph nodes and spleen. This is followed by an&#xD;
      infusion of blood stem cells, which will be donated by the same sibling who donated their&#xD;
      kidney. Researchers think that this treatment allows immune cells from the donor and&#xD;
      recipient to live side by side, a condition referred to as &quot;mixed chimerism.&quot; Mixed chimerism&#xD;
      may help create a state of &quot;tolerance&quot; in kidney transplant recipients in which all&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medications can be stopped without rejection of the transplanted kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test whether (1) the investigational treatment will allow patients to stop&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medications after their kidney transplant and (2) if the treatment impacts&#xD;
      the rate of kidney rejection and the side effects of immunosuppressive medications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In spite of the pronounced benefit of kidney transplantation in prolonging survival and&#xD;
      improving the quality of life of patients with end stage renal disease, it is still hampered&#xD;
      by the risk of graft rejection and the need for lifelong immunosuppression. Researchers have&#xD;
      sought to circumvent these challenges through the use of combined kidney and hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation to induce immune tolerance. This study will build upon published&#xD;
      reports showing favorable results for the TLI/rATG regimen in HLA-matched living donor&#xD;
      transplant recipients. The investigators seek to confirm that patients treated with total&#xD;
      lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) followed by human&#xD;
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donor hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant can be&#xD;
      withdrawn from immunosuppressive drugs while maintaining normal renal function after renal&#xD;
      transplantation. At serial time points, (1) graft function will be monitored, (2) chimerism&#xD;
      will be measured in recipient white blood cell subsets, and (3) protocol biopsies of the&#xD;
      graft will be obtained. An attempt will be made to discontinue tacrolimus at 12 months if the&#xD;
      following conditions are met: (1) chimerism (defined as ≥5% donor type cells among the T&#xD;
      cells, B cells, Natural Killer [NK] cells, and granulocytes) is detectable for at least 180&#xD;
      days after CD34+ and CD3+ cell infusion, (2) stable graft function without clinical rejection&#xD;
      episodes is maintained, (3) there is lack of histologic rejection on protocol biopsies, and&#xD;
      (4) there is no evidence of graft vs. host disease (GVHD). Recipients in the proposed study&#xD;
      will be given a target dose of ≥ 5 x106 CD34+ cells/kg and 5x106 CD3+ cells/kg with the goal&#xD;
      of achieving durable mixed chimerism.&#xD;
