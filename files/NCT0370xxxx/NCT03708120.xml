  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the length of time an insect repellent product can protect against three&#xD;
      species of ticks. Participants will have one arm treated with the repellent, and throughout&#xD;
      the next 10 hours, ticks will be given the opportunity to crawl up the treated arm. The test&#xD;
      will stop after 10 hours or when the repellent stops working whichever occurs sooner.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single group trial with the participants acting as their own controls. The study is&#xD;
      split into two parts; the first to determine a typical consumer dose when applied to repel&#xD;
      ticks, and the second to evaluate the longevity of that consumer dose against three tick&#xD;
      species.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the typical consumer dose, twenty-five volunteers will be required to apply the&#xD;
      repellent product from final consumer ready pump spray bottle to their forearm. Each&#xD;
      volunteer will be asked to read the label and apply the repellent according to the&#xD;
      instructions to their forearm. They will repeat the application three times. The amount&#xD;
      applied by each subject across the three applications will be averaged, and then the average&#xD;
      amount applied by each subject will be averaged to arrive at a &quot;typical consumer dose&quot;. This&#xD;
      typical consumer dose will be used as the application rate for the tick repellent efficacy&#xD;
      trial. Three species are required by the EPA to demonstrate the effectiveness of a repellent.&#xD;
      The following tick species have been chosen from the list of five species recommended by the&#xD;
      EPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ixodes scapularis - Also known as blacklegged ticks or deer ticks, this species is one of the&#xD;
      principal vectors of Lyme disease. They are found in eastern and northern Midwest of the&#xD;
      United States. The lifecycle takes approximately two years during which the tick develops&#xD;
      from egg to larva, to nymph and finally adult. Larvae, nymphs and adults will all blood feed.&#xD;
      Larvae usually feed from smaller mammals and birds, whilst nymphs and adults feed on larger&#xD;
      mammals such as deer and humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amblyomma americanum - The Lone Star Tick is found in the eastern United States and in&#xD;
      Mexico. This species of hard tick can be a vector of human ehrlichiosis, tularaemia, and may&#xD;
      trigger an allergy to the carbohydrate alpha gal found in mammalian meat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dermacentor variabilis - The American dog tick is usually found in central and eastern areas&#xD;
      of the United States. Adults preferentially feed on large mammals such as dogs and humans,&#xD;
      however immature stages will also feed on humans if the opportunity arises. They are the most&#xD;
      common vector of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and can also transmit tularaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rhipicephalus sanguineus - The brown dog tick is distributed worldwide, including across the&#xD;
      United States. It is the vector of many pathogens, including Rickettsia rickettsia, the&#xD;
      causative agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Coxiella burnetii, causative agent of Q&#xD;
      fever, Ehrlichia canis, and Rickettsia conorii. Dogs are the primary host for the brown dog&#xD;
      tick in each of its life stages, but the tick may also bite humans or other mammals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ticks will be sourced from disease-free colonies at Oklahoma State University and housed at&#xD;
      the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, United Kingdom, under optimal environmental&#xD;
      conditions of 25 ± 3 °C and greater than or equal to 80% Relative Humidity with a 16:8 hour&#xD;
      photoperiod.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single ticks will be exposed to participants' forearms following standardised treatment of&#xD;
      one of the participant's forearms with repellent, in a laboratory setting. The treatment will&#xD;
      be based on the dose derived from the dosimetry phase of the study, which will be submitted&#xD;
      to EPA for review before proceeding to the repellency phase of testing. The treatment will be&#xD;
      randomised to either the left or right arm of each participant for each test. There is no&#xD;
      blinding employed since the outcome measures are based on tick behaviour. Twenty-five&#xD;
      participants will be required for the consumer dose evaluation and to test the repellent&#xD;
      against each of the tick species (preferably with a 50:50 ratio of males to females).&#xD;
      Participants will test the product at a single dose against at least one of the three&#xD;
      species.&#xD;
