  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease affects 200,000 people in the UK (~1 in 500), most are young (diagnosed &lt; 35&#xD;
      years) with costs of direct medical care exceeding Â£500 million.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crohn's disease is caused by an auto-immune response and affects any part of the digestive&#xD;
      tract, most commonly the last segment of the small bowel (the terminal ileum).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a role in 3 areas: Crohn's disease diagnosis ,&#xD;
      monitoring treatment response &amp; assessing development of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the small bowel using MRI, Radiologists visually examine the scan slice-by-slice.&#xD;
      The interpretation is time consuming and error-prone because of disease presentation&#xD;
      variability and differentiation of diseased segments from collapsed segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep learning for image analysis is based on a computer algorithm &quot;learning&quot; from human&#xD;
      (Radiologist) generated training data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This method has been successfully applied to medical imaging, for example computer detection&#xD;
      of lung cancer on chest X-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study investigates if a deep learning algorithm can identify and score segments of&#xD;
      inflamed terminal ileum affected by Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge this is the first project attempting to develop such an algorithm.The study&#xD;
      will retrospectively review MR images obtained as part of standard care from patients being&#xD;
      investigated for, Crohn's or being followed up with Crohn's disease. 226 patients' images&#xD;
      will be used for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On fully anonymised images two Radiologists working at Northwick Park Hospital will score and&#xD;
      outline normal and abnormal loops of terminal ileum. Imperial College computer science&#xD;
      department will then develop a deep learning algorithm from imaging features of normal and&#xD;
      abnormal loops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study end-point is algorithm performance vs. images labelled by Radiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eventual aim is to develop an algorithm that assists Radiologists in the accurate&#xD;
      diagnosis and follow-up of patients with Crohn's disease.&#xD;

      Introduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal aim of the study is evaluating the accuracy of deep learning algorithm in&#xD;
      differentiating between normal and abnormal terminal ileum against experienced Radiologists&#xD;
      on MR Enterography images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study builds on existing research, which has shown statistical methods can identify sites&#xD;
      of small bowel Crohn's disease. However the process was time consuming &gt;1hr and not fully&#xD;
      automatic. Our project investigates if cutting edge &quot;deep learning&quot; algorithm (based on&#xD;
      neural networks) coupled with increased computing power can provide accurate and timely&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has been designed jointly by Specialist Radiologists in Gastrointestinal imaging&#xD;
      (who are aware of the challenges in imaging Crohn's disease accurately) and Imperial College&#xD;
      Computer Science Department (who are experienced in developing neural networks for medical&#xD;
      imaging). Input and review from London North-West Research and Development department is also&#xD;
      acknowledged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective design &amp; Recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will retrospectively identify eligible patients and use a consecutive case sampling&#xD;
      technique, (all eligible images will be included working backwards from most recent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective approach compromises between generalisability of findings being reduced&#xD;
      vs. the study being carried out relatively quickly and at low cost (study has no grant&#xD;
      funding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are confident of the generalisability of the results as a recruitment&#xD;
      target of 113 normal cases and 113 cases with terminal ileal disease should cover the&#xD;
      spectrum of normal and abnormal appearances (previous studies have used &lt;50 image sets).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases with normal terminal ileum on MRI are included as an approach to algorithm development&#xD;
      involves comparison of imaging features of normal and abnormal terminal ileum on MRI studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-experimental approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method uses MRI scans undertaken as part of standard clinical care. No additional imaging&#xD;
      is undertaken for this study. The study results will not change the current treatment/s&#xD;
      eligible patients are taking..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent &amp; confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the images used for algorithm development are fully anonymized so explicit consent will&#xD;
      not be obtained. This follows guidance from the General Medical Council Guidelines in 2011&#xD;
      and The Royal College of Radiologists(UK) in 2017 which state anonymized recordings can be&#xD;
      shared for use in research without consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI images used for this study were acquired as part of routine standard clinical care, and&#xD;
      would routinely be viewed by the Radiologists taking part in this study as part of their&#xD;
      normal working practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As soon as suitable patient is identified the patient's images will be copied in a fully&#xD;
      anonymized form with no direct or indirect identifiers. A robust anonymization function is&#xD;
      included in the Radiology image viewing program. Study subject Identifiers will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated preventing pseudo-anonymization if scans from the same patient at different time&#xD;
      points are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No sensitive/patient identifiable data will be transferred for algorithm development during&#xD;
      the study. The algorithm development is based on matching MRI pixel intensities to disease&#xD;
      scores/ annotations across multiple scans. Anonymization does not affect the pixels within&#xD;
      the image. Only aggregate data will be presented in publications- i.e. single case examples&#xD;
      will not be published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conflict of interest. The researchers on this study declare no conflict of interest.&#xD;
