  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of darvadstrocel for the treatment of&#xD;
      complex perianal fistulas in adult participants with Crohn's disease over 24 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Darvadstrocel (Cx601). This study will assess&#xD;
      the efficacy for 24 and 52 weeks, and safety for 156 weeks of darvadstrocel when administered&#xD;
      with intralesional injection in adult participants with Crohn's disease whose complex&#xD;
      perianal fistulas were previously treated and refractory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study enrolled 22 participants. All participants who will meet the criteria will be&#xD;
      assigned to screening period for approximately 5 weeks and after that will be enrolled the&#xD;
      treatment period which will be the day of study product administration. After the treatment&#xD;
      period, this study will include the follow-up period for approximately 52 weeks after study&#xD;
      product administration, and the long-term follow-up period from Week 52 to Week 156.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate is&#xD;
      totally approximately 156 weeks (3 years) from the start of treatment period plus follow-up&#xD;
      and long-term follow-up period. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and a&#xD;
      final visit 156 weeks after treatment of study product for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;

        <description>The PDAI is a scoring system to evaluate the severity of perianal lesion associated with Crohn's disease. It includes the following 5 items: (a) Discharge; (b) Pain; (c) Restriction of sexual activity; (d) Type of perianal disease; and (e) Degree of induration. The discharge item is graded on a 5-point scale where 0 indicates no symptoms and 4 indicates severe symptoms and total range of score is from 0 to 20. Higher score indicates more severe disease. Negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>CDAI score is calculated from the following 8 items: (a) Number of liquid or very soft stools; (b) Abdominal pain; (c) General wellbeing; (d) Extraintestinal complications; (e) Antidiarrhoeal drugs; (f) Abdominal mass; (g) Hematocrit; and (h) Body weight. Scores of some items in CDAI are calculated based on patient diary. Total score ranges from 0 to 600. Higher score means more severe disease and especially severe disease was defined as a value of greater than 450. Negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

Each item is graded on a 5-point scale ranging from no symptoms (score of 0) to severe symptoms (score of 4) and total range of score is from 0 to 20. Higher score means more severe disease.</description>
