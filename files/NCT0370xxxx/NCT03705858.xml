  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see what dose of 225Ac-lintuzumab is safest to give to acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who are in remission but still have minimal residual disease&#xD;
      (MRD). About 12 subjects will be asked to take part in this phase 1, 3+3 dose-escalation&#xD;
      study. In addition to confirming the safety profile of postremission therapy with&#xD;
      225Ac-lintuzumab, preliminary evidence of efficacy will be assessed by estimating&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and serially evaluating for MRD&#xD;
      using cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or flow cytometric assays, as&#xD;
      applicable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Therapy with α particle-emitting constructs of the anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody lintuzumab&#xD;
      has demonstrated significant tumor effects in AML. Because therapy is selectively targeted to&#xD;
      leukemic blasts, it has the potential advantage of less extramedullary toxicity than&#xD;
      conventional systemic agents. Moreover, the unique radiobiological features of α particle&#xD;
      emissions may permit more efficient tumor cell kill with greater specificity than treatment&#xD;
      with β particle-emitting radioisotopes. Objective responses in AML following treatment with&#xD;
      225Ac-lintuzumab have been seen in cytoreduced disease, either following chemotherapy or&#xD;
      using a fractionated dosing scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of MRD detectable by cytogenetic techniques and flow cytometric assays indicates&#xD;
      a high risk of relapse for AML patients, despite achieving a clinical complete remission. The&#xD;
      high linear energy and short range of α emissions make them ideally suited to eradicate MRD,&#xD;
      as suggested by the clinical responses observed in earlier studies. To date, 225Ac-lintuzumab&#xD;
      has only been studied in patients with overt leukemia. The aim of this phase 1 study is to&#xD;
      identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 225Ac-lintuzumab that can be given safely to AML&#xD;
      patients in the postremission setting in order to eliminate detectable MRD and ultimately&#xD;
      prolong PFS and OS.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must have histologically confirmed AML in first, second, or third clinical&#xD;
             CR/CRp after any standard or investigational therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must have detectable MRD by cytogenetics, FISH, or flow cytometry after the&#xD;
             completion of all planned therapy. Detectable MRD by flow cytometry is defined by the&#xD;
             presence of a myeloid blast population with an atypical immunophenotype, constituting&#xD;
             less than 5% of all events. Examples of planned therapy courses include induction&#xD;
             chemotherapy with cytarabine and an anthracycline followed by consolidation&#xD;
             chemotherapy or 4-6 cycles of a hypomethylating agent-based regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At the time of diagnosis or most recent relapse, greater than 25% of bone marrow&#xD;
             blasts must have been CD33 positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of 225Ac-lintuzumab in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must have adequate bone marrow and organ function documented within 14 days&#xD;
             of study entry as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/μL;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Platelet count ≥ 50,000/μL;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or estimated glomerular&#xD;
                  filtration rate of &gt; 50 mL/min;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN (unless attributable to Gilbert's disease);&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Alkaline phosphatase, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and serum alanine&#xD;
                  aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The effects of 225Ac-lintuzumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. Since&#xD;
             radiation exposure, however, is known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of treatment&#xD;
             on study. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4&#xD;
             months after completion of 225Ac-lintuzumab administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with acute promyelocytic leukemia or BCR-ABL-positive leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering&#xD;
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Prior clofarabine is not allowed due to risk&#xD;
             of liver dysfunction.&#xD;

             infections uncontrolled by antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable&#xD;
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, documented liver cirrhosis, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
