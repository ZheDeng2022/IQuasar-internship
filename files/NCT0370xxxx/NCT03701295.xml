  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pinometostat when given&#xD;
      together with azacitidine and to see how well it works in treating patients with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia that has come back (relapsed), does not respond to treatment (refractory),&#xD;
      or is newly diagnosed, with an 11q23 rearrangement. Pinometostat and azacitidine may stop the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if the combination of pinometostat, at a dose of 54 or 90 mg/m^2/day, and&#xD;
      azacitidine, at a dose of 75 mg/m^2 daily for 7 days, is safe and tolerable in patients with&#xD;
      MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia, either in the relapsed/ refractory setting or in those&#xD;
      who choose not to undergo standard induction therapy in the previously untreated setting.&#xD;
      (Phase Ib) II. To determine the preliminary efficacy, as determined by overall response rate&#xD;
      (complete response [CR], complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery [CRi],&#xD;
      partial response [PR], and morphologic leukemia-free state [MLFS]), of pinometostat&#xD;
      administered at the maximum tolerated dose from the phase 1b, combined with azacitidine&#xD;
      administered at 75 mg/m^2 daily for 7 days, in patients with MLL-rearranged acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia, either in the relapsed/refractory setting or in those who choose not to undergo&#xD;
      standard induction therapy in the previously untreated setting. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Perform correlative studies to evaluate for on-target effects, cellular differentiation,&#xD;
      and decreased leukemia cell proliferation in these patients. (Phase Ib and II) II. To observe&#xD;
      and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase Ib)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of pinometostat followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pinometostat intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-28 and azacitidine IV&#xD;
      over 10-40 minutes or subcutaneously (SC) for 7 of the first 10 days of the cycle. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.&#xD;

          -  Patients treated in the up-front setting must decline standard-of-care therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity with a close legal&#xD;
             guardian/caregiver may be considered&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as abnormal blasts detectable in the&#xD;
             peripheral blood or bone marrow or the presence of extramedullary disease, including&#xD;
             leukemia cutis. Patients with extramedullary disease but no bone marrow disease are&#xD;
             still considered eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have had previous treatment with standard-of-care or experimental agents.&#xD;
             Patients who have previously undergone bone marrow transplantation may also be&#xD;
             included&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive (+), hepatitis B virus&#xD;
             (HBV)+, and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV)+ may be eligible as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective antiretroviral&#xD;
                  therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
                  The antiretroviral therapy should not strongly induce or inhibit CYP3A4&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HBV viral load must be&#xD;
                  undetectable on suppressive therapy if indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, must be treated with&#xD;
                  undetectable HCV viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of pinometostat on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because histone methyltransferase inhibitors as well as hypomethylating agents are&#xD;
             known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior&#xD;
             to study entry, and for the duration of study participation and for 4 weeks after the&#xD;
             last dose of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 90 days after completion of pinometostat and azacitidine&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) disease are excluded from this&#xD;
             clinical trial because they may develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would&#xD;
             confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Patients with a prior&#xD;
             history of CNS disease will not be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to pinometostat or azacitidine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of&#xD;
             the CYP3A4 or CYP450 system should have their medications reviewed and adjusted for&#xD;
             interactions as appropriate for local institutional practice. Because the lists of&#xD;
             these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a&#xD;
             frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent&#xD;
             procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other&#xD;
             agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is&#xD;
             considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of&#xD;
             MATE1 and MATE2-K transporters should have their medications reviewed and adjusted for&#xD;
             interactions as appropriate for local institutional practice. Pinometostat has been&#xD;
             demonstrated to be an inhibitor of MATE1 and MATE2-K transporters in vitro, although&#xD;
             the clinical significance of this is unclear. Drug interactions may occur between&#xD;
             pinometostat and other therapies that are MATE substrates, including metformin.&#xD;
             Consultation with a frequently updated medical reference and/or pharmacist should be&#xD;
             sought to guide necessary changes in the patient's other medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             uncontrolled or clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
             Patients with these conditions that are medically well controlled may be considered&#xD;
             for enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because pinometostat is an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with pinometostat, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with pinometostat. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used&#xD;
             in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy should have their regimen&#xD;
             reviewed for potential pharmacokinetic interactions with pinometostat and azacitidine.&#xD;
             In the event of a potential interaction, alternative therapies may be considered in&#xD;
             consultation with the patient's primary HIV physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of an 11q23 rearrangement or absence of an 11q23 partial tandem duplication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an active bleeding diathesis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients at increased risk of QT prolongation (e.g. from known long-QT syndrome) or&#xD;
             who have a corrected QT interval that is persistently longer than 450 ms despite&#xD;
             adjustments to other medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are eligible for or willing to receive intensive induction therapy for de&#xD;
             novo AML&#xD;
