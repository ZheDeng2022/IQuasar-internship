  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are purposing a study to evaluate the use of acetaminophen given prior to&#xD;
      an electrophysiology procedure and post procedural pain control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial arrhythmias are very common and widespread. Recent reports suggest that 9% of patients&#xD;
      over the age of 65 currently have atrial fibrillation. In individuals of European descent the&#xD;
      lifetime risk of atrial fibrillation is as high as 26%. Atrial fibrillation carries&#xD;
      significant risk of complications including: a fivefold increase in risk of stroke, a&#xD;
      threefold risk of heart failure, a twofold risk of dementia and a twofold risk of mortality.&#xD;
      As treatment options continue to evolve, the use of catheter ablation procedures are becoming&#xD;
      increasingly common within the United States. Currently, ablation has a class 1A&#xD;
      recommendation for patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation refractory or&#xD;
      intolerant to at least one class I or class III antiarrhythmic medication and a class 2B&#xD;
      indication before initiation of antiarrhythmic drug therapy. One of the known complications&#xD;
      of catheter ablation procedures is pain following the procedure. Severe pain has been&#xD;
      reported in up to 55% of patients undergoing ablation procedures. IV acetaminophen has been&#xD;
      proven to be effective at controlling pain in post intra-abdominal surgery, however, its use&#xD;
      is limited due to the cost of this medication. Other studies have suggested that there is no&#xD;
      clear indication for IV over oral acetaminophen in patients who are able to take oral.&#xD;
      Empirically the investigators have seen patients complaining of pain after all&#xD;
      electrophysiology procedures, not limited to just ablation procedures. To the best of the&#xD;
      knowledge of the investigational team, at this time, no studies have looked at using oral&#xD;
      pre-procedural acetaminophen to assist with pain control following electrophysiology&#xD;
      procedures. The investigators are looking to perform a randomized, double blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled study to evaluate the use of pre-procedural oral acetaminophen to help control&#xD;
      post procedural pain.&#xD;
