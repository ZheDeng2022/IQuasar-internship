      1. INTRODUCTION Diaphragm ultrasound non-invasively explores the diaphragm function and it&#xD;
           can be useful in several clinical situations. Diaphragm ultrasound is able to evaluate&#xD;
           the cranio-caudal displacement of the diaphragm and its thickening fraction at the end&#xD;
           of inspiration, in relation to the end-expiratory value. These parameters provide useful&#xD;
           data in the evaluation and management of patients affected by diaphragm dysfunction;&#xD;
           moreover, they are gaining an increasing role in the evaluation of patients undergoing&#xD;
           mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To assess the diaphragm activity, clinicians use two different sonographic windows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. to evaluate diaphragmatic thickness in the zone of apposition of the diaphragm to the&#xD;
           rib cage. Physicians can assess thickening fraction between the 8th and 10th intercostal&#xD;
           space, on the anterior or midaxillary line, 0.5-2 cm below the costophfrenic angle. The&#xD;
           zone of apposition is the area of the chest wall where the abdominal contents reach the&#xD;
           lower rib cage. In this area, the diaphragm is observed as a structure made of three&#xD;
           distinct layers: a non-echogenic central layer bordered by two echogenic layers, the&#xD;
           peritoneum and the diaphragmatic pleurae. To obtain adequate images of diaphragmatic&#xD;
           thickness in M mode and 2D mode, a linear high-frequency probe (≥10 MHz) is necessary.&#xD;
           The diaphragmatic thickness can be measured during quiet spontaneous breathing and&#xD;
           during a maximal inspiratory and expiratory effort. An index of diaphragmatic&#xD;
           thickening, the thickening fraction (TF) can be calculated using the M mode (TF =&#xD;
           thickness at endinspiration - thickness at end-expiration/thickness at end-expiration).&#xD;
           Diaphragmatic thickening fraction can be used as an index of diaphragmatic efficiency as&#xD;
           a pressure generator. In normal individuals, there is a wide range of tdi at functional&#xD;
           residual capacity (FRC), ranging between 1.8 to 3 mm. As lung volume increases from the&#xD;
           residual volume (RV) to total lung capacity (TLC) there is a mean tdi increase of 54 %&#xD;
           (range 42-78 %). Furthermore, the diaphragm also thickens during a maximal inspiratory&#xD;
           pressure (Pimax) maneuver at FRC. A thickening ratio of 2.6 can be measured, dividing&#xD;
           the diaphragmatic thickness during Pimax at FRC by the diaphragmatic thickness while&#xD;
           relaxing at FRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. the physicians can also assess the diaphragmatic displacement (or excursion) trough&#xD;
           a 3.5-5 mHz phased array probe. The probe is placed immediately below the right costal&#xD;
           margin in the mid-clavicular line or in the right anterior axillary line, and it is&#xD;
           directed medially, cephalad and dorsally, in order that the ultrasound beam&#xD;
           perpendicularly reached the hemi-diaphragm in its posterior third portion. After&#xD;
           obtaining the best approach in two-dimensional mode, the displacement was measured in&#xD;
           M-mode displaying the motion of the hemi-diaphragm along the selected line. In healthy&#xD;
           subjects during spontaneous breathing, the inspiratory diaphragm excursion is 1.34 ±&#xD;
           0.18 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In patients undergoing assist mechanical ventilation, the thickening fraction is an&#xD;
           indicator of inspiratory effort. While several studies have been conducted in the&#xD;
           evaluation of educational programmes for echocardiography, to date data regarding this&#xD;
           aspect in diaphragm ultrasonographic assessment lack.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AIM OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the experience gained in some specialization schools in Anesthesia and Intensive&#xD;
      Care, the investigators hypothesize that the participation in a two-hour course, including a&#xD;
      theoretical part and a practical training, allows to acquire the appropriate theoretical and&#xD;
      practical skills necessary to correctly perform the measurement of the diaphragm excursion&#xD;
      and thickening fraction, compared to the theoretical lesson only, followed by a brief&#xD;
      explanation by an expert tutor, on the practical use of the ultrasound. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that the association of the theoretical part and of the practical training is&#xD;
      able to obtain:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Passing the theoretical test with at least 70% of the correct answers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The correct identification of the areas where the probe is affixed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The appropriate measure of diaphragmatic TF and displacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants will be randomized into two groups similar for age and&#xD;
      gender. First of all, a theoretical part will be conducted through the administration of a&#xD;
      video-tutorial to both groups, aimed to teach of ultrasonographic basic principles, of&#xD;
      sonographic windows and of the anatomical reference points for the diaphragmatic&#xD;
      ultrasonography. At the end of the video, a 10-point questionnaire will be administered to&#xD;
      evaluate the level of learning for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every single participant will pass the test if he/she correctly answers to at least the 70%&#xD;
      of the questions. Those passing the test will be randomized to two groups. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to one of the two groups using opaque, sealed, numbered envelopes. The&#xD;
      investigators will use a computer-generated randomization sequence, generated by an&#xD;
      independent biostatistician who is not otherwise involved in the trial. The envelopes will be&#xD;
      kept in head of nurses offices in every institution's critical care unit. The researcher will&#xD;
      distribute the envelopes to participants, which will independently open it. Participants will&#xD;
      communicate the random group allocation to the researcher who will assign the participant to&#xD;
      the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group will access the practical training, during which each participant will be&#xD;
      followed by a tutor who will interactively explain, using a healthy volunteer, how to perform&#xD;
      the ultrasound scan of the diaphragm. The ultrasound will be performed on a healthy volunteer&#xD;
      first by the tutor and then by the participants. During the exercise, the tutor himself will&#xD;
      supervise each individual learner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group will directly perform the ultrasound examination of the diaphragm. The&#xD;
      expert tutor will only show the learners how to use the various functions of the ultrasound,&#xD;
      the linear and convex probes both in two-dimensional and in M-mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tutors assigned to both groups will have proven experience in thoracic ultrasound. In&#xD;
      order to standardize the practical teaching of the technique, the tutors will meet&#xD;
      telematically by agreeing the modalities of the training and / or administration of the&#xD;
      basics on the use of the ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the learning, each participant of both groups will perform the ultrasound scan of&#xD;
      the diaphragm in both acoustic windows and acquire the images on the healthy volunteer. The&#xD;
      tutor will verify the correctness of the acquired images and make the measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A classroom helper will record the measurements taken and make the scanned image available&#xD;
      again for a new measurement. Therefore, on the same image, the participant, who will not know&#xD;
      the measurements performed by the tutor, will perform his own measurement, the results of&#xD;
      which will be recorded by the person in charge of the classroom. This procedure will be&#xD;
      carried out both for the measurement of the excursion and for that of the thickening&#xD;
      fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant fails to correctly display the diaphragm in one of the two windows, the&#xD;
      result will be negative. Those who will identify the diaphragm in both windows will be&#xD;
      admitted to the next step and will be able to measure the diaphragmatic displacement and the&#xD;
      diaphragmatic thickening fraction. The result will be considered positive if the learner will&#xD;
      obtain measurement values for thickening fraction that deviate from those performed by the&#xD;
      expert tutor at most 20% and diaphragmatic displacement values that deviate from the values&#xD;
      obtained by the tutor to a maximum of +/- 2 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Study design Multicenter randomized controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Population 58 students for each of the two groups, for a total of 116 volunteers, enrolled&#xD;
      between medical and surgical students, health professions, specializing in medical-surgical&#xD;
      disciplines who have no experience in the field of ultrasound and are divided into two&#xD;
      groups, of which one will receive both the theoretical lesson and the practical training,&#xD;
      while the other at the end of the theoretical lesson will receive only general notions about&#xD;
      the practical use of the ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Statistical analysis Based on the above considerations, at the end of the course, a&#xD;
      difference is expected between groups receiving the practical training compared and control,&#xD;
      in terms of achievement of the outcome equal to at least 30%.&#xD;
