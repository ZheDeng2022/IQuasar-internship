  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angiogenesis is inherently associated to bone formation and healing. During implant&#xD;
      osseointegration, a successive and successful angiogenic processes has to occur to promote&#xD;
      bone formation. In 1969, Branemark et al. demonstrated that direct contact between bone and&#xD;
      titanium implant surface was possible, defining osseointegration as &quot;the direct, structural,&#xD;
      and functional contact between live bone and the surface of a functionally loaded implant&quot;.&#xD;
      Consequently, the need of an empirical measurement appeared. With the introduction of&#xD;
      resonance frequency analysis (RFA), it is now possible to measure the degree of implant&#xD;
      stability at any time during the course of implant treatment and loading. In this way,&#xD;
      changes in implant stability can be monitored over the time and it is likely possible to find&#xD;
      implants at risk of failure before they become loose. The rationale of this study is to&#xD;
      analyse how important a good vascularization is for the future bone formation around dental&#xD;
      implants.&#xD;

        Patients who come to the Unit of Periodontology (UZ Leuven, St. RafaÃ«l), in need of implant&#xD;
        rehabilitation, will be evaluated for initial study eligibility during a screening visit.&#xD;
        Patients shall be advised of the need to attend follow-up visits: 3 months after implant&#xD;
        placement (at abutment placement visit) and 1 year, the latter to analyse the early bone&#xD;
        remodelling.&#xD;
