  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchial endoscopy (or bronchial fibroscopy) is an invasive diagnostic examination performed&#xD;
      extremely frequently in the Pneumology department of the Dijon University Hospital, with an&#xD;
      average of 1200 procedures per year. It allows the pneumologist to see the first divisions of&#xD;
      the bronchial tree but also to take samples for microbiological or anatomopathological&#xD;
      purposes. The two main sampling techniques are bronchoalveolar lavage and endobronchial&#xD;
      biopsies. Two steps in the process can be unpleasant for the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the crossing of the nasopharynx because of the narrow and curving passage,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the crossing of the vocal cords and exploration of the trachea, which sometimes causes&#xD;
           nausea but especially a cough and a feeling of suffocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the patients, the experience of the examination can be very difficult. In&#xD;
      addition, the experience of the examination is influenced by the psychological state of the&#xD;
      patient, who is often anxious in the perspective of a diagnosis of a malignancy. It is&#xD;
      therefore recommended to perform this examination under local anesthesia (LA) with xylocaine&#xD;
      spray 5%. Several protocols, such as the use of atropine, hydroxyzine or benzodiazepines,&#xD;
      have been proposed to improve test tolerance, but no pre-medication, other than the drugs&#xD;
      indicated in general anesthesia, including midazolam and propofol, has demonstrated their&#xD;
      efficacy. Moreover, these molecules are not without respiratory side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several recent studies have suggested that hypnotic analgesia improves the experience and&#xD;
      course of diagnostic procedures that are quite similar to bronchial endoscopy and are usually&#xD;
      performed with LA. This is particularly the case for gastroscopy or trans-oesophageal&#xD;
      ultrasound. In addition, the effectiveness of hypnotic analgesia for the relief of acute or&#xD;
      chronic pain is increasingly well established in the literature. However, the pathophysiology&#xD;
      of dyspnea is close to that of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that adding hypnotic analgesia to the usual local anesthesia will relieve&#xD;
      the dyspnea and pain experienced during the examination. There are no studies or data yet on&#xD;
      the effect of hypnotic analgesia in bronchial endoscopy with LA. The objective of this work&#xD;
      is to demonstrate its effectiveness in order to potentially offer this intervention to all&#xD;
      patients and to improve the management of this procedure.&#xD;
