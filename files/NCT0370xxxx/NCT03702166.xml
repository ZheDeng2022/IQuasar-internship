      Evaluation of the overlap between tinnitus-related distress and symptoms of Post Traumatic&#xD;
      Stress Disorder (PTSD), to identify functional covariance among resting-state networks among&#xD;
      individuals with tinnitus and PTSD&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize tinnitus and PTSD symptomatically,&#xD;
      neurobiologically, and causally, applying causal modeling to psychometric and neurofunctional&#xD;
      data. We will enroll 30 individuals with both tinnitus and PTSD. Participants will be asked&#xD;
      to complete baseline assessments of subjective tinnitus distress, PTSD, depression, and&#xD;
      resting-state fMRI at baseline. Individuals with comorbid tinnitus and PTSD who are eligible&#xD;
      for the study will receive 12 sessions of Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) over a 6- to&#xD;
      15-week period. CPT is a trauma-focused treatment for PTSD that guides individuals on how to&#xD;
      recognize and challenge thoughts that are erroneous and dysfunctional. One-month follow-up&#xD;
      assessments of tinnitus-related distress, PTSD, depression, and anxiety will be conducted,&#xD;
      along with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Score on Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for the DSM-5 (CAPS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS-5 is structured interview that assesses the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. Each item is rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 (Absent) to 4 (Extreme/incapacitating) and combines information about frequency and intensity for each of the 20 symptoms. Total scores range from 0-80 with a lower score indicating less symptoms of PTSD. Subscales were not utilized in analyses.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score on the PTSD Check List-5 (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure designed to assess PTSD symptoms. The PCL-5 evaluates how much participants have been bothered by PTSD symptoms in the past month (for baseline and follow up assessments) as a result of a specific life event. Each item of the PCL-5 is scored on a five point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extremely). Possible total score range is 0-80, with a lower score indicating less PTSD symptoms. Subscales were not utilized in analyses.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score on the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The TFI has 25 items that are used to calculate eight subscales that address the intrusiveness of tinnitus, the sense of control the patient has, cognitive interference, sleep disturbance, auditory issues, relaxation issues, quality of life, and emotional distress related to tinnitus. The same 25 items are used to calculate the total score, which was used for the purpose of this study. For the total score, the 25 scale items are scored 0-10 (those scored as a percentage are converted to a score of 1-10). Scores are totaled giving a potential range of 0-250 with a higher score indicating that tinnitus interferes more with the subject. The total score is then divided by the number of questions answered to give a mean score. The mean score is multiplied by 10 to provide an overall TFI score within a 0-100 range, where a lower score indicates that the tinnitus does not interfere with the subjects well-being as much.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tinnitus Acceptance Questionnaire (TAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The TAQ captures the extent to which individuals accept their tinnitus, and attempts to avoid or control tinnitus, as well as a patient's ability to pursue valued life activities and meaningful goals regardless of tinnitus. 12 questions are scored from 0 = Never true to 6= Always true. Total scores on the TAQ range from 0-72, with a lower score indicating higher acceptance of symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Symptom Index Suicide Subscale (DSI-SS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The DSI-SS will be used to assess current suicidal ideation. The DSI-SS is a 4-item self-report measure of suicidal ideation that focuses on ideation, plans, perceived control over ideation, and impulses for suicide. Each item is rated on a 4 point scale, and the scores totaled for a potential range of 4-16, where a higher score indicates more severe degrees of suicide ideation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a widely used and well-validated instrument for measuring the severity of depressive symptoms. It consists of 9 items that assess both affective and somatic symptoms related to depression and depressive disorders that correspond to the diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, outlined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders- 5th Edition (DSM-V, 2013). Each question is rated with a score of 0-3:&#xD;
0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days, 2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day. Scores are the total for the nine questions with a possible range of 0-27, where a lower score indicates minimal depression and a higher score indicates severe depression.</description>

          <description>The CAPS-5 is structured interview that assesses the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. Each item is rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 (Absent) to 4 (Extreme/incapacitating) and combines information about frequency and intensity for each of the 20 symptoms. Total scores range from 0-80 with a lower score indicating less symptoms of PTSD. Subscales were not utilized in analyses.</description>

        <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure designed to assess PTSD symptoms. The PCL-5 evaluates how much participants have been bothered by PTSD symptoms in the past month (for baseline and follow up assessments) as a result of a specific life event. Each item of the PCL-5 is scored on a five point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extremely). Possible total score range is 0-80, with a lower score indicating less PTSD symptoms. Subscales were not utilized in analyses.</description>

        <title>Change in Score on the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI)</title>
        <description>The TFI has 25 items that are used to calculate eight subscales that address the intrusiveness of tinnitus, the sense of control the patient has, cognitive interference, sleep disturbance, auditory issues, relaxation issues, quality of life, and emotional distress related to tinnitus. The same 25 items are used to calculate the total score, which was used for the purpose of this study. For the total score, the 25 scale items are scored 0-10 (those scored as a percentage are converted to a score of 1-10). Scores are totaled giving a potential range of 0-250 with a higher score indicating that tinnitus interferes more with the subject. The total score is then divided by the number of questions answered to give a mean score. The mean score is multiplied by 10 to provide an overall TFI score within a 0-100 range, where a lower score indicates that the tinnitus does not interfere with the subjects well-being as much.</description>

        <description>The PHQ-9 is a widely used and well-validated instrument for measuring the severity of depressive symptoms. It consists of 9 items that assess both affective and somatic symptoms related to depression and depressive disorders that correspond to the diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, outlined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders- 5th Edition (DSM-V, 2013). Each question is rated with a score of 0-3:&#xD;
0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days, 2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day. Scores are the total for the nine questions with a possible range of 0-27, where a lower score indicates minimal depression and a higher score indicates severe depression.</description>
