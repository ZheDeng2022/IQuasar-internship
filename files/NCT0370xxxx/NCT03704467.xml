    <measure>Part A: Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment-Related TEAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from first dose of study treatment up to 230 days</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A serious AE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. TEAEs were defined as events that started or worsened after first dose of study intervention until 30 days after last dose. TEAEs included both serious and non-serious AEs. Treatment-related TEAE: reasonably related to the study intervention. The AE could medically (pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to the study intervention under study in this clinical study protocol.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part A: Number of Participants With Confirmed Best Overall Response (BOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from first dose of study treatment up to 230 days</time_frame>
    <description>Confirmed BOR according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) and as assessed by an Investigator was defined as best response of any of the complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) recorded from the date of randomization until disease progression/ recurrence (taking the smallest measurement recorded since the start of treatment as reference). CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of all lesions. SD: Neither sufficient increase to qualify for PD nor sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. Number of participants with BOR in each category (CR, PR, SD, PD) were reported.</description>

PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (SLD), taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. Participant wise data reported for this outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>Part A: Duration of Response (DoR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from first dose of study treatment up to 230 days</time_frame>
    <description>DoR according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) and as assessed by an Investigator was defined as the time from first documentation of objective response (Complete Response [CR] or Partial Response [PR]) to the date of first documentation of objective progression of disease (PD) or death due to any cause whichever occurs first. CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of all lesions. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. If a participant has not an event (PD or death), DoR was censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment.</description>

    <measure>Part A: Time to Progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from first dose of study treatment up to 230 days</time_frame>
    <description>TTP according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) and assessed by an Investigator was defined as the time from first dose of study intervention until progression disease (PD).

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A serious AE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. TEAEs were defined as events that started or worsened after first dose of study intervention until 30 days after last dose. TEAEs included both serious and non-serious AEs. Treatment-related TEAE: reasonably related to the study intervention. The AE could medically (pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to the study intervention under study in this clinical study protocol.</description>

        <description>Confirmed BOR according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) and as assessed by an Investigator was defined as best response of any of the complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) recorded from the date of randomization until disease progression/ recurrence (taking the smallest measurement recorded since the start of treatment as reference). CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of all lesions. SD: Neither sufficient increase to qualify for PD nor sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. Number of participants with BOR in each category (CR, PR, SD, PD) were reported.</description>
