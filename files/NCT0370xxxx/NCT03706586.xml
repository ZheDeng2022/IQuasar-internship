  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth, or birth before 37 weeks' gestation, is increasingly common, occurring in 8%&#xD;
      of pregnancies in Canada. Preterm birth is associated with many health complications,&#xD;
      particularly when the birth happens before 29 weeks' gestation. At this gestational age, the&#xD;
      lungs are not fully developed and it is not uncommon for infants to have problems breathing&#xD;
      at the time of birth. One complication that can arise is when an infant stops breathing and&#xD;
      needs to be resuscitated. When preterm babies need to be resuscitated doctors must take&#xD;
      special care because of the small infant size and the immaturity of the brain and lungs.&#xD;
      Oxygen is used to resuscitate babies who need it, but unfortunately there is disagreement&#xD;
      about the best oxygen concentration to use. Oxygen concentration is important because both&#xD;
      too much and too little oxygen can cause brain injury. Our research aims to fill this&#xD;
      knowledge gap by participating in an international clinical trial to compare the effects of&#xD;
      resuscitating babies less than 29 weeks' gestational age with either a low oxygen&#xD;
      concentration or a high oxygen concentration. The oxygen concentrations have been selected&#xD;
      using the best available knowledge. During the first 2 months of the clinical trial we will&#xD;
      treat all babies less than 29 weeks' gestation who need resuscitation with the oxygen&#xD;
      concentration we are randomly assigned. Then in the next 2 months, we will treat babies using&#xD;
      the other oxygen concentration. After the trial, we will determine whether the babies&#xD;
      resuscitated with low oxygen or those resuscitated with high oxygen have better survival and&#xD;
      long-term health outcomes. Our research fills a critical knowledge gap in the care of&#xD;
      extremely preterm babies and will impact their survival both here in Canada and&#xD;
      internationally.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Purpose: Over the last 10 years, recommendations regarding the ideal level of oxygen for&#xD;
      resuscitation in preterm infants have changed from 100%, down to low levels of oxygen (&lt;30%),&#xD;
      up to moderate concentration (30-65%). In addition, in 2010, oxygen saturation targeting was&#xD;
      recommended as standard of care and this contributed to a change in clinical practice as&#xD;
      clinicians were more likely and comfortable to start resuscitation at either 21% (room air)&#xD;
      or titrated levels of oxygen such as 30-40%. When the guidelines were again revised in 2015,&#xD;
      the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) acknowledged that a critical&#xD;
      knowledge gap continued to exist for the resuscitation of the preterm infants &lt;37 weeks,&#xD;
      highlighting the need to provide more concrete guidelines. This leaves clinicians in a&#xD;
      challenging position. Despite the advances that have been achieved in perinatal and neonatal&#xD;
      care, neonates are still vulnerable to the consequences of the oxidative effects from&#xD;
      hyperoxia as well as the deleterious effects from hypoxia. A large, multi-centre&#xD;
      international trial of sufficient sample size that is powered to look at safety outcomes such&#xD;
      as mortality and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes is required to provide the necessary&#xD;
      evidenced to guide clinical practice with confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: the null hypothesis for this study is that the incidence of mortality or abnormal&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18-24 months corrected age will be no different by using&#xD;
      either higher initial oxygen concentration of 60% compared to using lower initial oxygen&#xD;
      concentration of 30% for resuscitation of preterm infants of 23 0/7- 28 6/7 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of supplementary oxygen may be crucial, but also potentially detrimental to premature&#xD;
      infants at birth. High oxygen levels may lead to organ damage through oxidative stress, while&#xD;
      low oxygen levels may lead to increased mortality. Excess oxygen exposure during the early&#xD;
      post-birth period is associated with many complications and morbidities of preterm birth.&#xD;
      Preterm infants have lower levels of anti-oxidant pathways consistent with their expected&#xD;
      fetal environment of low oxygen exposure. Excess of oxygen free-radicals in infants&#xD;
      intrinsically deficient in enzymatic antioxidants and non-enzymatic antioxidants may&#xD;
      contribute to these morbidities. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity, through the generation of&#xD;
      reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in excess of antioxidant defenses, is believed to be a&#xD;
      major contributor to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Using lower oxygen&#xD;
      concentrations at birth results in decreased oxidative stress markers and a decrease risk of&#xD;
      developing BPD compared to higher oxygen concentrations. Other organs that may be damaged by&#xD;
      such oxidative stress include kidneys, myocardium and the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is equally growing evidence that using lower oxygen concentrations will lead to lower&#xD;
      oxygen saturation levels and bradycardia, which may lead to increased rates of mortality in&#xD;
      this vulnerable group of infants. An individual patient analysis of clinical trials reported&#xD;
      that 46% of preterm infants resuscitated with initial low oxygen concentration did not reach&#xD;
      SpO2 of 80% at 5 min. This was associated with increased risk of major intraventricular&#xD;
      hemorrhage (IVH), and an almost five times higher risk of death in this vulnerable group of&#xD;
      infants. These data provide a warning note for the use of higher vs. lower initial oxygen&#xD;
      concentration during delivery room resuscitation. As we proceed in determining a safe range&#xD;
      for resuscitation of ELBW/ELGA infants, it is highly likely that the optimum level of oxygen&#xD;
      concentration is likely between the two extremes of 21% and 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To determine whether initial resuscitation of preterm neonates with 60% versus&#xD;
      30% oxygen in the delivery room is feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method/Procedures: This will be a cluster crossover design, unmasked randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) comparing two oxygen concentrations at initiation of resuscitation.&#xD;
      Infants will be placed on the resuscitation table with the initial steps of resuscitation&#xD;
      carried out as per standard of care at each centre which usually follows current&#xD;
      resuscitation guidelines. All centres will make every effort to establish adequate lung&#xD;
      expansion using CPAP or positive pressure ventilation as needed. Enrolled infants will have a&#xD;
      pulse oximeter sensor placed on the right arm in the first minute of life. Their&#xD;
      resuscitation will be initiated with an oxygen concentration of 30% or 60% depending on the&#xD;
      randomization sequence at the centre at the given time. Infants in the 30 % group will remain&#xD;
      in 30% oxygen until 5 min of age unless the infant's heart rate (HR) remains 100/min or less&#xD;
      and does not show a tendency towards progressive increase before reaching 5 min of age or&#xD;
      infant needs chest compression and/or epinephrine. No alteration in oxygen concentration will&#xD;
      be made for an infant who is responding to resuscitation efforts with HR progressively&#xD;
      increasing as minutes go by. At 5 min of age, the clinical team will assess oxygen&#xD;
      saturation. If the saturation is less than 85%, oxygen should be increased by 10-20% every 60&#xD;
      sec to achieve saturations of 85% or greater or a saturation of 90-95% at 10 min of age. If&#xD;
      saturations are greater than 95% at or before 5 min of age, oxygen should be decreased&#xD;
      stepwise (every 60 sec) with an aim to maintain saturations of 85% or greater during 5-10 min&#xD;
      of age or 90-95% at and beyond 10 min of age. The procedure for infants in the 60% group will&#xD;
      be identical. The intervention duration for the trial will be the first 5 min after birth&#xD;
      followed by initial monitoring/action for the next 5 min where titration in oxygen&#xD;
      concentration will be made to achieve stability making a total of 10 min for study&#xD;
      intervention. Titration of oxygen before 5 min after birth will only be made if the infant&#xD;
      remains bradycardic (HR less than 100) and does not show a tendency towards a sustained&#xD;
      increase in HR or if the oxygen saturation exceeds 95%. If the infant does not respond to&#xD;
      ventilation with increasing HR in the first 5 min after birth, steps to ensure effective&#xD;
      ventilation should be done before oxygen is titrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed as intention-to-treat. Data will be compared using Student's t-test for&#xD;
      parametric and Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric comparisons of continuous variables, and&#xD;
      Fisher exact for categorical variables. The data will be presented as mean (standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD)) for normally distributed continuous variables and median (interquartile range&#xD;
      (IQR)) when the distribution will be skewed. P-values will be 2-sided and p&lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses will be performed with SPSS&#xD;
      Statistics for Macintosh, Version 27.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).&#xD;
