      In this study, patients of advanced gastric adenocarcinoma with failed first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy-line or advanced mismatched repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite&#xD;
      instability-high (MSI-H) advanced solid carcinoma will be treated with HX008 combined with&#xD;
      irinotecan and HX008 monotherapy There will be two cohorts in this study: Cohort 1 and Cohort&#xD;
      2. For Cohort 1, advanced gastric adenocarcinoma with failed first-line chemotherapy-line&#xD;
      cancer participants, who had failed or were unable to tolerate first line chemotherapy with&#xD;
      platinum-based or fluorouracil regimens. For Cohort 2, advanced solid tumor participants, who&#xD;
      are required to have been previously treated with at least one line of systemic standard of&#xD;
      care therapy.&#xD;

      Cohort 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no PD-1 antibody against gastric cancer have been approved in China, and there are&#xD;
      many patients with gastric cancer in China, so effective, low-toxicity and affordable&#xD;
      treatment is urgently needed. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of combined&#xD;
      application of recombinant human anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (HX008) and irinotecan in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer (including gastric esophageal&#xD;
      junction cancer) ,thus providing a better treatment for Chinese patients with gastric&#xD;
      cancer.Advanced gastric adenocarcinoma with failed first-line chemotherapy-line cancer&#xD;
      participants, who had failed or were unable to tolerate first line chemotherapy with&#xD;
      platinum-based or fluorouracil regimens are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Later-line therapies after failure of standard treatments for advanced solid cancer patients&#xD;
      are limited. Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)&#xD;
      played a role of positive predictive factor, which had been documented after the&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and nivolumab trial were reported, for PD-1 blockade monotherapy in patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid carcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients with previously-treated locally-advanced or metastatic mismatched&#xD;
      repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) advanced solid tumors will&#xD;
      be treated with HX008 monotherapy.Advanced solid tumor participants, who are required to have&#xD;
      been previously treated with at least one line of systemic standard of care therapy are&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
