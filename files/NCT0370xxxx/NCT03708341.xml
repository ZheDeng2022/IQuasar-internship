    <textblock>
      To this day, a small number of studies have evaluated the effect of melatonin on the&#xD;
      modifications of the characteristics of sleep in critical care units, with mostly a small&#xD;
      studied population. However, no study has been realized on a large population, nor has it&#xD;
      evaluated the association between genetic factors and response to treatment (melatonin),&#xD;
      hence the originality of our study. In our study we hypothesized that systematic melatonin&#xD;
      usage in ICU can ameliorate the total sleep time and the fragmentation index and can decrease&#xD;
      the confusion related to sleep deprivation.&#xD;

      1. Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. Sleep and the circadian rhythm: Sleep is usually considered to be a time of rest&#xD;
           and recovery from the stress of daily life. It also plays a crucial role in the normal&#xD;
           immune and endocrine systems. Studies showed that there is a link between sleep duration&#xD;
           and a large variety of health issues, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension&#xD;
           and depression. Furthermore, sleep deprivation has been linked to immunosuppression as&#xD;
           well as alterations in normal wound healing, thermoregulation and upper airway muscles&#xD;
           (leading to a blunted response to hypercapnia and hypoxia).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sleep is divided into 2 cycles: non-REM (NREM) sleep and REM sleep. NREM sleep is&#xD;
           divided into 4 more stages (1, 2, 3 and 4). REM sleep is characterized by the presence&#xD;
           of rapid ocular movements, and is commonly known as the phase during which dreams occur.&#xD;
           Most individuals progress through the various stages, starting from NREM stage 1, to&#xD;
           finally reach REM sleep. Usually, each sleep cycle lasts 90 minutes , with an average of&#xD;
           4-5 cycles per night.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During sleep, various hormonal changes occur, which shows the importance of sleep in the&#xD;
           normal functioning of the body. Growth hormone and cortisol are released during sleep,&#xD;
           and melatonin levels markedly increased at sleep initiation, with a decrease right&#xD;
           before waking up. Circadian rhythms are normal fluctuations of the biological function,&#xD;
           and are part of an endogenous 24 hour clock situation in the supra-chiasmatic nucleus&#xD;
           (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus, responsible for controlling the day/night variations&#xD;
           of physiological and behavioral functions of the organism. These wake/sleep cycles are&#xD;
           usually divided into an average of 8 hours of nocturnal sleep and 16 hours of&#xD;
           wakefulness in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Circadian rhythms make cyclic environmental changes easier to adapt to, and influence a&#xD;
           number of behaviors and physiological parameters. This is due to a genetic molecular&#xD;
           clock which is present in most nucleated cells. This clock is composed of a group of&#xD;
           transcription factors and regulators of transcription factors which exerce a&#xD;
           retro-control over one another. Thus, protein of the molecular clock can have very&#xD;
           important effects on the transcriptional activity and the metabolism, leading, directly&#xD;
           or indirectly, to a variation of 50% of the total gene pool.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Sleep disorders Sleep disorders are frequent, and impact the quantity and quality&#xD;
           of sleep, leading to an increase in morbidity. Insomnia is generally defined as being a&#xD;
           &quot;sleep insatisfaction&quot;, and can be treated pharmacologically or non pharmacologically.&#xD;
           Considering the side effects of the pharmacological approach, as well as the possible&#xD;
           decrease over time of the latter's efficacy, elderly patients should initially receive a&#xD;
           non pharmacological treatment (sleep hygiene, cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia)&#xD;
           for several months before initiating a pharmacological treatment including&#xD;
           benzodiazepines (BZP) (triazolam, estazolam, temazepam, flurazepam and quazepam),&#xD;
           non-BZP hypnotics (zaleplon, zolpidem and eszopiclone), the recently approved suvorexant&#xD;
           (an orexine receptor antagonist), and/or melatonin receptor agonists as well as anti&#xD;
           depressors (doxepine).&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3. Sleep particularities in critical care patients Patients admitted in critical care&#xD;
           units can be extremely vulnerable to circadian rhythm disturbances, because of the&#xD;
           gravity of their underlying diseases, as well as environmental factors such as noise and&#xD;
           frequent therapeutic/diagnostic interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Several factors could contribute to the sleep disturbances in these patients, mainly&#xD;
           noise, interactions with them, mechanical ventilation, pain, drugs, artificial light,&#xD;
           fatigue, stress delirium, altered physiology, as well as their severe disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Several physiological profiles are also altered, such as arterial blood pressure, pulse,&#xD;
           temperature, spontaneous motor activity, melatonin and cortisol levels. These sleep&#xD;
           alterations are major sources of anxiety and stress during the ICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sleep studies in ICU patients have found:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  frequent arousals;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  sleep fragmentation;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  alteration in the circadian rhythm;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a majority of NREM sleep stage 2 (N2);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a reduction in sleep efficiency;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a prolonged sleep latency;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  an absence or decrease in the NREM sleep stage 3 (N3);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  an absence or decrease in REM sleep Melatonin secretion is also altered in sedated&#xD;
                patients as well as mechanically ventilated patients, as reported by certain&#xD;
                studies. In severe sepsis patients, alterations in the urinary excretion of&#xD;
                6-sulfatoxymelatonin (a melatonin metabolite) are noted, suggesting a role of&#xD;
                sepsis, as well as concomitant drugs, in the pathogenesis of melatonin secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4. Melatonin Administration of melatonin affects sleep architecture and&#xD;
           thermoregulation in humans, with a causal relationship existing between melatonin and&#xD;
           somnolence, which could be induced by thermoregulation mechanisms. This confirms the&#xD;
           hypothesis that the initiation of melatonin secretion could contribute to the increase&#xD;
           of somnolence as well as the increase in sleep that happens as the evening goes on.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The diurnal administration of exogenous melatonin (when it is absent endogenously)&#xD;
           induces sleep in humans. The levels of endogenous melatonin decrease with age, which&#xD;
           could lead certain elderly patients to complain of bad sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Human studies have shown that the exogenous administration of melatonin stimulates the&#xD;
           induction and maintenance of sleep. The increase of neuronal activity in the SCN is&#xD;
           secondary to an increase in the endogenous nocturnal melatonin secretion. The synthesis&#xD;
           and secretion of melatonin are parallel to the sleep rhythm, and are necessary to&#xD;
           regulate the sleep/wake cycle by inhibiting the part of the brain responsable for the&#xD;
           wakefulness function of the hypothalamus.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Various melatoninergic agonists are now available to treat sleep disorders:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ramelteon, for the treatment of insomnia due to difficult initiation of sleep;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Agomelatin, for the treatment of depression and its associated sleep disorders;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tasimelteon, which seems to be effective for the treatment of the transitory&#xD;
                insomnia due to jet lag The potential of melatonin as a hypnotic and chronobiotic&#xD;
                agent makes its agonists good candidates for the induction of physiological sleep&#xD;
                (in cases of insomnia and circadian rhythm alterations). They could also treat&#xD;
                comorbid insomnia while having positive effects on a wide range of neurological,&#xD;
                psychiatric, metabolic and cardiovascular disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Melatonin is perhaps one of the best approaches to sleep disorders, since it treats not&#xD;
           only wake/sleep disorders, but also regulates the physiological rhythms, allowing for a&#xD;
           better synchronized internal clock. It could be considered as a &quot;soft and natural&quot;&#xD;
           treatment since it mimics the effects of a molecule which is already present in the&#xD;
           human body.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.5. Pharmacogenetic of chronodisruption and its pharmacological treatment A certain&#xD;
           number of well studied genes seem to be important to initiate and maintain the circadian&#xD;
           rhythm, such as the CLOCK gene (Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput) which codes for&#xD;
           proteins affecting the persistence and length of a circadian cycle; BMAL1 (Brain and&#xD;
           Muscle AryL hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like) which is a transcription&#xD;
           factor; PER1, PER2 and PER3 which are negative elements in the circadian transcription&#xD;
           cycle, interacting with other regulator proteins by transporting them into the nucleus;&#xD;
           CRY1 and CRY2 (CRYptochromes) which are also negative elements that inhibit the&#xD;
           CLOCK-mediated transcription; and the orphan nuclear receptor RevErbA which plays an&#xD;
           important role in the regulation of CLOCK and BMAL1's expression. The variations in the&#xD;
           expression of all these genes can lead to variations in physiological functions and&#xD;
           sleep architecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.6. Conclusion To this day, a small number of studies have evaluated the effect of&#xD;
           melatonin on the modifications of the characteristics of sleep in critical care units,&#xD;
           with mostly a small studied population. However, no study has been realized on a large&#xD;
           population, nor has it evaluated the association between genetic factors and response to&#xD;
           treatment, hence the originality of our study.&#xD;
