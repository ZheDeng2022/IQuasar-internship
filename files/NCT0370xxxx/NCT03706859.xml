  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumatic tourniquets are widely used not only to reduce blood loss and to ensure optimal&#xD;
      operating conditions during extremity surgery, but also in regional anesthesia (local&#xD;
      intravenous) vein puncture and to control life or limb threatening conditions. However,&#xD;
      compression of the tissues under a tourniquet is associated with soft tissue damage involving&#xD;
      the skin, vessels, muscles, and most importantly, nerves, and are commonly pressure related&#xD;
      and can be affected by tourniquet time as well. Therefore, the &quot;minimal tourniquet inflation&#xD;
      pressure&quot; necessary to provide a bloodless field has been suggested to minimize the risk of&#xD;
      complications from excessive inflation pressure. Arterial occlusion pressure (AOP) is the&#xD;
      lowest pneumatic tourniquet inflation pressure required to stop the arterial blood flow into&#xD;
      the limb, and its usage has been shown to be useful in optimizing tourniquet cuff pressures.&#xD;
      The pressure to which a pneumatic tourniquet cuff should be inflated depends on a number of&#xD;
      variables, including the patient's age, skin, blood pressure and the shape and size of the&#xD;
      extremity in question, as well as the dimensions of the cuff. One of the estimation method&#xD;
      for AOP is based on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and tissue padding coefficient (KTP) values&#xD;
      (AOP=[SBP+10]/KTP) according to extremity circumferences. Unver B. et al., used this method&#xD;
      to estimate effective tourniquet pressure in total knee replacement under hypotensive general&#xD;
      anesthesia tourniquet pressure achieved was 169.7±7.9 mmHg, while Tuncali et al., tested it&#xD;
      again in different lower limb surgeries under general or neuraxial anesthesia with&#xD;
      normotensive techniques and the achieved maximal tourniquet pressures used was 173.3±15.6&#xD;
      mmHg. Hong-yun Liu et al., established a new occlusion pressure mathematical model for the&#xD;
      upper limb based on the correlation analysis between several possible influencing parameters&#xD;
      and the minimal pneumatic tourniquet pressure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After ethical committee approval and informed consent from the patients, 80 adult patients&#xD;
      18-40 years old, (ASA I-II), scheduled for knee arthroscopy under general anesthesia with&#xD;
      pneumatic tourniquet around the thigh, will be randomly allocated (using closed opaque&#xD;
      envelop) into one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group (A): where the pneumatic tourniquet inflated 20 mmHg above the arterial occlusion&#xD;
           pressure which will be estimated using the equation of Unver B. et al., [1]:&#xD;
           (AOP=[SBP+10]/KTP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group (B): where the pneumatic tourniquet inflated 20 mmHg above the arterial occlusion&#xD;
           pressure which will be estimated using the equation of Hong-yun Liu et al., [2]: (AOP =&#xD;
           17.986 + 3.158X1 + 0.408X2) Patients will be excluded from the study if they are outside&#xD;
           the age range, hypertensive, diabetic, complaining of any lower limb claudications, any&#xD;
           vascular disease, hemolytic blood disorders or hypercoagulability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival to the operating room, standard monitoring will be attached (5 lead ECG, pulse&#xD;
      oximeter and non-invasive blood pressure) followed by a wide-bore canula will be inserted a&#xD;
      big vein in the upper limb. General anesthesia will be induced using fentanyl 1 mcg/kg and&#xD;
      propofol 2-3 mg/kg laryngeal mask airway device will be inserted after atracurium 0.5 mg/kg&#xD;
      and lungs will be mechanically ventilated to maintain end-tidal CO2 at 36-40 mmHg and&#xD;
      maintenance of anesthesia will be achieved using isoflurane 1-2 volume %. Hemodynamic&#xD;
      stabilization will be assured and systolic blood pressure will be maintained within the&#xD;
      pre-induction values ± 20% using intravenous fluid infusion and titration of inhalational&#xD;
      anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, the thigh circumference will be measured 20 cm proximal to the superior pole&#xD;
      of the patella then, pneumatic the tourniquet cuff will be placed (deflated) around the thigh&#xD;
      with the distal edge 15 cm proximal to the proximal pole of the patella. The tissue padding&#xD;
      coefficients based on limb circumferences will be calculated in all patients of group (A)&#xD;
      according to table (1) [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      After three successive stable systolic blood pressure reading (5 minutes apart), an initial&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure [initial SBP] reading will take and estimated arterial occlusion&#xD;
      pressure (AOP) will be quickly calculated according to one of the previously mentioned&#xD;
      equation followed limb exsanguination using an Esmarch bandage, then the tourniquet cuff will&#xD;
      be inflated to a safety margin pressure 20 mmHg above the calculated (AOP) [3] which will be&#xD;
      the [initial tourniquet pressure]. The time between the initial SBP taking and tourniquet&#xD;
      inflation will be measured [initial SBP-to- tourniquet inflation time]. The absence of&#xD;
      arterial flow in the lower limb is assured using Doppler probe (HD, Philips) positioned, by&#xD;
      an independent anesthetist, at either the dorsalis pedis artery or the posterior tibial&#xD;
      artery on the foot to monitor arterial flow distal to the tourniquet. If any arterial flow&#xD;
      sound will be heard, the estimated tourniquet pressure will be considered insufficient and&#xD;
      the patient will excluded from the study. When no arterial blood flow is secured, the surgeon&#xD;
      (blinded to the groups) will allowed to start and will be asked to rate the bloodless&#xD;
      surgical field using a 4-point scale [1 (Excellent) = No blood in the surgical field, 2&#xD;
      (Good) = Some blood in the surgical field but no interference with surgery, 3 (Fair) = Blood&#xD;
      in the surgical field but no significant interference with surgery, 4 (Poor) = Blood in the&#xD;
      surgical field obscures the view] [3] at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the&#xD;
      surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the surgery, systolic blood pressure will be measured every 5 minutes and the&#xD;
      tourniquet inflation pressure will be always kept 20 mmHg above the SBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure and anesthetic management were performed by the same surgical and&#xD;
      anesthesia teams respectively. The attending anesthesiologist was aware of the allocated&#xD;
      group, but the data analyst, surgeon and the patients were blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be examined one day after surgery for any complications associated with&#xD;
      the tourniquet, (e.g. tissue damage, nerve palsy, lower limb blood flow).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's age, weight and gender and lower limb circumference?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Operative duration and tourniquet time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial SBP-to- tourniquet inflation time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary outcome: initial and maximal SBP, initial and maximum tourniquet inflation&#xD;
           pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary outcome: surgeon rating of the bloodlessness of the surgical field.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any tourniquet associated complications.&#xD;
