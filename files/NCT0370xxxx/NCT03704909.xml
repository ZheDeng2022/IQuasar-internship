  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia is the gold standard technique for elective cesarean section. It helps to&#xD;
      avoid risks regarding airway management and provides effective neuraxial postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia, enabling quicker maternal recovery. Cesarean section normally require an&#xD;
      anesthetic block at T4 level. So that maternal hypotension is reported to occur in up to 80%.&#xD;
      This can result in significant morbidity for both the mother and fetus.The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine if epinephrine is as effective and safe compared to ephedrine for&#xD;
      maintaining arterial blood pressure during elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.&#xD;
      All participants will receive spinal anesthesia with a local anesthetic and sufentanil. This&#xD;
      study plans to enroll 140 healthy pregnant women. Patients will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      according to a computer generated system to be in one of two groups.&#xD;

      Its a prospective double-blinded controlled trial. All participants gave a written informed&#xD;
      consent. One hundred and twenty healthy women, ASA II, with singleton pregnancies at term&#xD;
      scheduled for elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia are targeted for the study.&#xD;
      They are randomized to receive either epinephrine or ephedrine. Upon arrival in the operating&#xD;
      room, parturient was placed in the supine position with 15° left lateral tilt with routine&#xD;
      monitoring (HR, non-invasive BP, pulse oximetry, electrocardiography). Baseline BP and HR&#xD;
      were computed as the mean of three consecutive BP and HR readings respectively at 1-minute&#xD;
      intervals. Study participants will receive a standard spinal anesthetic consisting of 0.5%&#xD;
      hyperbaric bupivacaine (2 mL) plus sufentanil (5 µg) at L3-4 vertebral interspace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (for adrenaline group): received a prophylactic intravenous (i.v) bolus of&#xD;
      Epinephrine 0.15µg/Kg at time of SA. In this group, rescue boluses of Epinephrine 0.15µg/Kg,&#xD;
      were given if maternal BP decreased more than 20% from the baseline value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group E (for ephedrine group): received a prophylactic i.v bolus of Ephedrine 0.1mg/Kg at&#xD;
      time of SA. In this group, rescue boluses of Ephedrine 0.1mg/Kg, were given if maternal BP&#xD;
      decreased more than 20% from the baseline value. Once the spinal injection was performed a&#xD;
      rapid intravenous (i.v.) coload with 15mL/Kg of isotonic saline solution was started through&#xD;
      a 16 G i.v. cannula (by turning the i.v. infusion to maximum and using a pressure bag&#xD;
      inflated to 150 mmHg). A prophylactic bolus of vasopressor was administered at the end of&#xD;
      spinal injection. After performing anesthesia, the parturient was immediately replaced in the&#xD;
      supine position with a 15° left lateral table tilt until delivery of the infant. Prior to&#xD;
      surgical incision, the spinal sensory level will be tested to the bilateral T6-T4 dermatomal&#xD;
      level. Sensory block level was checked by cold-hot test and the Modified Bromage Scale was&#xD;
      used for the assessment of motor block. The surgery was allowed when the sensory block level&#xD;
      reached D4. Both the patient and the researcher's assistant (who will collect data) will be&#xD;
      blinded as to the administered Epinephrine or Ephedrine bolus. Supplemental oxygen will be&#xD;
      given only when the pulse oximeter reading decreased below 95%. After delivery, 5 IU of&#xD;
      oxytocin diluted in 20 ml of isotonic saline solution were slowly injected over 1 minute.&#xD;
      Then an i.v infusion was given (10 IU/500ml of isotonic saline solution at a flow rate of 28&#xD;
      drops/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate (beats/min), systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) will be recorded&#xD;
      every 1 min after spinal injection until the end of surgery. The incidence of hypotension&#xD;
      (defined as a reduction in SBP of &gt;20% from baseline determined just before the&#xD;
      administration of spinal anesthesia) will be recorded. Reactive hypertension (defined as a&#xD;
      rise of SBP &gt;20% of baseline) will also be recorded. Bradycardia (defined as HR &lt;50&#xD;
      beats/min) will be recorded. Tachycardia (defined as a HR &gt;140 beats/min) will also be&#xD;
      recorded. Umbilical blood samples will be obtained by clamping it on both sides and a gas&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to determine fetal pH, HCO3-, base excess and lactates.&#xD;
      Furthermore, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes after delivery will be recorded by the attending&#xD;
      pediatrician, who will be unaware of the vasopressor used. The study will end when cesarean&#xD;
      section is completed and the patient is transferred to the post-operative care unit.&#xD;
