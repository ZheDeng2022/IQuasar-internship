  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Volume expansion is the cornerstone of hemodynamic management of patients suffering from&#xD;
      circulatory failure. The main objective of volume expansion is to increase stroke volume.&#xD;
      This increase in stroke volume is due to myocardial contractility improvement. Nowadays, this&#xD;
      improvement cannot be assessed using classical monitoring used at the bedside. The main&#xD;
      objective of this study is to evaluate left ventricular contractility using Speckle-Tracking&#xD;
      before and after volume expansion in intensive care unit patients, to determine if this&#xD;
      technology is more sensitive than previous for left ventricular contractility assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of volume expansion is to increase stroke volume. Frank-Starling curve is&#xD;
      schematically divided into two portions: a vertical portion which mean that an increase in&#xD;
      preload secondary to volume expansion will induce an increase in stroke volume; and a flat&#xD;
      portion which mean that a same increase in preload will not induce an increase in stroke&#xD;
      volume. Stroke volume increase is due to a myocardial contractility improvement. Nowadays&#xD;
      this improvement cannot be assessed using classical monitoring used at the bedside (left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction, fractional area changes, etc â€¦). A new method is available to&#xD;
      assess left ventricular contractility at the bedside. Two-dimensional speckle tracking images&#xD;
      with echocardiography allows one to track a natural myocardial marker within the myocardium&#xD;
      by standard transthoracic echocardiography. It provides unique insights into myocardial&#xD;
      function such as tissue deformations and strain rate, which is the rate of deformation. This&#xD;
      method is more sensitive than classical echographic left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
      evaluation. Few data are available about the potential interest of speckle tracking to track&#xD;
      an improvement of left ventricular contractility following a volume expansion in intensive&#xD;
      care unit patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is observational, prospective in one center. Patients needing a volume expansion&#xD;
      will benefit from an echocardiography (stroke volume and longitudinal strain assessment)&#xD;
      before and after fluid challenge (500mL of crystalloids).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow up will be restricted to the duration of volume expansion. The last data will be&#xD;
      collected just after the end of volume expansion.&#xD;

    <description>It is calculated using values of longitudinal strain measured in the three-,four-, and two-chamber of the left ventricle of the heart. GLS is expressed as percentage. Strain is a measure of myocardial muscle fiber shortening during contraction and is calculated as the systolic segment shortening between end-systolic (ES) segment length (L) and end-diastolic (ED) length: strain = (-LES - LED)/LED x 100 %.</description>
