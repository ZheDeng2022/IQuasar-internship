  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of risankizumab for the&#xD;
      treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults and adolescents.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study includes a screening period of up to 35 days, a 16-week double-blind treatment&#xD;
      period (Period A), and a 36-week double-blind treatment period (Period B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized at Baseline in a 2:2:1 ratio to&#xD;
      one of 3 treatment groups: (1) risankizumab 150 mg, (2) risankizumab 300 mg, or (3) matching&#xD;
      placebo. Randomization will be stratified by Baseline disease severity (Validated&#xD;
      Investigator Global Assessment scale for Atopic Dermatitis [vIGA-AD] score of moderate [3]&#xD;
      versus severe [4]) and geographic region (Japan versus rest of world).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 16, participants in the placebo group will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive&#xD;
      either risankizumab 150 mg or 300 mg for the remainder of the study. Participants originally&#xD;
      randomized to the risankizumab 150 mg or 300 mg arms will stay on their previously-assigned&#xD;
      treatment through the end of the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving At Least a 75% Reduction From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>EASI is a tool used to measure the extent (area) and severity of atopic eczema based on assessments of the head/neck, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs. For each region the area score is recorded as the percentage of skin affected by eczema. For each region, the severity score is calculated as the sum of the intensity scores (scored as none [0], mild [1], moderate [2], or severe [3]) for redness (erythema, inflammation), thickness (induration, papulation, swelling - acute eczema), scratching (excoriation), and lichenification (lined skin, prurigo nodules - chronic eczema).&#xD;
The total EASI score for each region is calculated by multiplying the severity score by the area score, with adjustment for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The final EASI score is the sum of the 4 region scores and ranges from 0 to 72 where higher scores represent worse disease.</description>

It consists of 10 questions evaluating impact of skin diseases on different aspects of a participant's QoL over the prior week, including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and the side effects of treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale (0 = not at all/not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; and 3 = very much).&#xD;
Item scores are added to provide a total score, ranging from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater impairment of QoL.&#xD;
A change in DLQI score of at least 4 points is considered the minimum clinically important difference (MCID).</description>

    <description>The CDLQI is a 10-item, validated questionnaire used to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on QoL. The CDLQI has been validated for use in individuals 4-16 years old. It consists of 10 questions assessing impact of skin diseases on different aspects of a patient's QoL over the prior week. The CDLQI items include symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, school, relationships, sleep, and treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale (0 = not at all; 1 = only a little; 2 = quite a lot; and 3 = very much). Item scores (0 to 3) are added to provide a total score range of 0 to 30; higher scores indicate greater impairment of QoL. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.&#xD;
In this study, the CDLQI was administered to participants who were &lt; 16 years old at the Baseline visit.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Adults and adolescents with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) with onset of symptoms at least 2 years before the Baseline visit were enrolled at 50 sites in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Australia.&#xD;
The study included a 16-week double-blind treatment period (Period A) followed by a 36-week double-blind treatment period (Period B).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to risankizumab 150 mg, 300 mg, or placebo. Randomization was stratified by disease severity (Validated Investigator Global Assessment Scale for AD [vIGA-AD] moderate vs severe) and geographic region.&#xD;
At Week 16 participants in the placebo group were re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either risankizumab 150 mg or 300 mg in Period B. Participants originally randomized to risankizumab remained on their previously assigned treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score</title>
          <description>EASI measures the extent and severity of atopic eczema based on assessments of the head/neck, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs. For each region the percentage of skin affected and the severity (scored as none [0], mild [1], moderate [2], or severe [3]) for redness, thickness, scratching, and lichenification are assessed. The score for each region is calculated by multiplying the severity score by the area score, and adjusting for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The EASI score is the sum of the scores for each region and ranges from 0 to 72 (worse disease).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving At Least a 75% Reduction From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) at Week 16</title>
        <description>EASI is a tool used to measure the extent (area) and severity of atopic eczema based on assessments of the head/neck, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs. For each region the area score is recorded as the percentage of skin affected by eczema. For each region, the severity score is calculated as the sum of the intensity scores (scored as none [0], mild [1], moderate [2], or severe [3]) for redness (erythema, inflammation), thickness (induration, papulation, swelling - acute eczema), scratching (excoriation), and lichenification (lined skin, prurigo nodules - chronic eczema).&#xD;
The total EASI score for each region is calculated by multiplying the severity score by the area score, with adjustment for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The final EASI score is the sum of the 4 region scores and ranges from 0 to 72 where higher scores represent worse disease.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in EASI Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>EASI is a tool used to measure the extent (area) and severity of atopic eczema based on assessments of the head/neck, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs. For each region the area score is recorded as the percentage of skin affected by eczema. For each region, the severity score is calculated as the sum of the intensity scores (scored as none [0], mild [1], moderate [2], or severe [3]) for redness (erythema, inflammation), thickness (induration, papulation, swelling - acute eczema), scratching (excoriation), and lichenification (lined skin, prurigo nodules - chronic eczema).&#xD;
The total EASI score for each region is calculated by multiplying the severity score by the area score, with adjustment for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The final EASI score is the sum of the 4 region scores and ranges from 0 to 72 where higher scores represent worse disease; a negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <population>Intent-to-treat population; missing data were handled using a mixed-effect model with repeated measurements (MMRM). The overall number of participants analyzed is based on the number of participants with non-missing Baseline and Week 16 values.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an EASI 75 Response at Week 28 and Week 52</title>
        <description>EASI is a tool used to measure the extent (area) and severity of atopic eczema based on assessments of the head/neck, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs. For each region the area score is recorded as the percentage of skin affected by eczema. For each region, the severity score is calculated as the sum of the intensity scores (scored as none [0], mild [1], moderate [2], or severe [3]) for redness (erythema, inflammation), thickness (induration, papulation, swelling - acute eczema), scratching (excoriation), and lichenification (lined skin, prurigo nodules - chronic eczema).&#xD;
The total EASI score for each region is calculated by multiplying the severity score by the area score, with adjustment for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The final EASI score is the sum of the 4 region scores and ranges from 0 to 72 where higher scores represent worse disease.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an EASI 90 Response at Week 16</title>
        <description>EASI is a tool used to measure the extent (area) and severity of atopic eczema based on assessments of the head/neck, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs. For each region the area score is recorded as the percentage of skin affected by eczema. For each region, the severity score is calculated as the sum of the intensity scores (scored as none [0], mild [1], moderate [2], or severe [3]) for redness (erythema, inflammation), thickness (induration, papulation, swelling - acute eczema), scratching (excoriation), and lichenification (lined skin, prurigo nodules - chronic eczema).&#xD;
The total EASI score for each region is calculated by multiplying the severity score by the area score, with adjustment for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The final EASI score is the sum of the 4 region scores and ranges from 0 to 72 where higher scores represent worse disease.&#xD;
An EASI 90 response is defined as at least a 90% reduction (improvement) from Baseline in EASI score.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a 50% Improvement in SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) Score (SCORAD 50) at Week 16</title>
        <description>SCORAD is a clinical tool used to assess the extent and severity of eczema (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis). The extent is assessed using the rule of 9 to calculate the affected area (A) as a percentage of the whole body (0-100%). The intensity part of the SCORAD (B) consists of 6 items: erythema, oedema/papulation, excoriations, lichenification, oozing/crusts and dryness, each graded on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), for a total score of 0 to 18.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a SCORAD 75 Response at Week 28 and Week 52</title>
        <description>SCORAD is a clinical tool used to assess the extent and severity of eczema (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis). The extent is assessed using the rule of 9 to calculate the affected area (A) as a percentage of the whole body (0-100%). The intensity part of the SCORAD (B) consists of 6 items: erythema, oedema/papulation, excoriations, lichenification, oozing/crusts and dryness, each graded on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), for a total score of 0 to 18. Subjective items (C) include daily pruritus and sleeplessness, each scored on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 10 (total score 0-20). SCORAD is calculated as A/5 + 7B/2 + C, and ranges from 0 to 103 (worst).&#xD;
A SCORAD 75 response is defined as at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from Baseline in SCORAD score.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a 10-item validated questionnaire used to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on quality of life (QoL). It consists of 10 questions evaluating impact of skin diseases on different aspects of a participant's QoL over the prior week, including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and the side effects of treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale (0 = not at all/not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; and 3 = very much).&#xD;
Item scores are added to provide a total score, ranging from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater impairment of QoL. A score of 0 or 1 means that the disease has no effect at all.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a CDLQI Score of &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; at Week 28 and Week 52</title>
        <description>The CDLQI is a 10-item, validated questionnaire used to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on QoL. The CDLQI has been validated for use in individuals 4-16 years old. It consists of 10 questions assessing impact of skin diseases on different aspects of a patient's QoL over the prior week. The CDLQI items include symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, school, relationships, sleep, and treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale (0 = not at all; 1 = only a little; 2 = quite a lot; and 3 = very much). Item scores (0 to 3) are added to provide a total score range of 0 to 30; higher scores indicate greater impairment of QoL. A score of 0 or 1 means that the disease has no effect at all.&#xD;
In this study, the CDLQI was administered to participants who were &lt; 16 years old at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in DLQI Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a 10-item validated questionnaire used to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on quality of life (QoL). It consists of 10 questions evaluating impact of skin diseases on different aspects of a participant's QoL over the prior week, including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and the side effects of treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale (0 = not at all/not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; and 3 = very much).&#xD;
Item scores are added to provide a total score, ranging from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater impairment of QoL. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in CDLQI Score at Week 28 and Week 52</title>
          <description>The CDLQI is a 10-item, validated questionnaire used to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on QoL. The CDLQI has been validated for use in individuals 4-16 years old. It consists of 10 questions assessing impact of skin diseases on different aspects of a patient's QoL over the prior week. The CDLQI items include symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, school, relationships, sleep, and treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale (0 = not at all; 1 = only a little; 2 = quite a lot; and 3 = very much). Item scores (0 to 3) are added to provide a total score range of 0 to 30; higher scores indicate greater impairment of QoL. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.&#xD;
In this study, the CDLQI was administered to participants who were &lt; 16 years old at the Baseline visit.&#xD;
LS means were calculated from ANCOVA with Baseline and treatment in the model.</description>
