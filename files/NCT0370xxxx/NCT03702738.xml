    <textblock>
      To determine if adjunctive N-acetylcysteine 1200 mg twice a day (BID) accelerates sputum&#xD;
      culture conversion and normalization of cellular glutathione in tuberculosis (TB), and to&#xD;
      assess its potential effects on lung and immune function&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled, 2-arm, parallel group substudy of the TB-SEQUEL cohort&#xD;
      study. It will enrol drug sensitive TB patients with moderately advanced or far advanced&#xD;
      pulmonary disease by chest X-ray. Patients providing informed consent will undergo screening&#xD;
      evaluations to establish eligibility. Patients meeting all the inclusion and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive standard TB treatment (2HRZE/4HR) plus NAC&#xD;
      1200 mg BID for months 1-4, or standard treatment alone. During the treatment period patients&#xD;
      will undergo safety, efficacy, and biomarker assessments at specified time points. After a&#xD;
      final evaluation at 6 months, patients will continue follow-up as a part of the main&#xD;
      TB-SEQUEL cohort study.&#xD;
