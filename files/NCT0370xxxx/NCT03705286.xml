  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking at two different types of breathing tubes to see if one is better&#xD;
      than the other at preventing pneumonia. One of the tubes has a design features to prevent&#xD;
      leakage of fluids from the mouth and the back of the throat into the lower airways and lungs.&#xD;
      This is important since leakage of small amounts of fluid into the lungs may lead to&#xD;
      pneumonia. The other tube is the standard tube used at most hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the use of a breathing tube that reduces fluid leakage into the lungs&#xD;
      will reduce the risk of developing pneumonia and improve quality of life and cognitive&#xD;
      function, compared to the standard tube. The study will also look at the safety of the&#xD;
      modified breathing tube, compared to the standard tube.&#xD;

      The proposed study will be a randomized, controlled trial, conducted under Exception From&#xD;
      Informed Consent (EFIC), comparing patients who undergo emergency tracheal intubation with&#xD;
      one of two different endotracheal tubes (ETTs), one of which is designed to prevent&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): 1) An ETT fitted with a lumen to allow continuous&#xD;
      aspiration of subglottic secretions and made with a polyurethane cuff (EVAC-PU-ETT); and 2) A&#xD;
      standard ETT with a polyvinylchloride cuff (PVC-ETT). Approximately 1,074 adult patients&#xD;
      requiring endotracheal intubation in the ED or hospital for acute respiratory distress or&#xD;
      failure will be randomly assigned in an equal fashion to be intubated with one of the two&#xD;
      ETTs (537 patients in each group). Because endotracheal intubation is performed in an&#xD;
      emergency setting, the unit of randomization will be the intubation kits containing, in a&#xD;
      concealed manner, one of the two types of ETT. The intubation kits are placed in areas where&#xD;
      emergency intubation teams receive their intubation equipment supplies, primarily in the ICUs&#xD;
      and in the emergency department. The study is designed to allow all patients requiring&#xD;
      emergency intubation to be potentially eligible for enrollment to ensure the applicability of&#xD;
      the study findings to a generalizable setting of patients receiving emergency intubation&#xD;
      outside the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial primary aim is to determine if EVAC-PU-ETT is as safe as PVC-ETT and if long-term&#xD;
      patient quality of life and cognitive function are better in PU-CASS-ETT, compared with&#xD;
      PVC-ETT. The investigators will also monitor any device-related adverse events. Additional&#xD;
      secondary endpoints include the incidence of infection-related ventilator associated&#xD;
      conditions (IVAC) and ventilator associated events (VAEs), as defined by the Center for&#xD;
      Disease Control, respiratory antibiotics use, incidence of &quot;clinical&quot; VAP, 28-day&#xD;
      ventilator-free days, mean daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, length of&#xD;
      ICU and hospital stay, and mortality up to six months will serve to evaluate other clinical&#xD;
      meaningful consequences resulting from the occurrence of VAP. Furthermore, the study will&#xD;
      perform economic evaluation (cost-consequence approach) of quality of life, healthcare&#xD;
      resource utilization and cost for hospitals. Primary and secondary endpoints will be compared&#xD;
      between the PU-CASS-ETT and PVC-ETT groups, using an intention-to-treat approach.&#xD;
