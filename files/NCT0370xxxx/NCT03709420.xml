    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase I/Ib study which will assess&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, food effect, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of FOR-6219, a&#xD;
      hydroxysteroid (17B) dehydrogenase (HSD17B1) inhibitor. The study will be performed in three&#xD;
      parts: (I) Single ascending doses (SAD) in healthy post-menopausal women; (II) multiple&#xD;
      ascending doses (MAD) in post-menopausal women; (III) multiple ascending doses in healthy&#xD;
