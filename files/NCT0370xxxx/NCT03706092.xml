  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to optimize drug prescription and to reduce potentially inappropriate medications, a&#xD;
      pharmaceutical analysis activity is conducted in our establishment for several years. Medical&#xD;
      prescriptions are reviewed daily by pharmacists. This activity is developed in&#xD;
      approximatively 84% of the hospital wards of the institution, and especially in the geriatric&#xD;
      department. Drug induced adverse effects are frequently encountered in elderly people and ICU&#xD;
      environment causes a high risk of iatrogenic events because of the complexity of care and of&#xD;
      the severity of illness. The hypothesis of the study is that the intervention of pharmacists&#xD;
      and geriatricians could improve the medical prescription in elderly patients by reducing&#xD;
      avoidable drug interactions and thus by decreasing the risk of drug induced adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the intervention of&#xD;
      pharmacists and geriatricians on medical prescription and on iatrogenic risk in elderly&#xD;
      critically ill patients admitted in surgical ICU. The secondary objectives are (i) to&#xD;
      describe the elderly patients population in surgical ICU, (ii) to analyze the impact of the&#xD;
      ICU stay on medical prescription, (iii) to analyze the opportunities suggested by the&#xD;
      pharmacists to optimize drug therapies and (iv) to assess the impact of drug prescription in&#xD;
      the ICU on long-term disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, observational, before-after study will be conducted from august 1, 2018 to&#xD;
      February 1, 2020, in the surgical ICU of the hospital. Patients older than 70 years and&#xD;
      admitted to surgical ICU will be eligible. This study will be conducted in 2 successive&#xD;
      steps: (1) first step: without any intervention of pharmacists or and geriatricians&#xD;
      (Baseline), (2) second step: all drug prescription during the ICU and the hospital stay will&#xD;
      be analyzed by a pharmacist and a geriatrician, to decrease drug interaction and risk of drug&#xD;
      related adverse effect. During each step, the demographic and medical data will be recorded.&#xD;
      Medical prescriptions will be reviewed at ICU admission, at 96 hours after ICU admission and&#xD;
      then every 4 days until discharge from the ICU. For each patient, the impact of the&#xD;
      intervention on mid-term and long-term disability will be assessed during a geriatric&#xD;
      evaluation by using adequate specific scale at hospital discharge and at 3 months after&#xD;
      hospital discharge. All iatrogenic events will be collected and analyzed.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the intervention of pharmacists and&#xD;
      geriatricians on medical prescription and on the iatrogenic risk in elderly critically ill&#xD;
      patients admitted in surgical ICU. This study is before-after prospective study, carried out&#xD;
      in 2 steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1 data collection from August 1, 2018 to February 1, 2019&#xD;
&#xD;
      This step is a prospective analysis without any intervention of the pharmacist and of the&#xD;
      geriatrician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The sociodemographic, and medical (comorbidities, reason for ICU admission, SAPS II&#xD;
           (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) and SOFA (Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment)&#xD;
           scores, laboratory data, invasive procedures data will be collected from ICU medical&#xD;
           record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A geriatric evaluation and disability evaluation will be performed by using the ADL&#xD;
           (Activity of Daily Living), Charlson, and SEGA (Short Emergency Geriatric Assessment)&#xD;
           scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The medical prescriptions will be reviewed at the first day and at 96 hours after&#xD;
           admission in the ICU, and every 4 days during ICU stay. The pharmacist will analyse the&#xD;
           medical prescriptions by using a standardized tool (Micromedex®, Theriaque®, Vidal®), to&#xD;
           identify inappropriate prescription, and to assess the iatrogenic risks. These&#xD;
           interventions will be quantified by using the SFPC Scale (French Society of clinical&#xD;
           pharmacy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Iatrogenic events will be reported and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug prescription and patient outcome at discharge from the ICU and at discharge from&#xD;
           the hospital will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 3 months from discharge from the hospital, a new geriatric evaluation will be&#xD;
           conducted (patient's outcome and medical prescription).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2, from March 1, 2019 to March, 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This step is a prospective analysis with the intervention of the pharmacist and of the&#xD;
      geriatrician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same data that step 1 will be collected. During this step, the pharmacist carries&#xD;
      individualized interventions that will be discuss with the physician in charge of the patient&#xD;
      to improve the safety of drug prescription. The physician will be allowed to accept or to&#xD;
      refuse these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 months from discharge from the hospital, a consultation with geriatrician will be&#xD;
      proposed to the elderly patient. The geriatric evaluation and disability assessment will be&#xD;
      conducted during this consultation.&#xD;
