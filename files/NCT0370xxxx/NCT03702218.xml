  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite many efforts to increase the size of the donor pool, there is a large and growing&#xD;
      disparity between the number of donor kidneys and livers available for transplantation and&#xD;
      the number of patients on the transplant waiting list. New donor pools are needed to satisfy&#xD;
      the lack of available donor organs, along with expanded criteria for the existing donor&#xD;
      pools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new standard of care now exists at most local and regional transplant centers. This new&#xD;
      standard of care is based on the use of multiple direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for&#xD;
      treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) that have been approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hepatitis C and are associated with high HCV cure&#xD;
      rates and minimal side effect profiles. The efficacy and tolerability of these medications&#xD;
      has allowed the expansion of the available donor pool by making HCV antibody positive non&#xD;
      viremic organs and HCV-viremic organs (when HCV is detectable in the blood) available to&#xD;
      HCV-naive recipients on the organ transplantation waiting list. Expansion of this donor pool&#xD;
      may decrease time on the waiting list and improve quality of life and survival while waiting&#xD;
      for organ transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a clinical protocol to utilize solid organs from exposed and/or HCV-viremic organ&#xD;
      donors for transplantation into HCV negative recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the clinical protocol is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collect prospective standard of care laboratory data on the results of these interventions&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once the donor is accepted for transplantation and the recipient enrolled in the innovative&#xD;
      clinical practice, donor HCV Ab status will be requested to initiate HCV RNA viral load&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor data will be recorded as per our standard practice and as mandated by UNOS. Our&#xD;
      University of Maryland Medical Center team will be responsible for the donor operation as per&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hep C Ab + NAT - Donor to Naïve Recipient This group will be monitored as illustrated in&#xD;
      figure 1. Hep C Ab+ NAT+ Donor to Naïve Recipient HCV RNA levels, liver biochemistries, and&#xD;
      renal function will be measured 3 days after transplant. HCV Genotype will be determined&#xD;
      after HCV RNA is &gt;1,000 IU/mL. HCV RNA levels will be measured weekly after transplant until&#xD;
      HCV treatment is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to risk of HBV reactivation with DAA therapy, Hepatitis B surface antigen, surface&#xD;
      antibody and core antibody status will be determined prior to HCV therapy. In patients with a&#xD;
      prior exposure to HBV (i.e. positive HBV core antibody), Hepatitis B surface antigen levels&#xD;
      will be monitored throughout therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be seen in the Hepatology clinic within 4 weeks of transplant to establish&#xD;
      care and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCV Therapy DAA therapy will be prescribed to all patients according to AASLD and IDSA joint&#xD;
      guidelines, after giving consideration to the transplanted organ, renal function, and HCV&#xD;
      genotype. All regimens exclude administration of ribavirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy will be initiated as soon as possible (pending initiation of oral intake and&#xD;
      insurance approval) following organ transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAAs will be prescribed, after which medications will then be delivered to the patient's home&#xD;
      or to the bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If therapy is delayed beyond the 4-week appointment with Hepatology post-transplant, a&#xD;
      protocol to monitor for infection, new-onset diabetes mellitus, glomerulonephritis and severe&#xD;
      cholestatic hepatitis will be implemented. This protocol will include weekly blood work to&#xD;
      include: CBC with differential, hepatic function panel, basic metabolic panel, and&#xD;
      coagulation studies.&#xD;

           blood count (CBC) and liver biochemistries will be checked 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12&#xD;
           weeks after starting therapy. In patients previously exposed to HBV, HBV surface antigen&#xD;
           will be followed qualitatively at the same intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCV RNA will also be checked 12 weeks after completion of therapy to define cure, or&#xD;
      sustained virologic response. As part of long-term follow-up, HCV RNA will be checked&#xD;
      annually at routine post-transplant visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If SVR is not achieved, a second, and if needed, third antiviral regimen will be provided to&#xD;
      the participant at no cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplant, Post-Operative, Immunosuppression Follow Up All will be as per UMMC standard of&#xD;
      care. Unless otherwise contraindicated, tacrolimus immune suppression will be favored, due to&#xD;
      drug-drug interactions associated with DATs and cyclosporine.&#xD;
