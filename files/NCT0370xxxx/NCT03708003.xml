    <textblock>
      Venetoclax and ibrutinib have complementary activity in clearing the disease across&#xD;
      anatomical compartments. By combining ibrutinib with venetoclax, cells can be mobilized from&#xD;
      tissues into the bloodstream by ibrutinib and killed in the blood by venetoclax.&#xD;
      Consistently, the venetoclax-ibrutinib combination can achieve undetectable minimal residual&#xD;
      disease (MRD-neg) in a sizable proportion of patients. Gentle debulking obtained with a&#xD;
      lead-in phase of ibrutinib monotherapy may allow starting venetoclax when the disease has&#xD;
      been reshaped in a size that fits for low-risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a rare adverse&#xD;
      event (AE) of venetoclax. MRD-guided treatment duration may allow patients achieving a&#xD;
      negative status to gain drug-free intervals and less medicalization, and may avoid all the&#xD;
      potential, and not yet completely known implications of continuous therapy on long-term&#xD;
      safety, drug interactions, quality of life, compliance to treatment, and economic&#xD;
      sustainability.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (RR CLL) has substantially changed. Current standard for patients with a&#xD;
      relapse later than 3 years from first-line therapy is a repetition with the first-line&#xD;
      regimen used. This poses the risk of significant immunosuppression and infectious&#xD;
      complications as well as a shorter event-free survival as expected for first-line treatment.&#xD;
      Current standard for patients with refractory disease, early relapse or emerging TP53&#xD;
      defective clones, is a targeted treatment with ibrutinib, idelalisib + rituximab or&#xD;
      venetoclax as continuous therapy until progression or toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax and ibrutinib are both oral drugs whose tolerability when used in combination is&#xD;
      not inferior to single agents. Venetoclax and ibrutinib have complementary activity in&#xD;
      clearing the disease across anatomical compartments. Ibrutinib is more active in lymph nodes&#xD;
      rather than blood where a small lymphocytosis might persist despite continuous treatment.&#xD;
      Conversely, venetoclax appears to be more active in blood and bone marrow (BM) rather than&#xD;
      lymph nodes. By combining ibrutinib with venetoclax, cells can be mobilized from tissues into&#xD;
      the bloodstream by ibrutinib and killed in the blood by venetoclax. Consistently, the&#xD;
      venetoclax-ibrutinib combination can achieve undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD-neg)&#xD;
      in a sizable proportion of patients. Gentle debulking obtained with a lead-in phase of&#xD;
      ibrutinib monotherapy may allow starting venetoclax when the disease has been reshaped in a&#xD;
      size that fits for low-risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a rare adverse event (AE) of&#xD;
      venetoclax. MRD-guided treatment duration may allow patients achieving a negative status to&#xD;
      gain drug-free intervals and less medicalization, and may avoid all the potential, and not&#xD;
      yet completely known implications of continuous therapy on long-term safety, drug&#xD;
      interactions, quality of life, compliance to treatment, and economic sustainability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the trial is to assess efficacy after 30 cycles of trial treatment.&#xD;
