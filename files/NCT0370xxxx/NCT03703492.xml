      This prospective, one-arm study which will enroll participants with biopsy-proven DCIS&#xD;
      scheduled for diagnostic breast MRI for preoperative staging/extent of disease evaluation as&#xD;
      part of standard of care. Eligible participants will be consented for participation in the&#xD;
      research study which includes a directed breast PET/MRI with 18F-FES. 18F-FES uptake of the&#xD;
      known malignancy will be measured on the PET/MRI examination using standardized uptake values&#xD;
      (SUV) and tumor-to-normal tissue ratios.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Integrated whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      scanners have recently been introduced for clinical use. This technology combines the&#xD;
      anatomic and perfusion data obtained with Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI with functional&#xD;
      imaging data obtained from PET. For breast imaging, the combination of MRI and PET has&#xD;
      important potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and provide molecular characterization of&#xD;
      breast cancer. The overall purpose of this research is to assess the analytic validity of&#xD;
      simultaneous breast DCE MRI with 18F-FES PET for measuring estrogen receptor (ER) in patients&#xD;
      with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and identifying patients with low-risk of disease&#xD;
      recurrence. The hypothesis is that quantitative 18F-FES uptake parameters from PET/MRI will&#xD;
      correlate well with the ER immunohistochemistry score and with low-risk recurrence scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective 1) To compare quantitative 18F-FES uptake of biopsy-proven DCIS measured&#xD;
      using PET/MRI with ER protein levels determined by immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the optimal cut-point 18F-FES uptake value for distinguishing between ER+&#xD;
           and ER-negative DCIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the test-retest reproducibility of quantitative assessment of tumor 18F-FES&#xD;
           uptake&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the optimal cut-point 18F-FES uptake value for distinguishing between&#xD;
           low-risk DCIS and intermediate/high-risk DCIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To estimate the association of quantitative 18F-FES uptake (continuous SUVmax) with&#xD;
           research-based Oncotype DX DCIS scores (0-100)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To measure the upgrade rate to invasive cancer at surgical excision&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To correlate tumor 18F-FES uptake with serum estradiol and sex hormone binding globulin&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) To correlate tumor cell density with 18F-FES uptake on PET/MRI&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>ROC curve analysis will be performed to determine the optimal cut-point for 18F-FES SUVmax to distinguish low-risk DCIS and intermediate/high-risk DCIS. Risk categories will be determined using the Van Nuys Prognostic Index, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Nomogram, and the research-based Oncotype DX DCIS score. Sensitivity and specificity will be determined with two-sided 95% confidence intervals. The AUCs for the ROCs and their respective two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be calculated using logistic regression.&#xD;
The optimal cut-off point will be determined by considering the 18F-FES uptake value with the maximum sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
This analysis will be done separately for each risk assessment model.</description>

Pearson's or Spearman's rank correlation will be used to evaluate the association between quantitative 18F-FES uptake and research-based Oncotype DX DCIS score.
