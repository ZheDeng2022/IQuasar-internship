      The overall goal of the Parkland-UT Southwestern Population-based Research Optimizing&#xD;
      Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) Center is to optimize colon cancer screening&#xD;
      through personalized regimens in the integrated safety-net clinical provider network, which&#xD;
      serves a large and diverse population of under- and un-insured patients in Dallas. Together,&#xD;
      three research projects will assess clinic, system, and organizational factors associated&#xD;
      with over-, under- and guideline-based screening among this important population and will&#xD;
      compare benefits, harms, and costs of strategies for facilitating optimized screening&#xD;
      regimens. The theme of optimizing colorectal cancer screening in a safety-net clinical&#xD;
      provider network brings together several components. Its focus on colorectal cancer (CRC)&#xD;
      screening which is important, because CRC is the second cancer killer in the US while being&#xD;
      the only major cancer for which optimized screening results in primary prevention. Despite&#xD;
      this strong potential benefit, CRC screening remains suboptimal overall, and especially among&#xD;
      low-income and minority individuals served by safety-nets. Safety-net networks therefore&#xD;
      offer tremendous potential for CRC prevention and control, but numerous factors at the&#xD;
      clinics-, system-, and organization-level influence their ability to provide optimized care.&#xD;

      Each of the Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens&#xD;
      (PROSPR) Center's projects is innovative and addresses the continuum of care. Project 1&#xD;
      addresses transitions 1 and 3, employing novel, algorithmically driven tools in clinics to&#xD;
      determine personalized optimized screening regimens for individual patients and track whether&#xD;
      each has received the indicated guideline-based screening. Project 2 addresses all three&#xD;
      transitions through a novel comparative effectiveness study of benefits, risks, and costs of&#xD;
      two outreach strategies for promoting screening completion and guideline-appropriate&#xD;
      follow-up. Project 3 addresses transitions 2 and 3 by focusing on organizational culture,&#xD;
      structure, and protocols, using both quantitative and qualitative methods to elucidate&#xD;
      factors influencing completion of effective screening processes. These projects address&#xD;
      research priorities identified through a recent National Institute of Health (NIH) State of&#xD;
      the Science Conference, including: implementing interventions proven effective at increasing&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (CRC) screening (Projects 1 &amp; 2), conducting research to assess&#xD;
      effectiveness of tailoring programs to match characteristics and preferences of target&#xD;
      populations (Project 1), implementing systems to ensure follow up of positive CRC screening&#xD;
      results (Projects 1, 2 &amp; 3), and conducting studies to determine comparative effectiveness of&#xD;
      CRC screening methods in usual practice (Project 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROSPR Center's goals are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop a Parkland-UT Southwestern PROSPR Center to promote coordinated,&#xD;
           transdisciplinary research to evaluate and improve the CRC screening process in a large&#xD;
           population-based safety-net.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct three projects that address the continuum of care for CRC screening and address&#xD;
           these goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Project 1- Employ innovative methods for assessing personalized guideline-based&#xD;
           screening in the clinic setting to evaluate guideline-based, over- and under-screening;&#xD;
           Project 2 - Compare benefits, harm, and costs of three system-level strategies for&#xD;
           inviting patients to screening and promoting guideline-based follow up, with particular&#xD;
           focus on completing an effective screening process.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Project 3 - Examine specific organizational factors that contribute to completion of&#xD;
           guideline-based screening processes and examine which organizational factors modify&#xD;
           relationships between social disadvantage and completion of guideline-based repeat&#xD;
           screening and follow up of abnormal test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Contribute to a national PROSPR network by actively participating in network activities,&#xD;
           including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. collaborating with the National Data Coordinating Center regarding approaches for&#xD;
                measuring screening effectiveness, (b) sharing algorithmically driven tools&#xD;
                facilitating personalized screening regimes, (c) sharing electronic medical record&#xD;
                (EMR) capabilities with other Epic institutions, and (d) becoming a leader in&#xD;
                cancer screening processes in safety-net systems. While the SPDU will be&#xD;
                exclusively responsible for all required PROSPR network data collection, processing&#xD;
                and transfer activities, our complementary Shared Research Resources Core (SRRC)&#xD;
                will serve as the local &quot;data coordinating center&quot; of our PROSPR center. The SRRC&#xD;
                will work with Projects 1-3 to identify patients for recruitment; track study&#xD;
                accrual; and manage, process, and analyze all Project data. The SRRC will also help&#xD;
                assure consistent data definitions and terminology for harms, benefits, and other&#xD;
                common domains across the screening process documentation unit (SPDU) and Projects.&#xD;
                The SRRC and SPDU will work closely together as much of the required SPDU screening&#xD;
                process data will be used by the SRRC to identify eligible patients for Projects&#xD;
                1-3, and ascertain the processes and outcomes of the CRC screening process for&#xD;
                study participants. An innovative activity of the SRRC will be to extract from Epic&#xD;
                a novel set of electronically derived measures of social disadvantage previously&#xD;
                developed by the Parkland Center for Innovation.27 This will empower Projects 1 and&#xD;
                2 to examine the influence of these factors on the in-reach and out-reach programs,&#xD;
                as well as provide Project 3 with critical explanatory variables to understand the&#xD;
                impact of clinic-level organizational factors on the CRC screening process.&#xD;
