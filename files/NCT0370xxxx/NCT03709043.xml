  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drinking multiple alcoholic drinks on a single occasion (binge drinking), has many negative&#xD;
      health risks but interventions to address this behavior remain limited. This double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial will test whether kudzu, an herbal supplement,&#xD;
      can reduce heavy alcohol use and alcohol-associated sexual behaviors among sexually-active,&#xD;
      binge-drinking individuals at high risk for HIV infection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study, entitled &quot;The Harness Study&quot; is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm trial&#xD;
      in which 120 binge drinkers with AUD will be randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of kudzu&#xD;
      or placebo, to be taken on an as-needed basis (see Figure 2) with 1- and 3-month&#xD;
      post-treatment follow-up visits. This efficacy study will enroll sexually active, binge&#xD;
      drinkers with AUD because they are the most likely population to benefit from this&#xD;
      intervention by limiting harms associated with heavy alcohol use and decreasing&#xD;
      alcohol-related sexual risk behaviors. A study clinician will perform the Structured Clinical&#xD;
      Interview for the DSM-V (SCID) to screen for AUD and determine eligibility. Upon enrollment,&#xD;
      120 participants will be randomized 1:1 to kudzu extract (2 grams) or placebo for targeted&#xD;
      administration. Participants will be seen weekly for behavioral surveys, urinalyses, study&#xD;
      drug dispensing, and alcohol use counseling. Safety laboratory assessment, vital signs, and&#xD;
      the audio computer assisted survey instrument (ACASI) will be completed monthly. Efficacy,&#xD;
      tolerability, and acceptability (Specific Aims 1-4) will be assessed upon trial completion as&#xD;
      measured by number of binge drinking occasions and numbers of drinks on drinking days via&#xD;
      timeline follow-back at weekly visits; number of EtG-positive urine samples; sexual risk&#xD;
      behavior data through monthly surveys via ACASI; frequency of adverse events; and cumulative&#xD;
      medication adherence data at week 12. Durability of intervention effects will be evaluated at&#xD;
      1- and 3-month post-treatment visits.&#xD;

             copies/mm3; *&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. no current acute illnesses requiring prolonged medical care;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. no chronic illnesses that are likely to progress clinically during trial&#xD;
             participation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. able and willing to provide informed consent and adhere to visit schedule;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. age 18-70 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. baseline CBC, total protein, albumin, glucose, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, BUN,&#xD;

&#xD;
        (*Note: Participants newly diagnosed with HIV at screening are eligible for the study but&#xD;
        we will postpone their enrollment until they are virally suppressed with HIV viral load &lt;&#xD;
        50 copies/mm .)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any psychiatric (e.g., depression with suicidal ideation) or medical condition that&#xD;
             would preclude safe participation in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. known allergy/previous adverse reaction to kudzu;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. moderate/severe liver disease (AST, ALT &gt; 5 times upper limit of normal);&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. impaired renal function (creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. currently participating in another intervention research study with potential overlap;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. current severe substance-use disorder (exclusive of nicotine, cannabis or alcohol) as&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. pregnant women;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. HIV positive individuals who are not virally suppressed;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. any condition that, in the principal investigator and/or study clinician's judgment&#xD;
             interferes with safe study participation or adherence to study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. not willing to learn how to send EMA surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (*Note: Eligible participants who have a partner currently in the study will be enrolled&#xD;
        and randomized after their partner has completed their in-treatment follow-up, to reduce&#xD;
        the concerns of contamination between treatment conditions. Additionally, we will exclude&#xD;
        individuals with impaired renal function as a general precaution. Pharmacokinetic data on&#xD;
        kudzu is limited. Puerarin is present in the urine of rats for 4-72 hours after oral&#xD;
        administration, thus there is renal elimination of the active compound, as well as it's&#xD;
        metabolite, equol. For this reason, we prefer to be cautious by limiting enrollment to&#xD;
        those with reasonable renal function. We selected eGFR &lt; 50mL/min as that is the level at&#xD;
        which most products with renal clearance begin to demonstrate risks of increased toxicity.)&#xD;
