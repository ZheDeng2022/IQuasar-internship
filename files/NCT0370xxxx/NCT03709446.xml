  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents about 15% of breast cancers and is&#xD;
      characterized by the lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor&#xD;
      (PR), and HER-2 non-amplification. Women with TNBC tend to be younger, African American, and&#xD;
      BRCA-1 germline carriers. The hallmark of this subtype is early metastatic recurrences with a&#xD;
      peak frequency 1-2 years. Prognosis for metastatic TNBC is especially poor with median&#xD;
      survival of about 1 year as compared to about 2-4 years with other types of metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the phase I part of this study is to determine the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and maximum tolerated dose of leflunomide in women with previously treated TNBC.&#xD;
      The primary objective of the phase 2 part of this study is to determine the efficacy of&#xD;
      leflunomide in patients with TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leflunomide, which will be taken daily by mouth, is an inhibitor of dihydroorotate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase (DHODH). This proposal will test if DHODH is a novel target for a particular&#xD;
      subset of women with metastatic TNBC.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with histologically confirmed ER ≤ 10% and or PR ≤ 10% TNBC on the pre-trial&#xD;
             metastatic biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≤ 3 prior chemotherapies for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior immunotherapy is permitted and does not count as chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The use denosumab or zoledronic is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of previously treated brain metastases with ≥ 4 weeks after definitive surgery&#xD;
             and gamma knife/whole brain radiation and not taking steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥ 4 weeks from last oral or IV chemotherapy, small molecule inhibitor, a biologic&#xD;
             agent, surgery or radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin within institutional upper limit of normal. (≤ ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SPGT) ≤ 2 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine ≤ ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 3 days of receiving Day 1 Cycle 1&#xD;
                  of leflunomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             before study entry, for the duration of study participation and for 90 days following&#xD;
             completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recommended methods of birth control are: The consistent use of an approved hormonal&#xD;
             contraception such as an intrauterine device (IUD), Double barrier methods (Diaphragm&#xD;
             with spermicidal gel or condoms with contraceptive foam), Sexual abstinence (no sexual&#xD;
             intercourse) or Sterilization. The use of hormonal forms of birth control is&#xD;
             controversial in TNBC and as such women enrolled in the trial are permitted to use&#xD;
             birth control pills or depot Provera, only after a documented discussion by the&#xD;
             treating physician as too the uncertain risks of hormonal birth control methods in the&#xD;
             TNBC population. A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of&#xD;
             sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by&#xD;
             choice) who meets the following criteria: Has not undergone a hysterectomy or&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy; or Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12&#xD;
             consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within ≥ 2 weeks before entering&#xD;
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than ≥ 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The known history human immunodeficiency virus, acute and chronic Hepatitis B or C, or&#xD;
             acute or previously treated tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with untreated brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to leflunomide or teriflunomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital&#xD;
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.&#xD;
