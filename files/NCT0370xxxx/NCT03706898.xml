      This is open label, phase 1 clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of Elpida® in healthy subjects and patients with hepatic impairment (Child -&#xD;
      Pugh Class А and B), as well as to assess the impact of food intake and drug-drug&#xD;
      interactions in case of Co-administration with other antiviral drugs in healthy subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In medical practice HIV infection is often found associated with viral hepatitis, especially&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). This, as well as a possible change in PK parameters in case&#xD;
      of co-administration of Elpida® and HIV integrase inhibitors, necessitates the study of PK&#xD;
      and safety of co-administration of Elpida® with a combination of Sofosbuvir + Daclatasvir and&#xD;
      Dolutegravir in healthy subjects. Thus, the study to evaluates safety and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      Elpida® in healthy subjects and patients with hepatic impairment, as well as assesses the&#xD;
      impact of food intake and drug-drug interactions in case of co-administration with other&#xD;
      antiviral drugs in healthy subjects.&#xD;
