      with intratumoral injection of the CTLA-4 blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) ipilimumab and&#xD;
      the PD-L1 blocking mAb avelumab. Concomitantly, nivolumab (a PD-1 blocking mAb) will be&#xD;

      This phase I trial aims at investigating a new combinatorial immunotherapy regimen using&#xD;
      intratumoral injection of autologous CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myeloid dendritic cells in combination&#xD;
      with intratumoral injection of the CTLA-4 blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) ipilimumab and&#xD;
      the PD-L1 blocking mAb avelumab. Concomitantly, nivolumab (a PD-1 blocking mAb) will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myeloid dendritic (myDC) cells will be obtained by immunomagnetic isolation&#xD;
      from PBMC obtained by leukapheresis. The CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myDC will not be substantially&#xD;
      manipulated prior to autologous intratumoral injection, immediately following the isolation&#xD;
      and concentration (isolation and administration will be performed in the same procedure). The&#xD;
      investigators consider that the isolation represents a non-substantial manipulation of this&#xD;
      somatic cell therapy product. The intended use of CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myDC in this clinical&#xD;
      protocol is to enrich their presence within the injected metastasis where they should execute&#xD;
      their physiological role of coordinating the anti-tumor immune response. Based on recent&#xD;
      preclinical data, absence of myeloid dendritic cells in the tumor microenvironment is an&#xD;
      important immune escape mechanism of malignant tumors.&#xD;

             postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an alternative&#xD;
             medical cause; in women &lt; 45 years of age a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&#xD;
             level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in&#xD;
