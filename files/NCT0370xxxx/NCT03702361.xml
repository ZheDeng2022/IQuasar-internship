  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the past two years, the investigator has performed succsefully an IIR wherein patients&#xD;
      with GD, previously treated with velaglucerase alfa ERT were gradually switched to a 10&#xD;
      minutes (rapid) administration of the same ERT. The success was expressed as safety (no&#xD;
      clinically meaningful AEs, no antibodies detected, home therapy), efficacy (&quot;lack of&#xD;
      deterioration&quot;) and patients' satisfaction. The latter was based not just on specific&#xD;
      questionnaires and analog scales, but particularly by the patients' sharing the experience&#xD;
      with other patients and consequently repeated requests by many to switch to a rapid&#xD;
      administration of their ERT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigator is hereby proposing to investigate the safety and efficacy of a&#xD;
      10 minutes administration of velaglucerase alfa in a cohort of treatment-naive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current VPRIV label is restricted to a dosage of 60 units/kg body weight every other week&#xD;
      (60 units/kg EOW) - this dose will be used throughout the study period. The enzyme will be&#xD;
      provided by Shire, which will also provide a research grant for the conduction of the trial.&#xD;

      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This will be a single-center, open-label trial to assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of rapid administration of velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV) to treatment-naive patients&#xD;
      with type I Gaucher disease. The first six infusions will be administered in the hospital:&#xD;
      the first three infusions within 60, 30 and 20 minutes each, with the beginning of a 10&#xD;
      minutes administration from infusion #4. Following the three uneventful administration of the&#xD;
      10 minutes in the hospital, the bi-weekly ERT will continue as home therapy, as outlined in&#xD;
      the protocol. The duration of the study will be 12 months, with an extension pending positive&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients: 15. The first ten patients will be adults, and then children will be&#xD;
      allowed to enroll in the trial.&#xD;
