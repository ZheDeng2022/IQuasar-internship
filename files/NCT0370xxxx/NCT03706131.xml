      Taking into consideration the effects of mobilization on muscle tone and balance, it is&#xD;
      predicted that this method will have effective results in the treatment of individuals with&#xD;
      MS. Therefore, it is thought that grade A and grade B mobilization applications can be used&#xD;
      to strengthen the balance control mechanisms of MS individuals and to regulate muscle tone by&#xD;
      increasing the proprioceptive input. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the&#xD;
      short-term effects of cervical mobilization on balance and spasticity in MS individuals.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating, and neurodegenerative&#xD;
      disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The etiology of the disease is not fully known.&#xD;
      It is thought that both autoimmune and neurodegenerative mechanisms can play a role in MS.&#xD;
      Genetic and environmental factors are also influenced by the emergence of the disease.&#xD;
      Although the factors that trigger MS are not fully known, autoreactive T cells and antibodies&#xD;
      against SSS are thought to have a major pathogenic role in the development of inflammation&#xD;
      and tissue damage. The same mechanism is held responsible for the progression of neurological&#xD;
      disorders and functional deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS can severely limit the quality of life in patients due to the accumulation of sequelae&#xD;
      following the attacks or the development of a progressive degenerative process, leading to&#xD;
      progressive disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease has marked clinical heterogeneity. This difference may be in the age of onset,&#xD;
      onset, frequency, severity and sequelae of exacerbations, worsening prevalence and cumulative&#xD;
      impairment over time. Although there are differences in clinical and pathologic findings,&#xD;
      variable clinical features reflect multifocal SSS destruction. In patients, somatosensory&#xD;
      findings (burning, numbness, tingling, deep and superficial sensory deficits), motor findings&#xD;
      (spasticity due to corticospinal involvement, muscle strength losses), postural control and&#xD;
      coordination disorders, bladder-bowel problems, visual, cognitive and psychiatric&#xD;
      manifestations, fatigue and sleep disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spasticity is one of the most common physical disorders in MS. It is known that 60-90% of&#xD;
      individuals with MS develop spasticity. MS-associated spasticity; generalized, focal (which&#xD;
      affects a part of the extremity) or multifocal (which affects more than one part of the&#xD;
      extremities or extremities). Spasticity; due to force imbalance between agonist and&#xD;
      antagonist muscles, affecting static joint positions and dynamic limb movements, resulting in&#xD;
      abnormal postural conditions and stiffness. Spasticity is directly related to disease&#xD;
      progression and muscle weakness leads to secondary fatigue due to increased energy&#xD;
      expenditure. Depending on the spasticity, structural changes of muscles, tendons and joints&#xD;
      affect the movements and functions of the extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equilibrium losses are one of the other important symptoms seen in MS patients, affecting&#xD;
      about 75% of patients. Balance; the ability to keep the center of gravity of the body within&#xD;
      the limits of the support surface. The sensory components of the balance; visual, vestibular&#xD;
      and somatosensory system information. The feeling of proprioception, which is part of the&#xD;
      somatosensory system; joints and extremities, which are formed by receptors located in the&#xD;
      joints and tissues and provided by neural inputs. Proprioceptors are specific receptors that&#xD;
      are located at different rates in different structures and tissues of the body. It is known&#xD;
      that the cervical region is very rich in these receptors. In this respect, the neck plays a&#xD;
      very important role in maintaining the right orientation, balance, and accordingly motor&#xD;
      coordination of the whole body. For example; In the impaired proprioceptive processes of the&#xD;
      lower extremities, compensation is provided by proprioceptive inputs from the cervical region&#xD;
      to maintain body balance. The cervical region is closely related to the vestibular system,&#xD;
      which is another sensory component of balance. This relationship is extremely important in&#xD;
      the activity of cervico-colic (CCR) and vestibulo-colic reflexes (VCR). VCR is semicircular&#xD;
      canal and macular origin. They are effective on the receptors on the inner ear and on the&#xD;
      muscular extensor muscles. In one study, when vestibular stimulation accompanied the tension&#xD;
      of the neck muscles, the sagittal VCR in the semispinalis capitis muscle increased about&#xD;
      three-fold normally. Strengthening of the VCR reflex with tongue proprioceptive afferents is&#xD;
      the result of summing up of CCR and VCR induced by stretching of the neck muscles. The&#xD;
      interaction between the two reflexes showed that not only the vestibular stimulation but also&#xD;
      the length of the neck muscles were important in the normal movement of the head over the&#xD;
      neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treatment of spasticity and balance disorders, which are very common and difficult to&#xD;
      manage in MS patients, drug therapies, botulinum toxin treatments, surgical treatments and&#xD;
      physiotherapy and rehabilitation approaches are included.Physiotherapy applications; sensory,&#xD;
      walking parameters, extremity functions, muscle tone, body and standing balance are known to&#xD;
      have positive effects. The use of somatosensory strategies, balance exercises, coordination&#xD;
      training, spinal stabilization exercises and activity based exercises are the physiotherapy&#xD;
      approaches used in balance training. Mobilization techniques, which are another physiotherapy&#xD;
      application, restoration of joint motion with the application of different forms of active&#xD;
      and passive exercise. Mobilization is a repetitive passive motion within the limits of normal&#xD;
      joint motion, without exceeding this limit, at different amplitudes at low speeds. The&#xD;
      neurophysiological effects of mobilization are to improve the proprioception sensation by&#xD;
      stimulating receptor nerve endings in different periarticular structures, changing the range&#xD;
      of motion, pain, muscle tone, motor control and spinal stability. Inserted stretching and&#xD;
      pushing stimulates Type III joint receptors and golgi tendon organs. In this case relaxation&#xD;
      occurs with temporary inhibition in the muscles. This causes an increase in joint motion and&#xD;
      prepares the joint for more stretching and mobilization. Thus, pain and protective muscle&#xD;
      spasm are reduced. Neurophysiological effects of mobilization; decreased pain and muscle&#xD;
      tone, postural control and balance effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobilization techniques are classified into 3 groups according to severity and degree. These;&#xD;
      grade A (mobilization), grade B (mobilization) and grade C (manipulation). Grade (mobility);&#xD;
      active, or active assisted movements within painless range of motion. Grade B (mobility); is&#xD;
      a special continuous stretching technique which causes the prolongation of the connector&#xD;
      touch. At the spinal joints, the joint is applied at the end of the range of motion. Grade C&#xD;
      (manipulation); passive movement in the form of a minimal amplitude, high velocity push&#xD;
      applied between the physiological boundary and the anatomical boundary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into consideration the effects of mobilization on muscle tone and balance, it is&#xD;
      predicted that this method will have effective results in the treatment of individuals with&#xD;
      MS. Therefore, it is thought that grade A and grade B mobilization applications can be used&#xD;
      to strengthen the balance control mechanisms of MS individuals and to regulate muscle tone by&#xD;
      increasing the proprioceptive input. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the&#xD;
      short-term effects of cervical mobilization on balance and spasticity in MS individuals.&#xD;

    <description>The BBS is a 14-item scale that was designed to measure balance in the elderly population in a clinical setting. It has also been used to assess postural balance in people with a history of stroke and traumatic brain injury. The BBS consists of 14 different tests examining individuals' ability to sit, stand, reach, maintain single-leg stance, and turn. It rates performance on a scale from 0 (cannot perform task) to 4 (normal performance on task). In the elderly population, it has been found to be a good predictor of falling, with good validity and reliability.The total possible score ranges from 0 to 56; a score of 45 or below indicates an increased risk of falling.</description>
