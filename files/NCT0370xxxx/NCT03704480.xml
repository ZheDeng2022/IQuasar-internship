    <textblock>
      IMMUNO-BIL is a non-comparative randomized 1:1 phase II study. This study will assess the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the combination of durvalumab plus tremelimumab with or without weekly&#xD;
      paclitaxel in patients with advanced BTC after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the 25th June 2019, the maximum DLT event number was reached (6/10) in the durvalumab plus&#xD;
      tremelimumab combination with paclitaxel Arm (Arm B). According to the Pocock boundary&#xD;
      described in the protocol, GERCOR has updated the study to discontinue enrollment in Arm B&#xD;
      (durvalumab plus tremelimumab with paclitaxel) . No safety concerns were raised by the IDMC&#xD;
      in Arm A. Consequently, the study will resume with Arm A (durvalumab plus tremelimumab) only,&#xD;
      without randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation of ARM B(June 2019): Durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus paclitaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
      One cycle equals 4 weeks (D1=D28); Durvalumab: 1,500 mg by IV infusion on D1, until&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tremelimumab: 75 mg by IV infusion on D1 for the first 4 cycles. Paclitaxel: 80 mg/m2, every&#xD;
      week for 3 weeks (D1-D8-D15), by IV infusion, until progression or unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent (at least 6 cycles, at the discretion of the investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      December 2020: Tremelimumab dosage modification based on the results of the Study 22 study&#xD;
      (Kelley RK, et al. ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program 2020) showing increased efficacy&#xD;
      (response rate and progression-free survival) without safety concerns with one dose of&#xD;
      tremelimumab 300 mg (cycle 1) instead of four doses of 75 mg (cycle 1 to cycle 4) in&#xD;
      combination with durvalumab 1,500 mg Q4W in hepatocellular carcinoma. Following these&#xD;
      results, we have changed the tremelimumab 75 mg x 4 schedule for the 300 mg x 1 schedule. The&#xD;
      inclusion of 106 additional patients will be required to adequately evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      this administration schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A : Durvalumab plus tremelimumab ( patients included before 31/12/2020) One cycle equals&#xD;
      4 weeks (D1=D28);&#xD;
&#xD;
      Durvalumab: 1,500 mg by IV infusion on D1, until progression or unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tremelimumab: 75 mg by IV infusion on D1 for the first 4 cycles.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Biliary tract carcinoma (BTC, adenocarcinoma in more than 90% of cases) is the second primary&#xD;
      liver tumor in incidence after hepatocellular carcinoma (2,000 new cases/year in France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prognosis of biliary malignancies is poor, with a 5-year overall survival rate (OS) of&#xD;
      about 10-15%, most often due to late diagnosis, at an advanced stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In advanced BTC, the gemcitabine plus platinum (cisplatin [GEMCIS] or oxaliplatin [GEMOX])&#xD;
      doublet of chemotherapy is the standard first-line treatment and no targeted therapy has been&#xD;
      validated in this indication to date. There is no second-line therapeutic standard;&#xD;
      chemotherapy (mainly, 5-FU-based combination) yields limited median progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) and OS of abouty 2-3 months and 6-7 months respectively, justifying the exploration of&#xD;
      new therapeutic options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune therapies (mainly, immune checkpoint inhibitors [ICI]) have opened new opportunities&#xD;
      in cancer therapy. Hence, anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have&#xD;
      demonstrated robust clinical activity and obtained FDA approval in several cancers. Recent&#xD;
      data showed encouraging results with anti-PD-1 mAb as a monotherapy in PD-L1-positive&#xD;
      pre-treated advanced BTC. The effects of ICI in combination with second-line chemotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with advanced BTC have not been explored to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platinum salts can induce &quot;immunogenic cell death&quot;. Therefore, previous treatment with&#xD;
      platinum may increase tumor immunogenicity and sensitivity to immune therapy, particularly,&#xD;
      ICI. The second-line setting after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy may then be an&#xD;
      optimal biological context for testing immune therapy in advanced BTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 kappa (IgG1κ) anti-PD-L1 mAb. Tremelimumab is a&#xD;
      human IgG2 anti-CTLA-4 mAb. Paclitaxel is a chemotherapy belonging to the taxane family.&#xD;
      Taxanes may enhance the effect of immunotherapy by increasing the sensitivity of the tumor&#xD;
      and activating the immune system. Taxanes are used in some patients with advanced biliary&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data suggest that BTC may be a good candidate for immune therapy. The combination of&#xD;
      anti-CTL4 and anti-PD1/PD-L1 mAb is expected to be active in both immune-inflamed and&#xD;
      non-inflamed BTC, and in PD-L1 high and low tumors.&#xD;
