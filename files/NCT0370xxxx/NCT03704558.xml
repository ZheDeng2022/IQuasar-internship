    <textblock>
      In advanced stage osteoarthritis or osteonecrosis of the articular bearing surfaces of the&#xD;
      knee, the surgical therapeutic solutions consist of a replacement of the articular surfaces&#xD;
      by prosthetic implants. Depending on whether these implants replace all or part of the&#xD;
      articular surfaces they are called &quot;total&quot; or &quot;uni compartmental&quot; knee prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The uni-compartmental medial prosthesis replaces only the medial tibiofemoral compartment of&#xD;
      the knee and is therefore intended for patients with cartilaginous wear isolated from this&#xD;
      compartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The uni-compartmental medial prosthesis has advantages over the total knee arthroplasty of&#xD;
      being more economical in articular tissues of the knee, having better functional results and&#xD;
      lower complication rates. Although this is debated, the survival rate of uni-compartmental&#xD;
      prostheses in the international registers is lower than that of total knee prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most common early failure factors of uni-compartmental prostheses is the absence&#xD;
      of a functional anterior cruciate ligament. Other factors have also been identified and are&#xD;
      sometimes highly debated such as the Kozinn and Scott criteria. The group of designers of the&#xD;
      unicompartmental Oxford Uni compartmental prosthesis Knee Arthroplasty (OUKA) (Zimmer Biomet,&#xD;
      Warsaw) proposed and validated expanded criteria. These criteria, exclusively radiographic,&#xD;
      are grouped in a document called &quot;decision aid&quot; to check the functional status of the&#xD;
      collateral ligaments medial and anterior cross, other compartments of the knee (lateral&#xD;
      femoro-tibial and femoro-patellar).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In decision aid, the functional status of the anterior cruciate ligament is judged on the&#xD;
      knee radiograph by the location of the osteoarthritic cup. If it is present and functional,&#xD;
      the cartilaginous wear is anterior with a respect of the posterior portion of the tibial&#xD;
      plateau.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After regular use of the French version of the decision aid, the assessment of the location&#xD;
      of osteoarthritis seems subjective to us however it is essential to validate the indication&#xD;
      of a uni-compartmental prosthesis. In case of poor evaluation, the risk is the intraoperative&#xD;
      discovery of the actual status of the anterior cruciate ligament that may result in a change&#xD;
      of indication and the installation of a total knee prosthesis. The investigators have not&#xD;
      found in the literature, studies evaluating the reliability and reproducibility of the&#xD;
      lateral radiograph to judge the functional status of the anterior cruciate ligament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the lateral radiograph is unreliable and reproducible to judge the&#xD;
      functional status of the anterior cruciate ligament in a population of patients with medial&#xD;
      femoro-tibial knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
