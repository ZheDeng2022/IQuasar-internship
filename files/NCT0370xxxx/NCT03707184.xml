    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well fluciclovine 18F PET/CT imaging works in assessing hormone-naive&#xD;
      men with prostate cancer that has spread to the bone. Fluciclovine 18F is a radioactive drug&#xD;
      used to measure tumor growth. PET/CT uses x-rays to take pictures inside the body. Comparing&#xD;
      results of fluciclovine 18F PET/CT imaging may help doctors predict a patient's response to&#xD;
      treatment and help plan the best treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Abnormal fluciclovine F18 ([18F] fluciclovine) uptake on visual assessment will differ by&#xD;
      the type of metastatic lesion present (blastic, lytic, marrow, mixed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean)&#xD;
      on (18F) fluciclovine-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging&#xD;
      will differ by the type of metastatic lesion present (blastic, lytic, marrow, mixed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine if a 25% or greater reduction in average (ave)SUVmax or aveSUVmean on (18F)&#xD;
      fluciclovine-PET/CT imaging after completion of all radiation therapy will be predictive of&#xD;
      increased time to biochemical failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the correlation between the number of lesions, their visual uptake, and&#xD;
      semi-quantitative uptake on technetium tc-99m medronate (99mTc-MDP) bone scintigraphy and&#xD;
      (18F) fluciclovine- PET/CT at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the correlation between the number of lesions, their visual uptake, and&#xD;
      semi-quantitative uptake on 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy and (18F) fluciclovine- PET/CT after&#xD;
      3 and 6 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a companion imaging study to Institutional Review Board (IRB) #102312 (A&#xD;
      Phase 2 Study of Radium-223 and Radiotherapy in Hormone-Naive Men with Oligometastatic&#xD;
      Prostate Cancer to Bone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive fluciclovine F18 intravenously (IV) over 30 seconds and undergo PET/CT scan&#xD;
      over 60 minutes at baseline, 3 months and at approximately 6 months of radium-223 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of diagnostic testing, patients are followed for 2 years.&#xD;

    <description>The primary analysis of SUVmean will be t-tests comparing the osteoblastic and osteolytic lesions. An additional analysis of the primary objective will be one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post hoc analysis comparing all four lesion types (osteoblastic, osteolytic, marrow and mixed). As a secondary sensitivity analysis mixed effects models with a fixed effect for lesion type and a random patient effect will also be fit.</description>

The number of lesions identified by 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy alone, 18F fluciclovine- PET/CT alone, and both 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy and 18F fluciclovine- PET/CT will be tabulated.</description>

    <description>Will be analyzed using standard survival analysis methods. Two binary variables will be constructed, by dividing the cohort into those that did and did not achieve a 25% or greater reduction in average (ave)SUVmax or aveSUVmean on18F fluciclovine-PET/CT imaging after completion of all radiation therapy. Kaplan-Meier methods will be used for plotting and log rank tests will be used to determine whether either of these binary variable is predictive of increased time to biochemical failure.</description>
