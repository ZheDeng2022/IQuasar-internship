  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      24 healthy volunteers will be immunized with three times 50 L3 larvae or placebo followed by&#xD;
      treatment with albendazol and subsequently challenged with twice 50 L3 larvae.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      24 healthy hookworm-naive volunteers will be randomized in a 2:1 allocation to either the&#xD;
      intervention group or placebo. Volunteers in the intervention group will be immunized three&#xD;
      times with 50 L3 larvae of Necator americanus with three-week intervals. Two weeks after each&#xD;
      immunization, volunteers will be treated with albendazole. Four weeks after the last&#xD;
      treatment all volunteers are challenged with controlled human hookworm infection consisting&#xD;
      of two doses of 50 L3 larvae with a two week interval. 16 weeks after the first challenge all&#xD;
      volunteers will be treated with albendazole, except up to four volunteers who will be asked&#xD;
      to remain as chronic donors for future hookworm studies.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participant, clinical trial physicians and laboratory personnel are blinded for treatment allocation. Blinding is maintained by exposing the volunteers in the placebo group to a mock infection with water.
