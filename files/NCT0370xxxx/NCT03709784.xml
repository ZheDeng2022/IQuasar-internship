      This is a prospective, longitudinal, multi-center, observational study designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of SPINRAZA® (nusinersen) in ambulatory and&#xD;
      non-ambulatory adult patients with SMA. Subjects with SMA II/III that are 18 years to 70&#xD;
      years of age who are planning to initiate treatment with SPINRAZA® (nusinersen) as part of&#xD;
      their clinical care plan will be enrolled in this study. This study does not provide&#xD;
      SPINRAZA® (nusinersen) or cover costs associated with standard clinical care.These patients&#xD;
      will be treated by their respective physicians according to standard clinical practice. Study&#xD;
      visits, some of which including standardized assessments of strength and function, will occur&#xD;
      at baseline, day 15 after treatment initiation, day 30, day 60, and then 4-month intervals&#xD;
      through month 30.&#xD;

      5cc of Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) is collected and typically discarded as part of the&#xD;
      typical clinical encounter when SPINRAZA® (nusinersen) is administered. This 5cc of CSF will&#xD;
      be collected for research purposes at each dosing visit. Blood samples, including whole&#xD;
      blood, serum, and plasma (3 teaspoons total) will be collected within seven days of standard&#xD;
      of care SPINRAZA® (nusinersen) administration at dose #1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 11.&#xD;

             intervals, and the fourth loading dose administered 30 days after the third dose and&#xD;

&#xD;
        For Group 2 subjects:&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Be free of major orthopedic deformities that limit ambulation.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Revised upper limb score ≤ 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Respiratory insufficiency, defined by the medical necessity for invasive or&#xD;

             other surgery), cardiac event, pulmonary event, or other major medical problem within&#xD;
             2 months of screening or planned major surgical procedure likely to impact the&#xD;
             clinical assessments during the duration of the study. Outpatient surgical procedure&#xD;
             (i.e., placement of feeding tube) is not considered an exclusionary major medical&#xD;
             event.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of a symptomatic severe active infection or illness during the screening&#xD;
             period that is likely to impact the performance on the clinical assessments.&#xD;

          5. Prior exposure to SPINRAZA® (nusinersen).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Prior disorder, injury (e.g., upper or lower limb fracture) or surgical procedure&#xD;
             which impacts the subject's ability to perform any of the outcome measure testing&#xD;
             required in the protocol and from which the subject has not fully recovered or&#xD;
             achieved a stable baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;

             carnitine, creatine, sodium phenylbutyrate, etc.), biological agent, or device within&#xD;
             1-month of Screening or 5 half-lives of study agent, whichever is longer. Patients&#xD;
             using intrathecal drug delivery devices, including investigational devices with an&#xD;
             active IDE designation in the United States, may be eligible but require Study PI&#xD;
             approval prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any history of exposure to gene therapy, antisense oligonucleotide therapy, or cell&#xD;
             transplantation that was intended for the treatment of SMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Ongoing medical condition that according to the Clinical Center Investigator would&#xD;
             interfere with the conduct and assessments of the study. Examples are medical&#xD;
             disability (e.g., wasting or cachexia, severe anemia, etc.) that would interfere with&#xD;
             the assessment of safety or would compromise the ability of the subject to undergo&#xD;
             study procedures.&#xD;
