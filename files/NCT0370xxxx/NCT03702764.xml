  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of GEOMETRY study is to investigate the correlation between coronary plaque geometric&#xD;
      modifications and lesion vulnerability in patients with suspected coronary artery disease&#xD;
      referred for cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Furthermore the study will&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of plaque eccentricity and morphology on the rate of major adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events (MACE) for a 2 years follow-up period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide.&#xD;
      Early detection of CAD may reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction by improving primary&#xD;
      prevention and providing more effective treatment methods. A step in this direction is&#xD;
      identifying the pattern of coronary plaques which are prone to rupture. Coronary computed&#xD;
      tomography angiography (CCTA) has emerged recently as a reliable noninvasive tool used in the&#xD;
      evaluation of coronary arteries. Some features related to plaque composition and morphology&#xD;
      such as low attenuation plaques, spotty calcification, positive remodeling or napkin ring&#xD;
      sign, were already identified as vulnerability markers. However the role of lesion geometry&#xD;
      on plaque vulnerability was not investigated yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, cohort, single-center study which will be carried out in the Center of&#xD;
      Advanced Research in Multimodal Cardiac Imaging Cardiomed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 1.000 subjects with suspected CAD who are referred to CCTA by the&#xD;
      attending physician and in which presence of at least one coronary plaque is confirmed by&#xD;
      CCTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plaque burden, composition, and morphology will be assessed for each plaque. Longitudinal and&#xD;
      transversal eccentricity will be also assessed in each plaque and in all cases, eccentricity&#xD;
      index will be calculated in cross-section plane at the degree of maximum stenosis in order to&#xD;
      determine the position of the remaining circulant lumen and to classify the plaque into&#xD;
      concentric and eccentric lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted over a period of 3 years, in which patients will be examined at&#xD;
      baseline, and will be followed-up for 2 years for occurrence of MACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: to evaluate the association between different patterns of plaque geometry and the&#xD;
      risk for major adverse cardiac events MACE (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, repeated revascularization, repeated hospitalizations for&#xD;
      cardiovascular related incidents, cerebrovascular events) during a 2-year follow-up,&#xD;
      Secondary: to evaluate the association of plaque eccentricity, plaque vulnerability and&#xD;
      plaque progression after 2 years of follow-up&#xD;
