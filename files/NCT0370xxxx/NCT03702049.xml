  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is the prototypical disease of poverty as it disproportionately affects&#xD;
      marginalized and impoverished communities. In the US, TB rates are unacceptably high among&#xD;
      homeless persons who have a 10-fold increase in TB incidence as compared to the general&#xD;
      population. In California, the rate of TB is more than twice the national case rate and&#xD;
      recent TB outbreaks have been alarming. Among persons with active TB disease, over 10% die&#xD;
      during treatment, with mortality being even higher among homeless persons with TB. While TB&#xD;
      can be prevented by treating TB infection (TBI) before it develops into infectious,&#xD;
      symptomatic disease, individual factors such as high prevalence of psychosocial&#xD;
      comorbidities, unstable housing and limited access to care have led to poor adherence and&#xD;
      completion of TBI treatment among homeless persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the complex health disparity factors that affect TBI treatment adherence among homeless&#xD;
      persons, this study will assess the feasibility of a theoretically-based novel model of care&#xD;
      among persons with TBI and complex chronic illnesses. This study will evaluate an innovative,&#xD;
      community-based intervention that addresses critical individual level factors which are&#xD;
      potential mechanisms that underlie health disparities in completing TBI treatment among the&#xD;
      predominantly minority homeless. The study hypothesis is that improving these conditions, and&#xD;
      promoting health by focused screening for TBI, and early detection and treatment for these&#xD;
      vulnerable adults will improve TB treatment completion and prevent future TB disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed theoretically-based health promotion intervention focuses on: 1) completion of&#xD;
      TBI treatment, 2) reducing substance use; 3) improving mental health; and 4) improving&#xD;
      critical social determinants of TB risk (unstable housing and poor health care access) among&#xD;
      homeless adults in the highest TB prevalence area in Los Angeles. A total of 76 homeless&#xD;
      adults with TBI will receive this program which includes culturally-sensitive education, case&#xD;
      management, and directly observed therapy (DOT) delivery of medication among patients who&#xD;
      have been prescribed 3HP (12 weeks treatment for latent TB infection) by a medical provider.&#xD;
      This study will determine whether this intervention can achieve higher completion rates than&#xD;
      the 65% completion rate among homeless persons reported by previous TB programs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is a global public health threat, which is driven by social factors,&#xD;
      including poverty, inadequate housing, malnutrition, and substance use. In the United States&#xD;
      (US), TB disproportionately impacts homeless populations. When compared to the general&#xD;
      population, homeless persons have a 10-fold increase in TB incidence. Lack of stable housing&#xD;
      and living in congregate settings are predisposing factors for TB Infection (TBI). Homeless&#xD;
      persons who develop active TB disease are also at higher risk of death during TB treatment&#xD;
      due to mental illness and substance use. Even one TB case among a homeless person can easily&#xD;
      lead to widespread TB transmission due to crowded, poorly ventilated, and congregate living&#xD;
      situations. Therefore, an extensive public health response is needed for each case of&#xD;
      infectious TB disease that develops among homeless persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the significant public health impact of TB among homeless persons, development of&#xD;
      effective interventions to prevent TB among homeless persons that are theoretically-based and&#xD;
      advance science in the area of best adherence strategies to minimize these health disparities&#xD;
      can lead to significant benefits for patients and further reduce the disparity in TB rates&#xD;
      between homeless and housed persons. While adherence to traditional TBI treatment with 6 to 9&#xD;
      months of isoniazid (INH) has been dismal, over the last few years, a promising treatment&#xD;
      option in form of a 12-dose combination therapy (3HP; rifapentine [RPT] plus isoniazid&#xD;
      [INH]), delivered once weekly as directly observed therapy (DOT), has achieved treatment&#xD;
      completion rates of 82%. However, homeless populations who are at high risk for TBI have&#xD;
      complex, multi-dimensional barriers to TBI treatment adherence. Thus, TBI treatment programs&#xD;
      in this population have yielded marginal results of 65% completion to date. Among homeless&#xD;
      persons, health disparities are accentuated by additional barriers to TBI treatment&#xD;
      adherence, including substance use, mental disorders, and unstable housing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the complex factors that affect TBI treatment adherence among homeless persons, the&#xD;
      research team developed a theoretically-based novel model of care that has been successfully&#xD;
      investigated in other disadvantaged populations. This model involves understanding the&#xD;
      behavioral, psychological, and environmental influences on health and developing&#xD;
      culturally-tailored interventions to reduce health disparities, and promote health. By&#xD;
      engaging nurses, physicians, and community health workers (CHW), the investigators have&#xD;
      developed a team-based approach to better understand and support medication adherence by&#xD;
      engaging individuals as active partners in managing their own health. This scientific&#xD;
      contribution has the potential to be highly significant as new models of care are being&#xD;
      proposed to improve timely entry, engagement and retention in care, and supportive services&#xD;
      for homeless persons and other vulnerable populations affected by complex health disparities&#xD;
      impacting treatment adherence. The pilot study builds on the investigators' extensive three&#xD;
      decades of research with homeless persons in improving health, including TBI treatment&#xD;
      adherence, HBV vaccination, and adherence to HIV therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the impact of the TBI program that the investigators have developed,&#xD;
      as a single arm intervention study, among 76 eligible TBI homeless adults on completion of&#xD;
      3HP treatment, decrease in drug and alcohol use, improved access to care and mental health,&#xD;
      and shelter stability. Completion of 3HP will be compared to a minimum standard completion&#xD;
      rate of 65%. This small pilot will generate the effectiveness data for a future R01&#xD;
      application to evaluate the intervention in a definitive randomized-controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
