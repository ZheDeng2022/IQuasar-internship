    <textblock>
      The study objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of ASP8302 compared with&#xD;
      placebo in participants with underactive bladder (UAB), to investigate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of ASP8302 compared with placebo in participants with UAB, to investigate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of ASP8302 in participants with UAB and to support the development of the&#xD;
      UAB - Patient Reported Outcome (PRO).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will comprise a screening visit, followed by a treatment period and a 2-week&#xD;
      follow-up period, in total 8 weeks. Participants will visit the clinic at screening (visit 1)&#xD;
      and every 2 weeks (visit 2, 3, 4, and 5). During the course of the study assessments will be&#xD;
      performed at the visits.&#xD;

    <description>Bladder voiding efficiency (BVE) is defined as the percentage of the total bladder capacity (BC) that is voided using the following formula: BVE = [volume voided (VV) / (PVR + VV)] x 100.
