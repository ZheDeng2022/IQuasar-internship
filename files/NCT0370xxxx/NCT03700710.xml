  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) hypertension guidelines&#xD;
      recommend lifestyle modification for patients with elevated blood pressure. While eating a&#xD;
      Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet, increasing physical activity, and&#xD;
      weight loss have been shown to reduce blood pressure, limited resources are available in the&#xD;
      primary care setting to help patients make these changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will compare the efficacy of a self-guided vs. dietitian-led&#xD;
      approach using web-based lifestyle modification tools to reduce weight, improve dietary&#xD;
      quality, and lower blood pressure in overweight/obese adults with elevated blood pressure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Goals that all participants will be instructed to target include: 1) weight loss &gt;=3% at 3&#xD;
      months; 2) consume a healthier dietary pattern (high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains,&#xD;
      low-fat dairy, vegetable/fish/poultry sources of protein, healthier sources of fat, and avoid&#xD;
      sugar and salt); 3) reduce sodium intake to &lt;2300 mg/d; 4) at least 180 min/wk of&#xD;
      moderate-intensity physical activity.&#xD;

    <description>In the self-guided arm, participants will receive access to web-based tools to help achieve healthy lifestyle changes to lower their blood pressure.&#xD;
The web-based tools include: 1) a web-based food frequency questionnaire (Viocare FFQ), which will provide a snapshot of participants' dietary habits in the past 6 months as well as personalized recommendations for areas to improve; 2) access to an evidence-based program (Evolve, formerly BMIQ), which includes program materials for weight loss and leading a healthy lifestyle as well as the ability for capturing dietary data entry.</description>

From January 2019 to February 2021, participants used an earlier version of the platform, which was used in tandem with LoseIt (www.loseit.com), a meal-logging app that integrated with the platform.&#xD;
In February 2021, a platform update occurred (Evolve) where the core tenets of the program remained the same and included the dietary data entry directly on the platform.</description>
