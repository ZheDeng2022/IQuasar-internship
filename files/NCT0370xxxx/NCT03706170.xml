  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a coma, one important challenge is the detection of awareness with patients with&#xD;
      disorders of consciousness. For some patients, the only behavioral manifestation indicative&#xD;
      of awareness is an appropriate emotional response. Studies show that the use of a particular&#xD;
      conditioning - with delay - appears to be an objective solution to study the conscious&#xD;
      perception of an emotion in none-communicating people. Until now, emotions of patients&#xD;
      suffering disorder of consciousness (DOC) have been scarcely studied. It has been proved that&#xD;
      some awakening patients have vegetative reactions following an emotional stimulus, but the&#xD;
      investigator can't confirm whether or not the emotional experience of the patient is&#xD;
      conscious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's main purpose is to study emotional reactions from patients suffering a&#xD;
      disorder of consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator hypothesize that some patients have preserved reflexes reaction to the&#xD;
      emotional stimuli while others could demonstrate a conscious emotional experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to answer these questions, the study is designed to record in a single session: (i)&#xD;
      physiological vegetative reactions (electrodermal, pupillary responses and heart rate) to&#xD;
      emotional stimuli both in DOC patients and healthy controls; (ii) a neurophysiological marker&#xD;
      of consciousness; and (iii) physiological parameters during a trace conditioning experiment&#xD;
      using auditory stimuli with and without emotional valence. The investigator plan to include&#xD;
      patients vegetative patients (n=15); minimally conscious patients (n=15); acquired brain&#xD;
      injured patients without conscious disorder (n=15) and healthy participants (n=15).&#xD;

    <description>electroencephalography (EEG) The investigator will study how the intensity of different Event Related Potentials varies with different levels of sound around the auditory threshold: this will be assessed specifically for early cortical components of the auditory response such as the N1 around 100 ms after the stimulus, and for late components around 300-500 ms after the stimulus, particularly the P300.</description>
