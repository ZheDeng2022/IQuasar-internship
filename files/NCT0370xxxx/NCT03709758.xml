    <textblock>
      This research study is studying the combination of venetoclax and chemotherapy as a possible&#xD;
      treatment for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daunorubicin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cytarabine&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for&#xD;
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved venetoclax for this specific&#xD;
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are combining the use of venetoclax (the&#xD;
      investigational drug being studied) with chemotherapy drugs daunorubicin and cytarabine. The&#xD;
      investigators are looking to determine the highest dose of venetoclax that can be given&#xD;
      safely in combination with these chemotherapy drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on when the participant join the study, the participant may participate in part 1&#xD;
      (induction with venetoclax escalation), part 2 (consolidation with venetoclax escalation), or&#xD;
      part 3 (an expansion cohort utilizing the maximum tolerated doses identified in parts 1 and&#xD;
      2). The study doctor will tell the participant which part of the study they will join.&#xD;
