  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcoholic hepatitis is related to very high mortality rate. About 40% of the patients are&#xD;
      died within first 6 months after the detection of the clinical syndrome. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      very essential for proper diagnosis and early treatment. In response to acute or chronic&#xD;
      liver damage, bone marrow derived stem cells can spontaneously populate liver and&#xD;
      differentiate into hepatic cells. Animal and human studies suggested that injured hepatocyte&#xD;
      may be replaced by pluripotent bone marrow cells. However, this hepatocyte repopulation is&#xD;
      highly dependent on varieties of liver injury and therapeutic conditions. The studies has&#xD;
      suggested Granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) can regenerate hepatocyte by fusing&#xD;
      with hematopoietic cells, thereby enhancing the liver histology and survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G-CSF is a cytokine capable to regulate a number of functions in neutrophils. In three recent&#xD;
      studies mobilization of bone marrow stem cells induced by G-CSF was observed in patients with&#xD;
      alcoholic hepatitis. In two of this studies there was a survival benefit with the use of&#xD;
      G-CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore we plan to study the safety and efficacy of G-CSF in the patients with alcoholic&#xD;
      hepatitis.&#xD;

      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, admitted to Department of Hepatology PGIMER,&#xD;
      Chandigarh will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an open label trial. A randomization code is generated by random number table.&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized to receive standard medical therapy (SMT) only as control and&#xD;
      therapy of G-CSF as case. There will be one control and one case as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) SMT (control) 2) G-CSF (case): G-CSF 5 mcg/kg every 12 hourly for consecutive 5 days This&#xD;
      will be a single time therapy. Patients will be admitted in the department of hepatology and&#xD;
      will be assessed everyday clinically as well as by laboratory tests during therapy to assess&#xD;
      safety and effects of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Total leukocytes count will be assessed daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Circulating CD 34 positive cells will be measured on day 0 and 6 of G-CSF therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In addition, ultrasonography will be performed at day 1 and 6 in order to evaluate&#xD;
           difference in spleen size and portal vein flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Biochemical, coagulation, and hematological parameters (Liver function tests, Renal&#xD;
           Function Tests, Prothrombin Time, International Normalised Ratio, etc.) will be&#xD;
           monitored periodically, daily for 1 week, then weekly for 1month and monthly for three&#xD;
           month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed at weekly interval for 1 month and then monthly for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival at 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobilisation of CD34 positive cells in peripheral blood.Clinical/biochemical improvement in&#xD;
      liver function profile.Improvement in prognostic scores-Maddrey's Discriminant function, MELD&#xD;
      score, and Child score.&#xD;
