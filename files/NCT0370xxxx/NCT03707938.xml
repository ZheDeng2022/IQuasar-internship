  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies the side effects and how well local consolidative therapy&#xD;
      (LCT) and brigatinib works in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that is stage&#xD;
      IV or has come back (recurrent). Giving LCT, such as surgery and/or radiation, after initial&#xD;
      treatment may kill any remaining tumor cells. Brigatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells&#xD;
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving LCT and brigatinib may work&#xD;
      better in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of brigatinib with local consolidative&#xD;
      therapy (LCT) in tyrosine kinase inhibitor-naive ALK-rearranged advanced (non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer) NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) using modified Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
      in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) in advanced ALK+ NSCLC patients treated with local consolidative&#xD;
      therapy (LCT) after achieving stable disease or partial response with first-line brigatinib&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine overall survival (OS). III. To assess time to progression (TTP) of non-LCT&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess time to appearance of new metastatic lesion(s). II. To determine the utility of&#xD;
      pre-treatment, pre-LCT, and post-LCT circulating free tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#xD;
      (cfDNA) as a potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate potential impact of LCT on mechanisms of ALK resistance with molecular&#xD;
      analysis of post-progression biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive brigatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients then undergo LCT for up to 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Within 7 days after completion of LCT, patients receive brigatinib PO&#xD;
      QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 3 months&#xD;
      for up to 2 years.&#xD;
