  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restoration of gait independence in stroke patients is one of the most important goals of&#xD;
      rehabilitation therapy, and gait rehabilitation is one of the most important treatments in&#xD;
      the treatment of stroke because it is a major factor affecting rehabilitation after stroke.&#xD;
      In the rehabilitation of patients with post - stroke walking disorders, previous physical&#xD;
      therapy was mainly manual therapy using therapist 's physical effort and walking training&#xD;
      with walking aids. In recent years, however, emphasis has been placed on therapies based on&#xD;
      motor learning concepts, which allow the patient to intensively train the exercise as closely&#xD;
      as possible to the ultimate goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The robot used for walking rehabilitation includes exoskeleton walking robot such as Lokomat®&#xD;
      (Hocoma AG, Switzerland), Walkbot-G® (P &amp; S Mechanics, Korea), MorningWalk® (Curexo, Korea)&#xD;
      According to the Systematic Review, which compares two types of robot-assisted gait treatment&#xD;
      divided into end-effector type, which is not an exoskeletal type such as System® (Rehatech,&#xD;
      Switzerland) It has been reported that the percentage of patients who were able to walk&#xD;
      independently when treated with a robot was higher than that of an exoskeleton-type robot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, in terms of acquisition of independent gait, studies on the therapeutic&#xD;
      effect of the exoskeleton-type robot and the end-effector-type robot before and after the&#xD;
      gait therapy were continuously performed, but 80% of the patients obtained independent gait,&#xD;
      Despite the fact that many of these patients have abnormal walking, research has not yet been&#xD;
      conducted. In previous studies, there was a statistically significant improvement in&#xD;
      parameters of Gait speed, Cadence, and step length when compared with spatiotemporal&#xD;
      parameters in training using exoskeleton robots for stroke patients. In another study, Gait&#xD;
      speed and Cadence did not show a statistically significant improvement, and the effect on&#xD;
      Gait speed and Cadence is still unknown. However, unlike exoskeletal robots, end-effector&#xD;
      robotic gait training has been reported to improve Gait speed in most studies compared to&#xD;
      conventional gait training. In addition, Cadence, Temporal symmetry ratio, Single, an&#xD;
      improved side stride length, an improvement in the symmetry index of stance phase, and an&#xD;
      improvement in Gait endurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way, the end effector type robot walking training is more likely to improve walking&#xD;
      quality than the exoskeleton type robot. The end-effector type robot, which is different from&#xD;
      the exoskeleton type, reproduces the gait using the ankle joint to induce the movement of the&#xD;
      knee joint and the hip joint. Therefore, it is possible to control the ankle joint, which is&#xD;
      essential for improving the gait pattern. It is considered that the end effector type robot&#xD;
      which can control the ankle joint is more likely to induce the improvement of the gait&#xD;
      pattern than the existing exoskeleton type robot because it shows limitations in reproducing&#xD;
      the ankle rocker motion.&#xD;

      There are few studies on kinematic, kinematic, and energy consumption after robot training,&#xD;
      so it is urgent to study this part. In a small retrospective open-label study, the results of&#xD;
      spatiotemporal parameters and kinetic and kinematic analyzes of patients with chronic stroke&#xD;
      in patients who underwent gait using an end-effector robot were compared with those of Gait&#xD;
      speed, Cadence , Stride time, and stride speed, improvement of hip extension in kinematic&#xD;
      analysis as a whole, and reduction of anterior tilting in pelvis. This suggests that&#xD;
      robot-assisted gait training may improve the kinematic index Randomized Controlled Trial&#xD;
      design is a systematic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it is important to evaluate the energy expenditure and cardiorespiratory load of&#xD;
      robot-assisted walking therapy for the rehabilitation of patients at risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and stroke patients with impaired cardiopulmonary function. The purpose of gait&#xD;
      therapy in stroke patients is to improve the efficiency of energy consumption by calibrating&#xD;
      patterns of gait and asymmetry of gait movements. This is also an important issue for gait&#xD;
      researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors reported that when using an end-effector type robot, the oxygen consumption was&#xD;
      statistically significantly lower during the robot-assisted walking compared to when the&#xD;
      robot was not assisted by the robot. During the walking with the exoskeleton type robot, and&#xD;
      when compared to OTW (Overground treadmill walking) during ATW, there was a statistically&#xD;
      significant decrease in mean oxygen consumption There was a report. However, previous&#xD;
      researches did not compare the pre - treatment and post - treatment, but there is no report&#xD;
      on the possibility of improvement of oxygen consumption after robot - assisted gait training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we divided the patients into two groups. One group was treated with 6-week&#xD;
      gait training using an end-effector type robot-assisted walking device and the other group&#xD;
      was treated with gait therapy for the same period of time. Six weeks after the end of the&#xD;
      treatment, three-dimensional motion analysis, foot pressure analysis and energy consumption&#xD;
      analysis were performed to obtain robot assisted training in terms of space time index,&#xD;
      kinematics, kinematic index, dynamic EMG activation pattern, The purpose of this study was to&#xD;
      investigate whether the improvement in walking performance and the energy consumption&#xD;
      efficiency of walkers are more effective than the conventional walking training group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the three most natural walking cycles Calculate kinematical index and spatio-temporal index&#xD;
      according to each gait cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic EMG analysis Dynamic EMG was performed by attaching surface EMG to the skin using&#xD;
      Medial GCM, Tibialis Anterior, Vastus Medialis, Rectus Femoris, Medial Hamstring, and Gluteus&#xD;
      Maximus of both lower limbs using a wireless Delsys Trigno Sensor System (Delsys Inc, USA)&#xD;
      Measure the signal and convert it to Root mean square (RMS). (Figure 5) EMG signal sampling&#xD;
      rate: 2000 samples / sec Filter: EMG signal bandwidth 20- 450 Hz Surface electrode: Parallel&#xD;
      bar electrode&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measured EMG signals are obtained by measuring the duration and the period of activity&#xD;
      according to the walking cycle and analyzing the degree of activation.&#xD;

      (Fig. 6) Measure O2 cost [ml / (m / kg)] and O2 rate (ml / min / kg) The walking distance was&#xD;
      measured by walking with the self-selected gait velocity while wearing K4b2 (COSMED, Italy)&#xD;
      for 5 minutes in total. The walking distance was measured for 3 minutes except the first 1&#xD;
      minute and the last 1 minute of oxygen consumption data for 5 minutes Using O2 rate and O2&#xD;

      USA) with a 0.16-mm thick, 980 force-sensing resistors (3.88 sensors per centimeter square)&#xD;
      After inserting the pressure insoles, calibrate them according to the Tekscan user manual&#xD;
      (Tekscan Research Software User Manual version 6.7 Rev. D, 2003) and measure them and analyze&#xD;
