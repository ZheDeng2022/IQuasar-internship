      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-L1) is a protein on the surface of cells. It regulates if&#xD;
      a cell can be killed by immune system cells. It is thought to be able to affect the immune&#xD;
      system response to diseased cells like those infected with a virus. The molecule M7824&#xD;
      interferes with the activity of PD-L1. It could help the immune system kill cells infected&#xD;
      with a virus . Since recurrent respiratory papillomatosis is caused by a virus infection,&#xD;
      this molecule could help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if M7824 works in treating recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 years or older with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and pregnancy tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopy procedure in clinic. A small tube with a camera will look at the inside of the&#xD;
      nose, throat, larynx, and upper windpipe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will also be screened with a chest scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the study, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have a sedated endoscopy procedure where biopsies will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have apheresis. Blood will be collected by a tube in an arm vein. A machine will remove white&#xD;
      blood cells. The rest of the blood will be returned into an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fill out a voice questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the study molecule into a vein over about 1 hour. They will get it&#xD;
      every other week for up to 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will repeat screening and starting procedures throughout the study. They will&#xD;
      also review side effects and any medicine they are taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When they are done with the study treatment, participants will be evaluated by repeating the&#xD;
      study procedures. They may be evaluated periodically until their disease progresses.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a rare papillomatous disease of the&#xD;
           aerodigestive tract that is caused by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RRP can progress to cause airway compromise, fatal pulmonary lesions, and invasive&#xD;
           cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no effective systemic therapy for RRP. Patients typically require repeated&#xD;
           interventional procedures for disease control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A recently completed phase II clinical trial investigating avelumab in subjects with&#xD;
           aggressive RRP demonstrated an acceptable safety profile from Avelumab and a high rate&#xD;
           of partial responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RRP is characterized by frequent expression of PD-L1 and transforming growth factor beta&#xD;
           (TGF)-beta in the tumor microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This clinical trial will evaluate the activity of M7824, a novel bifunctional fusion&#xD;
           protein composed of a fully human Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody against&#xD;
           human PD-L1 (avelumab) fused, via a flexible glycine-serine linker, to the soluble&#xD;
           extracellular domain of human TGF- B receptor II (Transforming growth factor, beta&#xD;
           receptor II (TGF-BRII), which functions as a TGF-B trap. This drug was selected for its&#xD;
           demonstrated activity in a variety of cancers and for its acceptable safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Determine the complete response rate for M7824 in the treatment of patients with RRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of RRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A Derkay anatomic score of 10 or greater and a history of two or more endoscopic&#xD;
                interventions in the last 12 months for control of RRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pulmonary RRP with pulmonary disease that is measurable by computed tomography&#xD;
                scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tracheal involvement with RRP that has required either two or more endoscopic&#xD;
                interventions in the last 12 months or a tracheostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age 18 years or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group Performance Score of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase II clinical trial with two cohorts that will enroll simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 will consist of subjects who have not been treated previously with an immune&#xD;
           checkpoint inhibitor. Cohort 2 will consist of subjects whose disease has been treated&#xD;
           previously with andrefractory to an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Each cohort will have a&#xD;
           Simon optimal two-stage design with initial enrollment of 12 patients and expands 21&#xD;
           patients if one or more complete response(s) is/are observed in the initial patients.&#xD;
           With amendment D, dated 7/24/2019, cohort 2 will be closed to further enrollment.&#xD;

    <description>Partial response for M7824 in the treatment of patients with RRP was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Partial Response is defined as a decrease in Derkay anatomic score of 30 percent or greater, and a partial tumor response by imaging using RECIST 1.1 criteria.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. The experimental&#xD;

             virus (HBV) Viral Load), and if confirmatory tests are negative, the patient can be&#xD;
             enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seronegative for hepatitis C antibody unless antigen negative. If hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
             test is positive, then patients must be tested for the presence of antigen by Hep C&#xD;
             Ribonucleic acid (RNA) Quant, hepatitis C virus (HCV) Viral Load and be HCV RNA&#xD;
             negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions including recent (within&#xD;
             the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, liver disease, lung disease&#xD;
             (with the exception of what is specified in inclusion criteria) , or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities that, in the opinion of the investigators, may increase the risk&#xD;
             associated with study participation or study drug administration, impair the ability&#xD;
             of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this study. Patients with mild to moderate asthma or&#xD;
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) well controlled with oral or inhaled&#xD;
             medications are permitted to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo,&#xD;
             residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;&#xD;
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14&#xD;

             steroids, and adrenal replacement doses &lt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are&#xD;

             consecutive months. Note: women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are&#xD;
             still considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to&#xD;
