  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the well-documented benefits of hydroxyurea (HU) therapy in decreasing morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in youth with Sickle cell disease (SCD), pediatric HU adherence rates range as low&#xD;
      as 49% and lead to discontinuation of HU regimens in 8-20%. In addition, treatment&#xD;
      non-adherence may lead to unnecessary increases in medication dosage resulting from erroneous&#xD;
      assumption that a patient is non-responsive to treatment (versus non-adherent to the regimen&#xD;
      as prescribed). Given the detrimental effects of non-adherence, assessment of and&#xD;
      intervention for HU non-adherence is essential to improving health outcomes in the pediatric&#xD;
      SCD population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic adherence monitoring is widely considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; in objective&#xD;
      adherence measurement. These monitors provide continuous, real- time records of medication&#xD;
      adherence and reveal problematic behavior patterns, including underdosing, overdosing,&#xD;
      delayed dosing, &quot;drug holidays,&quot; and &quot;white coat&quot; adherence. Overall, electronic adherence&#xD;
      measures are considered valid, reliable, and accurate, with clear advantages over pharmacy&#xD;
      refill records, physician estimates and self-report measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this pilot study is to determine the use of the AdhereTech as a&#xD;
      feasible and valid measure of HU adherence in pediatric SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective Estimate the association between HU adherence as measured by the AdhereTech&#xD;
      device to a) caregiver-report, b) youth-report, c) lab values, d) pill- count, and e)&#xD;
      Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) adherence measures Secondary Objectives Estimate the rate&#xD;
      of consent to the study, the rate of AdhereTech device use, the rate of AdhereTech device&#xD;
      failure, and the perceived acceptability of using the AdhereTech device, as reported by&#xD;
      caregivers and youth&#xD;

      The AdhereTech smart bottle is an electronic medicine dispenser with a tracking and reminder&#xD;
      system connected wirelessly. The device provides real time adherence aids to the patient and&#xD;
      this information is relayed to the provider. The device can sense the amount of pills&#xD;
      remaining inside the bottle. This information is measured periodically and concurrently sent&#xD;
      to a secure database using cellular data technology. Thus, AdhereTech bottles can be used to&#xD;
      determine whether medication was removed from the bottle, the amount of medication removed,&#xD;
      and the timing of removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants ages 12.0-17.99 who are receiving HU prescribed in pill form will use the&#xD;
      AdhereTech smart bottle for a two-month period. Participants and their caregivers will&#xD;
      complete self-report measures of adherence at the baseline, 1 month and 2 month clinic&#xD;
      visits, a Demographic questionnaire at the baseline clinic visit and an Acceptability&#xD;
      questionnaire at the 1 month and 2 month clinic visits using Audio Computer-Assisted&#xD;
      Self-Interviews (ACASI) on a password protected laptop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lab values and clinical information will be obtained through medical records review and&#xD;
      adherence information from pill counts and pharmacy records.&#xD;

    <measure>Estimate the association between AdhereTech device HU adherence to caregiver-report of adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Continuous over two months, baseline to off study</time_frame>
    <description>For each subject, we will calculate the proportion of days of opening the AdhereTech device across the two month study period (days with missing information will not be counted). Caregiver-report of their child's HU adherence will be assessed by the Medical Adherence Measure (MAM), a measure of 7-day self-reported adherence. Each subject's caregiver-reported adherence will be calculated as: [(medication reported taken [(medication reported taken ÷ medication prescribed) x 100]. We will estimate the Spearman's rank-based correlation, with 95% confidence interval, of the AdhereTech device adherence with the caregiver-report of their child's adherence.</description>
