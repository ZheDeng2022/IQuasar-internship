  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hoped that different forms of the same medicine, called PVP001, PVP002, and PVP003,&#xD;
      will help people with celiac disease. Both healthy adults and adults with celiac disease will&#xD;
      take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many main aims of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To check if participants have side effects from different forms of the study medicine.&#xD;
           These forms are called PVP001 (liquid in a cup), PVP002 capsule, and PVP003 tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To check how well PVP003 breaks down gluten.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To check how much PVP003 participants can take without getting side effects from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is in 4 parts. At the start of each part of the study, the study doctor will check&#xD;
      to determine who can take part at the first study visit. Different groups of participants&#xD;
      will be in different parts of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all parts of the study, some participants will take 1 of the 3 forms of study medicine.&#xD;
      Others will take a placebo. In this study, a placebo will look like the form of study&#xD;
      medicine but will not have any medicine in it. This means that a placebo can either look like&#xD;
      PVP001 liquid in a cup, the PVP002 tablet, or the PVP003 tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, different small groups of participants will take lower to higher doses of PVP001&#xD;
      or PVP002 or a placebo. This is to work out the best dose of study medicine to take in other&#xD;
      parts of the study. After treatment, participants will regularly visit the clinic to check&#xD;
      that they have no problems with their treatment, including any side effects from their&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, different small groups will take different doses of PVP001 or PVP002 or a placebo,&#xD;
      either with or without a meal that has different amounts of gluten in it. This is to check if&#xD;
      PVP001 or PVP002 has broken down gluten in the body. Participants will visit the clinic after&#xD;
      treatment to check how much gluten has been broken down in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 3, different small groups will take different doses of PVP003 or a placebo, either&#xD;
      with or without a meal that has gluten in it. This is to check if PVP003 has broken down&#xD;
      gluten in the body. Participants will visit the clinic after treatment to check if more&#xD;
      gluten has broken down in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 4, different small groups will take PVP003 or placebo 3 times a day for 5 days. After&#xD;
      treatment, participants will visit the clinic to check that they have no problems with their&#xD;
      treatment, including any side effects from their treatment.&#xD;

      This study has four parts. Each part of the study begins with a Screening Period of up to 4&#xD;
      weeks to allow for completion of screening procedures and subject scheduling. Each&#xD;
      participant will be screened by means of medical history, medication review, Gastrointestinal&#xD;
      Symptoms Questionnaire (GSQ), physical examination, vital signs, weight, height, laboratory&#xD;
      tests, and ECG. The GSQ is being used as a separate safety monitoring tool in this study to&#xD;
      ensure that all gastrointestinal complaints are reported by the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of all screening procedures, eligible participants will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study in healthy participants will be completed prior to enrollment of any&#xD;
      subject in Part 2 of the study. A participant enrolled in Part 1 of the study will&#xD;
      participate in one of five dose Cohorts. Enrollment of healthy participants and participants&#xD;
      with CeD in each of the five dose Cohorts will occur sequentially, but each of these dose&#xD;
      Cohorts will be open to enrollment only after demonstration of the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      the same dose level in healthy participants. A healthy participant enrolled in Part 2 of the&#xD;
      study will participate in one of three groups; within Groups 1, 2 and 3 enrollment may occur&#xD;
      in parallel. A healthy participant enrolled in Part 3 of the study will participate in one of&#xD;
      five groups; within Groups 1 to 5 enrollment will occur sequentially. A healthy participant&#xD;
      enrolled in Part 4 of the study will participate in two cohorts; enrollment in Part 4 may&#xD;
      occur in parallel with enrollment in Part 3. Each participant will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      two possible treatment order. Participants who participate in Part 1 or Part 2 of the study,&#xD;
      and who are not ADA positive, may participate in Part 3 or Part 4 of the study. No other&#xD;
      participants may participate in more than one Part/Group of the study.&#xD;
