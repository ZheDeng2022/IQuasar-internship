  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord (SC) involvement is prevalent in multiple sclerosis (MS) and contributes&#xD;
      importantly to disease progression. To be able reliably evaluate spinal cord volume and its&#xD;
      changes in MS patients we need to understand variability of these parameters in sex and age&#xD;
      matched healthy controls (HC). To date, no generally available data about these parameters in&#xD;
      HC are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate age and sex matched HC by MRI to get the basic&#xD;
      set of the data representing both cross sectional values and its longitudinal changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will also investigate different strategies how to normalize the absolute&#xD;
      spinal cord and brain volume data, what is a relationship between spinal cord volume and&#xD;
      brain volume and what is the best protocol to be used in a routine clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory and neurodegenerative&#xD;
      disease that affects central nervous system. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the main&#xD;
      paraclinical examination used to monitor disease activity and response to treatment. However,&#xD;
      there is only limited correlation between the clinical symptoms and findings seen on the&#xD;
      conventional MRI - a phenomena called clinical-radiological paradox. Measuring whole and&#xD;
      regional brain atrophy provides additional information to MRI and seems to correlate better&#xD;
      with clinical course and prognosis. In the last two decades, brain atrophy in MS has been&#xD;
      exten sively studied, cut-offs for brain volume loss over time has been established and it is&#xD;
      likely that it will become an important outcome measure in both clinical studies and routine&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to brain atrophy, spinal cord (SC) atrophy and its relation to MS-related disability&#xD;
      has been given less attention. This is partly due to technical challenges such as&#xD;
      inhomogeneous magnetic field in this region, small physical dimensions of SC and artefacts&#xD;
      caused by motion of the SC within the spinal canal together with the flow of cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid and periodic motion due to respiratory and cardiac cycles. Moreover, focal spinal cord&#xD;
      MS lesions may cause both swelling and shrinking of SC that influence its absolute volume,&#xD;
      resulting in problems with interpretation of absolute SC volume in MS. Despite all these&#xD;
      challenges, it is possible to identify SC lesions and reliably measure SC volume, but there&#xD;
      is no &quot;gold standard&quot; (standardized) software for SC volume measurement and no agreement on&#xD;
      the SC level (segments) that is most suitable for SC volume loss measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 2016 we have developed an in-house semiautomatic pipeline for measurement of cervical&#xD;
      spinal cord volume that is a part of Scanview program. The segmentation is performed on&#xD;
      T2-weighted images. In the first step, a marker is manually placed in a center of an&#xD;
      intervertebral disc C3-4 (sagittal plane). Subsequently a cord straightening (manual rotation&#xD;
      of the cord to achieve a perpendicular orientation of spinal cord to dorsal part of C3&#xD;
      vertebral body), that enable to reduce partial volume due to the cord orientation. After this&#xD;
      centering and straightening,transformation matrix is saved and all subsequent steps are fully&#xD;
      automatized. These steps include: 1. Sub-pixel division, 2. Reversing the contrast of&#xD;
      T2-weighted images and smoothing by applying a set of median, Gaussian and edge-enhancing&#xD;
      filters and 4. Cubic spline interpolation to find a curve that represents a border of a&#xD;
      spinal cord with highest probability. Finally, a sum of mean areas of 21 1-mm slices is&#xD;
      calculated (1 center slice fixed at center of a intervertebral disc C3-4 and 2 x 10 slices in&#xD;
      cranial and caudal direction. Using this new software we have assessed 1,036 MS patients&#xD;
      during 2016 and 2017. The intra- and inter-rater variability of SC volume assessment was done&#xD;
      by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with a two-way mixed absolute agreement&#xD;
      and single-measures design. The analysis confirmed very good consistency (&gt; 98%) of the&#xD;
      method. The preliminary results showed a significant correlation between spinal cord volume&#xD;
      and different clinical phenotypes.&#xD;
