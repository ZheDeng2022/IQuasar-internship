      This is a study looking at the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a form of&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), on the human brain as recorded by intracranial&#xD;
      electroencephalography in neurosurgical patients. NIBS will be applied in a targeted manner&#xD;
      and brain responses will be recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last few years, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial current stimulation, and peripheral multi-modal&#xD;
      stimulation have shown widespread clinical applications. Transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS) is a noninvasive method of focally stimulating the brain that uses electromagnetic&#xD;
      induction and does not require surgery. There is optimism that TMS and other forms of NIBS&#xD;
      will revolutionize how we treat neurological and psychiatric disorders, evidenced by over&#xD;
      1000 clinical trials registered using TMS. Much of this optimism stems from the successful&#xD;
      use of TMS as a treatment for depression. Despite the large number of clinical trials using&#xD;
      NIBS the number of therapeutic indications has been stagnant, limited to major depression and&#xD;
      more recently obsessive-compulsive disorder. There are fundamental questions about the&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms of action for NIBS that will be critical to understand in order to&#xD;
      advance this treatment modality. Here, we propose a unique collaborative project between&#xD;
      neurology and neurosurgery that will allow an unprecedented window into understanding how&#xD;
      NIBS impacts the human brain. Specifically, we will perform various forms of targeted TMS in&#xD;
      neurosurgical patients with intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) monitoring to record&#xD;
      real time effects of NIBS on local and remote brain areas with an unparalleled combination of&#xD;
      spatial and temporal resolution relative to other human studies. TMS may present the most&#xD;
      risk for patients with intracranial electrodes and we have already demonstrated the safety of&#xD;
      this approach using a gel-based phantom brain and have results from seven patients&#xD;
      demonstrating safety and preliminary results. For the current proposal we aim to: 1)&#xD;
      characterize the response of NIBS on the human brain as recorded from iEEG between active and&#xD;
      sham conditions, and 2) relate remote electrophysiological responses from NIBS to measures of&#xD;
      brain connectivity between the stimulation &amp; recording sites assessed with resting state&#xD;
      functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI). This will allow us to evaluate the relationship&#xD;
      between NIBS-evoked iEEG responses and the strength of functional connectivity to the&#xD;
      stimulation site in a regression model. For the TMS portion of the study we hypothesize that&#xD;
      1) TMS will have focal effects detected from surface electrodes underlying the stimulation&#xD;
      site as well as network-level engagement detected at remote sites, 2) Repetitive TMS will&#xD;
      induce frequency-specific effects that differ between 0.5 and 10 Hz stimulation protocols,&#xD;
      and 3) the magnitude of repetitive TMS-evoked iEEG responses across electrodes will relate to&#xD;
      the strength of rs-fcMRI between the stimulation and recording sites. By investigating the&#xD;
      electrophysiological responses of TMS with high spatiotemporal precision in humans, this&#xD;
      study will provide new mechanistic insights into the effects of TMS on target engagement and&#xD;
      relate these findings to imaging methods already in widespread use. Moreover, the TMS will be&#xD;
      applied in a clinically meaningful way by targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      in a protocol used to treat depression. Generating results for these aims will be key to&#xD;
      advancing our understanding of how TMS and other forms of NIBS engage brain networks, which&#xD;
      can be leveraged to rationally develop personalized, imaging-guided therapeutic NIBS for&#xD;
      depression and other disorders.&#xD;
