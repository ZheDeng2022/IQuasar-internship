      The investigators aim to characterize fecal microbial biomarkers as well as blood cytokine&#xD;
      levels in MDD patients vs. healthy controls. 40 MDD patients will be recruited for this&#xD;
      study, as well as 20 healthy age-matched participants (as a control group). Following signing&#xD;
      of informed consent, stool and blood (20 ml) samples will be collected from all participants,&#xD;
      for microbial composition assessment, and blood measures of inflammation and protein&#xD;
      expression. According to clinical assessment of the diagnosed MDD patients, the psychiatrist&#xD;
      will recommend SSRI or ECT treatment, and the patients will be divided accordingly to&#xD;
      treatment group. Clinical status will be assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale&#xD;
      (HAM-D) scored by a psychiatrist at the starting point (before treatment), after 4 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment (as ECT-group patients receive 8-12 treatments on average). A lowering in the HAM-D&#xD;
      score will be considered clinical improvement which may be attributed to treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators expect a treatment success rate of over 50% for ECT according to past&#xD;
      experience. Blood and stool samples will be collected from MDD patients after 4 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment, repeating inflammatory, protein expression and microbial measurements and&#xD;
      comparing them to initial results. Additional data recorded will include age, BMI, ethnicity,&#xD;
      previous medication use, and number of ECT treatments or current medication.&#xD;

      All procedures will be approved by the ZIV Helsinki ethics committee. Recruitment and&#xD;
      clinical assessment: 40 MDD patients will be recruited for this study, as well as 20 healthy&#xD;
      age-matched participants (as a control group). A psychiatrist not involved in the study will&#xD;
      assess the qualification of the patients for signing informed consent. Following signing of&#xD;
      informed consent, stool and blood (20 ml) samples will be collected from all participants,&#xD;
      for microbial composition assessment, and blood measures of inflammation and protein&#xD;
      expression. According to clinical assessment of the diagnosed MDD patients, the psychiatrist&#xD;
      will recommend SSRI or ECT treatment, and the patients will be divided accordingly to&#xD;
      treatment group. Clinical status will be assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale&#xD;
      (HAM-D) scored by a psychiatrist at the starting point (before treatment), after 4 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment (as ECT-group patients receive 8-12 treatments on average). A lowering in the HAM-D&#xD;
      score will be considered clinical improvement which may be attributed to treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators expect a treatment success rate of over 50% for ECT according to our past&#xD;
      experience. The investigators will collect blood and stool samples from MDD patients after 4&#xD;
      weeks of treatment, repeat inflammatory, protein expression and microbial measurements and&#xD;
      compare them to initial results. Additional data recorded will include age, BMI, ethnicity,&#xD;
      previous medication use, and number of ECT treatments or current medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: MDD patients with stable depression clinically diagnosed by a&#xD;
      psychiatrist according to the Hamilton Depression Scale. Patient age may range between 18-80&#xD;
      years, as depression is more common in older people as represented by a median age of over 55&#xD;
      in the treated population at the Ziv Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Patients receiving antibiotics in the past 3 months prior to sampling,&#xD;
      patients suffering from chronic gastrointestinal diseases or other chronic diseases such as&#xD;
      autoimmune or cancer, patients with comorbidities such as schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples: Whole blood will be centrifuged and serum samples will be kept at -80C until&#xD;
      analysis for inflammatory measurements. Additionally, lymphocytes will be purified, RNA will&#xD;
      be extracted and qRT-PCR will be performed to test immune protein and receptor expression&#xD;
      (IL-1β, IL-1R1, IL-6, TNF-α, TNF1, TNF2) as well as additional proteins related to MDD (e.g.&#xD;
      cannabinoid receptor 1- CNR1, CD38, oxytocin receptor- OXTR, brain-derived neurotrophic&#xD;
      factor - BDNF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory measures in the serum: We will measure levels of pro and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines by multiplex tests including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNFα using a Bio-Plex kit&#xD;
      (Bio-Rad). The assay plate will be read on a MAGPIX multiplex reader (Bio-Rad).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool samples: stool samples will be stored within 4 hours from collection at -80C until&#xD;
      processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbial analysis: Microbial DNA will be purified from stool and a barcoded 16S rRNA library&#xD;
      from each subject will be generated from which we will obtain ~300,000 reads per sample using&#xD;
      the Illumina MiSeq platform (NGS sequencing) at the Faculty of Medicine, Bar Ilan University.&#xD;
      Sequences will be analyzed by QIIME. Additionally, microbial RNA will be extracted from stool&#xD;
      in order to test microbial gene expression via metatranscriptomics (NGS sequencing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: All assays will be conducted using statistical software SPSS version 24&#xD;
      (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
