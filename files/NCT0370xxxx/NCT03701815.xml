    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to determine whether a lifestyle medicine intervention following stroke&#xD;
      may increase levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a substudy of the study entitled &quot;Assessing a Multi-Disciplinary Lifestyle Medicine&#xD;
      Intervention Following Stroke,&quot; specifically looking at the effects of lifestyle change on&#xD;
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF has emerged as a key facilitator of&#xD;
      neuroplasticity to improve motor learning and rehabilitation after stroke. Aerobic exercise&#xD;
      has been shown to increase levels of BDNF in multiple parts of the central nervous system and&#xD;
      therefore may facilitate neuroplasticity and motor recovery. While BDNF levels appear to be&#xD;
      increased for up to 1 hour following a bout of aerobic exercise, it is unclear whether&#xD;
      regular aerobic exercise over weeks to months can increase baseline BDNF levels in humans&#xD;
      following stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An single nucleotide polymorphism exists on the BDNF gene in 30-50% of the human population&#xD;
      that results in an amino acid change from valine (val) to methionine (met) at position 66&#xD;
      (val66met) of the precursor peptide proBDNF. The presence of the met allele results in a 25%&#xD;
      reduction in activity-dependent secretion of BDNF in the CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Wellness in Rehabilitation program at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System is a lifestyle&#xD;
      medicine intervention for patients following stroke. It is a 12-week program involving weekly&#xD;
      meetings that include exercise (particularly aerobic exercise), nutrition, stress management,&#xD;
      education, and group support. Participants are encouraged to perform healthy lifestyle&#xD;
      behaviors (i.e. exercise) daily at home, and a health coach calls each patient weekly to&#xD;
      support the behavior change process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the Wellness in Rehabilitation program who elect to participate in the&#xD;
      research study will have blood drawn at baseline, week 6, and week 12. Blood draws will be&#xD;
      performed in the morning prior to exercise, and week 6 will additionally include a blood draw&#xD;
      within 30 minutes of completing a bout of aerobic exercise. Following completion of the&#xD;
      study, plasma BDNF levels (measured as nanograms per milliliter) will then be measured at all&#xD;
      4 time points (baseline, week 6 pre-exercise, week 6 post-exercise, and week 12). In&#xD;
      addition, BDNF genotype will be measured using the baseline sample. Participants will also&#xD;
      complete bike or treadmill exercise testing at baseline and week 12 to determine pre- and&#xD;
      post-program cardiovascular fitness levels (measured as VO2 max and estimated metabolic&#xD;
      equivalents), and will also complete a 6-minute walk test. They will be asked to record their&#xD;
      exercise daily and will additionally complete the Physical Activity Scale for Individuals&#xD;
      with Physical Disabilities at baseline and week 12 time points.&#xD;
