      The risks and benefits of many diagnostic approaches and treatments differ for older adults&#xD;
      compared to middle aged adults. When diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are misapplied to&#xD;
      older adults this can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Well established examples&#xD;
      where clinicians do not often follow best practices in the care of older adults include those&#xD;
      identified by the American Geriatrics Society for the Choosing Wisely initiative: 1) testing&#xD;
      and treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria, 2) prostate specific antigen testing in older men&#xD;
      without prostate cancer, and 3) overuse of insulin or oral hypoglycemics for type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical decision support nudges, informed by social psychology and delivered via electronic&#xD;
      health records (EHRs), are promising strategies to reduce the misuse of services in cases&#xD;
      where optimal utilization may not be zero but should be well below current practice. These&#xD;
      interventions seek to influence conscious and unconscious drivers of clinical decision&#xD;
      making, are low cost to implement and disseminate, and can be incorporated into existing&#xD;
      delivery systems. In the R21 phase of this Behavioral Economics Applications to Geriatrics&#xD;
      Leveraging EHRs (BEAGLE) study, we will: select EHR delivered nudges to address 3 topics of&#xD;
      potential misuse in older adults based on the main psychological drivers of overuse&#xD;
      identified in interviews with high-using clinicians; develop and pilot test decision support&#xD;
      tools within a health systems' EHR to understand technical feasibility, work flow fit,&#xD;
      preliminary impact on clinical outcomes, and clinician acceptability; and develop and&#xD;
      validate electronic clinical quality measures of potential overuse/misuse related to the care&#xD;
      of older adults.&#xD;

      The risks and benefits of many diagnostic approaches and treatments differ for older adults&#xD;
      compared to middle aged adults. When diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are misapplied to&#xD;
      older adults this can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Well-established examples&#xD;
      where clinicians do not often follow best practices in the care of older adults include those&#xD;
      identified by the American Geriatrics Society for the Choosing Wisely initiative: 1) testing&#xD;
      and treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria, 2) prostate specific antigen testing in older men&#xD;
      without prostate cancer, and 3) overuse of insulin or oral hypoglycemics for type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      There are several hypotheses as to why clinicians fail to incorporate best evidence into&#xD;
      geriatric clinical care. First, they may underestimate downstream harms of testing which&#xD;
      seems easy to do (e.g., a urinalysis for a non-specific symptom) or treatment that may be&#xD;
      appropriate for younger patients (e.g. intensifying insulin to achieve tight control).&#xD;
      Second, clinicians may overweigh the risks of not performing the action (e.g., missing cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis, failing to diagnose UTI in a patient presenting without urinary tract symptoms).&#xD;
      Third, clinicians may respond to real or perceived social norms (from patients and their&#xD;
      families, other clinicians or both) that set expectations to behave in specific ways. Fourth,&#xD;
      force of habit may lead clinicians to act in a way similar to how they have done in the past&#xD;
      even if current evidence doesn't support it. And fifth, clinicians may overuse a test or&#xD;
      treatment to avoid feeling they are expressing an ageist bias toward their patients. Clinical&#xD;
      decision support nudges, informed by social psychology and delivered via electronic health&#xD;
      records (EHRs), are promising strategies to reduce the misuse of services in cases where&#xD;
      optimal utilization may not be zero but should be well below current practice. These&#xD;
      interventions seek to influence conscious and unconscious drivers of clinical decision&#xD;
      making, are low cost to implement and disseminate, and can be incorporated into existing&#xD;
      delivery systems. In the R21 phase of this Behavioral Economics Applications to Geriatrics&#xD;
