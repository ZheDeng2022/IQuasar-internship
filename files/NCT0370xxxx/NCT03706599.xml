      To evaluate the effect of a therapeutic education session on fever versus a control education&#xD;
      session on household accidents on the behavior and knowledge of families concerning the&#xD;
      management of infant fever between day 4 and day 7 after the intervention&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Increased attendance at pediatric emergencies is observed in many countries. Fever, a&#xD;
      frequent reason for consultation in pediatric emergencies, contributes to this phenomenon and&#xD;
      is known to cause panic reactions in parents that are not justified by the actual state of&#xD;
      the child. The accurate identification of families' lack of knowledge of fever has allowed us&#xD;
      to develop a therapeutic education session, after which families should be able to properly&#xD;
      care for a febrile child without excessive use of emergency services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that a therapeutic education session on fever in infancy, intended for&#xD;
      parents, carried out in pediatric emergencies, after a consultation for febrile illness will&#xD;
      allow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improve family behaviors and knowledge regarding fever in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  limit the number of new consultations to pediatric emergencies in the next 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project takes place in two successive phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First phase, which is now completed, consisted of 4 stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. Semi-structured interviews conducted by an anthropologist with parents of children&#xD;
           aged 3 months to 2 years who consulted pediatric emergencies for the reason &quot;fever&quot;. The&#xD;
           anthropologist questioned the families about their perceptions of the fever, the&#xD;
           perceived origin, the fears associated with this symptom, the behavior adopted, the&#xD;
           reasons for the consultation in these services:&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Development of a therapeutic education session for fever. This session was conceived&#xD;
           from the data of the literature but also from the results of the semi-directive&#xD;
           interviews, in particular to better correspond to the sociocultural characteristics of&#xD;
           the families consulting in pediatric emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           C. Elaboration of a questionnaire to evaluate behaviors and knowledge, called &quot;D-FI&quot;&#xD;
           questionnaire: the thematic cross-sectional analysis of the interviews led to the&#xD;
           construction of a knowledge assessment questionnaire on the management of fever in&#xD;
           infants by families. This questionnaire will assess the effectiveness of the therapeutic&#xD;
           education intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           D. Validation of the D-Fi questionnaire in a test population: the questionnaire was&#xD;
           administered to &quot;uneducated&quot; parents in the management of fever and to health&#xD;
           professionals. The results between these two groups were compared. Different aspects&#xD;
           have been studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Reliability of the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality of each selected item&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Internal validity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Calculation of a score to assess skills and knowledge on fever&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The study reported at Clinical trial corresponds to the second phase of this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial will evaluate the impact of the therapeutic education session&#xD;
      developed in Phase 1 on family behaviors and knowledge on fever compared to a control&#xD;
      intervention. The intervention control will be a health education session on the prevention&#xD;
      of domestic accidents. The D-Fi survey designed during the first phase will be used during&#xD;
      this test. The recruitment of consulting patients in two different hospitals, namely the&#xD;
      hospitals of Robert-Debré (Paris 19th) and Necker-Enfants Malades (Paris 15th), will widen&#xD;
      the socio-cultural diversity of the population included in this project and improve the&#xD;
      external validity of the study.&#xD;
