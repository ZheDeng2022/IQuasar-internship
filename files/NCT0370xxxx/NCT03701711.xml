  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) is a rare autoimmune disorder of the peripheral&#xD;
      nerves that presents with weakness, gait imbalance, and loss of sensation. It almost always&#xD;
      occurs in the setting of excess protein buildup in the body in the form of immunoglobulin&#xD;
      monoclonal (IgM) gammopathy. Anti-MAG neuropathy currently has no established therapies. It&#xD;
      is diagnosed through blood tests (anti-MAG and IgM), nerve conduction studies (which showed&#xD;
      marked velocity slowing), and clinical exam findings.The efficacy of lenalidomide has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in anti-MAG peripheral neuropathy with two separate dosing regimens: 25mg on&#xD;
      days 1-21 of each 28 day cycle in conjunction with oral dexamethasone 20mg/day on days 1-4 of&#xD;
      each cycle as well as at 5mg on days 1-21 of each cycle without oral dexamethasone. This&#xD;
      phase 1 study aims to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Lenalidomide in patients&#xD;
      with anti-MAG neuropathy. We will explore preliminary efficacy and postulate that this drug&#xD;
      is effective in this subset of patients, using preselected, specifically tailored outcome&#xD;
      measures that encompass quality of life, neurologic function, serum protein levels, and&#xD;
      focused measures of proprioception.&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in phase I of lenalidomide and recommended&#xD;
           dose in an extension cohort of lenalidomide of anti-MAG patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the safety profile of lenalidomide in anti-MAG patients Secondary Objective&#xD;
           To explore preliminary efficacy by using preselected, specifically tailored outcome&#xD;
           measures that encompass quality of life, neurologic function, serum protein levels, and&#xD;
           focused measures of proprioception&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Part 1: Dose Escalation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the dose escalation phase will receive oral treatment with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide: 10, 15, or 25 mg on Days 1-21 of every 28-day cycle Dexamethasone: 20mg on Days&#xD;
      1,8,15 and 22&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting doses of Lenalidomide will be assigned at the time of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find the MTD and select the dose level for each cohort enrolled, we will use the Bayesian&#xD;
      optimal interval design (BOIN).3-4 BOIN is implemented in a way that is similar to the&#xD;
      traditional 3+3 design but has superior operating characteristics that are comparable to much&#xD;
      more complex model-based designs, like the continual reassessment method (CRM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target toxicity rate will be 0.3 and the maximum sample size will be 12 patients. The&#xD;
      BOIN design does not require a fixed cohort size throughout the trial. Thus, we will&#xD;
      initially enroll in cohorts of size 1 but can modify subsequent cohort sizes as desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the enrollment of the maximum sample size, the MTD will be selected using isotonic&#xD;
      regression. The MTD will be the dose with the estimated toxicity rate closest to the target&#xD;
      rate of 0.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Dose Expansion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD has been established or determined, 8 additional patients will be treated at the&#xD;
      MTD of lenalidomide at the same schedule as above. Dexamethasone will be given at the same&#xD;
      dose as in the dose escalation portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have not had disease progression, have experienced acceptable toxicity or have&#xD;
      not withdrawn for any other reason after 24 months will be eligible to continue protocol&#xD;
      treatment at their current dose level until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or&#xD;
      refusal. Those patients who have not progressed and who have experienced unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity may be eligible for re-treatment at a lower dose. A maximum of 2 reductions are&#xD;
      allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for discontinuation of protocol therapy include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Request by the patient to withdraw&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unacceptable adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment delay of &gt;4weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intercurrent illness which would, in the judgment of the investigator, affect&#xD;
           assessments of clinical status to a significant degree that require discontinuation of&#xD;
           drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-protocol chemotherapy, or an experimental drug during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who discontinue treatment for any of the above reasons will go to event monitoring.&#xD;
      Once a patient has entered the event monitoring phase of the trial, his/her therapy is at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physician. Patients' charts will be reviewed for progression and&#xD;
      survival endpoints during visits with treating physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood (10ml purple top EDTA for immediate analysis and 6ml red top for possible&#xD;
      later cytokine evaluation) will be collected at pre-treatment and after cycles 1,2,3,6,9,12,&#xD;
      as well as 18 and 24 (for extension phase) for immunome correlative studies.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Treatment duration up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>A self-reported descriptive system that comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems (1), slight problems(2), moderate problems(3), severe problems(4) and extreme problems(5). The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The new version can define 3,125 (=55) different health states. The five figure score represents a 1-5 score in each of 5 domains; the lower the score in each domain the less severe the problems in that domain.</description>

    <description>The INCAT (Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment) disability score is a measure of activity limitation. It is used frequently as a primary endpoint in inflammatory polyneuropathy clinical trials. The INCAT disability score combines arm and leg disability in a total score ranging from 0 (no signs of disability) to 12 (most severe disability score). It provides a good functional description of the arms and legs in a checklist form suitable for interviewing patients.</description>
