      The Supervisory Neglect, Non-Accidental Trauma, Brief Intervention, and Treatment Referral&#xD;
      (SunBrite) protocol is a family-empowered, risk mitigation strategy that targets families&#xD;
      with young children who present to the ED with intracranial trauma. Based on the widely&#xD;
      utilized screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) protocol, SunBrite&#xD;
      has 3 core components: screening, brief motivational interview, and referral for treatment.&#xD;
      PCH will: 1) engage community partnerships to support SunBrite development; 2) utilize&#xD;
      participatory action research approach for design, implementation, process evaluation, and&#xD;
      dissemination of the pilot program; and 3) evaluate intervention implementation and pilot&#xD;
      outcomes. Over a 2-year period, this study will encompass a pilot intervention and&#xD;
      implementation assessment and a randomized trial to evaluate outcomes. Implementation of&#xD;
      SunBrite will yield rigorous scientific evidence for a sustainable, evidenced-based,&#xD;
      widely-needed non-accidental (NAT) screening and intervention for families with young&#xD;
      children.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SunBrite is a novel, evidence-based intervention for non-accidental trauma (NAT) that has&#xD;
      not, as yet, been implemented in any health care setting. Current programs targeting NAT vary&#xD;
      widely, and there is insufficient research to conclude that these efforts have reduced&#xD;
      re-admission rates(12,13). EDs primarily screen for risk factors associated with child abuse,&#xD;
      focusing on their role in reporting and developing forensic evidence for investigations but&#xD;
      not on risk reduction. While such efforts as embedding child protection teams in trauma&#xD;
      programs are a starting point, much more needs to be done to develop a standard of care and&#xD;
      empirically demonstrate efforts that reduce the risk of subsequent injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overlap between non-accidental trauma (NAT) and inadequate caregiver supervision provides&#xD;
      an opportunity to identify and intervene during earlier health care visits for children at&#xD;
      risk for severe or fatal injury. Because head injuries account for over 80% of all suspected&#xD;
      non-accidental injuries and over 90% of fatalities in the pediatric population, this&#xD;
      intervention specifically targets all children ages 0-2 years who present in the Phoenix&#xD;
      Children's Hospital (PCH) ED with a diagnosed head injury of any kind not resulting from a&#xD;
      motor vehicle collision (MVC). These injuries include, but ae not limited to, abrasions,&#xD;
      contusions, hematoma, ischemia, fractures, swelling or bruising. In this way, SunBrite&#xD;
      expands the scope of detection for NAT to include injuries resulting from supervisory&#xD;
      neglect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCH will implement the SunBrite pilot protocol in collaboration with key community partners&#xD;
      who will be extensively involved in project design, implementation, and evaluation. In&#xD;
      preparation for study recruitment, PCH and its partners will formalize the SunBrite process,&#xD;
      create a curriculum, draft training tools to support the fidelity of SunBrite, finalize study&#xD;
      materials (e.g., worksheets, data collection forms, interview scripts, consent documentation,&#xD;
      and logic model), and conduct professional training. Once development is complete, pediatric&#xD;
      patient families will be enrolled into the pilot program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SunBrite study will utilize a simple, randomized, prospective study design, with 221 eligible&#xD;
      pilot study participants randomized upon triage to one of two study arms: the control arm (73&#xD;
      families) or the treatment arm (148 families). Families in the control group will receive&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU), which includes reporting to child welfare agencies when&#xD;
      appropriate. In the treatment group, the patient/family will receive the SunBrite protocol,&#xD;
      whose components include a screening, a brief intervention based in motivational interviewing&#xD;
      (MI) techniques, and referral to treatment. All abuse and neglect, no matter the study arm,&#xD;
      will be reported in accordance with hospital policy, federal and state laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All self-identified primary caregivers (legal guardians or parents) of children ages 0-2 who&#xD;
      present in the PCH ED with a diagnosed intracranial injury will be automatically screened for&#xD;
      eligibility. Caregivers will be initially screened by ED clinicians (e.g., physicians,&#xD;
      nurse-practitioners) for eligibility based on age, injury (head), and method of injury (MOI)&#xD;
      (non-MVC) using a standard clinical interview currently in place. All caregivers who screen&#xD;
      positive based on these three criteria will then be deemed eligible for SunBrite. A trauma&#xD;
      social worker will be notified by the ED that they have an eligible patient for consult. The&#xD;
      social worker will meet the family and briefly describe the study and their eligibility. If&#xD;
      they are willing to participate, the social worker will then obtain informed consent. All&#xD;
      patient families will be fully consented in person in English or Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment will occur in the ED in the form&#xD;
      of an abbreviated social work consultation prior to discharge. A social worker will complete&#xD;
      an assessment for supervisory and household risks and then complete an injury risk worksheet&#xD;
      to be used in the brief intervention. The social worker will engage caregivers in a 20- to&#xD;
      30-minute motivational interview (i.e., social work consult) using parent-coaching techniques&#xD;
      for medical settings(12). In-person coaching facilitates active practice of these skills,&#xD;
      supports further development of desired behaviors, and promotes long-term, sustainable risk&#xD;
      mitigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The referral-to-treatment component of SunBrite identifies risks that may require further&#xD;
      professional intervention, such as a history of trauma, mental illness, or substance abuse.&#xD;
      For risks that warrant longer-term treatment, social workers will make referrals to external&#xD;
      agencies and professionals for psychiatric evaluation, medication management,&#xD;
      medically-assisted treatment (MAT), cognitive-behavioral therapy, and PTSD treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from all participants, regardless of randomization, will be collected from patient&#xD;
      health records. This will include patient demographics, injury characteristics, labs,&#xD;
      imaging, consults, diagnoses, treatments, complications, and discharge notes. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed for up to 12 months to assess study outcomes. The primary outcomes for this study&#xD;
      are rates re-hospitalization (including frequency of hospitalization and length of stay) and&#xD;
      return ED visits for any ICD-10 code. Secondary outcomes include complications from the&#xD;
      indexed traumatic injury, other illnesses and conditions unrelated to trauma, and cost&#xD;
      savings from reduced ED return visits and admissions. Based on PCH admissions data, we expect&#xD;
      that 50% of eligible patients will return to the ED with an injury within one year of&#xD;
      discharge. In addition to tracking all patients for 12 months post-discharge for any&#xD;
      diagnosis at PCH, we will match our participants to the statewide database housed at the&#xD;
      Arizona State University (ASU) Center for Health Information Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitatively, we hypothesize that the proportion of patients measured on the primary&#xD;
      outcome (return to ED) for the experimental group will be statistically smaller than the&#xD;
      proportion in the control group under the following assumptions of a superiority design: 1)&#xD;
      the percentage of patients that we expect to return to the ED is approximately 50% for the&#xD;
      control group within one year of discharge to home and 25% for the experimental group; 2) the&#xD;
      risk of type I error is alpha=.025; 3) power=.80. These parameters require a total sample&#xD;
      size of 134 with a sample size of 67 for each group. However, we are planning to randomize in&#xD;
      an unequal allocation of 2:1 to the experimental arm and oversample by 10%, bringing the&#xD;
      total sample size up to 221 (148 in the experimental arm and 73 in the control arm). This&#xD;
      design has an advantage in early phase trials, allowing investigators to explore treatment&#xD;
      dimensions and optimize treatment utility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also employ qualitative methods to provide rich feedback to enhance the&#xD;
      implementation process and ensure project fidelity (e.g., identifying barriers and strategies&#xD;
      to sustainability and wider dissemination). A formative evaluation of SunBrite will follow a&#xD;
      plan, do, review, revise cycle of performance management that addresses the following&#xD;
      intervention components: screening, staffing, brief intervention fidelity, referral, data&#xD;
      collection, and reporting. . Quarterly advisory board meetings with community partners&#xD;
      throughout the pilot program will provide an opportunity to update stakeholders on the pilot&#xD;
      and receive feedback on implementation. Interviews with key stakeholders occurring at the&#xD;
      start of the pilot, during program recruitment, and at the end of the recruitment process&#xD;
      will provide important feedback to keep the pilot on track and achieve program goals.&#xD;
      Voluntary interviews will assess experience with implementation and acceptability of SunBrite&#xD;
      as implemented. Significantly, a research plan will be developed to validate SunBrite in a&#xD;
      multi-site randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prepare for SunBrite information dissemination statewide, PCH will facilitate ongoing&#xD;
      development of a formalized screening tool for use in EDs and manualize the SunBrite brief&#xD;
      intervention and referral system. We will also design a dissemination plan (including&#xD;
      funding) for SunBrite to incorporate a telemedicine option for the brief intervention. We&#xD;
      will also disseminate findings from the pilot nationally through speaking engagements,&#xD;
      conferences, posters, and published papers. In coordination with our community partners, we&#xD;
      will develop a plan to sustain SunBrite in the PCH ED and to promote dissemination to other&#xD;
      trauma centers.&#xD;
