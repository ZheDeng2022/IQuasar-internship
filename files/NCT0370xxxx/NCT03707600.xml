  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OBJECTIVES: The current protocol seeks to develop brain-based intermediate phenotypes of&#xD;
      response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in chronic substance use disorder (SUD).&#xD;
      To date the field has relied on subjective reports, behavioral performance, and long-term&#xD;
      clinical outcomes as primary measures of TMS efficacy. While certainly ecologically valid,&#xD;
      these observable behaviors lack the sensitivity necessary to fully quantify the effects (or&#xD;
      lack thereof) across both individual participants and TMS intervention protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed within-subjects design seeks to leverage differences in metaplasticity that is,&#xD;
      the context in which stimulation occurs-by studying the response to stimulation in both sated&#xD;
      and abstinent states. It is predicted these state manipulations will potentiate response to&#xD;
      TMS. When a disruptive allostatic load like chronic nicotine exposure or acute abstinence is&#xD;
      placed on the brain, the underlying network becomes less stable and thus more susceptible to&#xD;
      TMS intervention. For SUD in general and tobacco use disorder (TUD) in particular, this state&#xD;
      dependence of TMS response is a potentially valuable tool to improve a given intervention s&#xD;
      clinical efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION: Physically and psychiatrically healthy smokers will be recruited. A&#xD;
      comparison group of non-smokers will be concurrently enrolled. We estimate we will require&#xD;
      n=51/group of completers to have sufficient power to develop the intermediate phenotypes of&#xD;
      TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: The protocol is a two group, between/within subject, fully counterbalanced design.&#xD;
      The between-subjects factor is GROUP (smoker/non-smoker) and the within-subjects factor for&#xD;
      each GROUP is TMS CONDITION (active/sham). Additionally, and for the smoker group, nicotine&#xD;
      STATE (sated/abstinent) is a nested within-subjects factor. Each group will receive single&#xD;
      sessions of active and sham intermittent theta burst stimulation to left dorsal lateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex, followed immediately by an MRI scan to characterize the acute&#xD;
      neurobiological response to stimulation. Smokers will repeat these procedures both during&#xD;
      smoking satiety and following an ~48-hour period nicotine abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES PARAMETERS: In addition to subjective and behavioral task performance changes&#xD;
      associated with TMS intervention, changes in MRI BOLD signal will be used to characterize the&#xD;
      neurobiological response to TMS intervention across groups and states. Taken together, the&#xD;
      development of brain-based markers of TMS response may thus improve both our mechanistic&#xD;
      understanding of the causal dysfunctions of TUD as well as the potential efficacy of these&#xD;
      interventions longer term to address the relevant clinical characteristics of the disease and&#xD;
      ultimately improve treatment outcomes.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA (MAIN STUDY):&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be between the ages of 18-60. Justification: Many neural processes change with age,&#xD;
             and these changes could introduce unwanted variability in both behavioral and MRI&#xD;
             signals. In addition, the risk of difficult-to-detect medical abnormalities such as&#xD;
             silent cerebral infarcts increase with age. Assessment tools: History. Government-&#xD;
             issued forms of identification (e.g. driver s license, birth certificate) will be&#xD;
             required when participant appears to be out of age range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be in good health. Justification: Many illnesses may alter fMRI signals as well as&#xD;
             cognitive processes and neural functioning. Assessment tools: Medical Assessment,&#xD;
             Medical History and Physical Examination. Medical assessments include: Vital Signs,&#xD;
             EKG, oral HIV test, height/weight measurements, urinalysis and blood sample. Tests on&#xD;
             the blood sample include CBC, complete metabolic profile, TSH, ESR, STS and HIV (if&#xD;
             needed to confirm a positive salivary test for HIV). The following individual&#xD;
             laboratory results will independently disqualify individuals: Cholesterol greater than&#xD;
             250 mg/dl, Hemoglobin less than 10.5 g/dl, WBC less than 2400/ (Micro)l, LFTs less&#xD;
             than 3 times upper normal, HCG positive, Casual serum glucose less than 200 mg/dl,&#xD;
             Urine protein less than 1+. The MAI will retain discretion to exclude at less extreme&#xD;
             values, depending on the clinical presentation. (Serum glucose over 140 mg/dl will be&#xD;
             followed up with a fasting serum glucose assessment. Those with fasting glucose below&#xD;
             100 mg/dl may be considered for the protocol. Others will be rejected and referred for&#xD;
             work-up.) Liver function will be evaluated with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and&#xD;
             alanine transaminase (ALT). A greater than 3 times upper normal limit for AST or ALT&#xD;
             will disqualify individuals. MAI will make the final judgment on any questionable lab&#xD;
             results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be right-handed. Justification: Using right-handed individuals will reduce variability&#xD;
             in BOLD MRI data. Assessment tool: Edinburgh Handedness Inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be able to abstain from alcohol and other substances 24hrs and caffeine for 12 hours&#xD;
             before each of the imaging sessions. Justification: Alcohol and caffeine (among other&#xD;
             substances) modulate neural functioning in a way that would complicate data&#xD;
             interpretation. Assessment tools: Self-report, urine drug screen and breathalyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For smoker group, must have a urine cotinine level of greater than 4 as measured by a&#xD;
             semi-quantitative in vitro diagnostic (e.g., NicAlert) and have been smoking a regular&#xD;
             combustible tobacco product consistently for at least one year. Based on the&#xD;
             correlation between self-reported cpd/FTND and urine cotinine levels, a single&#xD;
             inclusion criterion will be easier to manage and provide adequate characterization of&#xD;
             dependent smokers. Urine cotinine level provides a biomarker that does not rely on&#xD;
             self-report/memory. Quit attempts will be assessed via clinical interview and&#xD;
             judgment. Justification: The present protocol is interested in neurobiological&#xD;
             mechanisms that underlie nicotine dependence-induced plasticity, and is thus&#xD;
             contingent on the presence of nicotine dependence. Assessment tools: Self-report,&#xD;
             NicAlert of 4 or higher (or other nicotine/cotinine lab test equivalent to 200ng/ml&#xD;
             cotinine concentration)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the smoker group, must be willing to attempt an acute abstinence period lasting&#xD;
             approximately 48 hours on 2 separate occasions. Justification: We aim to look at the&#xD;
             response to stimulation in both drug sated and abstinent states in smokers. Assessment&#xD;
             tool: Self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the non-smoking control group, less than 20 cigarettes lifetime, no cigarette or&#xD;
             other nicotine product in past year and no history of daily use of any other nicotine&#xD;
             products for &gt; 2 weeks. Justification: Minimal cigarette exposure in the control group&#xD;
             is required to assess differences between healthy control and the smoker groups.&#xD;
             Assessment tools: Self-report, NicAlert of less than or equal 2, CO less than 6 or MAI&#xD;
             discretion if there is a reasonable planation for high CO exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (MAIN STUDY):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or personal history of cerebrovascular or neurological illnesses including,&#xD;
             but not limited to, seizure disorders, frequent migraines or on prophylaxis, multiple&#xD;
             sclerosis, movement disorders, history of significant head trauma, or CNS tumor.&#xD;
             Current or personal history of any neurological disorders that would increase seizure&#xD;
             risk from iTBS such as stroke, brain lesions, previous neurosurgery, any history of&#xD;
             seizure or fainting episode of unknown cause, or head trauma resulting in loss of&#xD;
             consciousness, lasting over 30 minutes or with sequela lasting longer than three&#xD;
             months, regardless of loss of consciousness. Justification: Cerebrovascular and&#xD;
             neurological conditions may alter blood flow, CNS function, the fMRI signal and other&#xD;
             autonomic signals. Additionally, neurological disorders such as stroke, vascular&#xD;
             lesions or head trauma can lower the seizure threshold and are therefore&#xD;
             contra-indications for iTBS. Fainting episodes or syncope of unknown cause could&#xD;
             indicate an undiagnosed condition associated with seizures. Assessment tools: TMS&#xD;
             Safety Screen and Medical History and Physical Exam. The MAI who will also retain&#xD;
             discretion to exclude based on a history of neurological illness that may compromise&#xD;
             data integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  First-degree family history of any neurological disorder with a potentially hereditary&#xD;
             basis, including migraines, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis. Justification:&#xD;
             Neurological disorders can lower the seizure threshold and are therefore&#xD;
             contra-indications for iTBS. First -degree family history of certain neurological&#xD;
             disorder with a hereditary component increases the risk of the participant having an&#xD;
             undiagnosed conditi n that is associated with lowered seizure threshold. Assessment&#xD;
             tools: TMS Safety Screen and Medical History.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Implantable defibrillator, implanted medication pumps, cardiac pacemaker,&#xD;
             neurostimulator, some artificial joints, metal pins, surgical clips, intracardiac&#xD;
             lines, or acute unstable cardiac disease with intracranial implants (e.g. aneurysm&#xD;
             clips, shunts, stimulators, cochlear implants or electrodes) or any other implant or&#xD;
             metal object in the body that precludes MRI scanning or iTBS administrations.&#xD;
             Justification: certain metal in the body is a contra-indication for MRI scanning and&#xD;
             iTBS administration, which involves exposure to a relatively strong static magnetic&#xD;
             field that can move magnetic material not securely bound and rapidly alternating&#xD;
             magnetic fields that can generate heat and current in metal contained in the body.&#xD;
             Assessment tools: TMS Safety Screen, MRI Safety Screen and Medical History.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are not suitable to undergo an fMRI experiment due to body morphology or&#xD;
             claustrophobia. Justification: MR scanning is one of the primary measurement tools&#xD;
             used in the protocol. Assessment tools: MRI Safety Screen, Medical History.&#xD;
             Prospective participants will be questioned about symptoms of claustrophobia and may&#xD;
             be placed in the mock scanner during screening to assess for possible difficulty&#xD;
             tolerating the confinement of the scanner and for ability to fit into the scanner.&#xD;
             Noise-induced hearing loss or tinnitus. Justification: individuals with noise-induced&#xD;
             hearing problems may be particularly vulnerable to the acoustic noise generated by&#xD;
             iTBS equipment and MRI (even with the use of sound attenuation ear plugs). Assessment&#xD;
             tools: TMS Safety Screen, MRI Safety Screen, Medical History.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use (any use in the past 4 weeks, daily use for more than a week within the&#xD;
             past 6 months) of any substances (excluding alcohol, see criteria 9), investigational&#xD;
             drug or of any medications with psychotropic, anti- or pro-convulsive action, or anti&#xD;
             coagulants. This will be determined at the discretion of the MAI. Justification: the&#xD;
             use of certain medications or drugs can lower seizure threshold during use or&#xD;
             withdrawal and is therefore contra-indicated for iTBS. Assessment tools: Medical&#xD;
             History, urine toxicology analysis for the presence of a broad range of prescription&#xD;
             and non-prescription drugs. Lifetime history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,&#xD;
             mania, or hypomania. Justification: The population of interest here is a healthy&#xD;
             population with no psychiatric disorders other than tobacco use disorders. In&#xD;
             participants with bipolar disorder, mania or hypomania, there is a small chance that&#xD;
             iTBS can trigger (hypo)manic symptoms. Assessment tools: M.I.N.I. Potential diagnoses&#xD;
             will be further evaluated by a counselor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current major psychiatric disorders to include, but not limited to, mood, anxiety,&#xD;
             psychotic disorders, or substance-induced psychiatric disorders, or any current&#xD;
             suicidal ideations or currently under antidepressant or antipsychotic medication&#xD;
             treatment. The MAI will reserve the right to exclude on the basis of psychiatric&#xD;
             history not explicitly described in this criterion. Justification: Psychiatric&#xD;
             disorders involve the central neural system (CNS) and, therefore, can be expected to&#xD;
             alter the fMRI measures being used in this study. Assessment tools: M.I.N.I., Beck&#xD;
             Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Adult ADHD Self-Report Scales and&#xD;
             clinical terview confirmation by clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meet current DSM-5 criteria for moderate to severe substance use disorder, for alcohol&#xD;
             or any drug (except nicotine for the smoker group). Past substance use disorder (SUD)&#xD;
             is acceptable based on MAI determination. Those with past SUD of substances other than&#xD;
             alcohol or marijuana may not have any current use (past 6 months) of the substance on&#xD;
             which they were dependent. Individuals with past SUD of either alcohol or marijuana&#xD;
             who report current use of the previously dependent substance may be included provided&#xD;
             they do not currently meet withdrawal criteria. Justification: SUD of other substances&#xD;
             (drugs or alcohol) may result in unique CNS deficits that could confound results and&#xD;
             introduce excessive variance. Assessment tools: The Mini International&#xD;
             Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I) and clinical SUD assessment, Drug Use Survey,&#xD;
             Addiction Severity Index. A positive drug test for marijuana will not be exclusionary&#xD;
             as long as participants, based on self- report, have not used in the 24hrs preceding&#xD;
             the imaging visits. In the event of a positive drug test for marijuana, self-reports&#xD;
             of current marijuana use will be used to differentiate intermittent/infrequent from&#xD;
             chronic/frequent users.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of myocardial infarction, angina, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
             stroke or transient ischemic attack, mitral valve prolapse, or any heart condition&#xD;
             currently under medical care. Justification: the risk of iTBS for individuals with a&#xD;
             heart condition is unknown, further such conditions may alter blood flow, the fMRI&#xD;
             signal and other autonomic signals. These conditions are also likely to add&#xD;
             considerable additional variability to the data. Assessment tools: physical&#xD;
             assessment, EKG, medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant, sexually active and not using an acceptable form of birth&#xD;
             control. Justification: study procedures used in the current protocol (MRI, iTBS) may&#xD;
             complicate pregnancy. Assessment tools: Urine and/or serum pregnancy tests, and&#xD;
             clinical interview. Urine pregnancy tests will also be conducted at the beginning of&#xD;
             each imaging visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in any NIBS session (excluding the current protocol) less than two weeks&#xD;
             ago. No NIBS exposure for treatment purposes in the last 6 months. Justification: in&#xD;
             order to avoid possible carry-over effects from previous exposure to NIBS prior to&#xD;
             participation in the proposed intervention, we will not enroll participants who have&#xD;
             received any NIBS in the two weeks preceding enrollment or treatment with NIBS&#xD;
             modality with the last 6 months preceding enrollment. Assessment tools: TMS safety&#xD;
             screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitively impaired or learning disabled. Justification: Cognitive impairment and&#xD;
             learning disabilities may be associated with altered brain functioning in regions&#xD;
             recruited during laboratory task performance. Cognitive impairment may affect one s&#xD;
             ability to give informed consent. Assessment tool: Medical History and Wechsler&#xD;
             Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). IQ estimate must be 80 or over.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have coagulopathies, history of, current superficial, or deep vein thrombosis,&#xD;
             musculoskeletal abnormalities restricting an individual s ability to lie flat for&#xD;
             extended periods of time. Justification: MR scanning sessions require participants to&#xD;
             lie flat on their backs and remain perfectly still for approximately two hours.&#xD;
             Therefore, conditions that would make that difficult (e.g. chronic back pain,&#xD;
             significant scoliosis) or dangerous (e.g. familial hypercoagulability syndrome,&#xD;
             history of thrombosis) will be exclusionary. Assessment tools: History and physical&#xD;
             examination by a qualified IRP clinician, supplemented with a trial of lying in the&#xD;
             mock scanner to ssess comfort issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regularly use any prescription (e.g., antidepressants, benzodiazepines,&#xD;
             antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, barbiturates), over-the-counter (e.g., cold medicine)&#xD;
             or herbal medication (e.g., Kava, Gingko biloba, St. John s wort) that may alter CNS&#xD;
             function, cardiovascular function, or neuronal-vascular coupling. Justification: The&#xD;
             use of these substances may alter the fMRI signal and/or neural functions of interest&#xD;
             in the current study. Assessment tools: History and comprehensive urine drug screening&#xD;
             to detect antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and&#xD;
             barbiturates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA (PROTOCOL TRIANING):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be Right-handed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: Differences in hemispheric dominance could confound iTBS&#xD;
                  administration and MRI measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening tool: Self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be in good health.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: Many illnesses may increase likelihood of TMS ...&#xD;
