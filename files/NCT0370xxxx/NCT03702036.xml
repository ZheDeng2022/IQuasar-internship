      Compassionate use access to molibresib/GSK525762 for eligible participant with NUT Midline&#xD;
      Carcinoma; indication is a seriously debilitating or life-threatening disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigational Product GSK525762 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that is a potent&#xD;
      inhibitor of the binding of BET proteins to acetylated histones. Binding of GSK525762 induces&#xD;
      squamous differentiation and inhibits proliferation of patient-derived NMC cell lines both in&#xD;
      culture and in murine xenografts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compassionate use access to molibresib is restricted to patients with confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
      NUT Midline Carcinoma.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants meeting all three of the following criteria will be eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diagnosis of NUT Midline Carcinoma based on ectopic expression of NUT protein as&#xD;
                  determined by IHC and/or detection of NUT gene translocation as determined by&#xD;
                  FISH.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  there is no satisfactory alternative treatment; and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  there is reason to believe that the benefit:risk ratio for molibresib in the&#xD;
                  indication is positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Written informed consent can be obtained from the participant or legally authorised&#xD;
             representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant must be ≥16 years of age, at the time of signing the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Demonstrate adequate organ function defined as :Hematological Absolute neutrophil&#xD;
             count (ANC) ≥1.5 X 109/liter (L) ; Platelets ≥100 X 109/L ; Hemoglobin≥9.0 g/deciliter&#xD;
             ; total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x X ULN (upper limit of normal)(isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 X ULN&#xD;
             is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35% or participant&#xD;
             has a diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome) ; Alanine transaminase ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN&#xD;
             with documented liver metastases/tumor infiltration; Prothrombin Time (PT) or Partial&#xD;
             Thromboplastin Time (PTT) ≤ 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN); Renal creatinine OR&#xD;
             calculated creatinine clearance [calculated or directly measured] ≤1.5 X ULN or ≥ 50&#xD;
             mL/min; Ejection fraction ≥ Lower limit of normal (LLN); Troponin ≤ ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female participants who are not pregnant, breastfeeding and at least one of the&#xD;
             following applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Is not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR Is a WOCBP and using a&#xD;
             contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year,&#xD;
             see Appendix 5), preferably with low user dependency, during the intervention period&#xD;
             and for at least 7 months after the last dose of molibresib. The investigator should&#xD;
             evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first&#xD;
             dose of molibresib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female participants of childbearing potential: Negative highly sensitive serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test (as required by local regulations) within 72 hours prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of molibresib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. NOTE: The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history&#xD;
             and recent sexual activity to decrease risk for inclusion of a woman with an early&#xD;
             undetected pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Male participants are eligible to participate if agree to the following during&#xD;
             intervention period and for at least 16 weeks after the last dose of molibresib:&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Refrain from donating sperm&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. PLUS, if have a female partner of childbearing potential, either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
        (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent -OR- Agree to&#xD;
        use a male condom and if female partner is not pregnant, partner to use an additional&#xD;

             per investigator assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases (e.g., unstable or uncompensated&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive hepatitis C antibody test&#xD;
             result at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: Participants with positive Hepatitis C antibody due to prior resolved disease&#xD;
             can be enrolled only if a confirmatory negative Hepatitis C RNA PCR is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of known HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Hemoptysis &gt;1 teaspoon in 24 hours within the last 28 days.&#xD;
