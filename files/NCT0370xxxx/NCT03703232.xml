    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to obtain performance measurements and participant feedback about&#xD;
      use of an investigational prosthetic foot compared to the participant's usual prosthetic&#xD;
      foot. To accomplish this, the study will use a combination of laboratory motion analysis,&#xD;
      functional tests, and community mobility trials where participants complete questionnaires&#xD;
      and interviews about use of an investigational prosthetic foot compared to the participant's&#xD;
      usual prosthetic foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with amputations that participate in the (optional) motion analysis sub-study at&#xD;
      the University of Washington will complete forward walking, side-step, and across river rock&#xD;
      with usual foot (session 1), and also with the investigational foot locked and unlocked&#xD;
      (session 2) after an accommodation period of between 1-4 weeks. The participants will rate&#xD;
      their experiences using socket comfort score and the socket pressure score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control participants recruited at the University of Washington to provide information about&#xD;
      performance for people without amputation will go through the consenting process, then will&#xD;
      be asked to complete forward walking, Figure-of-8 Walk Test, Narrowing Beam Walking Test,&#xD;
      side-step, and walking across river rock surface. These tests will be conducted at a single&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If the participant with an amputation is eligible and wishes to participate, an appointment&#xD;
      will be made for the person to come to the University of Washington Motion Analysis Lab or&#xD;
      WillowWood, in Mt. Sterling, Ohio. The participant will meet with a researcher and clinical&#xD;
      prosthetist to go through the consenting process. At that time, participants will complete&#xD;
      the demographic data questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prosthetist will assess the condition and fit of the participant's current prosthesis for&#xD;
      alignment, fit, and condition. The prosthetist will also inspect the participant's residual&#xD;
      limb for skin condition. People presenting with significant skin breakdown will not be&#xD;
      eligible to participate. The prosthetist will also determine how best to set up the current&#xD;
      socket system with the investigational foot at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motion analysis trials of the investigational foot compared to the participant's usual foot.&#xD;
      Participants will complete forward walking, side-step, and across river rock with usual foot&#xD;
      (session 1), and also with the investigational foot locked and unlocked (session 2) after an&#xD;
      accommodation period of between 1-4 weeks. The UW will conduct optically-based motion&#xD;
      analysis using an 8-camera Qualisys motion capture system 4 embedded tri-axial ground&#xD;
      reaction force platforms and a river rock-substrate surface that is parallel to the main&#xD;
      motion capture space. For all motion analysis tests, retroreflective markers are taped to&#xD;
      anatomical landmarks that are compatible with Visual 3-D kinematic modeling software. Motion&#xD;
      data are captured at 120 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motion Analysis Tests Forward walking. Participants will walk at a self-selected speed on a&#xD;
      level surface for 10 m. In the center of the calibrated walking area, the participant will&#xD;
      step on force plates. Marker position and reaction forces will be recorded for 2 sequential&#xD;
      steps of the prosthetic side for participants with amputations, or matched side for control&#xD;
      subjects. After a practice test, 3 tests where the prosthetic side successfully contacts the&#xD;
      force plates will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side-step. Participants will perform the test in a similar manner to forward walking but will&#xD;
      instead move laterally over the 10 m surface and across the centrally placed force plates.&#xD;
      The order of side-stepping to the right or left will be randomly assigned. Participants will&#xD;
      be asked not to cross-over their feet. After a practice test, 3 tests in each direction,&#xD;
      where the prosthetic side or matched side successfully contacts the force plates, will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Walking across river rock surface. Participants will walk in a direct path through the center&#xD;
      of the river rock. They will be wearing a safety harness and will be attached to an overhead&#xD;
      moving protection system. Participants will use the visual field limiting goggles during the&#xD;
      river rock walking test. After practice tests, 3 tests will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified socket comfort score and pressure score. Following each test protocol, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to rate the socket comfort during the activity from 0 to 10 (with 0 being the&#xD;
      least comfortable and 10 being the most comfortable imaginable) and pressures of the&#xD;
      prosthetic socket on their residual limb during the activity from 0 to 10 (with zero being&#xD;
      none and 10 being the highest imaginable). Participants will be asked to qualify the score&#xD;
      with subjective comments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community Walking Trials (CWT) of the Investigational foot. To assess the benefit of the&#xD;
      investigational foot, a combination of subjective and objective measures will be collected&#xD;
      following 2- to 4-week periods of use. During the first laboratory visit, subjects will&#xD;
      complete functional tasks with their existing prosthesis, as well as complete the Prosthetic&#xD;
      Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) and the Comprehensive Lower Limb Amputee Socket Survey&#xD;
      (CLASS). Next, they will be fit with the investigational foot and complete a 2- to 4-week&#xD;
      at-home use period. A team member will contact the participant about one week after they&#xD;
      start using the investigational foot to see how things are going and if there are any issues&#xD;
      or problems to address (such as is the degree of stiffness appropriate) that may prompt a&#xD;
      re-fitting. If this occurs, the 2- to 4-week at-home use period will re-start, increasing the&#xD;
      participant's total amount of time in the study. During at-home use, participants will be&#xD;
      prompted to complete a daily, structured, online logbook formatted in REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second visit, subjects will again complete the PEQ and CLASS, and repeat the same&#xD;
      functional tasks as at the first visit but while wearing the investigational foot (locked and&#xD;
      unlocked linkage). During this visit, a semi-structured interview will be conducted and&#xD;
      recorded using Zoom. At the end of the visit, subjects will be re-fit with their original&#xD;
      prosthetic foot and will complete another 2- to 4-week at-home use period with logbook&#xD;
      entries before completing study questionnaires and a final interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative instruments - Community Walking Trials PEQ Subscales: The PEQ is a 9-scale&#xD;
      instrument that has good psychometric properties and has been validated. The PEQ subscales&#xD;
      vary from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). PEQ subscales of residual limb health, ambulation,&#xD;
      utility, and sounds were selected for this study and comprise a total of 24 visual analogue&#xD;
      scale questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLASS: The intent of the CLASS is to provide greater insight into the cause of socket&#xD;
      dissatisfaction compared to the Socket Comfort Score. To accomplish this, the CLASS includes&#xD;
      4 subcategories; 1) stability, 2) suspension, 3) comfort, and 4) appearance. Each subcategory&#xD;
      contains 3-4 items scored using a 5-point scale that relate to common tasks such as standing,&#xD;
      sitting, walking, and ascending and descending stairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured interview: Participants' lived experiences using the investigational foot in&#xD;
      comparison to the participant's usual foot will be collected using qualitative research&#xD;
      methods. There will be an exit interview using open-ended questions to obtain qualitative&#xD;
      data on foot performance and comparisons of foot prostheses. The interviews will be audio&#xD;
      recorded. Interviews may be conducted remotely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily Log Book: During home use of the participant's usual foot and the investigational foot,&#xD;
      participants will keep an activity log (completed either electronically or on paper) that&#xD;
      encourages descriptions of activities, including strengths and limitations of foot&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Tasks Figure-of-8 Walk Test: Subjects will begin the task standing between the 2&#xD;
      cones. The subject will walk a figure-of-8 course 3 times for each condition at their&#xD;
      self-selected pace and stop when they return to the start position. Time to complete the test&#xD;
      and number of steps will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Narrowing Beam Walking Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test consists of walking across a beam that has 4, 6-foot long sections, each one&#xD;
      narrower than the previous one. The narrowing beam is 2&quot; above the floor. When ready, the&#xD;
      subject will begin walking along the beam while keeping their feet pointed in the direction&#xD;
      of the beam (no side-stepping allowed). Subjects must keep their arms crossed in front of&#xD;
      their body to eliminate the use of their arms to maintain balance. For this test of balance,&#xD;
      the distance along the beam will be measured.&#xD;
