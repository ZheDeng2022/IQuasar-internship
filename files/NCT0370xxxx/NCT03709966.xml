  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intervention proposed for this project aims to improve the practice of physical activity&#xD;
      (PA) for people with type 2 diabetes by increasing their motivation using a portable device&#xD;
      to monitor PA (FitBit). This study will provide preliminary data to assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      the intervention, its acceptability for patients with type 2 diabetes, and its potential&#xD;
      impact of PA motivation and PA level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is recognized that the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits, such as the practice of&#xD;
      physical activity (PA) on a regular and constant basis, contributes significantly to reducing&#xD;
      the prevalence of diabetes and its complications. The use of portable technological support&#xD;
      to monitor PA can contribute to a favorable behavioral change in people with chronic diseases&#xD;
      such as diabetes. Objective: The intervention proposed for this project aims to improve the&#xD;
      practice of PA for people with type 2 diabetes, by increasing their motivation using a&#xD;
      portable device tracking of PA (FitBit). The device is similar to a wrist-sport watch with&#xD;
      many features including step calculations, distance traveled, calories burned, but also heart&#xD;
      rate and sleep status. The information recorded by the watch can be synchronized and&#xD;
      transmitted directly to the FitBit application, allowing it to be viewed and tracked on a&#xD;
      daily basis, and also the ability to produce weekly and monthly reports and adjust personal&#xD;
      goals. Methods: This study consists in a pilot randomized controlled trial of 30 Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes patients already followed by health professionals from a University-affiliated&#xD;
      Family Medicine Group (GMF-U Quatre-Bourgeois). Patients are randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      these two conditions: routine follow-up, including a PA promotion intervention supported by a&#xD;
      kinesiologist from the research center of the Institut de cardiologie et de pneumologie de&#xD;
      Québec (CRIUCPQ) or FitBit follow-up, which consists of routine follow-up with the adding the&#xD;
      portable PA tracking device. We plan to recruit 15 patients per group. The randomization is&#xD;
      done by a statistician from CRIUCPQ. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: To participate in the&#xD;
      study, participants must meet the following inclusion criteria: to be in a stable medical&#xD;
      condition, sedentary and type 2 diabetic man or woman between the ages of 18 and 90 years of&#xD;
      age. People with acute renal failure, FG below 30 ml and those under 18 years of age are&#xD;
      excluded. Intervention: The intervention lasts 3 months and involves a total of 3&#xD;
      appointments. The first appointment takes place with the physician in charge of the study in&#xD;
      order to evaluate the patient's record and to validate their eligibility. The glycated&#xD;
      hemoglobin data and cardiometabolic measurements taken by the attending physician of each&#xD;
      participant will be collected by the physician and clinical researcher in charge of the&#xD;
      project. These same measures will be taken at the 3-month follow-up prescribed to each&#xD;
      participant and this data will be collected a second and last time by the physician in charge&#xD;
      of the project, at the very end of the intervention. Following their visit to the physician&#xD;
      in charge of the study, the participants will meet the research professional who will be&#xD;
      responsible for explaining the project in more details and obtaining their consent. The&#xD;
      second appointment is attended by a kinesiologist who will distribute a physical activity&#xD;
      motivation questionnaire, a physical activity questionnaire and a logbook to the&#xD;
      participants. A personalized physical activity program will also be proposed to all&#xD;
      participants. At the 6th week of the intervention, the kinesiologist will follow up with all&#xD;
      participants to verify the integration of the physical activity program. A third appointment&#xD;
      is planned at the very end of the intervention with the kinesiologist. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to complete the same questionnaires as for visit # 2 and submit their completed&#xD;
      logbook. The participants in the experimental group will have a satisfaction questionnaire /&#xD;
      appreciation of the technology to be completed in addition to the other questionnaires. They&#xD;
      will also have to bring back their Fitbit material during this appointment.&#xD;
