    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the effects of a digital meditation intervention in a sample&#xD;
      of UCLA employees who report mild to moderate stress. We will randomize University of&#xD;
      California Los Angeles employees to either 8-weeks of a digital meditation intervention&#xD;
      (using the commercially available application Headspace) or a waitlist control condition.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to test the effects of a digital meditation intervention in a sample&#xD;
      of UCLA employees who report mild to moderate stress. UCLA employees will be randomized to&#xD;
      either 8-weeks of a digital meditation intervention (using the commercially available&#xD;
      application Headspace) or a waitlist control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are assigned to the intervention group will be asked to download and use the&#xD;
      Headspace mobile application for at least 10 minutes per day for 8 weeks. All participants&#xD;
      will be asked to fill out short (no longer than 25 minutes) questionnaires at baseline, week&#xD;
      4, week 8 (post intervention), and a 4-month follow up period. Among participants who are&#xD;
      randomized to the digital meditation intervention, they will also take part in a 1-year&#xD;
      follow up. All activities will take place online (via computer or smartphone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to randomization, participants will complete an eligibility screening and complete the&#xD;
      baseline questionnaire battery. The entirety of the study is digital and there are no&#xD;
      in-person assessments. Adherence will be tracked remotely. The goal is to recruit as many as&#xD;
      1000 participants (500 per condition).&#xD;

    <measure>Reductions in perceived stress as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-intervention (8 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the Perceived Stress Scale (range: 1-40; Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1988). Higher scores indicate greater psychological distress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reductions in stress-induced eating as measured by the Palatable Eating Motives Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-intervention (8 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes self-reporting using highly palatable foods to cope with stress, according to the Palatable Eating Motives Scale Coping subscale (range: 1-20) Burgess, Turan, Lokken, Morse, &amp; Boggiano, 2014). Higher scores indicate a higher likelihood of using palatable foods to cope with stress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reductions in reward-based eating as measured by the Reward-based Eating Drive</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-intervention (8 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in self-reporting intrinsic rewards from consuming highly palatable foods, according to the Reward-based Eating Drive (RED) Scale (range: 1-45; Epel, et al. 2014). Higher scores indicate a greater reward response from consuming palatable foods.</description>
