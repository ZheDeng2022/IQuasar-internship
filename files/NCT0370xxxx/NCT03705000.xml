      This project aims to test whether a newly designed lacrimal stent - the SlitStent - when&#xD;
      placed into the lacrimal system in the standard fashion following a DCR surgery, will provide&#xD;
      good symptomatic relief for epiphora and be well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epiphora, or severe tearing, is both a very common debilitating symptom and a potential cause&#xD;
      of dangerous infections (i.e. dacryocystitis and orbital cellulitis). DCR+lacrimal stenting&#xD;
      surgery is 80-95% successful at improving epiphora, and the longer the stent remains in&#xD;
      place, the better the long-term outcome. However, lacrimal stents that provide adequate&#xD;
      circumferential force to facilitate post-DCR healing also occupy space and prevent good tear&#xD;
      drainage until removed. Yet patients want complete symptomatic improvement as soon as&#xD;
      possible, even if it compromises long-term results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to test a newly designed lacrimal stent that allows tears to drain through&#xD;
      the lumen of the stent. The new stent is constructed by modifying a commercially available&#xD;
      stent by placing openings along the side of the stent using a process developed by a&#xD;
      University of Michigan engineer/collaborator. Following slit placement, the stent will be&#xD;
      gas-sterilized for surgery. Patient who are scheduled for DCR+stenting surgery who provide&#xD;
      informed consent will be randomized 2:1 to receive the investigational SlitStent or the&#xD;
      standard commercially available stent. Following surgery, patients will be assessed both&#xD;
      clinically, which is standard of care, and via a patient questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center study that will be conducted at the University of Michigan (Ann&#xD;
      Arbor, Michigan). Fifty (50) subjects will be enrolled and treated with either the&#xD;
      experimental Slit Stent II or the control stent BIKA for DCR. Patients who are currently&#xD;
      scheduled to undergo a DCR (dacryocystorhinostomy) as per standard of care will be offered&#xD;
      participation in the study. Patients who elect to participate in the study will be consented&#xD;
      and then randomized to the treatment or control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lacrimal stent is hollow silicone tubing with a non-traumatic tip. The tubing is securely&#xD;
      attached into malleable stainless steel probes that are used to guide the silicone tubing&#xD;
      through the lacrimal drainage apparatus. The device is used to maintain an open lacrimal path&#xD;
      between the surface of the eye and the nasal passages, particularly during a healing process&#xD;
      following injury or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BIKA for DCR lacrimal stent is a bicanalicular intubation device used for intubation of&#xD;
      the lacrimal drainage apparatus, especially in cases of dacryocystorhinostomy (conventional&#xD;
      or laser). The silicone tube acts as a conformer during the healing process while&#xD;
      facilitating drainage of tears through capillary action around the stent. In cases of&#xD;
      canalicular lacerations, the silicone tube guides wound healing and prevents the onset of&#xD;
      synechia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BIKA lacrimal stent consists of a single unit including a silicone tube (length: 280 mm,&#xD;
      external diameter: 0.94 mm), and one steel probe at each end of the silicone tube (length: 53&#xD;
      mm, external diameter: 0.8 mm) with round tips.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BIKA for DCR is a sterile, single-use device, and is an FDA cleared device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Slit Stent II (investigational) device is created by modifying an existing FDA cleared&#xD;
      lacrimal stent (Bika, manufactured by FCI Opthalmics) by adding additional 3 mm and 35 mm&#xD;
      long slits of equal depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The axial cutouts located on the stent allow drainage of tears from the ocular surface to the&#xD;
      nasal/oropharynx cavities through the internal lumen of the stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All modifications to the stent are inspected under an optical microscope at a magnification&#xD;
      of at least 5x to ensure they are free from cutting defects, which could impact the&#xD;
      structural integrity of the Slit Stent II. To ensure that the Slit Stent II can withstand the&#xD;
      forces experienced during implantation and removal, additional mechanical integrity tests&#xD;
      were performed. Comparing the implantation forces to the maximum insertion and removal force,&#xD;
      it was determined that the modified Slit Stent II will have excellent tensile strength -&#xD;
      essentially identical to unmodified stent - to prevent mechanical failure in patient use.&#xD;
      Each section was tested to determine the maximum elongation and force it can withstand before&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will be 6 months for all study patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following examination schedule will be followed from screening through the postoperative&#xD;
      visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening (Day -60 to Day 0 Preoperatively)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Device implantation operation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phone call Assessment at 1 day post op&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phone call Assessment at 45 days post op (+/- 15 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 5-14 postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 30-120 postoperatively (with stent removal)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4-7 month final post-operative exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to the experimental vs. control stents using a randomized&#xD;
      block design with 1:1 allocation to treatment and control. Stents will be provided to the&#xD;
      surgical team on the day of surgery by the Study Coordinator. Surgical team, recruitment&#xD;
      staff, and scheduling staff will be masked to treatment assignment until day of surgery. All&#xD;
      tests and measurements should be obtained in accordance with the procedures specified in this&#xD;
      protocol. If it is not possible to perform a measurement or examination due to the individual&#xD;
      eye's specific ocular pathology, the reason for not performing the test or measurement should&#xD;
      be documented on the source documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator may designate one or more surgeon sub-investigators at his/her investigative&#xD;
      site. A surgeon sub-investigator may evaluate subjects for the study and perform the Slit&#xD;
      Stent II lacrimal stent intubation. Surgeon sub-investigators will be listed on all&#xD;
      applicable investigator regulatory documents (including the delegation of responsibilities&#xD;
      log) and will complete all sponsor-required training for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the two post-op study visits, the Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaire (Glasgow Benefit&#xD;
      Inventory (GBI)- see Appendix A) and the Patient Tearing Questionnaire (Munk Scale and Lac-Q&#xD;
      questionnaire, see Appendix B) will be administered by an interviewer, and the interviewer&#xD;
      will record the subject's responses directly onto the corresponding questionnaire CRFs or&#xD;
      source documents and calculate the GBI score, Munk Score, and Lac-Q score.&#xD;
