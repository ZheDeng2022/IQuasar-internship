      This single center, randomized, single dose, full replicate, crossover comparative&#xD;
      laboratory-blinded study will be conducted in healthy male and female volunteers in order to&#xD;
      determine the bioequivalence of two different formulations of telmisartan 80 mg tablets after&#xD;
      oral administration under fasting conditions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is characterized by single center, randomized, single dose, laboratory-blinded,&#xD;
      4-period, 2-sequence, full replicate crossover design.The objective is to determine the&#xD;
      bioequivalence of two different formulations of telmisartan after a single oral dose&#xD;
      administration under fasting conditions. The test product is Telmisartan 80 mg tablets&#xD;
      manufactured by Pharmtechnology LLC, Belarus. The reference product is Micardis 80 mg tablets&#xD;
      manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim Ellas AE, Greece. The primary study endpoints are the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-T of telmisartan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible 26 healthy adult subjects will be randomized to the one of two predetermined&#xD;
      sequences: ABAB or BABA where A = the test product, B = the reference product. Clinical part&#xD;
      of the study will include 4 periods; in each of them a single 80 mg dose of telmisartan will&#xD;
      be administered orally with approximately 240 mL of water, in the morning, following a&#xD;
      10-hour overnight fast. Wash-out period between treatment administrations will last at least&#xD;
      14 calendar days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be confined to the clinical site from at least 10 hours prior to each drug&#xD;
      administration until 24 hours following each drug administration. Subjects will return to the&#xD;
      clinical site for the remaining blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each study period, 21 blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic assessments. The&#xD;
      first blood sample will be collected prior to drug administration while the others will be&#xD;
      collected up to 72 hours after drug administration (0.17, 0.33, 0.50, 0.67, 0.83, 1.00, 1.25,&#xD;
      1.50, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 4.00, 6.00, 9.00, 12.00, 16.00, 24.00, 36.00, 48.00, 72.00 postdose)&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study duration: up to 74 days (including screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telmisartan plasma concentrations will be measured by a validated bioanalytical method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters will be based on an ANOVA model. Two-sided&#xD;
      90% confidence interval of the ratio of geometric LSmeans will be obtained from the&#xD;
      ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical inference of telmisartan will be based on a bioequivalence approach using the&#xD;
      following standards:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  average bioequivalence (the ratio of geometric LSmeans with corresponding 90% confidence&#xD;
           interval calculated from the exponential of the difference between the test and the&#xD;
           reference product for the ln-transformed parameters Cmax and AUC0-T should all be within&#xD;
           the 80.00 to 125.00% bioequivalence range);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  scaled-average-bioequivalence (in the event that the Cmax reference-to-reference&#xD;
           within-subject CV is greater than 30%, that its test-to-reference geometric LSmeans&#xD;
           ratio is within the bioequivalence range of 80.00 125.00% and the average bioequivalence&#xD;
           criteria are not met, a scaling approach to the bioequivalence assessment will be used).&#xD;
