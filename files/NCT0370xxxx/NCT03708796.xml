  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic pathology is an extremely frequent reason for consultation in our emergency services,&#xD;
      with an annual incidence of severe forms between 50 to 95 cases per 100,000 inhabitants and a&#xD;
      constant increase estimated at 9% per year. Diagnosing these patients early and precisely is&#xD;
      a major challenge for the clinician, as this diagnosis will lead to more or less aggressive&#xD;
      medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria of S.I.R.S, used to define and to sort patients in sepsis according to the old&#xD;
      definition, were completely abandoned in the last recommendations for lack of specificity but&#xD;
      also of sensitivity. The latest recommendations suggest using another score, the &quot;Quick&#xD;
      Sepsis Related Organ Failure Assesment (qSOFA) score&quot;, in order to early detect septic&#xD;
      patients at risk of poor progress. However, the recent literature highlights a very low&#xD;
      sensitivity of the qSOFA score for the screening of septic patients, ranging from 30 to 60%&#xD;
      according to the studies. In addition to qSOFA, other scores are described in the literature&#xD;
      with apparently higher sensitivity, and thus seem more suitable for our daily practice. Among&#xD;
      them is the NEWS score or the RETTS score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of these scores is again based upon the values of vital signs recorded as soon as the&#xD;
      patient arrives in the emergency department. To date, very few studies have been interested,&#xD;
      in a prospective way, in the sensitivity and the specificity of these different scores to&#xD;
      diagnose the &quot;infected&quot; patients in the emergency departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore a non-interventional, prospective, multicenter cohort study is carried out here, in&#xD;
      order to be able to compare, on the same cohort of patients admitted into emergency services,&#xD;
      the diagnostic performance of these different scores with respect to the presence or absence&#xD;
      of an infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to define the best clinical score to use in emergency medicine to&#xD;
      quickly diagnose the infected patients, and offer them the best medical care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Septic pathology is an extremely frequent reason for consultation in our emergency services,&#xD;
      with an annual incidence of severe forms between 50 to 95 cases per 100,000 inhabitants and a&#xD;
      constant increase estimated at 9% per year. Diagnosing these patients early and precisely is&#xD;
      a major challenge for the clinician, as this diagnosis will lead to more or less aggressive&#xD;
      medical management with direct repercussions on the patient's morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latest publications of March 2017 have completely changed the definition of the septic&#xD;
      patient, in particular by eliminating the concept of &quot;severe sepsis&quot;. Today the patient can&#xD;
      be classified as either an &quot;infected&quot; or &quot;sepsis&quot; patient when there is associated organ&#xD;
      failure, or as &quot;septic shock&quot; when it is necessary to use a cathecholaminergic support to&#xD;
      maintain a sufficient blood pressure. There is a real nosological continuum between these&#xD;
      three diagnostic entities and each of them is tainted by a growing intra-hospital mortality.&#xD;
      One in ten patients will progress from infection to sepsis during their hospitalization and&#xD;
      3% of sepsis will progress to septic shock, making it easy to understand the value of&#xD;
      screening these patients quickly in order to stop the progression of the infection. The&#xD;
      triage of these patients, as soon as they arrive in an emergency service is therefore&#xD;
      essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria of S.I.R.S, used to define and to sort patients in sepsis according to the old&#xD;
      definition, were completely abandoned in the last recommendations for lack of specificity but&#xD;
      also of sensitivity. Indeed, a large number of non-septic patients presenting to the&#xD;
      emergency department, has at least two SIRS criteria from the initial phase of their care,&#xD;
      making it difficult to use this score as a reliable diagnostic tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latest recommendations suggest using another score, the &quot;Quick Sepsis Related Organ&#xD;
      Failure Assesment (qSOFA) score&quot;, in order to early detect septic patients at risk of poor&#xD;
      progress. This score is easily usable because it takes into account only three criteria that&#xD;
      are: (i) the respiratory rate ≥ 22 / min, (ii) the systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg, (iii)&#xD;
      and the level of vigilance of the patient to evaluate by the Glasgow score &lt;15. Each&#xD;
      criterion is weighted by 1 point if it is present. A score of qSOFA ≥2 is considered&#xD;
      positive, and in this case the patient must be managed quickly with optimization of its&#xD;
      volemia and implementation of a suitable antibiotic treatment within one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the recent literature highlights a very low sensitivity of the qSOFA score for the&#xD;
      screening of septic patients, ranging from 30 to 60% according to the studies. Such&#xD;
      sensitivity values seem insufficient to properly screen septic patients in an emergency&#xD;
      department. Some authors even report similar AUCs for qSOFA and SIRS at 0.72 and 0.73,&#xD;
      respectively, to screen for the severe septic patient, concluding that the decision to&#xD;
      abandon SIRS for qSOFA may be a little premature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to qSOFA, other scores are described in the literature with apparently higher&#xD;
      sensitivity, and thus seem more suitable for our daily practice. Among them is the NEWS score&#xD;
      or the RETTS score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of these scores is again based upon the values of vital signs recorded as soon as the&#xD;
      patient arrives in the emergency department, such as the respiratory rate, the heart rate,&#xD;
      the oxygen saturation, the temperature, the blood pressure or the level of patient's&#xD;
      vigilance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective cohort study of 1535 patients in emergency departments have compared the RETTS&#xD;
      score to the qSOFA score showing a much better sensitivity of the RETTS score with a value of&#xD;
      85% against only 32% for qSOFA, for the screening of patients with severe sepsis according to&#xD;
      the &quot;SEPSIS-2&quot; definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study published in April 2017, compared qSOFA, SIRS, and NEWS to predict mortality&#xD;
      or hospitalizations into intensive care units for septic patients in emergencies. Once again&#xD;
      the qSOFA score showed a low sensitivity at 54% versus 67% for a NEWS score ≥ 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, several studies have compared the prognostic contribution of these different scores&#xD;
      and their ability to predict mortality or even hospitalization in intensive care units, but&#xD;
      very few studies have been interested, in a prospective way, in the sensitivity and the&#xD;
      specificity of these different scores to diagnose the &quot;infected&quot; patients in the emergency&#xD;
      departments. Whereas this first step seems essential in order to implement the most&#xD;
      appropriate therapeutic strategy, today, if we stick to the recommendations, the diagnosis of&#xD;
      the infected patient is based solely on the physician clinical feeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it seemed interesting to carry out a prospective, multicenter cohort study, in&#xD;
      order to be able to compare, on the same cohort of patients admitted into emergency services,&#xD;
      the diagnostic performance of these different scores (qSOFA, SIRS, NEWS, and RETTS ) with&#xD;
      respect to the presence or absence of an infection.&#xD;
