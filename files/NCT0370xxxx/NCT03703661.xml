  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Negative pressure wound dressings have been studied and shown to have applications in&#xD;
      decreasing rates of surgical wound infections. This study studies the effect of a low cost&#xD;
      needle-aspirated negative pressure compression dressing on rates of wound infection at prior&#xD;
      ostomy site in patients undergoing ostomy reversal surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) will be studied in colorectal surgery patients&#xD;
      undergoing ostomy reversal surgery. The immediate goal is to compare primary wound closure&#xD;
      against primary closure with needle-aspirated compression dressing, and determine if risk of&#xD;
      potential ostomy site wound infections is decreased. The investigators would also like to&#xD;
      evaluate if this compression dressing can increase prevalence of complete wound closure by 12&#xD;
      weeks (last planned clinic visit). NPWT using a continuous suction device was shown to&#xD;
      decrease surgical site infection (SSI) at ostomy reversal sites undergoing primary closure.&#xD;
      There is a lack of published literature studying NPWT dressings without an associated suction&#xD;
      device. The investigators will be using a low-cost simple needle-aspirated suction technique&#xD;
      to provide negative pressure under a tegaderm/gauze dressing, at the time of placement.&#xD;
      Patients will be consented and randomized into a negative pressure group, or a control group&#xD;
      consisting of the same dressing under normal pressure. All adult patients undergoing ostomy&#xD;
      reversal surgery who consent to the study will be included. Exclusion criteria include prior&#xD;
      recurrent skin infections, prior stoma-site infection, or large parastomal hernia. Patients&#xD;
      in the negative pressure group will have the pressure under the dressing measured immediately&#xD;
      prior to removal on post-operative day 2.&#xD;
