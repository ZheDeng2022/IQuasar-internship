  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in women. Adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      significantly reduces the risk of recurrence of high-risk breast cancer. However, about 30%&#xD;
      of patients still have distant metastasis or local recurrence after chemotherapy. Moreover,&#xD;
      60% of patients had 3-4 degrees of adverse drug reactions during chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to investigate relationship between gut microbiome and adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy in early breast cancer patients.&#xD;

      Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in women. Adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      significantly reduces the risk of recurrence of high-risk breast cancer. However, about 30%&#xD;
      of patients still have distant metastasis or local recurrence after chemotherapy. Moreover,&#xD;
      60% of patients had 3-4 degrees of adverse drug reactions during chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human gut microbiota have been considered the most important microecosystem living in&#xD;
      symbiosis with the body. It is identified as a crucial determinant in cancer occurrence and&#xD;
      development . Besides, Gut microbial alterations may influence the therapy efficacy and&#xD;
      adverse drug event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We collect the fresh tail stool sample 24h before adjuvant chemotherapy and 24h after&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy then the composition of intestinal microbiota and subsequent short-term&#xD;
      alterations are analysed by 16srRNA sequencing.The purpose of the study is to investigate&#xD;
      relationship between gut microbiome and adjuvant chemotherapy in early breast cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
