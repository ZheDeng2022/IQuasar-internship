  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: There are no existing data available to guide clinicians in the appropriate&#xD;
      rehabilitation progression of patients who have undergone knee arthroscopy. The investigator&#xD;
      intends to fill this void by establishing normative recovery curves for patients undergoing&#xD;
      knee arthroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design: Prospective Observational Design Procedures: Patients 10-70 years old will&#xD;
      be screened for &quot;standard of care&quot; clinical and functional outcomes to occur at standardized&#xD;
      time-points (post-op weeks 1-4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and return to sport/activity) following&#xD;
      arthroscopic knee surgery. Recovery curves will be plotted for all outcome variables of&#xD;
      interest including; (1) International knee Disability Committee (IKDC) survey, (2) Tampa&#xD;
      Kinesiophobia scale, (3) Tegner activity scale, (4) Marx activity scale, (5) Passive knee&#xD;
      range of motion/heel-height difference, (6) Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), (7)&#xD;
      Quad/Hamstring strength ratios, (8) Y-Balance, (9) Functional Movement Screening, (10)&#xD;
      Vail-Sport Test, (11) Landing Error Scoring System (LESS), (12) Hop Testing, and the (13)&#xD;
      Sports Metrics Test. Polynomial lines-of-best-fit and 95% confidence intervals will be&#xD;
      plotted to provide objective recovery curves for clinical utilization and stratification of&#xD;
      patient recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks: There are no additional risks to &quot;standard physical therapy practice&quot; for&#xD;
      post-surgical patients participating in this study. The investigator will not be using&#xD;
      invasive procedures or testing modalities that emit radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits &amp; Clinical Relevance: This information may offer valuable information to clinicians&#xD;
      treating patients following knee arthroscopy by providing objective data for each phase of&#xD;
      post-operative recovery. Identifying key landmarks and functional milestones may allow the&#xD;
      ability to identify patients who are not meeting clinical expectations and subsequently&#xD;
      tailor rehabilitation programs to improve recovery trajectories.&#xD;
