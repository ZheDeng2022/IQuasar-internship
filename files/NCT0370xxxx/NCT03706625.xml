  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The explosion of novel therapies targeting tumor mutations or immune molecules requests to&#xD;
      define or better characterize the mutational profiles of tumors that are none or&#xD;
      insufficiently explored so far. This is particularly the case for tumors arising in&#xD;
      immune-suppressed individuals or environments which have been poorly, if any, analyzed so far&#xD;
      with modern molecular methods. The goal of the translational research program, Ideation, is&#xD;
      to define novel biomarkers such as the tumor mutational profiling and immunomutanome in such&#xD;
      contexts and to compare the results obtained to those observed in immune competent&#xD;
      individuals. In addition, this approach will allow to characterize novel key non-invasive&#xD;
      diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers such as circulating tumoral DNA and cells. Altogether&#xD;
      results will provide novel biomarkers to better adapt therapeutic strategies in these&#xD;
      cancers, to monitor response to treatment as well as to define new molecular targets of&#xD;
      potential therapeutic strategies.&#xD;

      The main objective is to discover novel invasive and non-invasive immuno-molecular actionable&#xD;
      biomarkers in rare but severe tumors arising in immune-suppressed compared for some tumors in&#xD;
      immune-competent patients. Indeed, this tumors present a deficient immune environment, either&#xD;
      due to the host acquired immune deficiency, i.e. transplantations or HIV infection, or&#xD;
      because the diseased tissue belongs in an immune sanctuary as the brain. The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis, in this context, is that these tumor mutational profiles and their changes during&#xD;
      drug therapy must be influenced by the immune environment and response. This must lead to&#xD;
      differences from similar tumors observed in immune-competent environments (immunocompetent&#xD;
      individuals or tissues expressing immunity), responsible for: modification in the molecular&#xD;
      targets for appropriate drugs ; alteration of tumor immunogenicity and of future immune-based&#xD;
      therapies ; specific biomarkers for monitoring the response to drug therapy. The objectives&#xD;
      of this program are to carry on invasive and non-invasive investigations in order to define&#xD;
      the mutational profile of these free types of severe tumors, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), lung&#xD;
      cancers and gliomas arising in hosts or tissues with altered immunity. These investigations&#xD;
      will lead to : identify novel invasive and non-invasive biomarkers for predicting and&#xD;
      evaluating efficacy of future personalized and immune-based therapies; compare tumors from&#xD;
      immune-suppressed and immune-competent hosts; discover hot spots of tumoral mutations as&#xD;
      mechanisms of tumors resistance, new molecular targets for future molecular and immune-bases&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies; define the tumor immunomutanome as a score of neo-epitopes&#xD;
      predicting: tumor immunogenicity, disease outcome and efficacy of immunotherapies; detect&#xD;
      non-invasive tumoral biomarkers from liquid biopsies based on Circulating tumoral DNA and&#xD;
      Circulating tumoral Cells to facilitate future diagnosis and monitoring of such tumors;&#xD;
      identify biomarkers of tumor escape or resistance to treatments.&#xD;

    <description>The analysis of circulating DNA (ctDNA) will be performed from plasma collected from the prospective cohort of the patients for the three types of cancer (NHL, lung cancer and glioma). DNA will be extracted and amplified followed by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) analysis for the identification of new biomarkers and/or for the follow up of mutations previously identified on tumor DNA. Results will be compared to tissue results in each group and to CTCs results in the Lung cancer group and prognostic values of these biomarkers will be assessed from clinical datas.</description>

    <description>The analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) will be performed from whole peripheral blood collected from the prospective cohort of patients with lung cancer infected or not with HIV. CTC fraction will be prepared from a cell size-based enrichment protocol. Then, DNA and RNA will be extracted and amplified followed by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and RNA sequencing for the identification of new biomarkers. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) analysis will also be performed for validation and patient follow-up. Mutations and expression data in CTC will be compared to tissue and ctDNA in the two groups and prognostic values of these biomarkers will be assessed from clinical datas.</description>
