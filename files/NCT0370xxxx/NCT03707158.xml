      The Kids FACE FEARS (Kids Face-to-face And Computer-Enhanced Formats Effectiveness study for&#xD;
      Anxiety and Related Symptoms) is a large-scale, streamlined, pragmatic Randomized Controlled&#xD;
      Trial (RCT) evaluating face-to-face (therapist led office based or telehealth) vs.&#xD;
      self-administered online cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of child and&#xD;
      adolescent anxiety. Families will be recruited from pediatric health centers serving&#xD;
      primarily racial/ethnic minority youth in urban, suburban, and semi-rural regions.&#xD;
      Patient-centered outcomes will be evaluated across a one-year follow-up period; parents,&#xD;
      patients, providers, and other key stakeholders will be actively engaged throughout all&#xD;
      aspects of the research.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are among the most common and impairing psychiatric disorders to affect&#xD;
      children and adolescents. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an effective psychological&#xD;
      treatment for youth anxiety, with roughly 60-80% of youth showing considerable clinical&#xD;
      response and global improvements in functioning. Regrettably, despite the existence of&#xD;
      well-supported treatments, most youth with anxiety disorders do not receive any form of&#xD;
      treatment, especially in resource poor settings. The pediatric health care setting offers an&#xD;
      optimal public health venue for youth anxiety management, yet there is a critical lack of&#xD;
      behavioral health specialty care providers who are trained in providing mental health&#xD;
      treatment, and a lack of information on the optimal methods of treating anxiety in pediatric&#xD;
      settings. Two evidence-based strategies for delivering CBT for youth with mild to moderate&#xD;
      anxiety in pediatric settings are (1) face-to-face CBT delivered by therapists within&#xD;
      pediatric health care in an office-based setting or via telehealth and (2) online delivery of&#xD;
      CBT skills to youth and families. Importantly, however, there are no data on the relative&#xD;
      effectiveness of these two treatment formats in real-world settings, and no information on&#xD;
      which patient subgroups benefit most from which formats in patients in real-world practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design entails a large-scale, streamlined, pragmatic, Randomized Controlled Trial&#xD;
      (RCT), in which eligible anxious youth presenting to pediatric primary care settings will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to face-to-face versus online Cool Kids suite of CBT intervention for youth&#xD;
      anxiety and monitored for up to one year post-intervention. Outcomes for each participant&#xD;
      will be monitored across four assessment points, corresponding to baseline, mid-treatment,&#xD;
      post-treatment, and 1 year post-baseline. Long-term outcomes associated with face-to-face&#xD;
      versus online CBT will be evaluated over a 1-year period post-intervention. We will use the&#xD;
      well-established Cool Kids suite of face-to-face and online anxiety CBT protocols within&#xD;
      pediatric primary care networks serving primarily racial-ethnic minority children in both&#xD;
      urban and rural settings across four regions of the US: the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic, the&#xD;
      Southeast, and the Pacific Northwest. Therapists embedded within pediatric primary care&#xD;
      settings and mental health clinics co-located with primary care will provide all services.&#xD;
      All participants will be identified and referred for enrollment from pediatric health&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study addresses three critical yet unanswered questions related to improving the&#xD;
      delivery of treatment and outcomes for anxiety in pediatric primary care. Answering the&#xD;
      following question offers the potential to meaningfully improve the quality of the evidence&#xD;
      available to help children, families, and organizational stakeholders make informed decisions&#xD;
      regarding clinical practice and implementation strategies for the treatment of childhood&#xD;
      anxiety:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the relative effectiveness of implementing therapist-led (face-to-face or&#xD;
           telehealth) versus self-administered online formats of CBT to treat youth anxiety in&#xD;
           pediatric health care?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How do factors such as clinical severity, treatment preference, socioeconomic status,&#xD;
           computer literacy, distance to clinic, organizational readiness, or medical home status&#xD;
           moderate outcomes across treatment formats? Which patient subgroups might benefit most&#xD;
           from which formats?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What are the barriers and facilitators to delivering this care in pediatric health care&#xD;
           settings and for the diverse patient populations served?&#xD;
