&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase II, multi-arm, open-label trial of perioperative atezolizumab alone&#xD;
      or in combination with other immune-modulating agents in advanced SCCHN. Based on the results&#xD;
      of these initial cohorts, the trial will be amended to explore other novel atezolizumab-based&#xD;
      combinations (such as atezolizumab in combination with another immuno-oncology (IO) agent,&#xD;
      chemotherapeutics, or a molecularly targeted agent that could potentiate the activity of&#xD;
      atezolizumab). Each of these new cohorts will be tested and enrolled to in sequential,&#xD;
      non-randomized fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: Patients receive 2 infusions of atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes for&#xD;
      up to 15 days prior to definitive surgery and radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A (Adjuvant): Patients received 2 infusions of atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60&#xD;
      minutes for up to 15 days prior to definitive surgery and radiation. In addition to&#xD;
      neoadjuvant atezolizumab, the first 9 participants in Arm A (atezolizumab monotherapy)&#xD;
      received adjuvant atezolizumab beginning 16 weeks after surgery and radiation, or&#xD;
      chemoradiation therapy, every 3 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Adjuvant atezolizumab will only be initiated if&#xD;
      radiation-associated adverse events have resolved to grade 2 or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes for up to 2 courses and&#xD;
      tiragolumab administered by IV infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 of neoadjuvant treatment prior to&#xD;
      standard surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm C: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes for up to 2 courses and&#xD;
      tocilizumab administered by IV infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 of neoadjuvant treatment prior to&#xD;
      standard surgery. Tocilizumab will be administered (prior to atezolizumab administration) as&#xD;
      an intravenous infusion Atezolizumab will be administered 2 hours after the conclusion of the&#xD;
      tocilizumab infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days post surgery, 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months, 12 months, and at 24 months.&#xD;

    <description>Intratumoral CD3+ T-cells will be identified by immunohistochemistry in pre- and post-treatment tumor specimens. The analysis population for the primary outcome will be all patients who received at least 2 weeks of neoadjuvant therapy with pre- and post-treatment tumor specimens that are evaluable for CD3+ T-cells. The proportion of patients with a &gt;= 40% increase (from pre- to post-treatment) will be calculated. The exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the Pearson-Clopper method and an exact binomial test will be used as an exploratory purpose.

             course of the study or within 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab. Note for&#xD;
             Arm C (atezolizumab + tocilizumab): Because IL-6 inhibition may interfere with the&#xD;
             normal immune response to new antigen, patients should be brought up to date on all&#xD;
             recommended vaccinations, except for live vaccines, prior to initiation of therapy&#xD;
             with tocilizumab to maximize vaccine response.&#xD;

&#xD;
         24. Any major episode of infection requiring hospitalization or treatment with IV&#xD;
