      In this trial different parts of the pain signalling system involved in two rheumatic&#xD;
      diseases - painful hand osteoarthritis and psoriatic arthritis, is examined. These&#xD;
      measurements will be compared to those of healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that patients with hand osteoarthritis and psoriatic arthritis react&#xD;
      differently to painful and non-painful stimuli compared with the healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to recruit 66 patients with painful hand-osteoarthritis, 66 patients with painful&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis and 66 healthy subjects not currently suffering from any pain conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing an informed consent form subjects will participate in a single clinical&#xD;
      visit. The pain signalling system is examined using pressure algometry and cuff algometry. A&#xD;
      pressure algometer is a pistol shaped device that elicits pressure through a rod and a cuff&#xD;
      algometer is akin to a blood pressure cuff. Different thresholds will be measured, such as&#xD;
      when the sensation of pressure becomes painful and when the painful pressure becomes&#xD;
      unbearable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also get hand strength tested, have their joints examined and answer&#xD;
      questionnaires regarding daily function and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore participants will get blood drawn which is analysed for the presence of markers&#xD;
      of inflammation and joint degeneration.&#xD;

      Purpose and rationale for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treating painful hand osteoarthritis (Hand-OA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a clinical&#xD;
      challenge because the exact pain mechanisms remain unknown. Both conditions seem to involve&#xD;
      both central and peripheral pain mechanisms and inflammation to some degree. However, it&#xD;
      remains unknown whether the pain mechanisms are homogenous among patients with said&#xD;
      conditions or if different pain phenotypes exist that may respond differently to treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT)&#xD;
      consortium has recognized this. IMMPACT recommends that clinical trials with chronic pain&#xD;
      patients assess different domains of the pain experience (psychosocial, pain qualities,&#xD;
      sleep, and pain pathways) to examine if pain phenotypes exist and whether different treatment&#xD;
      modalities are more effective for certain phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A cross-sectional study examining the difference in pain phenotype and pain&#xD;
      mechanisms between patients with Hand-OA, PsA and healthy pain free controls using&#xD;
      questionnaire assessments and quantitative sensory testing aiming at investigating pain&#xD;
      pathways in the central nervous system. Participants will also have blood drawn to evaluate&#xD;
      serological biomarkers for inflammation and joint degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To examine the pain phenotypes and assess differences in pressure pain threshold between&#xD;
      patients with Hand-OA, PsA and healthy pain free controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and controls: Patients with nodal non-erosive Hand-OA or PsA and visual analogue&#xD;
      scale for pain (VAS pain) during the last 24hours of 30mm or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls are healthy age and gender matched subjects with no known chronic pain conditions&#xD;
      and maximal pain during last 24 hours under 10mm on a 100mm VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination programme: All participants will receive a full medical interview and a physical&#xD;
      examination which includes auscultation, blood pressure, heart rate and saturation&#xD;
      measurements and BMI calculation. All participants will have blood drawn for later&#xD;
      examination for markers of inflammation and degeneration. All participants will go through&#xD;
      Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST). QST covers a wide range of different examinations&#xD;
      techniques used to assess the functional status of the somatosensory system33. In the present&#xD;
      study pressure algometry and cuff algometry will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain phenotyping: Participants will answer a series of questionnaires related to the pain&#xD;
      experience to assess: Anxiety and depression (the hospital anxiety and depression scale),&#xD;
      pain catastrophizing (the pain catastrophizing scale), pain description (The short form&#xD;
      McGill questionnaire and pain detect questionnaire), sleep quality (Pittsburgh sleep quality&#xD;
      index) and a widespread pain assessment questionnaire. To assess function and quality of life&#xD;
      the Short form 36 and Health assessment questionnaire will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PsA: Will receive an examination for disease specific tests including: joint&#xD;
      tenderness and swelling using the European league against rheumatism (EULAR) 66/68 regiment,&#xD;
      dactylitis evaluation using Leeds dactylitis index basic, skin involvement using the&#xD;
      psoriasis area and severity index and nail psoriasis via nail psoriasis severity index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Hand-OA: Will receive the following disease specific examinations evaluation of&#xD;
      tender and swollen joints of the hands and wrists. Grip and pinch strength measurements using&#xD;
      a hand-held dynamometer.&#xD;
