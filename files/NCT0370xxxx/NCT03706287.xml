  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to explore the safety and efficacy of anlotinib, a tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2（VEGFR）、FGFR（fibroblast growth&#xD;
      factor receptor）, platelet-derived growth factor receptor（PDGFR） and tumor cell proliferation&#xD;
      related kinase c-Kit, combined with platinum plus pemetrexed in T790M mutation negative&#xD;
      metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) after the failure of EGFR-TKI.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib, an oral highly potent tyrosine-kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR、PDGFR、FGFR and&#xD;
      c-kit，has demonstrated improved survival in previously treated patients with advanced&#xD;
      non-small-cell lung cancer(NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase Ⅲ study ALTER0303, patients who failed at least two kinds of systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance were treated with anlotinib or&#xD;
      placebo, the anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and 9.63 months, the placebo group&#xD;
      PFS and OS were 1.4 months and 6.3 months. Therefore,we envisage using anlotinib plus&#xD;
      platinum plus pemetrexed treat the EGFR wild-type metastatic non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      patients who were failure in the treatment of chemotherapy with platinum containing drugs, to&#xD;
      further improve the patient's PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into two stages，phase I use a dose escalation trial design to explore&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities(DLT), Maximum Tolerable Dose(MTD), A&#xD;
      cohort of 3~6 subjects will be enrolled at each dose level, If 0 of 3 or ≤ 1 of 6 subjects&#xD;
      experience a DLT, the phase I trial will move ahead to the next dose until ≥ 2 of 6 subjects&#xD;
      experience a DLT，and the current dose will be considered the MTD. Following completion of the&#xD;
      dose escalation trial and determination of MTD（Phase I）, a single arm study including 44&#xD;
      subjects may be enrolled to further evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of anlotinib&#xD;
      in combination with platinum plus pemetrexed in the same target population（phase II）. Phase&#xD;
      II is to designed to explore the anti-tumor activity of anlotinib combined with platinum plus&#xD;
      pemetrexed in T790M mutation negative metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer(NSCLC) after the failure of EGFR-TKI.&#xD;
