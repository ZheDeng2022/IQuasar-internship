  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine if DNA-based dietary guidelines can improve glucose regulation in&#xD;
      pre-diabetic individuals significantly more than standard dietary guidelines following 6&#xD;
      weeks of the intervention. This will be assessed using an oral glucose tolerance test, which&#xD;
      is a standard clinical measurement used to assess impaired glucose regulation. Pre-diabetic&#xD;
      individuals will be recruited by offering the opportunity to self-assess their risk score for&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes using the Leicester Risk Score Questionnaire on the Diabetes United Kingdom&#xD;
      website, and they can contact the clinical trial team if they are interested in participating&#xD;
      in the trial. They will then be invited for a point of care Hba1c test to determine their&#xD;
      suitability for the trial. The point of care Hba1c test is a simple finger prick test to&#xD;
      assess glucose regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential for lifestyle interventions to reduce the progression to type 2 diabetes from&#xD;
      pre-diabetic states has been demonstrated in a number of randomised control trials (RCTs) in&#xD;
      different countries, with a meta-analysis of RCTs suggesting that lifestyle intervention in&#xD;
      high risk subjects can halve the incidence of diabetes. However, they have been expensive and&#xD;
      labour intensive, with multiple personal contacts. Furthermore, DNA based dietary advice has&#xD;
      shown a greater improvement in fasting glucose measurements in obese individuals compared to&#xD;
      standard dietary advice, with the BMI (body mass index) only showing a long-term improvement&#xD;
      in the group that received DNA-based dietary advice. The proposed study may be able to show&#xD;
      that increased benefits can be obtained by following a DNA-based diet compared to standard&#xD;
      dietary advice for individuals with pre-diabetes. Furthermore, the exploratory arm of the&#xD;
      study will receive the advice via an app (provided by DnaNudge Ltd), which if effective,&#xD;
      would demonstrate a low-cost, widely-distributable method that could be deployed to the&#xD;
      general public without requiring individuals to self-identify as pre-diabetic to receive an&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is amongst the most common long term conditions, with the number of people affected&#xD;
      worldwide quadrupling from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. Its prevalence in&#xD;
      people over 18 years of age has risen from 4.7% in 1980 to a staggering 8.5% in 2014. In&#xD;
      2012, there were 1.5 million deaths as a direct result of diabetes, making it the 8th leading&#xD;
      cause of death amongst both sexes, and the 5th leading cause of death amongst women. There&#xD;
      were a further 2.2 million deaths as a result of complications due to higher-than-optimal&#xD;
      glucose levels. In 2013, 6% of the UK adult population (2.7 million people) were diabetic,&#xD;
      90% of whom had type 2 diabetes. A further 5 million people were estimated to be at high risk&#xD;
      of developing type 2 diabetes. This has led to a cost of Â£8 billion per year to the NHS, 80%&#xD;
      of which is due to diabetes-related complications such as cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      amputations, renal failure and sight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment protocol for pre-diabetic individuals in the UK is a brief&#xD;
      consultation with their clinician highlighting the dangers of an increased risk of diabetes,&#xD;
      and some general information regarding healthy eating and the benefits of regular physical&#xD;
      activity. The individual will subsequently be contacted every 3 years to assess the state of&#xD;
      their glucose regulation. Despite the implementation of this system, incidence rates of&#xD;
      diabetes have continued to rise over the years. From 1994-2011, the number of women diagnosed&#xD;
      with diabetes has risen from 1.9 - 4.9%, and 2.9 - 7.0% for men. In response to this, the NHS&#xD;
      launched the NHS Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in 2016. The aforementioned studies and&#xD;
      the predictions of the DPP are in agreement that an intensive lifestyle intervention can&#xD;
      radically reduce incidence rates of diabetes. However, these interventions are costly,&#xD;
      labour-intensive and require the health system to pre-identify pre-diabetic patients. The&#xD;
      latter is one of the greatest challenges to any diabetes prevention program, as many at-risk&#xD;
      individuals will not self-assess to pre-empt a glucose regulation test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's solution aims to assess the improvement in glucose regulation by following&#xD;
      a DNA-based diet in comparison with the standard protocol. The DNA-based diet will be devised&#xD;
      based on metabolism-based genotypic traits of the participant. The traits cover metabolic&#xD;
      imbalances such as carbohydrate sensitivity and fat sensitivity. This nutrigenetic&#xD;
      information will be supplied to the user in an easy to use electronic format to provide food&#xD;
      recommendations on demand during grocery shopping e.g. via the DnaNudge App or other visual&#xD;
      indicator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If effective, this solution could provide a cost-effective, widely-distributed, easily&#xD;
      scalable prevention tool for improving glucose regulation in high risk individuals. Moreover,&#xD;
      the non-invasive nature of the intervention, paired with the autonomy that it provides the&#xD;
      individual in choosing their food choices, enables it to be a low-risk intervention.&#xD;
      Furthermore, as a DNA-based diet is relevant for the general public, it has the potential to&#xD;
      perform the preventative measures on individuals who do not self-identify as pre-diabetic.&#xD;
