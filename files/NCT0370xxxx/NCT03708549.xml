  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from medicinal herbs, has been demonstrated&#xD;
      to produce beneficial effects on diabetes and hyperlipidemia, fewer study reported its&#xD;
      modification on lipid metabolism in schizophrenia. Metformin, have been used for metabolic&#xD;
      abnormalities in schizophrenia, findings from these studies indicated that they did have some&#xD;
      effect,which are still in experimental stage.This study is aim to compare the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of berberine and metformin for preventing metabolic dysfunction in schizophrenia&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
