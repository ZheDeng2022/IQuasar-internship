      To establish whether a pre-hospital advanced physician/ paramedic cardiac arrest team that is&#xD;
      ECMO capable can establish ECMO flow within 30 minutes of collapse. The Sub30 study will&#xD;
      investigate the technical and logistical feasibility of instituting pre-hospital&#xD;
      Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (ECPR) within 30 minutes of collapse for&#xD;
      selected patients (n=6) in a geographical sector of Greater London. It will achieve this&#xD;
      through a unique collaboration between the primary emergency dispatch and response services&#xD;
      (London Ambulance Service NHS Trust, LAS), pre-hospital practitioners (LAS and London Air&#xD;
      Ambulance) and clinicians in ECMO (Barts Health NHS Trust).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year, in London, the ambulance service treats over 4,000 patients who have a had a&#xD;
      cardiac arrest (or their heart has stopped). Less than 1 in 10 patients survive to get home.&#xD;
      Some of those who survive have severe brain damage since their brains did not receive blood&#xD;
      and oxygen when their heart was stopped. The ambulance service in London manages to get to a&#xD;
      patient, on average, 7 minutes following a 999 call. The paramedics are very skilled in&#xD;
      restarting people's hearts and often manage this in less than 10 minutes. However, sometimes&#xD;
      it can take much longer or not be possible. The risks of a patient dying or suffering brain&#xD;
      damage increase the longer it takes to restart the heart, particularly after about 20-30&#xD;
      minutes. An extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine may reduce these risks by&#xD;
      pumping a patient's blood through an artificial lung and to their vital body organs -&#xD;
      temporarily replacing the function of the heart and lungs. The ECMO is used in normal care to&#xD;
      support patients after a cardiac arrest once a patient reaches the hospital, but in this&#xD;
      study we want to see if the ECMO can be used very soon after the cardiac arrest is reported&#xD;
      via the 999 call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Sub30 study, the ECMO team and machine to travel immediately to where the patient&#xD;
      collapses rather than wait for the patient to be moved to a hospital. The study hypothesis is&#xD;
      that the ECMO will be started faster and that this may improve patient survival and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ECMO team consists of three senior doctors and a paramedic. They attend patients who have&#xD;
      collapsed and start ECMO if standard advanced resuscitation techniques fail to restart the&#xD;
      heart in 20 minutes. The team will aim to have the ECMO machine started within 30 minutes of&#xD;
      the 999 call. The team have achieved this in training and the current study will assess&#xD;
      whether it is possible to do this in six patients in real-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A target of thirty minutes to achieve ECMO flow or return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)&#xD;
      is less than in published series to date. This can be achieved by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  integration into an established pre-hospital emergency response services that&#xD;
           aggressively pursue ROSC through optimised Advanced Life Support&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  immediate deployment of an ECPR-capable cardiac arrest team as a primary resource, as&#xD;
           opposed to delayed secondary deployment. Dispatch will be done by the established&#xD;
           Advanced Paramedic Practitioner (APP) desk of London Ambulance Service, with the&#xD;
           objective to reach the patient within 8-10 minutes of the 999 call.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  early placement of guide-wires into the femoral vessels during on-going conventional&#xD;
           CPR, a procedure with low complication risk that does not commit the team to ECPR but&#xD;
           will minimise the delay to ECPR support if conventional resuscitative techniques are not&#xD;
           successful within 20 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  facilitated guide-wire placement through real-time wireless ultrasound delivered to the&#xD;
           operator through augmented reality smart glasses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some out of hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) are irreversible in nature and ECPR would not&#xD;
      provide benefit to these patients. The ECPR team will not be task fixated on providing ECPR,&#xD;
      but also supportive of the APP primary responders and provide ECPR only in settings of&#xD;
      refractory cardiac arrest that fulfils the study criteria, that have been chosen based on&#xD;
      best available evidence to identify those patients in whom ECPR is likely to be of benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If pre-hospital ECMO is feasible within 30 minutes of chest compressions starting, then a&#xD;
      larger randomised controlled study of clinical and cost effectiveness is merited.&#xD;
      Optimisation of the delivery of ECPR is vital, prior to a controlled study, in order to&#xD;
      maximise any potential benefits for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from Sub30 will inform the design of such studies enabling an estimation of the size of&#xD;
      any potential outcome benefits and the likely affordability for a healthcare service.&#xD;
