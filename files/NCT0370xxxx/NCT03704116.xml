  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a prevalent disorder developed by military personnel. While&#xD;
      some individuals recover function within months after injury, others continue to suffer from&#xD;
      cognitive problems months to years later and may not become evident immediately, particularly&#xD;
      for the recently transitioned veteran. Chronic TBI cases may include persistent difficulties&#xD;
      in cognition that negatively impact employment and personal relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test and evaluate software-based interventions aimed at improving&#xD;
      cognition in veterans experiencing everyday life cognitive deficits due to TBI. The&#xD;
      interventions will be administered on a computer using a tele-health approach. Two conditions&#xD;
      will be compared, an active condition challenging memory, inhibitory control and planning,&#xD;
      and a context-matched control condition that is lower on these challenge levels.&#xD;

      The investigators will evaluate the improvement of chronic TBI symptoms after interventions.&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the improvement of chronic mTBI symptoms using Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based injury markers, cognitive functions, and real-world functioning&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit military veterans with mild-to-moderate chronic TBI (at least&#xD;
      3 months post injury). The investigators will gather neuropsychological, cognitive, and&#xD;
      neuroimaging (functional MRI, resting-state functional MRI) measures. The efficacy of the&#xD;
      active compared to control intervention will be evaluated in 100 chronic TBI veterans. All&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to a group to complete four weeks of intervention over 20&#xD;
      performance sessions. Over the course of training participants will face escalating&#xD;
      challenges in each of these domains, thereby improving their overall skills. The software&#xD;
      captures response times and accuracy of performance throughout each task. Evaluations of&#xD;
      cognition (neuropsychological testing), brain (MRI), real life functional ability (survey&#xD;
      data), and real life performance data (multiple errands tasks) will be gathered pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention to evaluate cognitive, brain-based, and real life functional improvements.&#xD;
