  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexual assault victimization is a common and particularly harmful form of trauma that is&#xD;
      associated with increased risk for high-risk drinking and other conditions of public health&#xD;
      concern, such as PTSD. Given evidence that sexual assault survivors who have low social&#xD;
      support or receive negative social reactions to sexual assault disclosure are more likely to&#xD;
      experience PTSD and drinking problems, improving social support is a novel target for&#xD;
      intervention. The proposed study will attempt to prevent the onset of high-risk drinking and&#xD;
      PTSD in sexual assault survivors by developing and testing a web-based early intervention&#xD;
      aimed at increasing contact with social supporters and mitigating the harm of negative social&#xD;
      reactions; ultimately, results will contribute to advancing the field's understanding of the&#xD;
      potential for social support to mitigate the harm of trauma.&#xD;

      This study involves developing, modifying, and preliminarily testing an intervention to&#xD;
      prevent high-risk drinking and PTSD in women who have experienced sexual assault (SA) in the&#xD;
      past 10 weeks. In the pilot trial phase of this study, intervention feasibility will be&#xD;
      tested in an open trial with N = 40 women with past-10-week SA histories, active drinking,&#xD;
      and elevated distress. Participants will complete surveys at baseline, termination, and&#xD;
      3-month follow-up. Participants will be randomized to either the intervention (N = 20) or&#xD;
      assessment-only control (N = 20). We hypothesize that (H1) most participants will respond&#xD;
      positively on items assessing satisfaction with the intervention, (H2) participants will&#xD;
      report above-average usability on a standardized measure, (H3) completion rates for daily&#xD;
      activities will be similar to previous web-based interventions, (H4) participants will show&#xD;
      significant learning as evidenced by increases in correct responses to knowledge questions&#xD;
      from baseline to post, and (H5) participants in the intervention condition will evidence less&#xD;
      high-risk drinking and PTSD at 3-month follow-up than participants in the assessment-only&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;

    <description>The THRIVE app involves 3 weeks of daily activities. Day 1 involves identification of activities to add to a &quot;self-care activity list&quot; with guidance around selecting activities that increase social contact, reduce alcohol use, and reduce avoidance. They will also complete an active-learning exercise about cognitive distortions and create a &quot;stuck point to-do list&quot; consisting of their cognitive distortions. In subsequent days, participants will be prompted to complete activities from both lists. They will also have access optional activities on topics such as asking for help, preventing isolation, deciding whether to disclose an assault, coping with negative reactions to disclosure, and thinking in helpful ways about social support. They will be prompted to complete brief daily surveys in the app, which will populate a symptom tracker. Participants in will have brief weekly phone contact with a coach to monitor safety and troubleshoot issues with app use.</description>
