      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder. People with this disease have a problem&#xD;
      with their hemoglobin. That is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen in the body.&#xD;
      Some people with this disease are enrolled in research at NIH. Researchers want to learn more&#xD;
      about the thoughts and opinions of those people. This may improve the way researchers explain&#xD;
      clinical studies, risks, and benefits to people with the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn about the motivations, decisions, and experiences in clinical research of people&#xD;
      with sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older who have sickle cell disease. They must be in an NIH study on this&#xD;
      condition. They must have been invited to join either a gene therapy or peripheral blood stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 interview. It will be done in a quiet room in the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center or by video call. It will take about 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview will be audio-recorded if the participant agrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their experiences with and thoughts on sickle cell disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their decision to participate in clinical research&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Factors that may have affected their decision to participate. These may include family,&#xD;
           disease history, or faith.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may complete a few brief questionnaires.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical trials testing potentially curative interventions for sickle cell disease - such as&#xD;
      gene therapy (GT) or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) - have created a&#xD;
      novel opportunity for patients with sickle cell disease, for whom standard therapies can only&#xD;
      manage but not cure their conditions. But some of these experimental interventions may pose&#xD;
      risk of significant adverse events. As the development of these interventions create a new&#xD;
      decision-making situation for persons with longstanding diseases, these trials raise&#xD;
      questions about the expectations and decision- making process of patients considering and/or&#xD;
      participating in them. Given the longstanding debate in the bioethics literature about&#xD;
      whether patients expressions of desire for benefit are (1) evidence of false hopes or poor&#xD;
      understanding of risks and benefits, or, instead (2) expressions of natural optimism&#xD;
      compatible with valid informed consent, these patients present an opportunity to learn about&#xD;
      how they make their participation decisions which in turn could inform this longstanding&#xD;
      debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore the expectations, understanding, motivations, and decision-making&#xD;
      of patients with sickle cell disease who have either chosen or declined to enroll in research&#xD;
      studies testing experimental interventions. The aim is to better understand how these&#xD;
      patients understand the research study, assess risks and benefits at the time of enrollment,&#xD;
      make decisions, and react to their health outcomes. As faith and religion are known to play&#xD;
      an important part in the lives of persons with sickle cell disease, we will also explore the&#xD;
      role of religion and faith in sickle cell patients decision-making and retrospective&#xD;
      perspective on their decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a descriptive, explorative study. It may generate hypotheses for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe how patients with sickle cell disease understand and make decisions about&#xD;
      participating in gene therapy (GT) or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT)&#xD;
      clinical trials to shed light about the ethically salient issues regarding enrollment and&#xD;
      participation in high- risk, high-reward clinical trials. This information may inform&#xD;
      practices around the informed consent process and help researchers better understand the role&#xD;
      of family and religion/faith in clinical research decision making.&#xD;
