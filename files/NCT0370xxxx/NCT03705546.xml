      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of physical activity on the postoperative&#xD;
      symptoms, complication, and quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) survivor is increasing as developing early diagnosis and&#xD;
      perioperative management. Despite multidisciplinary treatment, Surgery is the primary&#xD;
      treatment option for cure in NSCLC. The patients with lung cancer who underwent surgery have&#xD;
      limitation of pulmonary function and high risk of co-morbidities. Perioperative physical&#xD;
      activity has been shown to reduce symptoms and prevent complications, improve long term&#xD;
      quality of life after surgery. But validated exercise regimen has not been established for&#xD;
      lung cancer patients. Therefore, Evidence-based guideline focusing on lung cancer after&#xD;
      surgery is needed.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Before surgery (baseline), and 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The change of quality of life is measured using the European Organization for Research Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ) core30 (C30). The scale for quality of life is transformed into a score from 0 to 100, derived by 4-point Likert scale. A higher score represents a higher level of quality of life.</description>

    <description>The change of symptom is measured using the European Organization for Research Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ) lung cancer module 13 (LC13). The scale for symptom is transformed into a score from 0 to 100, derived by 4-point Likert scale. A higher score represents a higher level of symptom.</description>
