      Overall Aim Coronary artery disease significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      the United States. Atherosclerotic disease can lead to stenosis of the coronary arteries and&#xD;
      subsequent cardiac hypoperfusion. Patients with a critical stenosis of the LAD, potentially&#xD;
      leading to acute anterior wall myocardial infarction, may be asymptomatic at presentation&#xD;
      with subtle EKG changes as its only manifestation. It is imperative for physicians to&#xD;
      recognize patients with new T wave inversions in leads V2-V3 as the standard course of&#xD;
      management may lead to poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if collateral circulation to the left anterior&#xD;
      descending (LAD) artery will mask the presence of a Wellens sign and therefore diminish its&#xD;
      diagnostic utility. The conclusion of this study would raise awareness for physicians in&#xD;
      light of an absent Wellens sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The presence of coronary collateral circulation to the LAD masks the presence of a&#xD;
      Wellens sign (both Type 1 and Type 2) in precordial leads V2-V4.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction Electrocardiograms are an inexpensive and indispensible tool to assess cardiac&#xD;
      rhythm and ischemia. A Wellens sign on an EKG is either a deeply inverted (Type 1) or&#xD;
      biphasic (Type 2) t-wave in precordial leads V2-V3 (but may extend to other precordial&#xD;
      leads). It is associated with critical stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending&#xD;
      (LAD) artery. Patients with a Wellens sign are at high risk for extensive anterior wall&#xD;
      myocardial infarction as the LAD is the main coronary artery that supplies the left&#xD;
      ventricle. Exercise stress testing is contraindicated in this patient population. In&#xD;
      addition, appropriate management of these patients is crucial to avoid acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been a number of studies addressing the role of collateral coronary circulation in&#xD;
      myocardial infarctions. Some studies show that the presence of collateral circulation is&#xD;
      associated with improved in-hospital outcomes in patients following a ST-elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (STEMI) whereas others show that collateral circulation does not decrease&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in patients following acute STEMI. Similarly, patients with&#xD;
      collateral circulation may have normal EKGs and be asymptomatic at rest but are symptomatic&#xD;
      with corresponding abnormal EKG findings during periods of increased cardiac demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a critically stenosed LAD may be asymptomatic and have normal to minimally&#xD;
      elevated cardiac enzymes at the time of presentation with at rest abnormal EKG findings being&#xD;
      the sole clue to the patient's gravity. While some studies have shown collateral coronary&#xD;
      circulation lead to normal EKGs, there is limited research addressing whether or not&#xD;
      collateral circulation affects the presence of a Wellens sign. As a result, its diagnostic&#xD;
      utility is questionable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Aim Coronary artery disease significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      the United States. Atherosclerotic disease can lead to stenosis of the coronary arteries and&#xD;
      subsequent cardiac hypoperfusion. Patients with a critical stenosis of the LAD, potentially&#xD;

      light of an absent Wellens sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify if coronary collateral circulation masks the presence of a Wellens sign by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating catheterization reports Examining for the presence of coronary collateral&#xD;
      circulation Examining EKGs for presence of deeply inverted t-waves in precordial leads&#xD;
      Examining EKGs for presence of biphasic t-waves in precordial leads Correlating the&#xD;
      presence/absence of coronary collateral circulation with EKG findings&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of coronary collateral circulation to the LAD masks the presence of a Wellens&#xD;
      sign (both Type 1 and Type 2) in precordial leads V2-V4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This study will be a retrospective chart review of patients who received cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization and had LAD and/or Left Main lesions between the years 2000-2016 at Coney&#xD;
      Island Hospital. Catheterization imaging and reports will be reviewed for collateral&#xD;
      circulation. Subsequent pre-catheterization electrocardiograms, dated up to 1 year prior to&#xD;
      cardiac catheterization, will be reviewed for the presence or absence of symmetrical deep (≥2&#xD;
      mV) t-wave inversion (type 1) or biphasic t-wave (type 2) Wellens sign in precordial leads.&#xD;
      EKGs will be accessed either electronically or physically. All data will be de-identified and&#xD;
      coded to maintain patient confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What and how will you measure or collect data to test your hypothesis (or study objectives)?&#xD;
      A retrospective chart review of cardiac catheterizations will be employed to assess the&#xD;
      presence of coronary collateral circulation. Grading of coronary collateral circulation will&#xD;
      be divided into four categories (0=no filling, 1=filling of side branches only, 2=partial&#xD;
      filling of epicardial segments, 3=complete filling of epicardial segments). In addition,&#xD;
      pre-catheterization EKGs will be analyzed for a.) the presence or absence of deeply inverted&#xD;
      t-waves (type 1) or biphasic t-waves (type 2) and b.) the amplitude (mV) of each&#xD;
      corresponding Wellens sign. Demographic data including medical record number, age, gender,&#xD;
      and known risk factors, including but not limited to diabetes, smoking, drinking, previous&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, will be recorded for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Describe where the research data will reside and who will have access to hold or maintain the&#xD;
      data? Research data will be collected and recorded on a password protected Microsoft Excel&#xD;
      Spreadsheet. Excel file will be saved on Coney Island Hospital servers. Computers are&#xD;
      password protected and every effort will be made to ensure safekeeping of the aforementioned&#xD;
      Excel file. File will be stored for a maximum of three years and will be permanantly&#xD;
      eliminated following the conclusion and publication of proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be managed by Dr. Ida Hui Suen and Dr. George Juang. Data will not be released to&#xD;
      other collaborators. De-identified data will be forwarded to central office for assistance&#xD;
      with statistical analysis if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Describe the methods that will be used to destroy data and/or specimens at the end of the&#xD;
      research study life cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efforts will be made to ensure that all files are deleted from Coney Island Servers. No&#xD;
      specimens will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Statistical analysis will be performed with the assistance of Brian Altonen of&#xD;
      New York Health and Hospital Corporation's Central Office. Chi Square, ANOVA, and multiple&#xD;
      logistic regression analyses will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Approximately 6,000 patients received cardiac catheterizations at Coney Island&#xD;
      Hospital between 2003-2016. Approximately 30% will have LAD lesions (N=1800); of which&#xD;
      approximately 20% will have a Wellens sign (N=360).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables Age, Nominal Sex, Categorical (1=M, 2=F) Date of Catheterization Location of&#xD;
      Lesion, Categorical (1=LAD Proximal, 2=LAD Mid, 3=LAD Distal, 4=Left Main) Collaterals&#xD;
      present, Categorical (0=N, 1=Y) Grading of Collaterals, Categorical (0=none, 1= filling of&#xD;
      side branches, 2=partial filling of epicardial segment, 3=complete filling of epicardial&#xD;
      segment) Date of pre-cath EKG Wellens Sign Present, Categorical (1=Y, 2=N) Type of Wellens&#xD;
      Sign, Categorical (1=Type 1, 2=Type 2)&#xD;
