  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment for scaphoid proximal pole nonunion remains challenging due to the poor&#xD;
      vascularity in the proximal pole fragment, associated SL injury and the technique of&#xD;
      fixation. Vascularized bone grafts and non-vascularized iliac bone graft have been used in&#xD;
      patients with scaphoid proximal pole nonunion, but the indication has not been well&#xD;
      clarified. Alternatively, we have been treating such patients with vascularized bone graft ,&#xD;
      or non-vascularized bone graft with screw or k-wire fixation with considerable success. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate and analyze retrospectively the surgical efficacy of our&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Scaphoid nonunion are common and operative treatment with bone graft was reported to have&#xD;
      good result. However, the treatment for proximal pole nonunion remains controversial. There&#xD;
      are some patterns of pathoanatomy combined with scaphoid fracture, like SL ligament tears,&#xD;
      which could not be easily identified or treated initially. The proximal pole nonunion was&#xD;
      near SL joint. Therefore, proximal pole nonunion may result in DISI instability. Furthermore,&#xD;
      proximal pole nonunion was identified as a poor prognostic factor in scaphoid nonunion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past 10 years, we have some different technique, like VBG, arthroscopic bone graft to&#xD;
      achieve good results. Some studies revealed that significantly better SL stability was&#xD;
      achieved with ARASL. We also used ARASL with BG to improve proximal pole union. However, it&#xD;
      is not clear which method would be appropriate for proximal pole nonunion. We retrospectively&#xD;
      investigated the functional outcome and radiological results after at least 2-year follow-up&#xD;
      to clarify the surgical efficacy of these procedures.&#xD;
