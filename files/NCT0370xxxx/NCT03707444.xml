    <textblock>
      Pain is the predominant and most feared symptom of pancreas cancer, and is often incompletely&#xD;
      relieved. Scrambler Therapy is a new way of treating pain by providing &quot;non-pain&quot; information&#xD;
      to confuse the nervous system and reset the damaged nerve pathways. It has been useful in&#xD;
      treating many types of pain, but has not been adequately tested in the pain associated with&#xD;
      pancreas cancer. The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of Scrambler Therapy on&#xD;
      typical abdominal pain associated with pancreas cancer. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      pain scores from day 0 (pre) to day 28 (post) will be reduced by at least 33%, e.g. from 6/10&#xD;
      to 4/10.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreas cancer causes pain in 70% of newly diagnosed patients rising to over 80% in advanced&#xD;
      cancer patients, and is the most common serious symptom. Pancreas cancer pain is strongly&#xD;
      correlated with worsened survival, and relief of pain is correlated with better survival.&#xD;
      Pancreas cancer pain is neuropathic in origin and sensation, arising from direct invasion of&#xD;
      local tissues. Pancreas cancer pain is relieved by local nerve blocks in about 75% of cases,&#xD;
      but the relief is often incomplete, temporary, and the procedure is invasive with some risks.&#xD;
      As the cancer grows to involve more nerves, or the nerves regrow, the pain typically comes&#xD;
      back. For the 46,420 newly diagnosed pancreas cancer patients and the 39,500 patients who die&#xD;
      of it each year, pain is the one constant symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scrambler Therapy is a novel treatment increasingly supported by clinical experience and&#xD;
      multiple trials. The goal of the device is to provide &quot;non-pain&quot; information through the&#xD;
      cutaneous nerves to block the effect of pain information. The device is a cutaneous&#xD;
      electrical stimulator that creates waveforms simulating 16 different action potentials, then&#xD;
      transmits the action potentials via C fibers. The goal is to reset the brain to perceive&#xD;
      &quot;non-pain&quot; from areas previously interpreted as painful, similar to spinal cord stimulation.&#xD;
      The multiprocessor apparatus directly stimulates the peripheral nerves by the application of&#xD;
      surface electrodes on the skin, similar to EKG electrodes, putting the electrodes above and&#xD;
      below the site of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data on Scrambler therapy in pancreas cancer Scrambler Therapy appears to work on&#xD;
      pain based on results from multiple trials. In fact, the first trial was done on patients&#xD;
      with abdominal pain from abdominal cancers. In this first trial, 11 cancer patients (3&#xD;
      pancreas, 4 colon, 4 gastric) suffering from drug resistant visceral pain were studied during&#xD;
      the patients' first ten treatment sessions. The pain score before the treatment is shown next&#xD;
      to the pain score after treatment, for each daily treatment. The electrodes were placed to&#xD;
      surround the pain, following the dermatomes, as shown in Figure 2. The active (yellow)&#xD;
      electrodes are always paired across the pain with the passive (black) electrode. Pain was&#xD;
      quickly and markedly reduced and maintained until death. As then inventor wrote, &quot;During the&#xD;
      applications, all the patients reported a very rapid (in the order of a few seconds)&#xD;
      disappearance of the perception of pain. All patients responded fully to the protocol and&#xD;
      none reported undesirable side effects. Compliance was excellent.&quot; Nine of 11 stopped pain&#xD;
      drugs within the first 5 applications. &quot;During the reference period, nine out of eleven&#xD;
      patients (81.8%) are seen to have stopped requesting painkillers between the second and the&#xD;
      fifth treatment session. The remaining two patients (18.2%) considerably reduced the dosage&#xD;
      and undertook mild therapy.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be blunt, no one really believed these results. The magnitude of pain relief was large,&#xD;
      with a simple machine using non-invasive therapy. To this day, the trial has not been&#xD;
      replicated. But over the next decade, more and more evidence about Scrambler Therapy emerged&#xD;
      from different investigators that led the investigators to believe that there was a signal&#xD;
      worth exploring for relief in pancreas cancer. In the second trial, 226 patients with&#xD;
      neuropathic pain including failed back surgery, brachial plexus neuropathy, and others were&#xD;
      treated. Over 80% of patients responded with &gt; 50% pain relief, 10% responded with pain&#xD;
      relief from 25% to 49%, and only 10% had no response (P&lt;0.0001). Based on these results the&#xD;
      FDA approved Scrambler Therapy for cancer pain treatment February 25, 2009. The investigators&#xD;
      have recently compiled the published reports of Scrambler Therapy for a review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Treatment Plan The investigators propose a straightforward single arm trial&#xD;
      of actual Scrambler Therapy to see if pain can be relieved. This study also serves to get&#xD;
      preliminary information for planning future, larger, phase III studies that could compare to&#xD;
      celiac plexus block, spinal cord stimulation, or sham treatment. The investigators anticipate&#xD;
      completing the study in less than 12 months, with 18 completed subjects having up to 10&#xD;
      treatment sessions each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Patients will be recruited through the Kimmel Cancer Center's outpatient oncology clinics,&#xD;
      and the inpatient oncology and palliative care consult services. The palliative care service&#xD;
      now sees over 1000 new consultations annually, with about half with cancer, and pancreas&#xD;
      cancer pain is one of the most common reasons for consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1/Treatment Initiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment should be initiated by turning on the stimulus for the first electrode pair.&#xD;
           The intensity of the stimulus is increased until the patient can first feel some&#xD;
           sensation associated with one or both of the electrodes. Script: &quot;Tell me when something&#xD;
           is felt.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Then, over a few seconds, the intensity is increased to what is maximally tolerated.&#xD;
           &quot;Tell me when tolerance has been reached.&quot; In practice, this has been universally&#xD;
           understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Once the intensity is at its maximum setting, the research therapist will evaluate the&#xD;
           level of pain. If the pain level is not decreased, the machine will be reset to zero,&#xD;
           the electrodes will be repositioned and the machine will be restarted in the manner&#xD;
           described above. If the pain is not resolved with one set of electrodes, a second set&#xD;
           will be applied in a similar fashion. Once satisfactory electrode placement and stimulus&#xD;
           intensity is determined, therapy is maintained for a total of 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If a patient develops pain or a burning sensation with any of the electrodes, then the&#xD;
           treatment should be interrupted and the electrode should be evaluated. Considerations&#xD;
           include subjective patient intolerance, stimulation of a cutaneous nerve branch, or&#xD;
           exacerbation of hyperesthesia or allodynia associated with the neuropathic process.&#xD;
           These problems can be addressed by moving one or both of the electrodes farther away&#xD;
           from the area of pain. For the electrodes that were moved, the intensity should again be&#xD;
           increased and maintained at maximum for 30 minutes as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 2-10:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment will be administered using the same principles (each day evaluated&#xD;
           independently and not necessarily reproducing the electrode arrangements and stimulation&#xD;
           parameters of the previous day) for 30 minutes on consecutive days (Monday-Friday for 2&#xD;
           weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Up to two or three days may be skipped to allow for weekends and/or holidays, if needed.&#xD;
           If the participant presents without any pain, then the treatment will be &quot;held&quot; for that&#xD;
           day and this information will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treatment does not proceed if the patient does not have pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose and Application&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Electrodes are applied on the skin surrounding the pain-affected area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The electrodes are never applied directly on the pain area, unless there is no pain free&#xD;
           area. In that case, the electrode will be applied to the most pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations Overall This is a single-arm, pilot study to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of Scrambler Therapy for patients with pancreas cancer who have an average daily pain rating&#xD;
      of ≥4 out of 10 based on the Modified Brief Pain Index, question #3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Accrual The investigators are anticipating that the starting pain score on&#xD;
      average will be ≥4 based on Virginia Commonwealth (VCU), Hopkins, Italian, and Mayo Clinic&#xD;
      data. The investigators are conservatively anticipating that a relative reduction in average&#xD;
      pain score by Day 28 will be 33%, a level which is considered minimal clinically important,&#xD;
      based on the VCU, Italian, Mayo Clinic, and Walter Reed data. It is anticipated that&#xD;
      approximately 90% of the patients will agree to be re-evaluated at Day 28 and have paired&#xD;
      ratings available for evaluation. Thus, the study will enroll 20 patients expecting 18 to be&#xD;
      evaluable for the primary endpoint. Based on prior studies, the investigators assume that the&#xD;
      average pain value at baseline is at least 4 on a 0-10 scale with a standard deviation (SD)&#xD;
      of the original pain value expected to fall in the range of 1-1.5 in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, a conservative estimate of the standard deviation of the change across patients from&#xD;
      Day 0 to Day 28 would be approximately up to 2. Using a one-sample paired t test with a&#xD;
      sample size of 18 patients, this design will provide at least 80% power to detect a minimum&#xD;
      of 33% reduction in average pain score at Day 28 compared to Day 0 with a two-sided type I&#xD;
      error of 5%. The table below shows statistical power under different scenarios of a range of&#xD;
      baseline pain scores and intra-patient correlation for a 33% relative reduction at Day 28. In&#xD;
      the situation when variation of the starting pain score is larger than expected (e.g.,&#xD;
      SD=2.0), the sample size remains sufficient for this endpoint if the patients have moderate&#xD;
      to severe pain to start with (i.e., 5 or above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Primary Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline and change at Day 28 in average daily pain score will be treated as continuous&#xD;
           variables and summarized with descriptive statistics. Each will be explored to determine&#xD;
           if transformations (e.g. log or square-root) are necessary to achieve normality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exploratory plots will be created and means will be estimated along with 95% confidence&#xD;
           intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The investigators will use the paired t-test and Wilcoxon sign rank test as appropriate&#xD;
           to determine whether or not the data shows evidence of change from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The primary analysis will include all patients who have received at least one session of&#xD;
           treatment; the investigators' experience is that &gt;90% will complete treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A sensitivity analysis may be performed with patients who have completed 10 sessions of&#xD;
           treatment, but the investigators anticipate that this highly motivated group will have&#xD;
           &gt;90% completion rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All of the secondary endpoints will be summarized by item and by type of questionnaire,&#xD;
           respectively, using descriptive statistics. A summary score of Brief Pain Inventory&#xD;
           (BPI) will also be calculated by adding the total number of points across items.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The normality of distributions will be assessed and transformations be made as&#xD;
           appropriate. Mean changes will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals. Changes from&#xD;
           baseline will be evaluated using paired t tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A repeated measure of analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to test if there are any&#xD;
           changes over time on pain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Adjustment for multiple comparisons will not be made due to the pilot nature of study&#xD;
           seeking to generate hypotheses to be tested in future larger randomized trials.&#xD;
