  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicentric, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in select countries in Europe and South Korea sponsored by LYSARC and in Japan&#xD;
      sponsored by Celgene. There will be a combined enrollment target of 86 randomized patients,&#xD;
      with approximately 14 randomized patients from Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollment to the randomized study will start at European sites in parallel to a safety&#xD;
      run-in part in Japan. A safety run-in will be conducted to confirm the tolerability of oral&#xD;
      azacitidine at doses of 100 mg and 200 mg QD in Asian patients. Once oral azacitidine at 200&#xD;
      mg QD is confirmed as tolerable, Asian patients from Japan and South Korea will start to be&#xD;
      randomized into the main study. Additional patients (non-randomized) are anticipated to&#xD;
      enroll to the safety run-in.&#xD;

                  needle core biopsy, and diagnostic tissue should be available for central&#xD;
                  pathology review and for ancillary molecular studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Local pathology report should be reviewed by the sponsor's medical monitor prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECOG performance status 0 to 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Relapsed (after partial or complete response) or refractory AITL after at least one&#xD;
             line of systemic therapy (there is no mandatory resting period after the previous&#xD;
             treatment as long as the biochemistry and hematology labs meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
             as below.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Meet the following lab criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ANC ≥ 1,5 x 109/L (≥ 1 x 109/L if BM involvement by lymphoma)&#xD;

             Patients with only cutaneous disease will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Female patient of childbearing potential (FCBP) may participate, providing she meets&#xD;
             the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the investigator prior to starting&#xD;
             study treatment: serum pregnancy test at Screening and negative serum or urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test (investigator's discretion) within 72 hours prior to starting treatment&#xD;
             with study treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1). She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing&#xD;
             during the study (before beginning each subsequent cycle of treatment), and 28 days&#xD;
             after the last study drug administration. This applies even if the patient practices&#xD;
             complete abstinence from heterosexual contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Agrees to practice true abstinence (which must be reviewed monthly and source&#xD;
             documented) or agrees to the use of highly effective methods of contraception from 28&#xD;
             days prior to starting study treatment, and must agree to continue using such&#xD;
             precautions during study treatment (including dose interruptions) and for up to 6&#xD;
             months after the last study drug administration. True abstinence is acceptable when&#xD;
             this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptomthermal, post ovulation methods) and&#xD;
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Cessation of contraception&#xD;
             after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Agrees to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least 6&#xD;
             months after the last study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at&#xD;
             some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has&#xD;
             not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule&#xD;
             out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses&#xD;
             at any time during the preceding 24 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Male patient must either practice true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which&#xD;
             must be reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agrees to avoid&#xD;
             fathering a child, to use highly effective methods of contraception, male condom plus&#xD;
             spermicide during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing&#xD;
             potential (even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy), from starting dose of IP&#xD;
             (cycle 1 Day 1), including dose interruptions through 6 months after receipt of the&#xD;
             last study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Furthermore, male patient must agree to not give semen or sperm during study drug&#xD;
             therapy and for a period of 1 year after end of study drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. For EU countries, patient covered by a social security system&#xD;
