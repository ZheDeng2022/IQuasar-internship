      The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of menstrual cycle phases on recovery&#xD;
      and cognitive function after general anesthesia.&#xD;

      Study Protocol, Methods and Procedures to be Applied:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was started after obtaining the approval of the Ethics Committee, the written&#xD;
      approvals of the patients The study is planned to conduct between October 2018- December&#xD;
      2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study groups were selected from patients who presented to the preop anesthesia polyclinic&#xD;
      in elective conditions, septo-rinoplasty operation under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study groups will be selected from patients who presented to the preop anesthesia&#xD;
      polyclinic in elective conditions, septo-rinoplasty operation under general anesthesia.&#xD;
      Assuming that there would be a 5-point difference in anxiety scores among the groups, it was&#xD;
      decided to take 45 cases for each group with a 0.75 standard effect size, 80% power, and 5%&#xD;
      error. Patients will be randomly assigned to 2 groups of 45 people according to their order&#xD;
      of application. Patients will be randomized by inclusion into the determined groups. At the&#xD;
      day of surgery, the inclusion of the patient into the one of the group will be decided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study inclusion criteria: The study included 80 women with ASA I-II, aged 18 to 45 years, who&#xD;
      were accepted to participate in the study, were smoking, did not use oral contraceptives, had&#xD;
      no menstrual irregularity (regular 28 ± 2 days menstrual cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study exclusion criteria: In preop evaluation patients had difficulties in communication,&#xD;
      amenorrhea, pregnancy, delirium, psychological illness, major depressive disorder, patients&#xD;
      with a history of acute illness (such as in intensive care unit follow-up), which may affect&#xD;
      cognitive function and daily life activities in the last 6 months, malignancy, acute renal&#xD;
      failure, substance abuse and patients older than 45 years and male sex will be excluded from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about menstrual cycle patterns was obtained from all cases. The days of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle will be determined starting from counting the first day of the last cycle.&#xD;
      Patients with menstrual cycle between 8-12 days were called Group F (Follicular phase).&#xD;
      Patients with menstrual cycle between 20-24 were called Group L (Luteal phase). The follow-up&#xD;
      of the cases and the recording of the measurements were performed by an anesthesiologist who&#xD;
      did not know which group the cases were in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures to be Applied:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' gender, age, height, weight values, ASA scores, body mass index (BMI) values will&#xD;
      be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative anesthetic examinations of the patients to be included in the study will be done&#xD;
      at the anesthesia clinic at least 1 day before the operation. The preop tests that will be&#xD;
      required after the examinations will consist of routine examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operation room, hemodynamic parameters will be recorded at 5-minute intervals before&#xD;
      induction, after intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine procedures that is applied to similar patients will be followed during extubation of&#xD;
      patients. The inside of the mouth will be aspirated before extubation and the patient will be&#xD;
      extubated after muscle strength and consciousness's are restored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total anesthesia duration and total surgical duration, postoperative agitation, laryngospasm,&#xD;
      hypoxia, nausea and vomiting frequency will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After general anesthesia, the time of return of the behaviors such as opening the eyes,&#xD;
      fulfilling the orders or saying the age will be recorded and evaluated as the recovery&#xD;
      criteria. In the postop recovery period, the patient will be subjected to mini mental state&#xD;
      testing (MMST) and cognitive functions will be evaluated.&#xD;
