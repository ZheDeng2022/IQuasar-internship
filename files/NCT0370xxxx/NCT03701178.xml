    <textblock>
      All ceramic crowns are indicated in case of mild to moderate discoloration, restoration of&#xD;
      traumatized or fractured teeth and abnormal tooth anatomy. Long term success of all ceramic&#xD;
      crowns is affected by many factors. Fracture of the all ceramic crowns is the most repeated&#xD;
      failure pattern and represents about 67% of total failures associated with this type of&#xD;
      restoration through a period of 15 years of clinical performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a polymer that has many potentials uses in dentistry.&#xD;
      Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) can be used to support fixed dental prostheses. However,&#xD;
      information about physio mechanical characterization is still scarce.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a synthetic, tooth colored polymeric material that has been&#xD;
      used as a biomaterial in orthopedics for many years due to its lower Young's (elastic)&#xD;
      modulus (3-4 GPa) being close to human bone. PEEK can be modified easily by incorporation of&#xD;
      other materials. For example; incorporation of carbon fibers or glass fibers can increase the&#xD;
      elastic modulus up to 18 GPa which becomes comparable to those of cortical bone and dentin so&#xD;
      the polymer could exhibit good stress distribution . Moreover, tensile properties of PEEK are&#xD;
      also analogous to those of bone, enamel and dentin making it a suitable restorative material&#xD;
      as far as the mechanical properties are concerned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BioHPP PEEK is 20% ceramic reinforced, semicrystalline, thermoplastic and radiolucent polymer&#xD;
      for extreme durability especially for frameworks for fixed and removable dental prostheses.&#xD;
      It has many advantages as low density, light weight, shock absorber, biocompatible and&#xD;
      venerable with composite resin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BioHPP PEEK can be fabricated via CAD/CAM technology by milling PEEK blanks. It is also can&#xD;
      be pressed by using granular or pellet-shaped PEEK. Three-unit PEEK fixed partial denture&#xD;
      manufactured via CAD-CAM has been suggested to have a higher fracture resistance than pressed&#xD;
      granular- or pellet-shaped PEEK dentures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fracture resistance of the CAD/CAM milled PEEK fixed dentures is much higher than those&#xD;
      of lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (950N), alumina (851N) , zirconia (981-1331N). The&#xD;
      abrasive properties of PEEK are excellent. Despite of significantly low elastic moduli and&#xD;
      hardness, abrasive resistance of PEEK is competitive with metallic alloys .&#xD;
&#xD;
      BioHPP PEEK can be used under resin composite as a coping material. Because the mechanical&#xD;
      properties of PEEK are similar to those of dentin and enamel, PEEK could have an advantage&#xD;
      over alloy and ceramic restorations . A variety of procedures have been suggested to&#xD;
      condition the surface of PEEK in order to facilitate its bonding with resin composite crowns.&#xD;
      For example, air abrasion with and without silica coating creates a more wettable surface.&#xD;
      Etching with sulphuric acid creates a rough and chemically altered surface which enables it&#xD;
      to bond more effectively with hydrophobic resin composites .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to these unique physical and mechanical properties, BioHPP PEEK is a promising material&#xD;
      for dental application and it has been proposed for other prosthodontic applications such as&#xD;
      fixed prostheses and removable prostheses .&#xD;
