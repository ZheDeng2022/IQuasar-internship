      Identification of Causes and Risk Factors for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest through&#xD;
      Development of Prediction Model and Novel Biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify causes and risk factors of OHCA incidence that are associated with chronic&#xD;
           diseases and health behaviors&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify high risk population for OHCA incidence through development of a prediction&#xD;
           model&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To develop novel biomarkers associated with OHCA incidence, survival, and disabilities&#xD;

      Study design: Multicenter case-control study, 14 tertiary teaching hospital emergency&#xD;
      departments in Korea&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period: September 2017 to December 2023 (75 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Early cardiac arrest patients aged between 19 and 79 (1,780 cases) and&#xD;
      their age-, gender-, and urban/rural area-matched community controls (3,560 cases).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cases will be consecutive adult patients with EMS-treated OHCA and transport to the 14&#xD;
           emergency departments of participating hospitals. A prospective OHCA patient cohort will&#xD;
           be developed and all survived OHCA cases will be followed at 1-month, 6-month, and&#xD;
           12-month after ED discharge by telephone. During the study period, the investigators aim&#xD;
           to recruit a total 1,780 cases (200 cases between September 2017 and August 2018, 600&#xD;
           cases between September 2018 and August 2020, 80 cases between September 2020 and&#xD;
           December 2020, and 900 cases between January 2021 and December 2023).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  matched community-based controls (2:1 matching) will be selected from two health&#xD;
           screening centers. Controls are those who visit the participating health screening&#xD;
           centers for their annual routine physical examinations. During the study period, the&#xD;
           investigators aim to recruit a total 3,560 controls (400 controls between September 2017&#xD;
           and August 2018, 1200 controls between September 2018 and August 2020, 160 controls&#xD;
           between September 2020 and December 2020, and 1800 controls between January 2021 and&#xD;
           December 2023).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Following data will be collected for both cases and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical data: Basic demographic and clinical outcomes will be retrieved from medical&#xD;
           records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survey data: Comorbidity, family history of selected diseases, lifestyle behaviors&#xD;
           (including smoking, alcohol, physical activity, sleeping, nutrition, marital status,&#xD;
           occupation), and history of selected chronic diseases data will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples: The investigators aim to develop both clinical and behavioral (including&#xD;
           nutrition, alcohol, and smoking) biomarkers of OHCA. The investigators also plan to&#xD;
           further develop OHCA biomarkers using proteomics, genomics, and metabolomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-ups: All survived OHCA cases will be followed-up at 1-month, 6-month, and&#xD;
           12-month after ED discharge and their survival, disability, and quality of life outcomes&#xD;
           will be collected by telephone.&#xD;
