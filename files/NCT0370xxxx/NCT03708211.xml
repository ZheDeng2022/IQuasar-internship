  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the relative bioavailability of TAK-931 tablets in&#xD;
      reference to powder-in capsule (PIC) and to assess the effect of food and esomeprazole on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAK-931 as a tablet.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-931. TAK 931 is being tested to treat&#xD;
      participants who have advanced solid tumors. This study will look at relative&#xD;
      bioavailability, effect of food and gastric pH modification on the PK of TAK-931.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 44 participants. The study will be conducted in 2 parts:&#xD;
      Part 1 and Part 2. In Part 1 and Part 2, participants will be randomly assigned (by chance,&#xD;
      like flipping a coin) in a crossover design. In Part 1, participants will be assigned to 1 of&#xD;
      the 2 following treatment sequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-931 80 mg PIC + TAK-931 80 mg Tablet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-931 80 mg Tablet + TAK-931 80 mg PIC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study will be initiated, once the preliminary PK data from Part 1 is available&#xD;
      to determine the relative bioavailability of the tablet formulation in reference to PIC and&#xD;
      to calculate the single dose of TAK-931 tablet to be used in Part 2.In Part 2, participants&#xD;
      will be assigned to 1 of the 2 following treatment sequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-931 TBD Fed + TAK-931 TBD Fasted&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-931 TBD Fasted + TAK-931 TBD Fed&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the Netherlands. The overall time to participate&#xD;
      in this study is approximately 2 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic&#xD;
      and will be contacted for approximately 30 days after receiving their last dose of study drug&#xD;
      or until the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first for a follow up&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), CR was defined as disappearance of all lesions, PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD.</description>

    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of PD or death due to any cause, whichever occured first. Per RECIST V1.1, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SoD (Sum of Diameters) of target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest (nadir) SoD since (and including) baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the SoD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm).</description>

    <description>DCR was defined as the percentage of participants with CR, PR plus stable disease (SD) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 1 post baseline computed tomography (CT) scan evaluation from treatment initiation to qualify for DCR. Per RECIST v 1.1, CR was defined as disappearance of all lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SoD of target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest (nadir) SoD since (and including) baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the SoD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who has enrolled in a study; it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A severity grade was defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 5.0. As per NCI-CTCAE, Grade 1 scales as Mild; Grade 2 scales as Moderate; Grade 3 scales as severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; Grade 4 scales as life-threatening consequences; and Grade 5 scales as death related to AE.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adult participants with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or&#xD;

          3. With treated brain metastases are eligible if there is no evidence of progression for&#xD;
             at least 4 weeks after central nervous system-directed treatment, as ascertained by&#xD;

      <pre_assignment_details>Participants with advanced solid tumors were enrolled in 2-part cross-over design study to receive 1 of 2 treatment sequences in Part 1: TAK-931 80 mg PIC + TAK-931 80 mg tablet (Sequence A) or TAK-931 80 mg tablet + TAK-931 80 mg PIC (Sequence B). Part 2 of the study was not conducted due to the business decision, which was unrelated to safety.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who has enrolled in a study; it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A severity grade was defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 5.0. As per NCI-CTCAE, Grade 1 scales as Mild; Grade 2 scales as Moderate; Grade 3 scales as severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; Grade 4 scales as life-threatening consequences; and Grade 5 scales as death related to AE.</description>
        <time_frame>From the start of the study drug up to Day 30 after the last dose of study drug (up to 8 months)</time_frame>
        <population>The safety set included all participants who received any amount of study drug. As planned, safety data was collected and analyzed as per sequence and in accordance with the study design.</population>
