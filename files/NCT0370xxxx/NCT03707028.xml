  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, single-arm, dose escalation and dose expansion Phase&#xD;
      I/IIa study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2&#xD;
      dose (RP2D), and the safety and tolerability profile along with preliminary signs of efficacy&#xD;
      of rivoceranib in combination with paclitaxel as a second-line therapy in advanced, recurrent&#xD;
      and/or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer. This study will also&#xD;
      characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of rivoceranib and paclitaxel when given in&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
