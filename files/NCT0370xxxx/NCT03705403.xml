    <textblock>
      This will be a phase II trial testing if the combination of stereotactic ablative body&#xD;
      radiotherapy (SABR) and L19-IL2 improve the progression-free survival in patients with&#xD;
      limited metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The trial consists of one cohort with&#xD;
      two arms; C-arm and an E-arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with oligometastatic disease will receive SABR to minimal 1 and max all metastatic&#xD;
      sites (max 5 sites irradiated) and patients with diffuse metastatic lesions (6 to max 10)&#xD;
      will receive radiotherapy to max 5 sites. In the experimental arm, immunotherapy will be&#xD;
      given after irradiation.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IMMUNOSABR will include 126 patients. In this single-stage controlled randomised open-label&#xD;
      phase II trial, we aim to demonstrate an absolute increase in progression-free survival&#xD;
      (primary endpoint). PFS will be determined as the time between randomisation and disease&#xD;
      progression, according to RECIST 1.1, death due to any cause or last patient contact alive&#xD;
      and progression-free. Patients will be randomized between control (no immunocytokine) and&#xD;
      experimental arms (with immunocytokine L19-IL2) in a 1:1 ratio. The accrual period will be 29&#xD;
      months (or 2.41 years), and the minimum follow-up will be 18 months (or 1.5 years), making&#xD;
      the total study duration 47 months. Comparison between control and experimental arms will be&#xD;
      made using the Log-Rank statistic. This test for superiority will be one-sided with the&#xD;
      desired type I error of 0.10 and power of 0.90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the trial will be randomised into the control arm (C-arm) or&#xD;
      experimental arm (E-arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C-arm: Standard of Care (SOC) according to the local and national guidelines: (wait and&#xD;
           see or surgery and/or chemotherapy and/or standard (symptomatic) radiotherapy and/or&#xD;
           SABR, oligometastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  E-arm: SABR (oligometastatic disease) or radiotherapy (diffuse disease) + L19-IL2 up to&#xD;
           6 cycles (+ aPD(L)1 if SOC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected 1.5-year PFS is 15% in the C-arm and 35% in the E-arm. A sample size of 116&#xD;
      patients (58 patients per treatment arm) is needed to show this difference of 20% in PFS,&#xD;
      using a logrank test with a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and power of 85%. Patients will be evenly&#xD;
      divided over the two arms. Assuming a drop-out rate of 10%, a total of 126 patients (63 per&#xD;
      arm) need to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective The main objective of the trial is to test if the activity of the&#xD;
      combination of (SAB)R and L19-IL2 in patients with metastatic NSCLC will result in improved&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the SOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of the PFS of the patient cohort, at 5 years after randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of the overall survival of the patient cohort, at 5 years after&#xD;
           randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the toxicity of this treatment schedule;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess Quality of Life (QoL);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the occurrence of an Out of Field Radio-Immune (OFRI) response / abscopal&#xD;
           effect using imaging;&#xD;
&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a multicentre, randomised controlled open-label phase II trial testing if the combination of (SAB)R and immunocytokine L19-IL2 improves the progression-free survival in patients with limited metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patients included in the trial will be stratified for the metastatic load (oligo; max 5 or diffuse; 6-10 metastases). After randomisation, patients will be assigned either to the experimental arm or the standard of care (SOC) arm. Depending on the metastatic load, patients with (max 5 metastases) will receive in the experimental arm SABR to all lesions followed by L19-IL2 followed by standard of care therapy. Patients with more extensive metastatic disease (6 to up to 10 metastasis) in the experimental arm will be included following first or second line treatment with a platinum doublet and receive radiotherapy (3x8 Gy) to at least one (symptomatic) lesion, followed by L19-IL2 followed by SOC.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ assesses health-related QoL of cancer patients; it consists of 30 items and covers 9 domains + 6 single symptoms. There are 5 functional scales: physical, role functioning, cognitive, emotional, social; 3 symptom scales: fatigue, pain, nausea + vomiting; a global health and QoL scale, and 6 single items. Each item has four response alternatives: 1) not at all, 2) a little 3) quite a bit 4) very much (score 1-4 with range 3); except for the global health-status/quality of life scale, which has options ranging from 1) very poor to 7) excellent (score 1-7, range 6). Answers are combined into dimensions and scores are linearly transformed into a score of 0 to 100 according to the scoring manual of the EORTC QoL group. For functional and global QoL scales, higher scores mean better level of functioning. For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score means more severe symptoms. Scores are reported as mean and standard deviation. Scores will be used in multilevel-analysis.</description>

          -  Patients who are already actively participating in another study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who need simultaneous radiation on the primary tumour and metastatic&#xD;
             lesion(s). For these patients it might be an option to treat the primary tumour first&#xD;
             although this is not mandatory for this study. There must be minimal four weeks&#xD;
             between last treatment and randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is not allowed, although it is accepted when given at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks prior to randomisation or after the treatment period. Patients with&#xD;
             stable brain metastases are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous radiotherapy to an area that would be re-treated by (SAB)R, resulting in&#xD;
             overlap of the high dose areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Maintenance therapy with Anti-PD(L)1 treatment combined with chemotherapy is not&#xD;
             allowed during treatment ((SAB)R and L19-IL2 cycles).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other active malignancy or malignancy within the last 2 years (except localised skin&#xD;
             basal/squamous cell carcinoma, non-muscle invasive carcinoma of the bladder or in situ&#xD;
             carcinoma from any site).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitantly administered glucocorticoids may decrease the activity of IL2 and&#xD;
             therefore should be avoided. However, patients who develop life-threatening signs or&#xD;
             symptoms may be treated with dexamethasone until toxicity resolves or reduces to an&#xD;
             acceptable level (generally grade 1 and 2, however must be based at the research&#xD;
             physician's discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy to intravenously administered proteins/peptides/antibodies/&#xD;
             radiographic contrast media.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV positive; active HIV infection, or active hepatitis B or C (assessed in local&#xD;
             lab).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic treatment with either corticosteroid (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or&#xD;
             Interferon alpha or immunosuppressive medications within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             randomisation. Topical or inhalation steroids are allowed. If a patient needs to take&#xD;
             unexpectedly immunosuppressive medication during the trial, it will be allowed but&#xD;
             decreasing the dose as soon as possible is strongly advised.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of organ transplant, including autologous stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute or sub-acute coronary syndromes within the last year, acute inflammatory heart&#xD;
             disease, heart insufficiency NYHA &gt; 2, or irreversible cardiac arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A known impaired cardiac function defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)&#xD;
             &lt; 50 % (or below the study site's lower limit of normal) as measured by MUGA or ECHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertensive disease; (systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥160 or diastolic&#xD;
             blood pressure (DBP) ≥100 mm Hg during two measurements).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or evidence of active autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe diabetic retinopathy (neoangiogenesis targeted by L19 outside the tumour).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major trauma, including oncologic surgery, but excluding smaller procedures like the&#xD;
             placement of porth-à-cath or surgical biopsy, within 4 weeks prior to randomisation&#xD;
             (neoangiogenesis targeted by L19 outside a tumour).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any underlying mental, medical or psychiatric condition which in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator will make administration of study drug hazardous or hinder the&#xD;
             interpretation of study results. Unstable or serious concurrent uncontrolled medical&#xD;
             conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding; it is well known that ED-B, the target of both L19IL2, is&#xD;
             expressed in a variety of fetal tissues. Furthermore, anti-PD(L)1 treatment may&#xD;
             increase the risk of immune-mediated disorders. Therefore, it will be contra-indicated&#xD;
             for pregnant or lactating women.&#xD;
