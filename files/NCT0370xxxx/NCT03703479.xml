      To evaluate the healing effect of advanced platelet-rich fibrin (blood clot charged with&#xD;
      growth factors) taken from the patient own blood on the extraction site.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind clinical study. A preoperative and radiographic evaluation&#xD;
      will be done in order to select the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are healthy patients above 18 years old with vertical or mesioangular&#xD;
      bilateral impacted mandibular third molars. Exclusion criteria are missing second molars or&#xD;
      indicated for extraction (un-restorable and remaining roots), patients under&#xD;
      immunosuppressant and patients with acute infection. Those who fail to attend for follow-up&#xD;
      appointments will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) distal to the second molar will be&#xD;
      measured before each procedure. All patients will undergo bilateral removal of 3rd molar in a&#xD;
      single appointment. Envelope flap with distal extension and a full-thickness mucoperiosteal&#xD;
      flap will be utilized and the teeth will be removed with elevators. Bone removal will be&#xD;
      utilized if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the extraction, venous blood will be withdrawn to fill 2 tubes of 10mL each&#xD;
      (sterile vacuum plain tube for A-PRFâ„¢ +). The blood tubes will be spun in the centrifugation&#xD;
      machine for 13 minutes at 1300 rpm then it is pressed in PRF Box to form PRF clots which will&#xD;
      be placed in one the extraction socket while the other socket will not receive a PRF&#xD;
      (control).Randomization will be done using a coin toss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both extraction cavities will be closed using 3-4 interrupted sutures using 3.0 chromic gut&#xD;
      sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, all patients will be treated with oral antibiotic amoxicillin 500 mg and&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications ibuprofen 600mg in case. also, all patients will&#xD;
      be instructed to rinse with 0.2 % Chlorhexidine mouthwash for seven days postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the 7th,15th and 90th days, patients will be asked about pain using visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS) and whether they have any concern related to extraction socket statuses like halitosis,&#xD;
      empty socket, open socket, dehiscence, and infection signs including swelling, pus, or fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will also undergo a clinical examination at this visit and the consecutive visits. The&#xD;
      following measures will be assessed during each clinical examination: the presence of a&#xD;
      pocket distal to the adjacent second molar measuring the pocket depth and clinical attachment&#xD;
      level and any signs of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using statistical software. Analysis of multivariate regression will be&#xD;
      used. The healing status will be compared between the graft site and the control site.&#xD;
      Results will be interpreted to be statistically significant if they have a P-value of less&#xD;
      than 0.05&#xD;
