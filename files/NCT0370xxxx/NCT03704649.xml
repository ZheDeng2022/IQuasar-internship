  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent girls in the Upper Manya Krobo (UMK) district, Ghana are disproportionately&#xD;
      burdened by ill-health in relation to their male counterparts. Research also shows that this&#xD;
      demographic lacks access to nutrition education and health services. This research aims to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility and influence of an intervention that utilizes a participatory video&#xD;
      education model on adolescent girls' nutrition knowledge, dietary habits and health&#xD;
      behaviour. To address our research objectives, we will conduct a school-based cluster&#xD;
      randomized control pilot trial with adolescent girls, 12-16 years of age, who are part of&#xD;
      existing girls' clubs in 20 schools of the Upper Manya Krobo district. The intervention group&#xD;
      (10 schools) will use a participatory video education model and the control group consists of&#xD;
      standard-of-care education received in regular girls' club gatherings. The intervention&#xD;
      groups develop a storyboard and produce a short 5-7 minute film on a nutritional issue. These&#xD;
      videos can be used by teachers as a means of sharing nutrition information with students and&#xD;
      in stimulating discussion around the nutrition topic. Baseline and end line surveys will be&#xD;
      conducted to assess nutrition literacy indicators and nutrition behaviour. We will use&#xD;
      surveys to assess nutritional knowledge and attitude; food frequency questionnaire to record&#xD;
      dietary intakes; and in-depth interviews with participants and school staff to assess&#xD;
      challenges and strengths of the nutrition education model being delivered.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there are a number of health and nutrition services targeted to adolescent girls in&#xD;
      rural Ghana, there continues to be a high prevalence of anemia, preventable ailments, and&#xD;
      teen pregnancies among adolescent girls in the Upper Manya Krobo district. This project&#xD;
      builds on a health literacy framework and social cognitive theory and explores salient&#xD;
      features in nutrition education delivery with adolescent girls in the Upper Manya Krobo&#xD;
      district of Ghana, and investigates their influence on nutritional knowledge and behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research objective is (1) to assess the feasibility of a participatory nutrition&#xD;
      education model in the Upper Manya Krobo district and, (2) to determine if there is a&#xD;
      difference in adolescent girls' nutrition literacy between the intervention and control&#xD;
      groups. The research will provide a process evaluation and offer insight into a replicable&#xD;
      and feasible protocol that can implemented in other schools. We hypothesize that there will&#xD;
      be a difference in nutrition literacy indicators and dietary patterns between intervention&#xD;
      and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address our research objectives, we will conduct a school-based cluster randomized control&#xD;
      pilot trial with adolescent girls, 12-16 years of age, who are part of existing girls' clubs&#xD;
      in 20 schools of the Upper Manya Krobo district. Eligible clusters consist of primary and/or&#xD;
      junior high schools in UMK district that are implementing standardized girls' clubs and who&#xD;
      intend to continue to implement girls' clubs for the upcoming 2018-2019 school year (n = 59).&#xD;
      Clusters will be stratified based on 1) the presence of the school feeding program and 2)&#xD;
      accessibility to the school. Accessibility will be based on the quality of roads and time&#xD;
      needed to travel to the cluster from the district capital, Asesewa. After stratification,&#xD;
      clusters will be randomized into control and treatment arms. In each cluster, approximately&#xD;
      20 female adolescent girls' club participants who are 12-16 years of age will be randomly&#xD;
      selected and enrolled in the study through seeking informed guardian's consent and&#xD;
      adolescent's assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control groups (10 schools) represent the standard-of-care. Participants in these clubs&#xD;
      meet on a weekly basis during designated time for club activities in the school schedule.&#xD;
      With the guidance of their club facilitator they talk about a variety of health and nutrition&#xD;
      topics. The intervention groups (10 schools) will follow a similar curriculum and will&#xD;
      include a participatory video education model. The intervention groups develop a storyboard&#xD;
      and produce a short 5-7 minute film on a nutritional issue where they are the individuals who&#xD;
      draft the script, create the characters, video-record the shots, and act (if they wish) in&#xD;
      the video. These videos will be used in the group as a means of sharing nutrition information&#xD;
      with students and in stimulating discussion around the nutrition topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Baseline survey and weight/height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline surveys will be conducted to assess nutrition literacy indicators and nutrition&#xD;
      behaviour. Survey questionnaires will be administered at baseline by trained research&#xD;
      assistants using electronic tablets. The Open Data Kit (ODK) software will be downloaded onto&#xD;
      Samsung Tab3 tablets that will be used to record survey questionnaire responses. This survey&#xD;
      will take about 30-45 minutes and will be conducted in a private location on the student's&#xD;
      school campus. We will use surveys to assess nutritional knowledge and attitude;&#xD;
      questionnaires to record dietary intakes. She will be asked about herself and her family (for&#xD;
      example, age, schooling, occupation), what she knows about food and nutrition, her diet, and&#xD;
      how she spends her free time. Her weight and height will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed intervention entails the active engagement of key community members,&#xD;
      community-based organizations and governmental institutions in the UMK district. A community&#xD;
      advisory board (CAB) is formed by key stakeholders, including health professionals, community&#xD;
      health workers, government officials, and influential community members. Their primary role&#xD;
      is to follow the development of the project, help to identify key health and nutrition&#xD;
      messages, to ensure the credibility of the health message being disseminated, and to help&#xD;
      strengthen community connections necessary for the seamless execution of the research-related&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of two girl club facilitators per school will attend a training to review health&#xD;
      and nutrition themes dictated in the girls' club standard curriculum. Facilitators from&#xD;
      intervention schools will participate in additional film production workshops where they are&#xD;
      trained on how to write storyboards and scripts, and use microphones and cameras to make&#xD;
      short 5-7 minute films. In the intervention girls' clubs sessions, the facilitators lead a&#xD;
      discussion on nutrition topics and assist the girls to develop a scenario, storyboard and&#xD;
      script for the educational video they will produce. A script is written in the local Krobo&#xD;
      dialect and auditions are held in their club to cast the various roles. After the video is&#xD;
      produced, it is viewed and approved by members of the CAB, to ensure that material is&#xD;
      culturally appropriate and that the nutrition information is accurate. The video is made&#xD;
      available to girls' club teachers who will screen it for the students with the use of a&#xD;
      battery operated pico projector and speakers, after which the audience is prompted to reflect&#xD;
      on the video being watched. Each intervention group will produce two videos on the nutrition&#xD;
      topics covered in the girls' club session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout this time, observations will be gathered regarding attendance and the content of&#xD;
      the nutrition messages delivered in the girls' club sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 - In-depth interview and Focus group discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-depth interviews will be conducted with participants. Whether the female participant is in&#xD;
      the intervention group or not, she may be selected to be interviewed based on the&#xD;
      recommendation of her club facilitator through purposive typical case sampling. This is done&#xD;
      so as to gain insight on the influence of the educational curriculum and/or intervention on&#xD;
      the average student. The purpose of this interview is to better understand her experience in&#xD;
      the girls' club, what nutrition information she remembers from the lessons, what helped her&#xD;
      and what challenges she faced in putting into practice what she learned. The most significant&#xD;
      change methodology is used in the interview guide design. The interview will be about 30&#xD;
      minutes.These interviews will be conducted in a private location at their schools after the&#xD;
      guardian's informed consent and participant informed assent is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus group discussions will also be conducted with staff and community members that were&#xD;
      associated to the girls' club activities. The purpose of this focus group discussion is to&#xD;
      better understand their experience with the girls' club sessions. Focus group discussions&#xD;
      will provide insights into helpful aspects or challenges that were faced when supporting the&#xD;
      girls' club activities. Other questions will focus on the changes they may have noticed in&#xD;
      the participant's understanding and attitude towards nutrition and changes in their eating&#xD;
      behaviour. The focus group discussion will be about 30-45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4 - Post-intervention surveys and weight/height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys will be conducted with the girl participants at the end of the school year when the&#xD;
      intervention is completed. Surveys will be used to assess changes in nutrition literacy&#xD;
      indicators and nutrition behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from these surveys will be downloaded into a password protected and secured laptop at&#xD;
      the end of every day and then deleted off the tablet. Data will be backed up on an external&#xD;
      hard drive that is located in a locked cabinet of the offices in the Nutrition Research and&#xD;
      Training Centre in Asesewa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be given a code number to protect the participant's identity. With&#xD;
      their guardian's consent and the participant's assent interviews will be audio-recorded and&#xD;
      then translated and written out for our records. Audio files of interviews will be deleted&#xD;
      off equipment after the study is finished and they are only for the use of the researcher.&#xD;
      All equipment used in collecting or storing data will be password protected. Hard copies of&#xD;
      consent forms, transcripts, and demographic data will be stored in a locked storage cabinet&#xD;
      at University of Ghana and McGill University. In addition to the researchers, community&#xD;
      health workers and school teachers tied to the girls' clubs will have a copy of the final&#xD;
      films made by the girls to use in their educational activities.&#xD;

    <description>Participatory video education is an intervention model that gives communities the film-making skills necessary to make videos that can be used in nutrition promotion. For the purposes of this study, we will be using a participatory video model as an approach to educate participants in a school-based girls club on nutrition education topics. Participants are taught how to use film equipment and accompanied to draft scripts, create characters, video-record the shots, and act (if they wish) in the video. These videos will be used in the group as a means of sharing nutrition information with students and in stimulating discussion around the nutrition topic.</description>
