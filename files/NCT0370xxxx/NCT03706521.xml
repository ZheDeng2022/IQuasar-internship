  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study is a single center, open-label study of SM04690 injected intraarticularly&#xD;
      (IA) into the target knee (most painful) joint of moderately to severely symptomatic&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA) subjects at a single dose of 0.07 mg SM04690 per 2 mL injection. This&#xD;
      study will utilize magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (including T1rho and T2 mapping pulse&#xD;
      sequence MRI, three-dimensional spoiled gradient recalled [3D-SPGR] pulse sequence MRI, and&#xD;
      whole organ MRI scoring [WORMS]), radiographic imaging, Western Ontario and McMaster&#xD;
      Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and patient reported outcomes (PROs) for data collection&#xD;
      to assess efficacy outcome measures.&#xD;
