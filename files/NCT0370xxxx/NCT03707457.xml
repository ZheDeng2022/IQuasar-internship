  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to test if it is safe to give nivolumab with targeted&#xD;
      immunotherapy drugs for recurrent glioblastoma (GBM), a type of brain tumor. The study&#xD;
      doctors believe that giving immunotherapy drugs that match the biomarkers in a tumor will&#xD;
      help the immune system fight the tumor. Tumor tissue collected during surgery will be tested&#xD;
      for certain biomarkers to determine which immunotherapy might best target the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination immunotherapy arms include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: Nivolumab + anti-GITR Arm B: Nivolumab + IDO1 inhibitor Arm C: Nivolumab + Ipilimumab&#xD;
    </textblock>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine safety of each of the following study agents, anti-GITR, IDO1 inhibitor, and&#xD;
      ipilimumab, in combination with nivolumab (BMS-936558) flat dose in patients with first&#xD;
      recurrence of GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To estimate toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate progression-free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To estimate overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate pain for patients undergoing the treatment of anti-GITR, IDO1 inhibitor, and&#xD;
           ipilimumab, in combination with nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To characterize the immune response during and after treatment as measured by&#xD;
           immunohistochemistry, and other T cells etc. in peripheral blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize the pharmacodynamic and genomic activity in tumor tissue as target&#xD;
           inhibition&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To characterize radiographic response&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Genetic characterization of correlative samples&#xD;
