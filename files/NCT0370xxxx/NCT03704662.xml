      Patients are randomized into two arms. Arm A patients will receive Stereotactic Body&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy (SBRT) and Arm B patients with receive conventional concurrent chemotherapy&#xD;
      and radiation therapy.&#xD;

      RATIONALE: There are limited studies comparing novel radiation treatments with stereotactic&#xD;
      body radiation therapy (SBRT) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma to conventional fractionation.&#xD;
      Much of the existing literature indicates this technique is safe and convenient for patients,&#xD;
      as compared with conventionally fractionated concurrent chemo-radiation therapy. However,&#xD;
      there has been no direct comparison of these two treatment modalities when given in the&#xD;
      preoperative setting. It also remains uncertain if SBRT results in similar nodal downstaging&#xD;
      to preoperative, conventionally fractionated chemo-RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: This study is a prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel, two-arm, phase&#xD;
      II clinical trial. Patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomized after a&#xD;
      minimum of one cycle of induction chemotherapy. These patients will be required to have no&#xD;
      biopsy-proven distant disease on repeat staging studies before randomization. Patients who&#xD;
      have radiologically equivocal evidence of distant metastatic disease (small lung nodules, or&#xD;
      liver lesions that cannot be definitively characterized, etc.) are also eligible for&#xD;
      enrollment. Patients with biopsy-proven metastatic disease are not eligible. The total number&#xD;
      of patients planned for accrual is approximately 102 patients (51 patients per arm), with 14&#xD;
      additional patients enrolled to account for a roughly 15% drop out rate.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pathologically confirmed (histologic or cytological), resectable, borderline&#xD;
             resectable, or locally advanced type A adenocarcinoma of the pancreas; patients must&#xD;
             have resectable, borderline resectable, or locally advanced type A disease, based on&#xD;
             institutional standardized criteria and tumor board review.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with and without regional adenopathy are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients are eligible with either no evidence of distant metastatic disease, or&#xD;
             &quot;equivocal&quot; evidence of distant metastatic disease, as judged by the multidisciplinary&#xD;
             tumor board. This &quot;equivocal&quot; definition can include small lung or liver lesions that&#xD;
             are not able to be radiographically characterized otherwise. Any biopsy-proven&#xD;
             metastatic disease will make the patient ineligible for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History/physical examination, including collection of weight and vital signs, within&#xD;
             30 days prior to start of treatment.&#xD;

             a simulation (SIM) with interpretation. The CT SIM will not be done with&#xD;
             interpretation. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan and MRI are both optional but&#xD;
             encouraged. Ability to undergo abdominal MR scans for staging and radiation planning&#xD;
             and follow-up is optional but encouraged.&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Women of childbearing potential and male participants who are sexually active must&#xD;
             practice adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Distant metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior invasive malignancy (except nonmelanomatous skin cancer), unless disease free&#xD;
             for a minimum of three years (for example, carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral&#xD;
             cavity or cervix are all permissible).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of&#xD;
             radiation therapy fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any major surgery within 28 days prior to study entry (for example, insertion of a&#xD;
             vascular access device or biliary stent, exploratory laparotomy and/or laparoscopy are&#xD;
             not considered major surgery; biliary or gastric bypass is considered major surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Severe, active comorbidity, defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within&#xD;
                  the last six months.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time&#xD;
                  of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness&#xD;
                  requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy within 30 days before&#xD;
                  registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled malabsorption syndrome significantly affecting gastrointestinal&#xD;
                  function.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any unresolved bowel or bile duct obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Major resection of the stomach or small bowel that could affect the absorption of&#xD;
                  capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), based upon current Center for Disease&#xD;
                  Control (CDC) definition. Note, however, that HIV testing is not required for&#xD;
                  entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this&#xD;
                  protocol is necessary because patients receiving antiretroviral therapy may&#xD;
                  experience possible pharmacokinetic interactions with capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absence of any significant medical comorbidity which would preclude the&#xD;
                  consideration of major pancreatic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not&#xD;
             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception during the course of&#xD;
             the study and for women three months after study therapy is completed and for men six&#xD;
             months after study therapy is completed. This exclusion is necessary because the&#xD;
             treatment involved in this study may be significantly teratogenic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women who are lactating at the time of registration and who plan to be lactating&#xD;
             through three months after study therapy is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Prior allergic reaction to capecitabine or gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participation in another interventional clinical treatment trial while on study&#xD;
             (observational trials are permitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients taking nonprotocol-specified chemotherapy agents or immune modulating agents&#xD;
             for other medical conditions are not permitted to participate in this trial. Any&#xD;
             medication questions should be reviewed by the PI.&#xD;
