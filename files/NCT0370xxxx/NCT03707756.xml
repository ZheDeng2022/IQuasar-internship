  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gene mutations account for more than 60% of congenital sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in&#xD;
      Western Countries. Hereditary SNHL does not necessarily start at birth, however, as many&#xD;
      causative gene mutations only begin to express at much later ages, such as for example DFNA9,&#xD;
      also known as the ninth discovered autosomal dominant SNHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is characterized by a late onset of rapid progressive SNHL together with accompanying&#xD;
      vestibular impairment. The first reported DFNA9 patients were carrying the c.151 C&gt;T mutation&#xD;
      in COCH, which is the result of a substitution of cytosine by thymine nucleotide of the 151th&#xD;
      base pair (c.151C&gt;T). At protein level, this missense point mutation induces a mistranslation&#xD;
      to a serine instead of a proline amino-acid (p.Pro51Ser, (P51S)), producing mutant cochlin&#xD;
      that cause a dominant negative effect due to misfolding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the perspective of promising future hearing and vestibular treatment developments, such as&#xD;
      gene therapy, stem cell therapy, neural regeneration, in association with cochlear and/or&#xD;
      vestibular implantation, a more accurate understanding of the onset of the very first signs&#xD;
      of the auditory and vestibular deterioration is important. However, in early stages these&#xD;
      first signs of impairment are very discrete and pre-symptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this systematic review is to identify studies related to DFNA9, caused by the P51S&#xD;
      COCH variant, describing detailed genotype-phenotype correlation in relation to the age and&#xD;
      to investigate the age of onset of the SNHL and peripheral vestibular function as well as&#xD;
      their progression in relation to age.&#xD;

      The strategy and methodology used for the systematic review was based on the PRISMA Statement&#xD;
      (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Medline, PubMed, Cochrane&#xD;
      Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ISI Web of&#xD;
      Knowledge and Web of Science were searched. Information was retrieved about COCH mutations&#xD;
      causing DFNA9, including phenotype, genotype, audiometric and vestibular data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audiometric data were collected using individual measurements or pure tone average incides in&#xD;
      the selected records.In case of different audiometric data presentation, for instance&#xD;
      audiograms or different pure tone average (PTA) plots against age, a comprehensive assessment&#xD;
      and inventory of all individual measurements was conducted. All available measurements at&#xD;
      both ears per frequency were inventoried and a binaural mean value for each frequency per age&#xD;
      was averaged, before the calculation of the indices. If longitudinal measurements of the same&#xD;
      individual were shown, all the available data was included in the assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters for the audiometric data were inventoried: pure tone average (PTA),&#xD;
      Annual Threshold detarioration (ATD) per frequency and/or PTA, Age-related Typical Audiogram&#xD;
      (ARTA) and age of onset of the sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the vestibular function, all different parameters of the vestibular function were&#xD;
      inventoried. Normative values, if mentioned, were used to evaluate the measurements. An&#xD;
      overall inventory of all individual vestibular measurements in relation to age was conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters for the vestibular function were inventoried: Time Constant (T)&#xD;
      derived from velocity-step test (VST) in seconds, Caloric response gain on&#xD;
      electronystagmography, Annual vestibular deterioration rate and age of onset of vestibular&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
