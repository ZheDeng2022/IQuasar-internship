      The study will be a prospective, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial of the comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness of diagnostic evaluation strategies for stable CAD, to be performed in&#xD;
      outpatient settings, including primary care and cardiology practices.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 within a clinical center to either a precision evaluation strategy or usual care using an interactive web or voice-based system (IXRS). Randomization will be stratified by intended first test if randomized to usual care and by classification as minimal vs. elevated risk by the minimal risk model. The randomization scheme within a clinical center will be carried out by the method of random permuted block design with variable block size</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants randomized to a precision strategy will be assigned to either guideline-recommended care without immediately planned testing (low risk) or cCTA with selective FFRct (elevated risk) using a risk tool based on pretest clinical characteristics derived from the PROMISE trial and validated in SCOT-HEART trial. Participants assigned to guideline-recommended care without planned testing will be treated with preventive and antianginal medical treatment per guideline recommendations and clinical judgment and followed without testing.</description>

    <description>PRECISE will evaluate whether a precision evaluation strategy that combines contemporary risk stratification using the PROMISE Risk Tool with functional and anatomic non-invasive evaluation with cCTA with selective FFRct can improve outcomes over usual care in stable chest pain patients while safely deferring further testing in low-risk patients and reducing cost overall</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria (all must be present):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age ≥18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Stable typical or atypical symptoms suggesting possible significant coronary artery&#xD;
             disease (CAD) with further non-emergent testing or elective catheterization&#xD;
             recommended to evaluate the presence of suspected significant CAD. Stable chest pain&#xD;
             (or equivalent) includes those who have fully been ruled out for Acute Coronary&#xD;
             Syndrome (ACS) and for whom elective testing is recommended, regardless of the venue&#xD;
             in which they are seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If prior CV testing has occurred, it must have been performed greater than one year&#xD;
             prior to randomization, and the following must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. cCTA or invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with stenosis &lt; 50%&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Quantified coronary artery calcium (CAC) &lt; 100 AG&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Safe performance of cCTA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Creatinine clearance ≥45 ml/min per most recent measurement within 90 days&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. For a female participant of childbearing potential (those who have not been&#xD;
                  surgically sterilized or are not postmenopausal), a pregnancy test must be&#xD;
                  performed with negative results known within 7 days prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willingness to comply with all aspects of the protocol, including adherence to the&#xD;
             assigned strategy and follow-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Ability to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria (all must be absent):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Acute chest pain (in patients who have not been ruled out for ACS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Unstable clinical status&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Noninvasive or invasive CV testing for CAD within 1 year. CV testing for CAD refers to&#xD;
             any stress tests, invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and cCTA (including calcium&#xD;
             scoring) only.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Resting ECG, resting echocardiogram and resting CMR (MRI) are not exclusionary&#xD;
             regardless of when were performed&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Lifetime history of known obstructive CAD (prior myocardial infarction, CABG or PCI,&#xD;
             stenosis ≥50%), known EF ≤40% or other moderate to severe valvular or congenital&#xD;
             cardiac disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Contraindications to cCTA including but not limited to creatinine clearance (GFR) &lt;45&#xD;
             ml/min as per most recent measurement taken within 90 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Exceeds the site's weight or size limit for cCTA or cardiac catheterization&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any condition leading to possible inability to comply with the protocol procedures or&#xD;
             follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any condition that might interfere with the study procedures or follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Enrolled in an investigational trial that involves a non-approved cardiac drug or&#xD;
             device which has not reached its primary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Life expectancy less than 2 years due to non-cardiovascular comorbidities&#xD;
