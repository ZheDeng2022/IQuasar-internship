  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if consuming arctigenin, a natural&#xD;
      compound from a Chinese herb called Arctium lappa (commonly called greater burdock), is safe,&#xD;
      and to measure the intake level of arctigenin in blood. Arctigenin is being studied by&#xD;
      researchers for potential health benefits such as helping to lower the risk of inflammation&#xD;
      and cancer. A human study has been done measuring the uptake of arctigenin into blood after&#xD;
      consumption of the herb extract containing arctigenin, and found no toxicity. Studies in mice&#xD;
      demonstrated that consumption of arctigenin in pure form at a safe level is highly effective&#xD;
      in inhibition of prostate cancer growth. Therefore, this study is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and uptake rate of pure arctigenin in humans, which may be potentially used in the&#xD;
      future for prostate cancer prevention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phytochemicals are bioactive natural compounds extracted from plants. Phytochemicals have&#xD;
      been considered as a major resource for developing non-toxic agents in prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cancer. However, most phytochemicals have&#xD;
      low absorption rates, and the dose levels necessary for their beneficial effects can barely&#xD;
      be achieved in the body after oral consumption, which limits their effect in humans.&#xD;
      Therefore it is in urgent need to identify phytochemicals of higher uptake rate (or termed&#xD;
      bioavailability). Arctigenin is a novel anti-inflammatory lignan mainly existing in the seeds&#xD;
      of the herb Arctium lappa. This herb particularly its seeds has been widely used in&#xD;
      traditional Chinese medicine to treat inflammation-related diseases such as cold, sore&#xD;
      throat, and cough. The anti-cancer activity of arctigenin has recently been identified in&#xD;
      cultured cancer cells and in animal models of several cancers. In prostate cancer, we found&#xD;
      that arctigenin is highly effective in inhibition of the growth of cultured prostate cancer&#xD;
      cells, while without affecting normal cells. The strong anti-tumor activity of arctigenin was&#xD;
      further confirmed in our animal studies with prostate cancer mouse models. By analysis of&#xD;
      blood concentrations of arctigenin, we found that the effective dose of arctigenin as&#xD;
      observed in cultured cancer cells was achievable in mouse blood after consumption of&#xD;
      arctigenin at a safe level, which suggests that the bioavailability of arctigenin is&#xD;
      adequately high for its anti-cancer effect in organisms. We therefore propose a phase I&#xD;
      one-arm dose escalation study to confirm the safety and bioavailability of arctigenin in&#xD;
      healthy men, and to determine the dosage for future phase II studies in prostate cancer&#xD;
      prevention. The study will use the traditional 3+3 design, which is the most widely used&#xD;
      phase I design in oncology. Three dose levels of arctigenin will be tested, and participants&#xD;
      will receive two capsules of arctigenin per day for 28 days, each capsule containing 250 mg&#xD;
      of arctigenin. Initially there will be three participants on each dose level. If there is no&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observed in any participant, the dose will be escalated to the&#xD;
      next level. If DLT is observed in one or two participants, three more participants will be&#xD;
      added. If DLT is observed in one or two participants out of the six, the dose will be&#xD;
      escalated to the next level. If DLT is observed in three or more participants of the six, the&#xD;
      previous dose level will be considered as the maximally tolerated dose (MTD), and three more&#xD;
      patients will be added to the MTD group for a more accurate evaluation of the safety. The&#xD;
      estimated MTD is the highest dose level with observed toxicity rate less than 0.33. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected at baseline, during week 2 and on the last day of the study. Urine&#xD;
      samples will be collected once a week during the intervention. On the last day of the&#xD;
      intervention (Day 28) we will perform a single dose challenge with arctigenin and collect&#xD;
      blood at baseline and at 1h, 2h, and 3h after arctigenin consumption in the morning.&#xD;
      Arctigenin and its glucuronide will be analyzed in blood and urine using high performance&#xD;
      liquid chromatography (HPLC)&#xD;
