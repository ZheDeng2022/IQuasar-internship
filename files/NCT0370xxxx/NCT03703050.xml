    <textblock>
      Prospective, non-randomized, single arm phase II trial with 2 cohorts of ALK+ ALCL treated&#xD;
      with nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: relapsed/refractory ALK+ ALCL with progressive disease after treatment (including&#xD;
      chemotherapy and ALK inhibitor and/or brentuximab vedotin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: ORR = best objective response rate (CR+PR) within the first 24 weeks,&#xD;
      assessed according to adapted Lugano 2014 response criteria for Lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A one-stage phase II trial with unacceptable ORR = 40% and promising ORR = 70%. 12&#xD;
      eligible and evaluable patients are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 Population: patients with a relapsed/refractory ALCL, having achieved CR with a&#xD;
      treatment including ALK-inhibitor or Brentuximab vedotin of at least 2 months and for whom&#xD;
      HSCT is considered for their consolidation therapy. In this case, nivolumab for 24 months&#xD;
      would be considered as consolidative immunotherapy instead as HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: progression-free survival (PFS) A PFS rate ≤ 50% will be considered as&#xD;
      unacceptable. Design: A four-stage phase II trial with unacceptable PFS rate = 50% and&#xD;
      promising PFS rate = 75%. A maximum of twenty-six patients will be included: 4 at the 1st and&#xD;
      2nd stages, 8 at the 3rd stage and 10 at the 4th stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No more than one third of the included patients must have received more than 12 months of ALK&#xD;
      inhibitor or brentuximab. Thus, the inclusion of these patients will be closed after 8&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
