    <textblock>
      A three arm cluster randomized trial randomizing government primary health clinics to a)&#xD;
      standard of care (SOC) with clinic invitation only; b) standard of care (SOC) and one&#xD;
      self-test kit to give to sexual partner (s); c) standard of care (SOC) and self-test kit and&#xD;
      monetary incentive given to partner conditional on clinic attendance and completion of&#xD;
      pre-set procedures to determine secondary accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial to be conducted in four districts (Blantyre, Zomba, Machinga and Chikwawa) in Malawi in&#xD;
      collaboration with the Ministry of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. proportion of male partners of antenatal care clinic attendees reported by the woman to&#xD;
           have tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) within 28 days of enrolling the woman&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Number of new HIV positives identified by providing trial services to newly tested HIV&#xD;
           positive clients in routine HIV testing service within 28 days of enrolling the index&#xD;
           client.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysed as intention to treat with all eligible antenatal care (ANC) attendees and&#xD;
      index clients at each health facility as the denominator, with unpaired t-test used to&#xD;
      compare each intervention arm to the standard of care (SOC).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Type of study: This proposal is for a 3-arm pragmatic cluster randomised trial (CRT) using&#xD;
      primary care clinics as the unit of randomisation. The three arms are: 1) Standard of care&#xD;
      (SOC) with written invitation to the partner, and two intervention arms of 2) standard of&#xD;
      care (SOC) + HIV self-test kits delivered by the partner; and 3) arm 2 plus a monetary&#xD;
      incentive for partners who participate in a linked-accuracy study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem: Malawi's Ministry of Health (MoH) uses a highly decentralized approach for delivery&#xD;
      of HIV services that delivers over 3 million HIV tests each year, and has taken the country&#xD;
      close to The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) 90-90-90 targets.&#xD;
      However, a testing gap remains among populations with barriers to accessing facility-based&#xD;
      HIV testing services (HTS), including men. The investigators recently showed&#xD;
      partner-delivered (secondary distribution) of HIV self-testing (HIVST) kits, via women&#xD;
      attending antenatal care (ANC) in urban Blantyre, to be effective at increasing the uptake of&#xD;
      HIV testing and subsequent HIV care and prevention services among male partners. However,&#xD;
      unanswered questions that remain to be addressed include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the accuracy of HIV self-testing (HIVST) when kits are provided by secondary&#xD;
           distribution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how effective secondary distribution is when fully devolved to Ministry of Health (MoH)&#xD;
           providers (&quot;pragmatic&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whether the high safety profile and acceptability of secondary distribution of HIV&#xD;
           self-test kits from antenatal care (ANC) clinics can be generalised to other clinic&#xD;
           services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of Ministry of Health (MoH), implementers and researchers: HIV self-test kits will be&#xD;
      delivered by the HIV Department of Ministry of Health (MoH), Malawi, in partnership with&#xD;
      Population Services International (PSI)-Malawi. Ministry of Health (MoH) aims to routinely&#xD;
      scale-up secondary distribution from antenatal care (ANC) clinics in high HIV prevalence&#xD;
      districts, and HIV testing services (HTS) nationally if results are satisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question: Can secondary distribution of HIV self-tests through antenatal care and&#xD;
      HIV testing services improve coverage of HIV testing in sexual partners of pregnant women and&#xD;
      newly-diagnosed people living with HIV (PLHIV), while maintaining low costs and acceptable&#xD;
      linkage, safety and accuracy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The broad objective is to determine the feasibility, benefits, costs, safety and&#xD;
      accuracy of secondary distribution of HIV self-test kits from routine antenatal and HIV&#xD;
      testing services (HTS) clinics in Malawi. The specific aims are to conduct a pragmatic&#xD;
      cluster randomized trial to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the feasibility of programmatic implementation of secondary distribution of HIV&#xD;
           self-test kits from routine Ministry of Health (MoH) clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establish the effectiveness of secondary distribution of HIV self-test kits on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. HIV testing among male partners of antenatal care (ANC) attendees&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and uptake of voluntary medical male&#xD;
                circumcision (VMMC) among male partners of antenatal care attendees&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Disclosure and couple testing among male partners of antenatal care attendees&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Identification of HIV-positive contacts among partners of newly diagnosed&#xD;
                HIV-positive index clients through routine HIV testing services (HTS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate the impact of secondary distribution of HIV self-test kits on the frequency&#xD;
           of social harms affecting distributors of HIV self-test kits&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Estimate the costs and cost-effectiveness of adding secondary distribution of HIV&#xD;
           self-test kits to the antenatal care and HIV testing service.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Estimate the sensitivity and specificity of OraQuick HIV self-test kits under secondary&#xD;
           distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Participants and intervention Pregnant women registering for antenatal care in 27&#xD;
      primary health clinics and newly diagnosed HIV+ clients from the same 27 clinics in Blantyre,&#xD;
      Chikwawa, Machinga and Zomba Districts. Restricted randomisation will be used to allocate&#xD;
      clinics to the 3 arms (1:1:1). Ministry of Health (MoH) Clinic staff in the HIV self-testing&#xD;
      arms will be trained in use of oral HIVST kits (OraQuick). HIV self-test kit supply will use&#xD;
      Ministry of Health (MoH) supply chains. Information and educational materials will include a&#xD;
      tablet with a video clip demonstrating correct use of kits. Data capture tools and training&#xD;
      materials will be developed with Ministry of Health (MoH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A full-time research assistant will support research-data capture at each clinic. For the&#xD;
      accuracy sub-study this will include a brief questionnaire, repeat HIV testing (2&#xD;
      finger-prick HIV rapid diagnostic tests plus repeat OraQuick) and dried blood spots (DBS) for&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) drug and HIV viral load testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two primary outcomes are comparison between standard of care (SOC) and HIV self-testing&#xD;
      arms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. % of women reporting that their partner has tested for HIV within 28 days of ANC&#xD;
           appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Number of previously undiagnosed people living with HIV (PLHIV) identified among&#xD;
           partners of HIV-positive index patients by Day 28&#xD;
&#xD;
      The six secondary outcomes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. % of partners of antenatal care attendees who start antiretroviral therapy (ART),&#xD;
           undergo voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), or attend discordant couples clinic&#xD;
           within 28 days of enrolling the woman&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. % of partners of antenatal care attendees who attend the clinic for any HIV services&#xD;
           within 28 days of enrolling the woman&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. % HIV+ index clients who self-report at least one partner tested for HIV as a result of&#xD;
           their diagnosis, measured at Day 28&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Number of partners of HIV testing services (HTS) index clients who start antiretroviral&#xD;
           therapy (ART), or undergo voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), or attend&#xD;
           discordant couples clinic within 28 days of index diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Number of partners of HIV+ Index clients who attend the clinic for any HIV services&#xD;
           within 28 days of index diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Risk of adverse events (e.g. partnership breakdown, intimate partner violence, etc.)&#xD;
           related to self-testing reported by antenatal care / HIV-positive index clients,&#xD;
           measured at Day 28&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      9 clinics per arm each recruiting 350 antenatal care clients and 135 newly diagnosed people&#xD;
      living with HIV (PLHIV) will provide 90% power to detect a 12% absolute difference in the&#xD;
      primary outcome, assuming 20% of standard of care (SOC) partners, and a coefficient of&#xD;
      variation (k) of 0.25. Cluster-level summaries with a t-test applied to the mean of clinic&#xD;
      proportions will be compared to the standard of care (SOC) for the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations: The investigators request a waiver of informed consent for HIV&#xD;
      self-testing, as this is now international best practice, and delivery will be by Ministry of&#xD;
      Health (MoH) routine systems. Written informed consent (witnessed thumb-print if illiterate)&#xD;
      will be taken from all participants in the accuracy sub-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination: The results will be used to inform Ministry of Health (MoH) on HIV&#xD;
      self-testing scale-up plans, and will also be disseminated through College of Medicine in&#xD;
      Blantyre including College of Medicine Research Ethics Committee (COMREC), and through&#xD;
      conference presentations and publication in peer-reviewed journal.&#xD;
