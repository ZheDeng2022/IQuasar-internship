  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to examine the analgesic efficacy of genicular nerve blocks for pain after&#xD;
      total knee replacement.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part of the way in which pain is controlled during total knee replacement surgery is through&#xD;
      a nerve block. The investigators have developed an effective protocol for pain control after&#xD;
      knee replacement, but know that many patients still experience pain around the knee after&#xD;
      knee replacement. There are nerves around the knee that carry pain impulses from behind the&#xD;
      knee. The investigators believe that placing numbing medicine around these nerves can help&#xD;
      with pain in front of the knee after surgery, in addition to the standard nerve block placed&#xD;
      for knee replacement surgery. This may result in taking less pain medication by mouth,and&#xD;
      having less pain with movement. For this study, before the operation, either a placebo&#xD;
      solution or the local anesthetic bupivacaine (a numbing solution) will be placed at three&#xD;
      sites around the knee where these nerves reside. The investigators will evaluate how&#xD;
      participants feel in recovery after surgery, during the stay in the hospital, and call at&#xD;
      home one week after surgery. Knowing if numbing these nerves helps with pain after surgery&#xD;
      will help us further refine our postoperative care plan for patients.&#xD;

    <description>The ultrasound-guided genicular nerve block will be performed at the site of the superior lateral, the superior medial, and the inferior medial genicular nerves. Color Doppler will be used to identify the arterial structures which serve as landmarks for the corresponding nerves.&#xD;
After skin local anesthetic infiltration, a 10 cm 21G insulated block needle will be inserted and aligned with the ultrasound scanning plane. Once satisfactory position of the needle is confirmed, 5mL of a solution containing 15 ml 0.25% bupivacaine with 2mg dexamethasone or 5mL saline will be slowly injected. Spread of local anesthetic will be documented adjacent to the target nerve. This procedure will be performed at the site of the three genicular nerves described.</description>
