    <measure>maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ibrutinib</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A standard 3+3 design will be employed. Four dose levels will be investigated. Patients will be treated in cohorts of size three to six and the dosage will be escalated if the clinical toxicity is acceptable. A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as in any of the following during cycle 1: any grade 4 hematologic toxicity, grade 3 febrile neutropenia and grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding or any grade ≥3 non-hematologic toxicity that does not respond to supportive therapy and at least possibly related to treatment with ibrutinib. A minimum of 4 up to a maximum of 30 patients will be enrolled.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>progression free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of treatment start to the date of the first documented PD or death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have progressed or died at the date of the analysis cut-off or when he/she receives any further anti-cancer therapy, PFS is censored at the time of the last tumor assessment before the cutoff date and before the anti-cancer therapy date. PFS will be based on the investigator&quot;s assessment of MRI, CSF studies and clinical presentation.</description>
