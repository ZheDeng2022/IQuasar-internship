  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of sensitization and contact dermatitis among workers exposed to epoxy resin systems&#xD;
      (ERS) is high despite extensive preventive efforts, probably because skin exposure is often&#xD;
      left unrecognized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project is to prevent epoxy-related dermatitis and sensitization,&#xD;
      caused by working with ERS, by fluorescence visualization of exposure. In cooperation with&#xD;
      global manufacturers of wind turbines, 250 lamination workers will be allocated to either an&#xD;
      intervention or a control Group. The risk of dermatitis and sensitization will be compared.&#xD;
      Skin exposure will be made visible by a fluorescent tracer added to the ERS. UVA-light will&#xD;
      illuminate the skin of head, neck, arms and hands and the fluorescent areas will be recorded&#xD;
      and quantified by a computer vision system. The intervention group will be shown the&#xD;
      fluorescent areas on their skin, while the control group will not have this information. The&#xD;
      intervention takes place daily for a period of 1 month, 4 times during the 2 year follow up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants are patch tested, screened for dermatitis and atopy at start and end of&#xD;
      follow up or at end of employment. The investigators also assess potential determinants for&#xD;
      ERS exposure including working tasks and procedures. Information on dermatitis diagnoses from&#xD;
      hospital contacts, medical prescriptions and education will be obtained from registers.&#xD;

      Objectives The overarching objective is to reduce the risk of dermatitis and sensitization&#xD;
      when working with epoxy resin systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify work procedures at increased risk of dermal exposure to epoxy resins&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine if fluorescence visualization of dermal exposure to epoxy resins reduces the&#xD;
           risk of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  subsequent dermal exposure to epoxy resins&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  dermatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  sensitization to epoxy resins&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the risk of dermatitis following sensitization to ERS components&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the course of sensitization to ERS components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods Study population The study population is 250 employees of two factories&#xD;
      producing rotor blades for wind turbines. The participants all have daily manual work with&#xD;
      ERS. Participants will be recruited through the Health Safety and Environment (HSE)&#xD;
      organizations by oral and written information. Current employees will be followed for 2&#xD;
      years. Employees employed during the study will continuously be recruited and followed until&#xD;
      end of follow up, 2 years after study start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of exposure ERS used in the production of wind turbines is fluorescent under&#xD;
      UVA-light. We have developed a computer vision system which will illuminate the skin of the&#xD;
      workers and record the fluorescent areas on the exposed skin areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system will, for milliseconds, illuminate the skin of head, neck, arms and hands with&#xD;
      UVA-light that does not allow the participants to notice the fluorescent skin areas. Digital&#xD;
      images of the fluorescent areas will be displayed to the participants on a screen.&#xD;
      Participants will record skin exposure with the vision system every time a production area is&#xD;
      left i.e. for lunch breaks, toilet visits and at the end of a work day. At each time,&#xD;
      participants will report work procedures and use of protective equipment during the preceding&#xD;
      few hours and this information will be stored and linked with the skin exposure measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be able to operate the system themselves; it will register and store&#xD;
      all data inclusive their identity for later analysis. The system is handy and can be&#xD;
      transported easily and the procedure will only take a couple minutes. The fluorescence&#xD;
      measurements will take place daily for a period of 1-2 month, 4 times during the 2 year&#xD;
      follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire At start and end of follow up, participants are asked to fill in a brief&#xD;
      questionnaire concerning recent and former skin rashes, allergies, atopic dermatitis, asthma&#xD;
      and life style factors. The questionnaire will be a shortened version of the Nordic&#xD;
      Occupational Skin Questionnaire and ECRHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination and blood samples To test for atopy, participants will provide a blood&#xD;
      sample for subsequent analysis of specific IgE for standard inhalation allergens.&#xD;
      Participants reporting skin rash or symptoms from airways will be invited to a clinical&#xD;
      examination for diagnostic classification.Photo documentation of the skin will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patch testing All participants will be patch tested for ERS components. a specially profiled&#xD;
      occupational patch test series will be developed as done in former studies of epoxy exposed&#xD;
      workers. The test materials are diluted according to recommended test concentrations. New&#xD;
      materials are tested on 20 patients with dermatitis from the Yrkes och Miljödermatologisk&#xD;
      Afdeling, Skånes Universitetssjukhus. Test concentrations are subsequently adjusted if&#xD;
      necessary. A dilution series on the 20 test patients will be added in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      degree of sensitization by positive reactions. All participants are also tested with the&#xD;
      European standard patch test series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patch testing will be performed at the workplaces at start and end of follow up. Employees&#xD;
      terminating employment during the study period will be contacted at home for testing. The&#xD;
      test material will be placed on the back, occluded for 48 hours with readings at day 3, 4 and&#xD;
      7. The backs of the participants will be photographed prior to application and in connection&#xD;
      with the readings. Possible skin reactions later than day 7 will be obtained by a&#xD;
      questionnaire supplemented with photo documentation by the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Register data Information about prescribed medications, hospital contacts (diagnoses),&#xD;
      education and other possible confounders or modifying factors will be obtained through&#xD;
      linkage with national registers. Data will be uploaded and anonymized at Statistics Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The 250 participants will be allocated to an intervention- or a control group,&#xD;
      around 125 in each. The intervention group will be shown the fluorescent areas on their skin,&#xD;
      while the control group will not have this opportunity. Work teams of 40 workers will be&#xD;
      allocated together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of 600 office workers will be asked to fill in the questionnaire. Of the 600 workers&#xD;
      100 will be asked to be patch tested and to provide a blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance The investigators will on a weekly basis monitor study compliance by checking the&#xD;
      frequency of the use of the visualization system. The quality of the visualization data&#xD;
      obtained, will also be monitored. The statistical results will continuously be evaluated&#xD;
      together with the HSE-responsible of the factories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses The investigators will analyze how different work procedures and&#xD;
      protective equipment predict intensity of skin exposure to epoxy resins in the control group.&#xD;
      The analytical unit will be exposure registrations and level of fluorescence. Since each&#xD;
      participant will contribute multiple recordings, data will be analyzed with mixed logistic&#xD;
      and linear regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of visualization on the risk of subsequent exposure will be analyzed by comparing&#xD;
      the occurrence of skin exposure in the intervention group with the control group. Data will&#xD;
      be analyzed with mixed logistic regression for reasons as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of visualization on the risk of dermatitis and sensitization to epoxy resin&#xD;
      systems will also be accomplished by comparing the intervention with the control group. The&#xD;
      analytical unit will be the individual participant and data are thus analyzed with&#xD;
      traditional logistic regression. Participants with dermatitis or sensitization to epoxy resin&#xD;
      systems at baseline will be excluded from these analyses. All analyses will be adjusted for&#xD;
      relevant confounders based on Direct Acyclic Graph (DAGs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical power Based on the expected incidence of dermatitis in a wind turbine plant,&#xD;
      around 225 participants in the intervention group and the control group, respectively, a&#xD;
      follow up of 2 years, and an expected annual incidence of dermatitis of 5 % in the control&#xD;
      group, the investigators will be able to detect reductions of 75% and 50% in the intervention&#xD;
      group with a power of 97% and 56%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives If exposure visualization reduces the risk of dermatitis and sensitization to&#xD;
      epoxy resin systems, this may have significant impact on the health of the many who work with&#xD;
      these materials worldwide. Global manufacturers of wind turbines and composite materials are&#xD;
      involved in the project and this is expected to facilitate the dissemination globally. Follow&#xD;
      up studies of persistent exposure to potent skin sensitizers with repeated patch testing has&#xD;
      rarely been done and the study may furthermore provide new insight to the epidemiology of&#xD;
      allergic dermatitis.&#xD;
