  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Youth depression is a highly prevalent disorder with tremendous personal and societal costs.&#xD;
      Guideline supported treatments are limited in efficacy and associated with side effects.&#xD;
      Novel, safe, and effective treatments are sorely needed. This study will examine the&#xD;
      biological targets, and efficacy, of cognitive training in combination with repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in non-medicated, depressed youth. If positive, the&#xD;
      investigators will have identified an effective, safe, and acceptable alternative treatment&#xD;
      for a population with few treatment options. Identifying biological mechanisms of response&#xD;
      will ultimately enable clinicians to tailor individual interventions for depressed youth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Youth depression affects roughly 10% of the North American population, effecting high costs&#xD;
      to both individuals and society at large. Unfortunately, few effective treatments exist.&#xD;
      Antidepressant medications such as selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are&#xD;
      associated with side effects, and possess marginal efficacy in this age group. Black box&#xD;
      warnings persist for antidepressants used in those under 24, owing to concerns that these&#xD;
      medications enhance suicidal ideation in this population. While guidelines and randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials support the use of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) as a standalone or&#xD;
      combination treatment for depressed youth, a large proportion of youth do not respond to&#xD;
      either medication or psychotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators propose to examine the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) in conjunction with cognitive training (CT) for depressed youth. rTMS&#xD;
      delivered to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is a safe and FDA approved treatment&#xD;
      for adults with treatment-resistant depression, and preliminary studies suggest its safety,&#xD;
      acceptability, and efficacy in depressed youth. Theta-burst stimulation (TBS) is a new form&#xD;
      of rTMS that can achieve antidepressant effects in a quarter of the time of conventional&#xD;
      rTMS. TBS is also thought to enhance neural plasticity. In this study, all participants will&#xD;
      receive daily (5x a week on weekdays) open-label TBS. In addition, half of the participants&#xD;
      will receive computer-based CT designed to enhance executive function, while the other half&#xD;
      will receive placebo CT. This approach may capitalize on rTMS-induced neural plasticity,&#xD;
      while improving depression associated executive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to investigate the efficacy of combination cognitive training and rTMS applied to the&#xD;
           DLPFC in youth depression, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to identify biological targets and predictors of response to combined CT and rTMS&#xD;
           intervention in youth depression&#xD;

    <measure>Improvement in symptom severity of depression as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression - 17</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (17-item version)&#xD;
This scale is used to quantify the severity of symptoms of depression&#xD;
Scale range: 0-52 (total score)&#xD;
Lower scores indicate lower severity of depressive symptoms (i.e., better outcome)&#xD;
Higher scores indicate higher severity of depressive symptoms (i.e., worse outcome)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in self-reported symptom severity of depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) is 21-item self-report instrument intended to assess the existence and severity of symptoms of depression&#xD;
Items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3&#xD;
Scale range: 0-63 (total score)&#xD;
Lower scores indicate lower severity of depressive symptoms (i.e., better outcome)&#xD;
Higher scores indicate higher severity of depressive symptoms (i.e., worse outcome)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in symptom severity of depression as measured by the Children's Depression Rating Scale, revised-version (CDRS-R) in youth under 18 years of age</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CDRS-R is a clinician-administered 17-item interview, with item ratings between 1 (=no difficulties) and 5 or 1 and 7(=clinically significant difficulties) (adding up to a total score between 17 to 113). It has been proposed, that a score of ≥40 indicates depressive symptomatology, whereas a score ≤28 was often used as indicative of remission within trials.</description>
