  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that obesity is associated with increased urinary oxalate&#xD;
      excretion, an important risk factor for calcium oxalate stone formation. By the&#xD;
      administration of a controlled low oxalate diet the investigators will estimate endogenous&#xD;
      oxalate synthesis in both non-obese and obese non-kidney-stone forming adults. This study&#xD;
      seeks to thusly increase the understanding of the relationships between obesity and&#xD;
      endogenous oxalate synthesis to serve as a platform to develop novel therapies for stone&#xD;
      prevention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Calcium oxalate stone disease results in billions of dollars in healthcare costs per year,&#xD;
      creates large economic losses due to decreased work productivity, and produces significant&#xD;
      pain and suffering in affected individuals impacting quality of life. Almost 9% of the&#xD;
      population in the United States may now experience a stone event at least once in their&#xD;
      lifetime and that figure is increasing. Although stone removing treatments have advanced in&#xD;
      the last few decades with a variety of minimally invasive procedures such as shock wave&#xD;
      lithotripsy, ureteroscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy, our knowledge of how stones form&#xD;
      and how to prevent them has not kept pace. Approximately 70-80% of the stones formed contain&#xD;
      oxalate. Oxalate is an end product of metabolism and an ubiquitous element of human diets.&#xD;
      Small increases in urinary oxalate can increase calcium oxalate crystal formation and thus&#xD;
      stone disease. Urinary oxalate levels are affected by both dietary and endogenous components,&#xD;
      complicating the discrimination between the two sources. Multiple epidemiological and&#xD;
      clinical studies have demonstrated a link between body mass index (BMI) and kidney stone&#xD;
      disease and also an increased urinary oxalate excretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interpretation of studies suggesting a link between obesity and the amount of urinary&#xD;
      oxalate excreted is confounded by the failure in most studies to use diets controlled in&#xD;
      calcium and oxalate. Adult humans without a history of kidney stones will be placed on&#xD;
      controlled low oxalate diets to estimate the contribution of endogenous oxalate synthesis to&#xD;
      the urinary oxalate pool. In addition, oral doses of 13C2-glycolate and 13C6- vitamin C will&#xD;
      be used to determine their conversions to 13C2-oxalate and provide an index of endogenous&#xD;
      oxalate production. Body morphometric indices, markers of oxidative stress, and insulin&#xD;
      resistance will be assessed in these subjects.They will also be evaluated with DXA and MRI to&#xD;
      define body fat content and distribution.&#xD;
