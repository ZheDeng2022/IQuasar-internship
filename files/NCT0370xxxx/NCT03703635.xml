  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is the most common cause of ischemical&#xD;
      cerebrovascular events. The risk of stroke recurrence or death of ICAD patients remains very&#xD;
      high. Even with aggressive medical management including dual antiplatelet therapy and strict&#xD;
      management of risk factors, 12.2 percent of patients with 70-99 percent stenosis of&#xD;
      intracranial artery had stroke or death during 1 year follow-up. In the real world, the&#xD;
      30-day risk of recurrent stroke of patients with aggressive medical management was as high as&#xD;
      20.2 percent. Balloon angioplasty and stent for intracranial artery have become important&#xD;
      alternative treatments to prevent recurrent stroke for patients with severe intracranial&#xD;
      atherosclerotic stenosis. Nevertheless, the SAMMPRIS trial has suggested intracranial&#xD;
      stenting has higher stroke and death rate than aggressive medication with high peri-procedure&#xD;
      complication rate. Previous nonrandomized studies have showed that stroke and death rate of&#xD;
      angioplasty for ICAD patients with severe stenosis of intracranial artery is lower than that&#xD;
      of aggressive medication. The primary purpose of this trial is to compare intracranial&#xD;
      angioplasty plus aggressive medical care with aggressive medical care alone for the treatment&#xD;
      of patients with 70-99 percent intracranial artery stenosis because of ICAD and to clarify&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of intracranial angioplasty through a multicenter，prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, parallel controlled trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This trial is a multicenter，prospective, randomized, parallel controlled trial. A total of&#xD;
      approximately 802 patients (Age≥18years) who suffered from TIA/nondisabled stroke due to&#xD;
      70-99% of the stenosis of one major intracranial artery (including anterior circulation and&#xD;
      posterior circulation) during more than 21 days before the screening period will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized into two groups according to the 1:1 ratio after offering informed content: 1)&#xD;
      Experimental group will receive intracranial angioplasty plus aggressive medical care which&#xD;
      is the same as the control group; 2) Control group will receive aggressive medical care only.&#xD;
      Aggressive medical care includes 100 mg/day of aspirin during the follow-up period; 75 mg/day&#xD;
      of clopidogrel within 90 days after enrollment, and whether clopidogrel should continue to be&#xD;
      used depends on the actual situation of the subjects; 20mg/day of atorvastatin should be used&#xD;
      during the year after enrollment, and whether it should continue to be used depends on the&#xD;
      actual situation of the subjects. Both groups will receive risk factors management including&#xD;
      blood pressure to maintain 130-140/90-100 mmHg and LDL lower than 70 mg/dl. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intracranial angioplasty combined with&#xD;
      aggressive medical care for symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis. The study consists of&#xD;
      11 visits including the day of screening and randomization, the day when the subject receive&#xD;
      intracranial angioplasty and/or aggressive medical care, the day before the subject is&#xD;
      discharged from hospital, 30, 90,180 days and 1 year after enrollment, and every half a year&#xD;
      after then until the third year. Demographic information, symptoms and signs, laboratory&#xD;
      test, neuro-imaging assessment neurological function rating scale will be recorded during the&#xD;
      program. The trial is anticipated to last from October 2018 to December 2023 with 802&#xD;
      subjects recruited from 30 centers in China. All the related investigative organization and&#xD;
      individuals will obey the Declaration of Helsinki and Chinese Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
      standard. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the&#xD;
      study. The trial has been approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Ethics&#xD;
      Committee(EC) in Being Tiantan hospital, Capital Medical University.&#xD;
