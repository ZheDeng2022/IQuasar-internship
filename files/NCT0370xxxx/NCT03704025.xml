  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that exercise training program guided by virtual augmented&#xD;
      reality glasses or by video from computer screen used at home will improve motivation into&#xD;
      exercise training and results in superior adherence to exercise training compared to current&#xD;
      practice. The primary objectives of this research project are to study the effects of&#xD;
      exercise training guidance by novel technology on 1) exercise capacity, 2) adherence to&#xD;
      exercise training, 3) changes in cardiac autonomic function and 4) quality of life in acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome (ACS) patients.&#xD;

      The subjects of the study will be recruited from the consecutive series of patients of men&#xD;
      and women admitted to Oulu University Hospital due to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The&#xD;
      study population will be randomized into control group (n=25) and study group (n=25) matched&#xD;
      with age and gender. For all subjects, clinical status including quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire, exercise capacity and autonomic function measurements will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline and after exercise training. Exercise training program is six months for both groups&#xD;
      according to current guidelines. All the patients will have a detailed and personalized&#xD;
      training prescription. Study group will have virtual augmented reality glasses or computer&#xD;
      with training video to motivate and control exercise training prescription at home.&#xD;
