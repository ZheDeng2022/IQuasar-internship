    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Cohort Treatment Plan is to allow access to alpelisib for eligible&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with hormone receptor positive, advanced or metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      harboring a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)CA mutation. The patient's Treating Physician&#xD;
      should follow the suggested treatment guidelines and comply with all local health authority&#xD;
      regulations.&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) &lt;50% as determined by Multiple Gated&#xD;
