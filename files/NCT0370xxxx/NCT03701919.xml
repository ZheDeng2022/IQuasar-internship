  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A common problem following sleeve gastrectomy surgery is called postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting (PONV). This problem is uncomfortable for patients, and can also lead to other&#xD;
      complications, including pneumonia. It is unclear what exactly causes this problem, but it&#xD;
      may be partly caused by slow emptying of the stomach. The current treatments for PONV include&#xD;
      medications, but these may only treat the symptoms. Botulinum toxin (BTX, brand name Botox®),&#xD;
      produced naturally by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and adapted for medical use, is an&#xD;
      neurotransmitter inhibitor of the neuromuscular junction, and produces temporary muscular&#xD;
      paralysis. BTX is widely used in cosmetic and other medical applications. Injecting BTX into&#xD;
      the pylorus, which is the circular sphincter muscle at the end of the stomach, temporarily&#xD;
      paralyzes the muscle, leaving it wide open, and allowing stomach contents to flow through.&#xD;
      This effect lasts for several weeks, and then goes away. This may help prevent PONV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) remains a common complaint after bariatric surgery&#xD;
      such as the sleeve gastrectomy, where the prevalence is estimated to be as high as 60-80%.&#xD;
      PONV is frequently of greater concern to patients than postoperative pain, decreasing patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and the perioperative experience. In addition, PONV increases the risk for&#xD;
      aspiration, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, incisional dehiscence, esophageal injury,&#xD;
      and other adverse events. Finally, PONV delays postoperative diet resumption and increases&#xD;
      hospital length of stay. Numerous medication regimens have been tried to reduce PONV after&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy, with varying success. A procedure called Botulinum toxin pyloroplasty&#xD;
      (BP), which involves injection of botulinum toxin into the muscular sphincter at the end of&#xD;
      the stomach, called the pylorus, has been demonstrated to improve gastric emptying. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that intraoperative BP during sleeve gastrectomy will decrease&#xD;
      rates of PONV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin type A (Botox®), produced naturally by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum&#xD;
      and adapted for medical use, is an inhibitor of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at the&#xD;
      neuromuscular junction, producing flaccid muscular paralysis. The effects of Botox® injection&#xD;
      are temporary and reversible, and its duration of action ranges from weeks to months. Botox®&#xD;
      injection has been widely used in many contexts, most familiarly during office-based cosmetic&#xD;
      procedures and also in disorders such as torticollis, spasticity, hyperhidrosis, bladder&#xD;
      overreactivity, and dystonias. It has been used endoscopically to relieve achalasia and&#xD;
      dysphagia by injection into the lower esophageal sphincter. Gastroenterologists have reported&#xD;
      successful treatment of gastroparesis using BP, by relieving the tonic contraction of the&#xD;
      pylorus and increasing gastric transit time. Postoperative endoscopic BP has been utilized to&#xD;
      improve gastroparesis following gastrectomy. The use of BP during bariatric surgery has not&#xD;
      been reported. This proposal represents the first study to evaluate the use of intraoperative&#xD;
      BP to decrease PONV after sleeve gastrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique involves pyloroplasty following completion of the robot-assisted laparoscopic&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy. The investigators mix 100 units of Botox® powder in 10ml of saline. Using&#xD;
      the robot, the investigators inject the pylorus laparoscopically using an 18-gauge, 0.5-inch&#xD;
      laparoscopic needle. Meanwhile, an assistant surgeon intubates the stomach with an endoscope,&#xD;
      which the investigators use to assess the gastric staple line and perform a leak test. Prior&#xD;
      to injection of Botox® into the pylorus, the investigators confirm endoscopically that the&#xD;
      tip of the needle is not intraluminal. After first aspirating to ensure the needle is&#xD;
      intramuscular and free from any vascular structures, the investigators then inject the&#xD;
      pylorus with approximately 5ml of Botox®. Proper placement of the injection is confirmed by&#xD;
      visualizing a rising weal. The anterior, superior, and inferior aspects of the pylorus are&#xD;
      injected with approximately 5-6 injections of 1ml each. The posterior aspect of the pylorus&#xD;
      is not injected, since this is not readily accessible from a laparoscopic approach, and also&#xD;
      contains the major vascular structure of the pylorus, the gastroduodenal artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique has been performed at Albany Medical Center institution more than 200 times&#xD;
      over the past four years. The Albany Medical Center Bariatric Center as participated in the&#xD;
      Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation for 10 years, and so has collected&#xD;
      comprehensive and granular data on complication rates and surgical outcomes. Analysis of this&#xD;
      data demonstrates that enteric use of Botox® is safe.&#xD;
