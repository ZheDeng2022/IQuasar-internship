  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affects up to 12.5% of the US population and has a significant&#xD;
      disease burden. The recommended medical management of CRS includes large-volume, low-pressure&#xD;
      saline lavage, systemic antibiotics, and intranasal corticosteroids (INCS). While the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of INCS are well-established for the long-term management of CRS,&#xD;
      penetration of INCS beyond the nasal vestibule and into the paranasal sinuses is limited. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of mometasone furoate large-volume,&#xD;
      low-pressure nasal irrigation for surgery-naive CRS patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) is a INCS that is used in the management of CRS. The&#xD;
      overall goal of this proposed research project is to optimize topical delivery of MF to the&#xD;
      paranasal sinuses in surgery-naive CRS patients through the use of high-volume, low-pressure&#xD;
      nasal saline irrigation. The investigators will be conducting a single-site, double-blinded,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT) in which we propose to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of MF nasal irrigation compared to MF nasal spray.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Sino-Nasal Outcome Test Scores (SNOT-22)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The change in Sino-Nasal Outcome Test scores (SNOT-22) scores pre- and post-treatment between the two arms was measured. The Sino-Nasal Outcome Test asks subjects to rate how &quot;bad&quot; their rhinosinusitis is by using a 0-5 point scale with 0=no problem, 1=very mild problem, 2=mild or slight problem, 3=moderate problem, 4=severe problem, 5=problem as bad as it can be. The SNOT includes 22 questions (symptoms and social/emotional consequences of rhinosinusitis), each of which are rated from 0 to 5 for a minimum score of 0 to maximum score of 110, with higher scores representing worse outcome.&#xD;
All relevant time points used in the calculation in the Time Frame (e.g., 'baseline and 8 weeks&quot;)</description>

    <measure>Change in Nasal Endoscopic Findings Using the Lund-Kennedy Grading System</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>A board-certified otolaryngologist will perform a nasal endoscopic examination pre- and post-intervention and findings recorded using the Lund-Kennedy grading system.&#xD;
The The Lund Kennedy System grades the pathologic state of the nasal cavity based on the presence of polyps, nasal discharge, and mucosal edema.&#xD;
Polyps graded from 0 to 2 (0=absent, 1=limited to middle meatus, 2=extending to nasal cavity) Discharge graded from 0 to 2 (0=absent, 1=thin/clear, 2=thick) Edema graded from 0 to 2 (0=absent, 1=mild/moderate, 2=polypoid degeneration). Scores are added for each side of the nose with a minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 12 with higher scores indicating more severe sinonasal inflammation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiologic Findings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Radiologic examinations, including CT scans of the paranasal sinuses, are not required for study enrollment. However, if participants receive paranasal sinus CT scans as part of their clinical work-up, the radiologic images will be reviewed and findings recorded using the Lund-McKay grading system. The radiologic data may possibly be included in the data analysis.</description>

The placebo nasal spray will be packaged identically to the mometasone nasal spray. Participants will be required to dissolve the contents of two capsules into an 8-ounce (240 mL) sinus rinse bottle along with the saline rinse. All participants will be instructed to perform the following once daily: irrigation of both right and left nasal cavity with one-half of the contents of the nasal rinse followed by 2 sprays per nostril of the nasal spray.</description>

        <description>The change in Sino-Nasal Outcome Test scores (SNOT-22) scores pre- and post-treatment between the two arms was measured. The Sino-Nasal Outcome Test asks subjects to rate how &quot;bad&quot; their rhinosinusitis is by using a 0-5 point scale with 0=no problem, 1=very mild problem, 2=mild or slight problem, 3=moderate problem, 4=severe problem, 5=problem as bad as it can be. The SNOT includes 22 questions (symptoms and social/emotional consequences of rhinosinusitis), each of which are rated from 0 to 5 for a minimum score of 0 to maximum score of 110, with higher scores representing worse outcome.&#xD;

        <title>Change in Nasal Endoscopic Findings Using the Lund-Kennedy Grading System</title>
        <description>A board-certified otolaryngologist will perform a nasal endoscopic examination pre- and post-intervention and findings recorded using the Lund-Kennedy grading system.&#xD;
The The Lund Kennedy System grades the pathologic state of the nasal cavity based on the presence of polyps, nasal discharge, and mucosal edema.&#xD;
Polyps graded from 0 to 2 (0=absent, 1=limited to middle meatus, 2=extending to nasal cavity) Discharge graded from 0 to 2 (0=absent, 1=thin/clear, 2=thick) Edema graded from 0 to 2 (0=absent, 1=mild/moderate, 2=polypoid degeneration). Scores are added for each side of the nose with a minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 12 with higher scores indicating more severe sinonasal inflammation.</description>

            <description>The study intervention will be mometasone furoate powder (1.2 mg/capsule) and placebo nasal spray. The placebo nasal spray will contain the same inert ingredients found in MF nasal spray: glycerin, microcrystalline cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose, sodium citrate, citric acid, benzalkonium chloride, and polysorbate 80. The placebo nasal spray will be packaged identically to the mometasone nasal spray. Participants will be required to dissolve the contents of two capsules into an 8-ounce (240 mL) sinus rinse bottle along with the saline rinse. All participants will be instructed to perform the following once daily: irrigation of both right and left nasal cavity with one-half of the contents of the nasal rinse followed by 2 sprays per nostril of the nasal spray.&#xD;

        <description>Radiologic examinations, including CT scans of the paranasal sinuses, are not required for study enrollment. However, if participants receive paranasal sinus CT scans as part of their clinical work-up, the radiologic images will be reviewed and findings recorded using the Lund-McKay grading system. The radiologic data may possibly be included in the data analysis.</description>
