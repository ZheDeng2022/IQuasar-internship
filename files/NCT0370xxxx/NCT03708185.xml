  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will seek to quantify whether a period of HIIT alongside β-alanine&#xD;
      supplementation will improve the adaptation to training, and therefore performance, more than&#xD;
      a period of HIIT alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whilst high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a powerful stimulus to increase endurance&#xD;
      exercise performance, there are potential nutritional interventions that can be put in place&#xD;
      to further increase performance gains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Energy for the contraction of muscles is created in the mitochondria. HIIT can improve the&#xD;
      function of mitochondria, therefore improving performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Β-alanine is a commonly used supplement that can improve exercise performance by increasing&#xD;
      the amount of carnosine in muscle. Carnosine has many functions that may help improve&#xD;
      exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will seek to quantify whether a period of HIIT alongside β-alanine&#xD;
      supplementation will improve the adaptation to training, and therefore performance, more than&#xD;
      a period of HIIT alone.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline work done on a cycle ergometer in a cycling capacity test at 110%VO2max following a period of 4 weeks of beta-alanine supplementation and then 8 weeks of beta-alanine supplementation and high intensity interval training</measure>
    <time_frame>At weeks 0, 4 and 12 of study.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will have previously performed an incremental test to exhaustion (VO2max test). A work-load that corresponds to 110 % of the peak power output (Wmax) will be calculated, and participants will be asked to cycle at this power output until volitional exhaustion. This test will be preceded but a bout of 90-minute cycling at 65%VO2max. Tests will be performed on a Lode Excalibur Sport, and software linked to the bike will record data.</description>

    <measure>VO2max</measure>
    <time_frame>At weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12 of study.</time_frame>
    <description>VO2max will be determined from data collected through a metabolic cart. It will be measured during an incremental test to exhaustion performed on a cycle ergometer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Substrate utilisation</measure>
    <time_frame>At weeks 0, 4 and 12 of study.</time_frame>
    <description>Substrate utilisation will be calculated from data collected through a metabolic cart and its software. It will be measured during the 90-minute steady-state cycle for 4 periods of 3 minutes. Carbohydrate and lipid oxidation rates will be calculated using equations by Jeukendrup &amp; Wallis (2005).</description>

    <time_frame>At weeks 0, 4 and 12 of study.</time_frame>
    <description>A cannula will be used to draw blood from subjects at several time points. Whole blood will be centrifuged immediately and its plasma split into aliquots and stored in a -80°C freezer for later analysis.</description>
