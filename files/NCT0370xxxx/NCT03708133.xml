  <brief_title>Study to Assess Bioequivalence of a New Nifurtimox Oral Tablet Formulation</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the current study is to investigate the bioequivalence of a newly&#xD;
      developed 120 mg nifurtimox tablet formulation (Test treatment) compared with the 120 mg&#xD;
      nifurtimox tablet currently used in the Bayer pediatric clinical development program&#xD;
      (Reference treatment). The new tablet formulation assessed in this study is intended to&#xD;
      replace the 120 mg nifurtimox tablet formulation currently used in clinical practice. It is&#xD;
      an immediate-release tablet with an altered composition compared to the reference&#xD;
      formulation. The new tablet overcomes pharmaceutical quality issues seen for the current&#xD;
      formulation, e.g. sensitivity to humidity. Due to safety reasons, the study drug will be&#xD;
      administered under fed conditions to adult male and female patients suffering from Chagas'&#xD;
      disease and not healthy subjects (see also Benefit-risk assessment below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the PK, safety, and tolerability of nifurtimox will be assessed as secondary&#xD;
      objectives.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Male/female patient diagnosed with chronic Chagas' disease: Previous diagnosis of acute&#xD;
        or chronic Chagas' disease by a health clinic prior to screening for the study. The&#xD;
        diagnosis of chronic Chagas' disease may be made by clinical findings, supported by&#xD;
        antibody titers if available. If there is a known history of acute disease, it is&#xD;
        preferable to have documentation of parasites on the blood smear, if available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women and men of reproductive potential must agree to use adequate contraception when&#xD;
             sexually active. This applies for the time period between signing of the informed&#xD;
             consent form and 12 weeks after the last administration of study drug. The definition&#xD;
             of adequate contraception will be based on the judgment of the investigator and on&#xD;
             local requirements. Acceptable methods of contraception include, but are not limited&#xD;
             to: (i) condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent; (ii) diaphragm&#xD;
             or cervical cap with spermicide; (iii) intra-uterine device; (iv) hormone-based&#xD;
             contraception. Subjects must agree to utilize two reliable and acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential with confirmed last menstrual period by anamnesis and&#xD;
             negative serum pregnancy test (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [βhCG]) at screening&#xD;
             and negative urine pregnancy test (βhCG) at pre-dose of each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of non-childbearing potential, such as surgically sterile women with either&#xD;
             written documentation of surgical sterility or negative serum pregnancy test (βhCG) at&#xD;
             screening and negative urine pregnancy test (βhCG) at pre-dose of each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects who agree not to act as sperm donors for 12 weeks after last&#xD;
             administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: 18 to 45 years (inclusive) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI): ≥18 and &lt;29.9 kg/m².&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 3 months since delivery or abortion, or 3 months since cessation of lactation&#xD;
             before screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and follow study-related instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute Chagas' disease. (During the acute phase, the parasite on a blood smear may be&#xD;
             seen under a microscope. Different antibodies are present, depending on the course of&#xD;
             the disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to the study drug (active substance or excipients of the&#xD;
             preparations)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspected or known porphyria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant allergies (e.g. allergies affecting the lower respiratory tract&#xD;
             such as allergic asthma or allergies requiring therapy with systemic corticosteroids)&#xD;
             within 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant non-allergic drug reactions, or multiple severe drug allergies&#xD;
             (e.g. adverse reactions in the form of bronchospasm, asthma, rhinitis or urticaria&#xD;
             after taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable or uncontrolled medical condition such as hypertension or diabetes,&#xD;
             decompensated heart failure, GI conditions that would interfere with the absorption of&#xD;
             the study drug (e.g. GI ulceration, peptic ulceration, GI bleeding, gastroesophageal&#xD;
             reflux, or other GI disease affecting gastroesophageal junction), conditions that&#xD;
             could potentially have an impact on drug metabolism or elimination (renal, hepatic&#xD;
             such as known hepatic or biliary abnormalities), or any clinically relevant active&#xD;
             infections in the opinion of the investigator within 4 weeks before the screening&#xD;
             visit, e.g. clinically relevant history or presence of significant respiratory (e.g.&#xD;
             interstitial lung disease), hematological, lymphatic, neurological, cardiovascular,&#xD;
             psychiatric, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, immunological, metabolic (e.g. diabetes),&#xD;
             and dermatological or connective tissue disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Incompletely cured pre-existing diseases (except chronic Chagas' disease without&#xD;
             active GI condition) for which it can be assumed that the absorption, distribution,&#xD;
             metabolism, elimination, and effects of the study drugs will not be normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Febrile illness within 1 week before the first study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systolic blood pressure &lt;100 or &gt;140 mmHg (after resting in supine position for a&#xD;
             minimum of 15 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diastolic blood pressure &lt;50 or &gt;90 mmHg (after resting in supine position for a&#xD;
             minimum of 15 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heart rate &lt;45&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive results for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus&#xD;
             antibodies (anti-HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus antibodies (anti-HIV 1+2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive urine drug screening.&#xD;
