      RESCUE-Japan LIMIT(Recovery by Endovascular Salvage for Cerebral Ultra-acute Embolism Japan&#xD;
      Large IscheMIc core Trial) is a prospective, open label, blinded endpoint (PROBE), Japanese,&#xD;
      two-arm, randomized, controlled, post-market study to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      endovascular treatment as compared to best medical treatment alone in the acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke patients with an low ASPECTS (CT-ASPECTS 3-5 or DWI-ASPECTS 3-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of endovascular treatment for acute&#xD;
      large vessel occlusion with large ischemic core (CT-ASPECT score 3-5 or DWI-ASPECT score&#xD;
      3-5).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the American Heart Association guideline 2018, endovascular therapy (EVT) has been&#xD;
      strongly recommended as class of recommendation (COR) I for for the patients with acute&#xD;
      cerebral large vessel occlusion (LVO), the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) 6&#xD;
      or more. The efficacy of EVT for the patients with low ASPECTS remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, open label, blinded endpoint (PROBE), Japanese, two-arm,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled, post-market study to compare the effectiveness of endovascular&#xD;
      treatment as compared to best medical treatment alone for acute large vessel occlusion&#xD;
      patients with large ischemic core (ASPECTS 3-5 or DWI-ASPECTS 3-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 200 subjects will be enrolled in the study and randomized for the Intention to treat&#xD;
      analysis set. The randomization will be stratified by treatment institutes, patient's age&#xD;
      (less than 75 years old or not), time from symptom onset (0-2 hours or more than 2 hours),&#xD;
      and stroke severity (NIHSS 21 or more/less than 21), and administration of rt-PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the&#xD;
      following two treatment arms: Arm 1: best medical treatment Arm 2: best medical treatment&#xD;
      plus endovascular treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome of this study is to investigate efficacy of endivascular treatment in acute&#xD;
      stroke patients with large ischemic core (ASPECTS 3-5 or DWI-ASPECTs 3-5) as compared to best&#xD;
      medical treatment alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 40 sites in Japan Patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) based on&#xD;
      focal occlusion in the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), and/or the&#xD;
      intracranial segment of the distal internal carotid artery (ICA), determined by Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Angiography (MRA) or Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA), and who meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be considered for study enrollment.&#xD;
