      The present study wants to design a training program for chemotherapy with using VR. Then the&#xD;
      investigators design a protocol to compare the training effects in the VR program and ISO&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As technology advances, mobile devices have gradually turned into wearable devices.&#xD;
      Furthermore, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) are being&#xD;
      increasingly applied in medical fields such as medical education and training, surgical&#xD;
      simulation, neurological rehabilitation, psychotherapy, and telemedicine. Research results&#xD;
      demonstrate the ability of VR, AR, and MR to ameliorate the inconveniences that are often&#xD;
      associated with traditional medical care, reduce incidents of medical malpractice caused by&#xD;
      unskilled operations, and reduce the cost of medical education and training. What is more,&#xD;
      the application of these technologies has enhanced the effectiveness of medical education and&#xD;
      training, raised the level of diagnosis and treatment, improved the doctor-patient&#xD;
      relationship, and boosted the efficiency of medical execution. The present study wants to&#xD;
      design a training program for chemotherapy with using VR. Then the investigators design a&#xD;
      protocol to compare the training effects in VR program and ISO document.&#xD;

    <measure>The questionnaire of Knowledge level for chemotherapy technique</measure>
    <time_frame>Before the intervention, the investigator perform a pretest. After intervention 1 week, the investigator perform the post test.</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire want to understand the Knowledge for chemotherapy operation skill before and after intervention. A total of ten questions, with scores ranging from 0 to 10 points. , score high means more correct.</description>
