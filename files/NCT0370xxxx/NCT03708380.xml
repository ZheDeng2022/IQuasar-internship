  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Geographic analyses of diabetes burden have found that poor glycemic control, high rates of&#xD;
      diabetes-related hospital utilization, and a high prevalence of microvascular diabetic&#xD;
      complications all cluster in the same neighborhoods.This proposed study seeks to identify&#xD;
      Black barbers with undiagnosed diabetes or prediabetes using point-of-care HbA1c testing,&#xD;
      perform qualitative interviews to identify health behaviors that may explain poor sugar&#xD;
      control, and develop a workplace-based food intervention to promote primary prevention and&#xD;
      test its effect on sugar control in these individuals.&#xD;
