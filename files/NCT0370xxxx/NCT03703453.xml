  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      REBOA is an endovascular technique that is becoming more widely used in the setting of severe&#xD;
      trauma. It is a procedure where one uses the seldigner technique to advance a balloon tipped&#xD;
      catheter into the femoral artery and then into the aorta. The balloon is then inflated to&#xD;
      fully occlude blood flow to the distal aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study investigators hypothesize that this technique may be of use in the setting of medical&#xD;
      cardiac arrest. By occluding the aorta and preventing distal blood flow during CPR,&#xD;
      physicians might maximize perfusion to the heart and the brain, and promote return of&#xD;
      spontaneous circulation and neurologic recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to conduct an IDE approved early feasibility study using the ER-REBOA&#xD;
      catheter in five patients who are in cardiac arrest of medical (i.e. non-traumatic) etiology.&#xD;
      The primary outcomes will be feasibility and safety. Secondary outcomes will focus on&#xD;
      procedural performance, hemodynamic response to aortic occlusion, and patient-centered&#xD;
      outcome variables. Investigators plan to expand the study to an additional 15 patients if,&#xD;
      after the initial five patients, the risk-benefit profile remains favorable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of the use of the&#xD;
      ER-REBOA™ catheter as a means of increasing cardio-cerebral perfusion in medical cardiac&#xD;
      arrest patients. The ER-REBOA™ catheter is a device that has been gaining increased use in&#xD;
      the setting of severe trauma for the purposes of stopping intra-abdominal hemorrhage. The&#xD;
      catheter is advanced through a femoral artery sheath into the aorta, where a balloon at its&#xD;
      tip is inflated, occluding all distal blood flow (and stopping any hemorrhage while the&#xD;
      patient can be prepared for definitive operative intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Daley (along with previous investigators) has hypothesized that by using the device to&#xD;
      occlude distal blood flow during medical cardiac arrest, one might increase the perfusion to&#xD;
      the brain and heart, maximizing the patient's chance for cardiac and neurologic recovery.&#xD;
      Aortic occlusion for medical cardiac arrest is supported by robust pre-clinical literature,&#xD;
      but has not yet been studied in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is divided into two phases, with a different primary outcome in each&#xD;
      phase. Phase 1 of the study is expected to occur over a period of 1 year. Phase 2 expected&#xD;
      duration is 1.5 years. Each phase of the study will require separate FDA/IRB approval.&#xD;
      Enrollment will take place at Yale-New Haven Hospital in New Haven, CT, the primary site for&#xD;
      Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the study. A potential secondary site, the University of California,&#xD;
      Davis, has been approved for trial participation but will not contribute to enrollment during&#xD;
      Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 will primarily examine the feasibility and safety of the use of the ER-REBOA catheter&#xD;
      in five non-traumatic cardiac arrest patients. If deemed feasible and safe, the PI will&#xD;
      request permission from the FDA and the IRB to expand the study to Phase 2. Phase 2 will&#xD;
      consist of the enrollment of a subsequent 15 patients (20 in total for both phase 1 and 2)&#xD;
      with a primary focus on procedural performance, hemodynamic response to aortic occlusion, and&#xD;
      patient-centered outcome variables. Per our hypothesis, if the ER-REBOA catheter is&#xD;
      efficacious in medical cardiac arrest patients, an increase in systolic and diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure should be evident after the inflation of the intra-aortic balloon. Phase 2 will&#xD;
      utilize the built in continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring capabilities of the device&#xD;
      to assess for a significant blood pressure increase after the deployment of the aortic&#xD;
      balloon.&#xD;

    <description>Measured by Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Cerebral Performance Category (CPC).&#xD;
The mRS can help users determine the degree of disability in patients who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability by measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people. An mRS of a patient is compared over time to check for recovery and degree of continued disability. A score of 0 is no disability, 5 is disability requiring constant care for all needs; 6 is death. The mRS has been used in clinical research for over 30 years and is a common standard for assessing functional outcomes in patients. Multiple studies have shown that the mRS correlates with physiological indicators for neurological impairment.&#xD;
The CPC score is the most commonly used tool to assess this for both research and audit purposes. Most studies define a good outcome as a CPC score of 1 or 2, and a poor outcome (severe neurological disability, persistent vegetative state or</description>
