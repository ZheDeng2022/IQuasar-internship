      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who have cancer tend to get sick more often. This is in part because of the cancer&#xD;
      treatments they get. Because of this, they may get shingles. Scientists had thought people&#xD;
      with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) should not get the shingles vaccine. Now there is a&#xD;
      new shingles vaccine that is not live and cannot cause shingles. The new shingles vaccine may&#xD;
      protect people with weak immune systems from getting shingles. This is currently shown to be&#xD;
      safe to give people 50 years and older to prevent shingles. Researchers want to test how safe&#xD;
      the vaccine is and how it works in people with CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how a new shingles vaccine works in people who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia or&#xD;
      small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 years and older with CLL or SLL who are not being treated for CLL or who are&#xD;
      getting certain treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a chart review or through another protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 1, participants may have a pregnancy test, blood test, or physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant participants cannot be in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will get the shingles vaccine as an injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a diary and write down any symptoms they have for 7 days after the&#xD;
      vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 will be 3 months later. Participants will have blood taken and get another dose of&#xD;
      the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a diary and write down any symptoms they have for 7 days after the&#xD;
      vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 will be 3 months after visit 2. Participants will have blood taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be able to get an additional vaccine the same day as the shingles vaccine.&#xD;

      This study aims to determine the efficacy of the SHINGRIX varicella zoster virus (VZV)&#xD;
      vaccine in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) patients&#xD;
      that are treatment naive or receiving Bruton s-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTK-I). (Note:&#xD;
      Since CLL and SLL are considered the same disease, CLL/SLL will be referred to as CLL&#xD;
      hereafter, unless otherwise specified).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of CLL or SLL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Treatment naive CLL or SLL patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Subjects must be receiving ibrutinib for at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
           administration of the first vaccine dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: Subjects must be receiving acalabrutinib for at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
           administration of the first vaccine dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status of 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CLL will enroll on the study for the purpose of determining the SHINGRIX&#xD;
      vaccine efficacy in patients who are treatment naive or receiving BTK-I therapy. A series of&#xD;
      2 doses of SHINGRIX will be given at 0- and 3- month schedule by intramuscular injection.&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for 6 months and receive assessment of serologic response 6 months&#xD;
      after the first vaccine dose administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a)Determine the serologic response against VZV after completing the SHINGRIX (RZV) 2-&#xD;
&#xD;
      dose vaccine series in the following populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CLL patients that are treatment naive (n=54)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CLL patients receiving treatment with ibrutinib (n=27)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CLL patients receiving treatment with acalabrutinib (n=27)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Determine the safety and tolerability of the SHINGRIX vaccine among CLL patients who are&#xD;
      treatment naive or receiving BTK-Is (ibrutinib or acalabrutinib).&#xD;
