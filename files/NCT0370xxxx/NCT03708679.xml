  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In preoperative period, preoperative anxiety is experienced in different degrees due to&#xD;
      surgery and anesthesia. Preoperative anxiety is a condition that negatively affects&#xD;
      anesthesia, surgery and postoperative recovery. It is reported that the incidence of&#xD;
      preoperative anxiety in the western population is between 60% and 80%. In the pre-operative&#xD;
      period, there are many causes of anxiety related to the patient's health and the concerns&#xD;
      about the operation, uncertainty of the outcome, non-wake up after surgery, pain hearing and&#xD;
      waking during surgery. It has been reported that anxiety increases direct blood pressure and&#xD;
      changes pulse rate. It is stated that anxiety also affects the awakening criteria in&#xD;
      postoperative period. This may cause hemodynamic instability in anesthesia applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormonal, physical and psychological fluctuations occur in women due to menstrual cycle.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is reported that there is a strong relationship between the menstrual cycle and&#xD;
      the person's emotional state. It is known that women feel good in the first phase of the&#xD;
      cycle and they experience emotional, physical and behavioral disorders towards the end of the&#xD;
      cycle. Studies have shown that anesthetic requirements, postoperative analgesic requirement&#xD;
      and incidence of nausea vomiting may change with the phases of the cycle. Similarly, in the&#xD;
      luteal phase of the cycle, it has been suggested that luteinizing hormones cause&#xD;
      sensitization in opioid receptors and increase sensitivity to pain. In addition, depressive&#xD;
      symptoms increase before menstruation. In this process, some women may have pre-menstrual&#xD;
      dysphoric discomfort, irritability, mood swings, depression, flare, anger, restlessness,&#xD;
      anorexia, sleep disturbance, and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that preop anxiety will be higher in the surgeries planned in the luteal&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aimed to investigate the effect of menstrual cycle phases on preoperative anxiety in women&#xD;
      under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material Method Ethics Committee approval was obtained before the study. After the written&#xD;
      consent of the patients were obtained, they started to the study. The study was planned as a&#xD;
      randomized prospective study between February 2018 and February 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study groups were selected from patients who presented to the preop anesthesia polyclinic&#xD;
      in elective conditions, septo-rinoplasty operation under general anesthesia. Assuming that&#xD;
      there would be a 5-point difference in anxiety scores among the groups, it was decided to&#xD;
      take 40 cases for each group with a 0.75 standard effect size, 80% power, and 5% error.&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned to two groups of 40 patients. The patients were randomized by&#xD;
      sequential addition to the groups determined in the order of their inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study inclusion criteria: The study included 80 women with ASA I-II, aged 18 to 45 years, who&#xD;
      were accepted to participate in the study, were smoking, did not use oral contraceptives, had&#xD;
      no menstrual irregularity (regular 28 ± 2 days menstrual cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study exclusion criteria: In preop evaluation patients had difficulties in communication,&#xD;
      amenorrhea, pregnancy, delirium, psychological illness, major depressive disorder, patients&#xD;
      with a history of acute illness (such as in intensive care unit follow-up), which may affect&#xD;
      cognitive function and daily life activities in the last 6 months, malignancy, acute renal&#xD;
      failure, substance abuse and patients older than 45 years and male sex will be excluded from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about menstrual cycle patterns was obtained from all cases. The days of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle will be determined starting from counting the first day of the last cycle.&#xD;
      Patients with menstrual cycle between 8-12 days were called Group F (Follicular phase).&#xD;
      Patients with menstrual cycle between 20-24 were called Group L (Luteal phase). The follow-up&#xD;
      of the cases and the recording of the measurements were performed by an anesthesiologist who&#xD;
      did not know which group the cases were in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure to be Applied:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sex, age, height and ASA scores of the patients were recorded preoperatively. The STAI&#xD;
      instantaneous anxiety inventory, which measures situational anxiety in the preop unit, will&#xD;
      be completed. In this form, there are 20 expressions, each is scored between the values of 1&#xD;
      to 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total STAI score will be determined by subtracting the sum of the scores given to the&#xD;
      expressions expressing positive emotions (1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 19 and 20) from the sum&#xD;
      of the scores given to the expressions expressing negative emotions (3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13,&#xD;
      14, 17 ve 18), then constant 50 number will be added to this value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preop unit and operation room, hemodynamic parameters (systolic, diastolic and mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and peripheral oxygen saturation values preop at&#xD;
      15th, 10th, 5th, before induction, after induction at 1th and intubation at 1st, 5th and 15th&#xD;
      minutes will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instead of patients who do not want to be included in the study or who are excluded from the&#xD;
      study for any reason, according to the results of the power analysis, a targeted number of&#xD;
      patients will be included in the study randomly.&#xD;
