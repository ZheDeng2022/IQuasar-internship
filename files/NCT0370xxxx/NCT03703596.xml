    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to explore the safety and efficacy of anlotinib, a tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2（VEGFR）、FGFR（Fibroblast Growth&#xD;
      Factor Receptor）, Platelet-derived growth factor Receptor（PDGFR） and c-kit, vs docetaxel in&#xD;
      advanced Non-squamous Non-small cell lung cancer harbouring wild-type epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor (EGFR) .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial conducted in China to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and and safety of Anlotinib vs Docetaxel in patients of EGFR mutation-negative&#xD;
      advanced nonsquamous non-small Cell Lung Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized to arm A and arm B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: Patients on the anlotinib arm received 12mg anlotinib orally daily on day 1 to 14 of a&#xD;
      21-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: Patients on the docetaxel arm received 75mg/m2 docetaxel as intravenous infusion on&#xD;
      day 1 of a 21-day cycle.&#xD;
