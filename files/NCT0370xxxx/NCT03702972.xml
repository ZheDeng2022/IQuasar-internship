    <textblock>
      The need to cover a burn with a skin graft is determined primarily by its depth. In fact only&#xD;
      burns of the second deep degree or the third degree are likely to be grafted. However, if the&#xD;
      diagnosis is obvious in the case of third degree burns, second degree burns are often &quot;mixed&quot;&#xD;
      with more or less deep areas, especially in pediatrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical experience and daily observation of the burn since its occurrence currently&#xD;
      determine the indication for surgery. In practice, it is rare to be able to determine with&#xD;
      certainty whether a second degree mixed burn will require a graft before the 10-12th day of&#xD;
      evolution. There are currently devices that can help refine the diagnosis such as laser&#xD;
      Doppler, but they are expensive devices, and not 100% reliable. The thermal camera Flir-one®&#xD;
      attaches to a smartphone or tablet and allows thanks to a free application, to obtain a&#xD;
      thermogram of the pointed area. This is a device used to detect insulation deficits in the&#xD;
      building sector. Knowing that a deep burn, by devascularization, will have an external&#xD;
      temperature lower than a superficial burn, a thermogram would thus make it possible to better&#xD;
      identify the deep zones and the superficial zones of the burn. One study showed a good&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of the device but it was a population of adult patients. This&#xD;
      determined that a difference in skin temperature between a deep burned area and healthy skin&#xD;
      should be at least 1.15 ° C in favor of healthy skin, to retain a burn as deep, and not to&#xD;
      operate so-called superficial burn if this difference was below this threshold. However,&#xD;
      further studies would be needed to demonstrate the validity of this method in clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All patients under 18, with acute burns (&lt;10 days of development), surface area &lt;10%, second&#xD;
      degree, hospitalized from 22/01/18 in the plastic surgery department and burns Trousseau&#xD;
      Hospital in Paris, subject to the non-opposition of parental authority. 500000 pediatric&#xD;
      burns are counted each year in France. In 2005, they resulted in 5109 hospital stays 2.&#xD;
      Improving the accuracy of the diagnosis before 10 days of evolution would make it possible to&#xD;
      graft the children who needed it more quickly and thus shorten the length of hospital stay.&#xD;
      It is therefore a public health issue, with a significant medical and economic impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the item (s) being researched&#xD;
&#xD;
      It involves collecting, through a thermal camera, a temperature difference between a&#xD;
      second-degree burn zone and an adjacent healthy zone, in order to prove that this difference,&#xD;
      can make it possible to retain the burn as deep, and can therefore guide a surgical decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of the duration of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the same study in adults1, the number of patients to be included was 41 to&#xD;
      obtain sufficient power for a statistical analysis of the same data collected in this study,&#xD;
      and according to the same methodology. A duration of 4 months seems compatible with such&#xD;
      recruitment in the specialized center for treating pediatric burns at the Trousseau Hospital&#xD;
      in Paris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal of the study: Objectively determine the depth of pediatric acute burns using a thermal&#xD;
      imaging camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD AND POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main evaluation criterion Measurement of Δ T = temperature difference between the burned area&#xD;
      and an adjacent healthy area of 3cm, or contralateral if extremity burns, with the thermal&#xD;
      camera, by a blind surgeon the final evaluation of the depth (between D10 and D14 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thermograms will be read at three different times, from the moment of admission to&#xD;
      hospital or after the patient has been cured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T1: D1 to D4 of the burn&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T2: D4 to D7 of the burn&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T3: D7 to D10 of the burn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary evaluation criteria Interest of the repeated measurements to determine if the&#xD;
      evolution of ΔT is also an index reflecting the depth of the burn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of the population Hospitalized patients from 22/01/18 in the Pediatric Burn&#xD;
      Surgery Department of Trousseau Hospital in Paris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria (inclusion and non-inclusion criteria) Inclusion criteria: All patients&#xD;
      &lt;18 years of age, with acute burns (&lt;10 days of progression) of the second degree of body&#xD;
      surface area burned &lt;10%, hospitalized from 22/01/18 in the plastic surgery department and&#xD;
      burns at the Trousseau Hospital in Paris, subject to the non-opposition of parental&#xD;
      authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for non-inclusion: First-degree burns, third-degree burns, fever episode not caused&#xD;
      by burns, burn surgery before measurement, inability to communicate with the persons having&#xD;
      parental authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population monitoring Patients will be followed as usual as part of the nurse consultation&#xD;
      consultation treatment every 2 days initially at the Trousseau Hospital Pediatric Burn&#xD;
      Treatment Center, with surgical advice on how to proceed with care. local, as was already the&#xD;
      case, then the pace will adapt to the pathology, with iterative appointments specialized&#xD;
      consultation with the surgeon from 15 days after discharge and every 2 months until complete&#xD;
      healing and definitive in the event of satisfactory evolution. In the case of surgery&#xD;
      necessary for healing during hospitalization, the follow-up may last for a period of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks AND VIGILANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-interventional research involving the human person presents no risk to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adverse effects observed in the patients participating in the research are notified by&#xD;
      the investigators according to the local vigilance plans put in place as part of the care&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Terms of data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of thermograms on thermal camera is performed by a blind surgeon of the&#xD;
      operative decision of the burn. The thermograms will be read at three different times, from&#xD;
      the moment of admission to hospital or after the patient has been cured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T1: D1 to D4 of the burn&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T2: D4 to D7 of the burn&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T3: D7 to D10 of the burn&#xD;
&#xD;
      An operative decision or a continuation of the surgical care is recorded in the database at&#xD;
      D10-14 in blind of the registered thermograms, by the only expertise of a surgeon different&#xD;
      from that having measured the ΔT thus without modification of the care usually dispensed for&#xD;
      each patient included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research does not foresee the use of data extracted from existing information systems or&#xD;
      study bases already carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data circuit The collection of thermograms on a thermal camera is done by a surgeon who uses&#xD;
      himself to transfer them by connectivity on the centralized computer database, protected,&#xD;
      anonymized with a number given to each patient which only the surgeon having collected the&#xD;
      thermograms knows the correspondence with the real identity. This surgeon does not&#xD;
      participate in the operative decision of the patient and records it if necessary in the&#xD;
      patient database after it is taken by the rest of the surgical team who remains blind&#xD;
      thermograms and Δ T measured.&#xD;
