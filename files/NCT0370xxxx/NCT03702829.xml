  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transthyretin is a protein produced in the liver that transports thyroid hormone and vitamin&#xD;
      A. A single substitution of an amino acid in the structure of TTR can result in a relatively&#xD;
      unstable protein, the breakdown products of which (predominantly monomers) aggregate&#xD;
      abnormally and produce proteinaceous deposits in nerves and the heart. These deposits are&#xD;
      known as amyloid and produce progressive nerve and heart damage. Amyloidosis due to a mutant&#xD;
      TTR is usually an autosomal dominant and hence is a familial condition. Wild-type TTR is also&#xD;
      capable of producing amyloid deposits which predominantly involves the heart (rather than the&#xD;
      nervous system) resulting in a progressive decrease in cardiac function with increasing signs&#xD;
      of heart failure. This study aims to determine whether subcutaneous injection of an antisense&#xD;
      oligonucleotide drug, known as inotersen, that has been specifically designed to reduce&#xD;
      production of the protein transthyretin by the liver, can slow or stop the progression of TTR&#xD;
      amyloid cardiomyopathy as compared to historical controls, using advanced echocardiography&#xD;
      and cardiac MRI. The study also aims to determine the tolerability and safety of this drug&#xD;
      when administered over a 24-month period to patients with TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center study of 50 patients with cardiac amyloidosis due to&#xD;
      wild-type or mutant TTR. Eligible patients will have evidence of cardiac amyloidosis due to&#xD;
      transthyretin. The diagnosis will be made by biopsy of the heart or other affected organ with&#xD;
      appropriate staining techniques confirming that the amyloid deposits are derived from&#xD;
      transthyretin. Alternatively, recent imaging data have shown that a strongly positive nuclear&#xD;
      scan using technetium pyrophosphate in the absence of evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia and&#xD;
      in the presence of a typical echocardiographic or cardiac magnetic resonance appearance of&#xD;
      cardiac amyloidosis is indicative of TTR amyloidosis and that a biopsy is not needed. This&#xD;
      will be acceptable for study entry. As inotersen has been associated with kidney toxicity in&#xD;
      a small number of patients, all subjects in the study will be required to have a glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate greater than 45. Once study criteria have been met, and baseline imaging&#xD;
      including echocardiography and (where feasible) cardiac magnetic resonance imaging have been&#xD;
      performed, all patients will receive inotersen in a weekly 300 mg dosing. Subsequent visits&#xD;
      will occur at 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Every 2 weeks, blood will be monitored&#xD;
      for renal function and platelet count and urine will be tested by dipstick for proteinuria.&#xD;
      Should kidney function be noted to be deteriorating or should proteinuria be found, a more&#xD;
      intense renal workup will be performed in order to detect or rule out potential kidney&#xD;
      toxicity. At each visit, in addition to standard laboratory work and pregnancy testing if&#xD;
      applicable, (complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and&#xD;
      urinalysis), Vitamin A level will be drawn (as TTR is a transport protein for Vitamin A) and&#xD;
      TTR (prealbumin) level will be drawn to determine degree of suppression. Disease progression&#xD;
      will be measured by serial cardiac biomarkers, 6-minute walk, cardiopulmonary stress testing,&#xD;
      advanced &quot;strain&quot; echocardiography and cardiac MRI. Patients will be compared to data derived&#xD;
      from a historical control group and from data in the literature to determine whether&#xD;
      inotersen slows or stops disease progression.&#xD;
