  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's goal is to find out if the kind of side effects people experience from radiation&#xD;
      is different depending on the schedule of their radiation treatment. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either the 3 Fraction or 5 Fraction schedule of radiation. After&#xD;
      patients complete radiation treatment, they will follow up with their radiation oncologist.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicities will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute common toxicities criteria version 4.0. The rates of grade 3 or higher adverse events at 1 year will be calculated as the proportion of patients who have any adverse event of interest by the end of year 1 among the total analyzable patients in each arm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>mean survival time of patients with overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The failure event for overall survival is a death due to any cause. Survival time is measured from the date of randomization to the date of death or last follow up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>proportion of patients with disease-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The failure event for disease-free survival is defined as death due to any cause, local failure, marginal failure, involved node failure, regional failure, distant metastasis, or second primary.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>proportions of patients with primary tumor control</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Marginal failures will be considered events for primary tumor failure. The primary tumor control rate at 1 year will be calculated as the number of patients who do not have a local progression event by the total number of analyzable patients in each arm at 1 year.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological confirmation of non-small cell cancer will not be required as primary&#xD;
             goal of this phase II trial is to look at toxicity. However, all primary non-small&#xD;
             cell lung cancers otherwise of following types are eligible: squamous cell carcinoma,&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, bronchioalveolar cell carcinoma, or non-small&#xD;
             cell carcinoma not otherwise specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible patients must have appropriate staging studies identifying them as specific&#xD;
             subsets of AJCC stage I or II based on only one of the following combinations of TNM&#xD;
             staging:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  T1, N0, M0&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  T2 (≤ 5 cm), N0, M0&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes ≤ 1cm and no abnormal hilar or&#xD;
             mediastinal uptake on PET will be considered N0. Patients with &gt; 1 cm hilar or&#xD;
             mediastinal lymph nodes on CT or abnormal PET (including suspicious but non-diagnostic&#xD;
             uptake) may still be eligible if directed tissue biopsy of all abnormally identified&#xD;
             areas are negative for cancer. All patients with suspicious nodes will be evaluated&#xD;
             for mediastinal and hilar staging with bronchoscopy and (if amenable) bronchoscopic&#xD;
             biopsy (preferably navigational biopsy and/or endobronchial US guided biopsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Zubrod performance status 0-2 within 4 weeks of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential and male participants must use an effective&#xD;
             contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evaluations required at time of study entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History &amp; Physical by a radiation oncologist within 4 weeks of study entry;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vitals within 4 weeks of study entry;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evaluation by a thoracic surgeon (either via clinical examination and/or input at&#xD;
             multidisciplinary tumor board) prior to study entry;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PFTs: Routine spirometry, lung volumes, diffusion capacity, and arterial blood gases&#xD;
             within 8 weeks prior to study entry;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CT Chest within 6 weeks of study entry (preferably with intravenous contrast, unless&#xD;
             medically contraindicated) - to include the entirety of both lungs, the mediastinum,&#xD;
             liver, and adrenal glands; primary tumor dimension will be measured on this CT;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Whole body positron emission tomography (PET) scan using FDG with adequate&#xD;
             visualization of the primary tumor and draining lymph node basins in the hilar and&#xD;
             mediastinal regions within 6 weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent signed by the subject and a member of the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with central tumors. Specifically; central location implies a tumor inside&#xD;
             the zone of the proximal bronchial tree defined as a volume 2 cm in all directions&#xD;
             around the proximal bronchial tree (carina, right and left main bronchi, right and&#xD;
             left upper lobe bronchi, intermedius bronchus, right middle lobe bronchus, lingular&#xD;
             bronchus, right and left lower lobe bronchi&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of regional or distant metastases after appropriate staging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Synchronous primary NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those with prior malignancy in the past 2 years other than non-melanomatous skin&#xD;
             cancer or in situ cancer or thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous lung or mediastinal radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plans for the patient to receive concomitant antineoplastic therapy (including&#xD;
             standard fractionated radiotherapy, chemotherapy, biological therapy, vaccine therapy,&#xD;
             and surgery) while on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active systemic, pulmonary or pericardial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women, as treatment involves unforeseeable risks to the embryo&#xD;
             or fetus.&#xD;
