  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that adjuvant administration of probiotics in&#xD;
      cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy can reduce a chemo-induced increased intestinal&#xD;
      permeability. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the use of probiotics may reduce the&#xD;
      occurrence of gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea, abdominal pains, bacterial&#xD;
      translocation and infections following chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of most cancer patients involves radiation and/or chemotherapy which often leads to&#xD;
      gastrointestinal toxicity. Cytotoxic chemotherapy in particular often induces several&#xD;
      intestinal abnormalities such as mucositis including destruction of intestinal villi,&#xD;
      alterations in the gut microbiota, modulation of tight junctions, leading to an increased&#xD;
      intestinal permeability. These toxic effects have been observed in several types of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and different methods of administering chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intestinal permeability is regulated and protected by a number factors, including a mucus&#xD;
      layer covering the surface of the epithelium. This mucus layer is partly regulated by&#xD;
      intestinal bacteria. Therefore it is hypothesized that chemoinduced changes in the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota may possibly affect intestinal permeability. Changes in the intestinal microbiota&#xD;
      are seen after only one or a few cycles of chemotherapy treatment in different types of&#xD;
      cancers, and could possibly be a contributing factor in the development of mucositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that probiotics may interfere with the ability of pathogenic bacteria to bind&#xD;
      to the surface of the intestinal epithelial lining. In vitro studies have shown that&#xD;
      probiotics may reduce a post-infective (Escherichia coli) increased intestinal permeability,&#xD;
      or increased permeability due to incubation with pro-inflammatory cytokines. VSL#3 is a&#xD;
      probiotic formula containing a mixture of 9x10^10 CFU/g Lactobacilli strains (Lactobacillus&#xD;
      acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus),&#xD;
      8x10^10 CFU/g Bifidum strains (Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium&#xD;
      infantis) and 20x10^10 CFU/g Streptococcus thermophilus. In vitro and ex vivo studies have&#xD;
      suggested that the probiotic bacteria found in VSL#3 may have a reducing effect on intestinal&#xD;
      permeability as well as a positive modulating effect on tight junction protein expression.&#xD;
      Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is another bacterial strain that has been shown to be able to&#xD;
      mediate the modulation of tight junction proteins and thus intestinal permeability. The&#xD;
      precise mechanisms behind the effects of probiotics on intestinal epithelial permeability are&#xD;
      not yet clear, but some mechanisms have been proposed, including a reduction in bacterial&#xD;
      secretion of proinflammatory cytokines as well as other secreted products from probiotic&#xD;
      microbial metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not known whether all probiotic strains exert a similar effect on intestinal&#xD;
      permeability, as only very limited clinical research has addressed this relation. However, it&#xD;
      is very likely that the specific choice of probiotic bacterial species may play a crucial&#xD;
      role. We are only familiar with one clinical trial examining the effect of probiotics on&#xD;
      intestinal permeability in adults with cancer undergoing treatment in the form of colectomy,&#xD;
      but no adjuvant chemotherapy. Probiotics in the form of Lactobacillus plantarum,&#xD;
      Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum was administered perioperative and&#xD;
      postoperative to patients undergoing colectomy, and the study showed that probiotics improved&#xD;
      the integrity of the small intestinal mucosal barrier, induced modulation of the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiome as well as a reduction in the postoperative rate of infections.The same&#xD;
      researchers also measured serum zonulin in the same subjects, and found that the treatment&#xD;
      with probiotics also reduced the concentration of postoperative serum zonulin, and thus&#xD;
      inhibited the same increase in intestinal permeability as was the case in the control group.&#xD;
