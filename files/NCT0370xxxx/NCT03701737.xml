  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by a repeated partial or complete obstruction&#xD;
      of the airway that results in a intermittent hypoxia and sleep disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complex and reciprocal link between obesity and OSA exists. On the one hand, obesity is one&#xD;
      of the main risk factors for OSA. On the other hand, OSA seems to promote obesity. The&#xD;
      changes in sleep patterns that characterize OSA alter energy metabolism and promote weight&#xD;
      gain. In particular, OSA is associated with metabolic disturbances, decreased physical&#xD;
      activity and changes in energy expenditure resulting in weight gain. OSA is characterized by&#xD;
      resistance to leptin which reduces the feeling of satiety and an increase in ghrelin levels&#xD;
      which increases the feeling of hunger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be an increase in food intake, but very few studies have looked at this aspect. Our&#xD;
      current knowledge is based on simple patient reports of the amount of food consumed per 24&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First-line treatment of OSA is based on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) but this&#xD;
      approach is not curative and weight loss is encouraged. CAPP could facilitate weight loss by&#xD;
      restoring sleep quality. Paradoxically, recent studies show weight gain proportional to the&#xD;
      duration of use of CPP. Randomized controlled trials offering apneic patients a return to&#xD;
      physical activity and hygiene-dietary rules have shown an improvement in OSA after weight&#xD;
      loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of the influence of OSA and its treatment on the energy balance&#xD;
      through food preferences and olfacto-gustatory sensoriality is an essential prerequisite for&#xD;
      personalized nutritional management. In the face of unexpected weight gain under CPP, this&#xD;
      type of intervention would be all the more beneficial as OSA and obesity are public health&#xD;
      problems representing two independent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      with increasing incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the treatment of OSA with CPAP changes food preferences in favour of&#xD;
      fatty and sugary high-calorie foods.&#xD;
