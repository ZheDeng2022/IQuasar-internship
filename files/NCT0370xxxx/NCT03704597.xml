    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomised, controlled, open-label, Phase III, non-inferiority clinical&#xD;
      trial trial patients with a diagnosis of myeloma who were undergoing autologous HSCT were&#xD;
      randomised 1:1 to receive cryotherapy for 7 hours or 2 hours . Oral mucositis was evaluated&#xD;
      prospectively.&#xD;

      We searched MEDLINE and PubMed with the following phrases: &quot;oral mucositis&quot;, &quot;oral toxicity&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;cryotherapy&quot;, &quot;myeloma&quot;, &quot;autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation&quot;, &quot;randomised&#xD;
      trial&quot; and &quot;high-dose melphalan&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral mucositis, which is a side effect of high-dose chemotherapy, has a major negative impact&#xD;
      on the quality of life and survival of patients who undergoing autologous haematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation (auto-HSCT). For patients with myeloma cryotherapy gives a significant&#xD;
      reduction in oral mucositis. The mechanism of action is suggested to be vasoconstriction that&#xD;
      is induced by the cooling of the oral mucosa, thereby protecting it from the cytotoxic&#xD;
      effects of the chemotherapy. The therapeutic efficacy of cryotherapy in this setting has been&#xD;
      confirmed in several trials, it is currently regarded as the standard of care prophylactic&#xD;
      regimen for oral mucositis in patients undergoing auto-HSCT for myeloma. However, the long&#xD;
      duration of the treatment (7 hours), as reported in the original, placebo-controlled study in&#xD;
      2006, has been associated with significant discomfort for the patients, with negative&#xD;
      consequences for compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uncontrolled trials have previously tested cryotherapy for less than 7 hours in patients with&#xD;
      myeloma who receive auto-HSCT. At the time of the planning of the current study in 2014,&#xD;
      those results were not yet confirmed in any randomised trial. However last year a randomised&#xD;
      trial was published, showing that 2-hour cryotherapy is equally as effective as 6-hour&#xD;
      cryotherapy in preventing oral mucositis in patients with myeloma who are treated with&#xD;
      high-dose melphalan. The present prospective, randomised study aimed to investigate whether 2&#xD;
      hours of cryotherapy is as effective as 7 hours of cryotherapy in protecting against oral&#xD;
      mucositis those patients who are subjected to high-dose melphalan as a conditioning agent for&#xD;
      auto-SCT for myeloma.&#xD;
