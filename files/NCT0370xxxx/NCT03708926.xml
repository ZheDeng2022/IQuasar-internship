  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a major public health issue as the leading cause of disability globally.&#xD;
      Degeneration of intervertebral disc (IVD) disorder is once source of low back pain. Current&#xD;
      treatment options for low back pain secondary to degeneration of intervertebral disc include&#xD;
      conservative care, steroid injections, prescription pain medications, physical therapy, or&#xD;
      surgery, such as discectomy or laminectomy. Treatments focus on addressing manifested&#xD;
      symptoms rather than functional causes, and symptomatic treatment of discogenic low back pain&#xD;
      is less than ideal. The investigators have recently found that parathyroid hormone (PTH)&#xD;
      effectively attenuates disc degeneration in aged mice. This clinical trial will test if&#xD;
      3-months of daily PTH-related protein (PTHrP), abaloparatide will improve pain, function, and&#xD;
      disc health in people with low back pain secondary to lumbar disc degeneration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled&#xD;
      proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trial of the effect of abaloparatide for the treatment of&#xD;
      lumbar degenerative disc disease. Adults with clinically significant lumbar degenerative disc&#xD;
      disease who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria and sign informed consent with be&#xD;
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to study drug:placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team physicians will review pertinent laboratory data, medication history, and&#xD;
      problem lists in the potential research participant's medical record to ensure eligibility&#xD;
      for the study. The investigators will also contact the potential research participants by&#xD;
      telephone to explain the study in further detail and elicit information not available in the&#xD;
      medical record that would affect the potential participant's eligibility to participate in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential research participants who meet the study criteria and are interested in&#xD;
      participating in the study will have an appointment arranged at the Johns Hopkins Orthopedic&#xD;
      Clinic. At the study visit, a study team physician and research coordinator will review the&#xD;
      study and consent the research participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research participants who provide informed consent will have age, sex, and ethnicity&#xD;
      recorded, undergo a focused history and physical exam, and have any necessary blood samples&#xD;
      collected for inclusion/exclusion criteria. The focused history will include the age of onset&#xD;
      of symptoms, age at diagnosis of degenerative disc disease, mechanism of injury, treatments&#xD;
      utilized, and the research participant's current perception of his or her disease control.&#xD;
      The focused physical exam will include inspection and palpation of the affected sites to&#xD;
      assess for pain and mobility of the spine. Research participants will be asked to rate&#xD;
      current pain attributed to degenerative disc disease on a Likert scale pain level and asked&#xD;
      to fill out the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement&#xD;
      Information System (PROMIS-29) and have spinal x-rays and an MRI of the lumbar spine&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred nine people who meet the study criteria and provide informed consent will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to 2 groups (abaloparatide:placebo) in a 2:1 fashion (n=73 abaloparatide;&#xD;
      36 placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be taught how to self-administer a injection of the study drug.&#xD;
      Participants and the study doctor will not know if the participant is receiving abaloparatide&#xD;
      or placebo as the study drug. Participants will inject the study drug daily for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples will be collected 2 weeks after study initiation to evaluate clinical&#xD;
      safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exams, health questionnaires, and MRI scans will be performed at 3-, 6-, and&#xD;
      12-month follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be blinded for all the investigators acquiring and analyzing the data.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of participants with improvement in symptomatic or radiographic symptoms as indicated by composite score aggregated from the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Pfirrmann grading system</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Composite score will be graded as a score of 0, 1 or 2, whereas:&#xD;
0 (no improvement) = less than 15 point score improvement on Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and less than 1 grade improvement on Pfirrmann grading system.&#xD;
1 (some improvement - symptomatic or radiographic) = 15 point or greater improvement on ODI score OR at least 1 grade improvement on Pfirrmann grading system.&#xD;
2 (definite improvement) = 15 point or greater improvement on ODI score AND 1 grade or greater improvement on Pfirrmann grading system.&#xD;
ODI is scored on a scale of 0-100 with higher scores indicating worse disability. A decrease in ODI of 15 points is considered a clinically (symptomatic) meaningful improvement by the FDA. The modified Pfirrmann Grading system is an MRI based score (radiographic) of disc degeneration on a scale of 1-8, with higher scores indicating more severe degeneration, such that improvement is by decreasing score.</description>
