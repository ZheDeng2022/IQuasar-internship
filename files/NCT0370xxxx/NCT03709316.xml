             extended QTc interval, but investigators find such a extension is caused by a cardiac&#xD;
             pacemaker (without any other cardiac abnormality), it shall be necessary to determine&#xD;
             whether the patient is eligible for enrollment or not based on the discussion with the&#xD;
