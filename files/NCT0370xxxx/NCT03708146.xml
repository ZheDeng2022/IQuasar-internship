  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel staggered&#xD;
      group study of BIA 5-1058 in 11 different cohorts of 15 healthy subjects. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive once-daily oral doses of BIA 5-1058 or matching placebo for 10&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the study are to assess the safety and tolerability of BIA 5-1058&#xD;
      after repeated ascending doses under fed and fasted conditions and to assess the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIA 5-1058 after repeated ascending doses under fed conditions&#xD;
      having matching fasting cohorts for comparison of bioavailability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned that comparison cohorts will be dosed in parallel, i.e. Cohorts 1 and 2, 3 and&#xD;
      4, 5 and 6, 7 and 8 and 9 and 10. Cohorts may be split or dosed sequentially for logistical&#xD;
      purposes; however, data from both comparison cohorts (e.g. Cohorts 1 and 2) must be available&#xD;
      before dose escalation to the next dose levels.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each cohort will follow the same study design. Subjects will be screened for inclusion in the&#xD;
      study between 28 and 3 days before the first dose. Eligible subjects will be admitted 2 days&#xD;
      before dosing (Day -2) for all regimens, and will remain resident in the clinic until 72 h&#xD;
      after the last dose (Day 13). On Day -1, blood samples will be taken in all cohorts for PD&#xD;
      assessments at pre-defined time points. These time points will be time matched to Day 1 PK&#xD;
      and PD time points. Subjects in Cohorts 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 11 (fed cohorts) will also undergo&#xD;
      continuous cardiac monitoring via 24 h Holter recordings on Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Cohorts 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 will receive oral doses of BIA 5-1058 or matching&#xD;
      placebo once daily from Day 1 to Day 10, administered in the morning of each day after a&#xD;
      minimum of 8 h fast and will remain fasted until 4 h post-dose. Subjects in Cohorts 2, 4, 6,&#xD;
      8, 10 and 11 will receive oral doses of BIA 5-1058 or matching placebo once daily from Day 1&#xD;
      to Day 10, administered in the morning of each day, 30 minutes after the start of a moderate&#xD;
      breakfast containing approximately 550 kcal with fat contributing approximately 150 kcal.&#xD;
