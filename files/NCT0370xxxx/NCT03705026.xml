  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) is one of the common complications after general&#xD;
      anesthesia while genetic factors may play an important role in Postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting. In this study, the investigators investigated the relationship between gene&#xD;
      polymorphism ( such as single nucleotide polymorphism ) of the gene HTR3A (&#xD;
      5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A ), HTR3B ( 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3B ), HTR3C (&#xD;
      5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3C ) and TACR1 ( tachykinin receptor 1 ) etc. with nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting after general anesthesia. Simultaneously, the investigators explored the influencing&#xD;
      factors of nausea and vomiting.&#xD;

      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data and risk factors responsible for PONV, including the history of PONV and&#xD;
      motion sickness, were collected preoperatively by interviewing participants the day before&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study subjects received a standardized anesthesia regimen. General anesthesia was induced&#xD;
      by midazolam 0.04 mg/kg, propofol 1.5 mg/kg, sufentanil 0.4 μg/kg, and cisatracurium 0.2&#xD;
      mg/kg (to facilitate tracheal intubation) given intravenously.Participants' lungs were&#xD;
      ventilated with 50% oxygen in air.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During general anesthesia, concentration of sevoflurane maintained 1.0% to 3.0% at the&#xD;
      discretion of anesthetist who was not involved in the study. General anesthesia also uses&#xD;
      propofol 1 mg kg-1 h-1 and sufentanil 0.1 μg kg-1 h-1 by continuous intravenous infusion. An&#xD;
      Entropy index monitor was used to maintain the appropriate anesthesia depth by 40-60.&#xD;
      Participants received a repeated bolus of sufentanil 0.1 μg/kg or cisatracurium intravenously&#xD;
      on demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery the investigators recorded the data such as Anesthesia duration, doses of&#xD;
      sufentanil and propofol and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of surgery and after returning to the ward, flurbiprofen axetil 50 mg injection&#xD;
      i.v. was administered as an analgesic therapy, respectively. Cholinesterase inhibitor-based&#xD;
      neuromuscular reversal drugs and vitamine B6 were not administered after surgery. Bucinnazine&#xD;
      hydrochloride 100 mg intramuscular injection (i.m.) as a rescue medication was administered&#xD;
      to any participant whose visual analogue scale/score (VAS) was &gt; 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ondansetron was given intravenously to the participants if necessary or requested . Unaware&#xD;
      of the genotypes of the subjects, the investigators collected the participants' data&#xD;
      including nausea, vomiting and pain.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators defined an emetic episode as a single occurrence of vomiting/retching or as a series of immediately successive vomiting/retching. However, vomiting/retching had to be separated by at least 1 minute to be classified as a single emetic episode.</description>
