  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators hypothesize that older red cell units trigger phagocytosis and activation&#xD;
      of circulating macrophages with a downstream immunomodulatory cascade and release of excess&#xD;
      Non Transferrin Bound Iron(NTBI) that leads to increased rates of infection in adults with&#xD;
      Sickle Cell Disease(SCD). To test this hypothesis, the study staff will perform a randomized&#xD;
      prospective clinical trial. In aim 1, the study staff will determine the biochemical&#xD;
      differences between ≥30 day-old versus ≤10 day-old units. In aim 2, the study staff will&#xD;
      determine the physiologic effects of the transfused blood in a patient with SCD. Lastly, in&#xD;
      aim 3, the study staff will explore the clinical implications of receiving older red cells&#xD;
      over a 3 month period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators assembled a multidisciplinary investigative team to examine the potential&#xD;
      effects of older red cell units in adults with Sickle Cell Disease(SCD). Study staff have&#xD;
      preliminary data that show: 1) there is equipoise among blood bank directors about the&#xD;
      effects of older units in adults with SCD, 2) in our institution, many adults are&#xD;
      administered older units, 3) older units activate macrophages and 4) this physiology promoted&#xD;
      by older units is associated with an increased risk of infection. Our team is now poised to&#xD;
      take the next investigative step: a prospective, randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Milwaukee, 1/3 of units transfused to adults with SCD are &gt;30 days old, but nation-wide&#xD;
      some restrict the transfusion of older units. About four hundred adults receive care in the&#xD;
      Adult Sickle Cell Clinic at Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee, about 23 of who receive chronic&#xD;
      outpatient transfusions for chronic pain or stroke prophylaxis. Transfusions are administered&#xD;
      to adults regardless of storage age, except in the case of red cell exchange, for which there&#xD;
      is a policy to use less than 14 day old units. In a 3-year retrospective review of&#xD;
      transfusions administered to adults with SCD, 627 units were given via simple transfusion&#xD;
      over 281 outpatient encounters. The overall median unit storage age was 22 days (range: 2-42&#xD;
      days), and 25% of the units transfused were stored 33 days or longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the opinions and policies of other hospital blood bank directors about the use&#xD;
      of older red cell units for patients with SCD, study staff conducted a nation-wide survey&#xD;
      (n=90). While only 23% of respondents had a storage age restriction policy for patients with&#xD;
      SCD, 31% thought that older units were not as effective as younger units, and 65% believed&#xD;
      that evidence-based policies were needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with SCD may be susceptible to the effects of an older unit's physiology because they&#xD;
      are prone to infection, inflamed, and poorly equipped to handle excess iron. In a cohort of&#xD;
      40 steady-state adults with SCD, we specifically measured markers of inflammation and iron&#xD;
      excess. High sensitivity C-reactive protein, a marker of systemic inflammation, was found to&#xD;
      be markedly elevated (median 5.6 mg/L, range 0.4-60 mg/L; reference range &lt;1.0 mg/L), as was&#xD;
      ferritin, a marker of iron stores (median 2,969 ng/ml, range 20-12,300 ng/ml; reference range&#xD;
      13-400 ng/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty chronically-transfused adults with SCD will be randomized in a double-blind fashion to&#xD;
      receive ≥30 day-old or ≤10 day-old units for 3 months. Subjects will be randomized in blocks&#xD;
      of 5 and stratified by age: at least 10 subjects from each of the age ranges 18-30 and 31-45&#xD;
      years will be enrolled. Pre-transfusion, sterile samples will be extracted from red cell&#xD;
      units. Patient peripheral blood will be also obtained 1 month before randomization,&#xD;
      immediately pre-transfusion, and 2 and 24 hours post-transfusion. Hemoglobin will be measured&#xD;
      pre-transfusion, 2 and 24 hours post-transfusion, and 2 weeks post transfusion. Participants&#xD;
      will complete standardized diaries daily to document symptoms of infection, SCD pain,&#xD;
      medications and Emergency Department(ED) or hospital use. Diaries will be collected and&#xD;
      participants will be assessed with each transfusion encounter and 4 weeks after the last&#xD;
      transfusion. To ensure compliance, coordinators will contact subjects weekly to complete the&#xD;
      diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will evaluate red cells pre- and post-transfusion for Phosphatidylserine(PE),&#xD;
      Phosphatidylethanolamine(PS), and microparticles as above for all blood samples. White cells&#xD;
      will be isolated with established separation techniques. The white cell populations of&#xD;
      interest will be defined by their location on a forward scatter/side scatter plot and their&#xD;
      positivity using key fluorochrome-labeled identity markers (macrophages: CD14, neutrophils:&#xD;
      CD16). Once the cell populations of interest are identified, the cells will be evaluated for&#xD;
      various markers of activation. The plasma fraction from each patient and red cell unit will&#xD;
      be diverted to determine concentrations of free heme/hemoglobin, cytokines, and NTBI,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of biochemically old red cell units</measure>

    <description>We will compare the transfusions provided to the two groups (the proportion of biochemically old units when stored ≥30 days compared to when stored ≤10 days) using a Fisher exact test at an alpha of 0.05. Power: With a total sample size of 40 patients (20 in each group), we will have at least 80% power (α=0.05) to detect a difference of at least 47% between the two randomized groups for biochemically old red cell units (close to a 100% difference is expected). We will compare the secondary endpoints plasma free hemoglobin, heme, and NTBI and also PS, PE, and microparticle concentrations using a two sided two sample t-test at an alpha of 0.05.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the concentration of CD62L positive circulating monocytes</measure>
    <time_frame>7 years</time_frame>
    <description>Change in CD62Lcirculating monocyte/macrophage MFI at 2 hours post-transfusion compared to the subject pre-transfusion. We will compare the two groups using a two sample two-sided t-test of the log at an alpha of 0.05. Power: In addition, we will use a general(ized) linear model to include biochemically old units transfused, regardless of unit age, as a covariate in our analysis. Other co-variates will include free heme, cell free hemoglobin, and NTBI from the transfused unit. We will similarly compare secondary activation endpoints: activation markers for neutrophils and measured cytokine concentrations. Lastly, as an exploratory aim, we will evaluate the in vivo change in recipient red cell PE/PS positivity at 2 and 24 hours post transfusion. When possible, donor and recipient red cells will be differentiated in S-antigen negative patients who are by chance provided S-positive heterozygous or homozygous donor red cells.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of infections in adults</measure>
    <time_frame>7 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is the percentage of infections in adults who receive ≥30 day-old units as compared to ≤10 day-old units. The presence of an indwelling catheter will be used as a key co-variate in this analysis.&#xD;
We will further explore the relationship of blood age and transfusion of biochemically old red cell units on the change in Hb and HbS% over time, daily pain scores, opioid use and dose, ED and hospitalization rate, infection symptoms, new alloantibody formation, and antibiotic use during the 3-month study period. We will compare groups using a Fisher exact test. Power: A difference of 20% will be of clinical interest. We do not expect to have adequate power for this pilot study but at an alpha of 0.05 with 20 subjects in each group we will be able to detect a difference of 47% between the proportions.</description>
