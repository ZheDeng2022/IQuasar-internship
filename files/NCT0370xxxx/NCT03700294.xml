      This study evaluates the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics (PK), and antitumor activity of&#xD;
      ADCT-601 in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open-label, multicenter single-arm study with a dose-escalation phase (Part&#xD;
      1) followed by a dose-expansion phase (Part 2). The study will enroll approximately 75&#xD;
      patients. A standard 3+3 dose-escalation design will be used for Part 1 in order to determine&#xD;
      the MTD and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will consist of 3 cohorts from one or more selected tumor types. Each cohort will&#xD;
      enroll 15 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a Screening Period (of up to 28 days), a Treatment Period (cycles of&#xD;
      3-6 weeks), and a Follow-up Period (visits approximately every 12 weeks for up to 2 years&#xD;
      after treatment discontinuation).&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Failure to recover to Grade ≤1 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]&#xD;
             version 4.0) from acute non-hematologic toxicity (Grade ≤ 2 neuropathy or alopecia)&#xD;
             due to previous therapy prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Congenital long QT syndrome or a corrected QTcF interval of &gt; 480 ms at screening&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Any other significant medical illness, abnormality, or condition that would, in the&#xD;
             Investigator's judgment, make the patient inappropriate for study participation or put&#xD;
