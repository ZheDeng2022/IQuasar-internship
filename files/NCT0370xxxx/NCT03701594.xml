  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore if a yoga-based physical therapy session would promote improved&#xD;
      (increased) heart rate variability in subjects with traumatic brain injuries. The results of&#xD;
      this pilot study may inform a larger-scale study of the effects of regular participation in a&#xD;
      yoga-based program as an adjunct to traditional physical therapy. The secondary objective is&#xD;
      to determine whether a yoga-based physical therapy session would impact anxiety, fatigue, or&#xD;
      agitation and/or sleep quality. The study will enroll up to 30 inpatient subjects on a&#xD;
      rolling basis as they are admitted with traumatic brain injury over a 12 month period at the&#xD;
      Shirley Ryan AbilityLab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each person in the study will participate in three conditions in a random order across three&#xD;
      days: 1 hour of yoga-based physical therapy session in a group setting,1 hour of one-on-one&#xD;
      conventional physical therapy, and 1 hour of seated rest in a relaxing environment in a group&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that individuals who participate in 1 hour of a yoga-based physical therapy&#xD;
      session in a group setting will demonstrate a significant improvement in heart rate&#xD;
      variability, anxiety, fatigue, and agitation after the session when compared to the same&#xD;
      measures after 1 hour of a conventional physical therapy session and 1 hour of seated rest in&#xD;
      a relaxing environment. Sleep will also be assessed with an activity monitor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Admissions to the traumatic brain injury service of Shirley Ryan AbilityLab will be reviewed&#xD;
      on a weekly basis, and eligible patients will be approached to attain assent/consent.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized as to which condition they participate in first. Subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed not to eat or drink caffeine within 1 hour of participating in a condition. A&#xD;
      trained researcher will apply three sensors to the chest. The sensors to monitor heart rate&#xD;
      variability (HRV) via electrocardiogram (EKG) are from the BioStampRC Discovery Kit MC10,&#xD;
      Inc., and are research-grade, non-invasive, wireless, wearable sensors. For each sensor&#xD;
      location, the skin will be prepped and cleaned using alcohol wipes. Sensors are placed on the&#xD;
      skin using adhesive stickers that minimize irritation. Medical dressing (Tegaderm, 3M) may&#xD;
      also be used to ensure adhesion and proper contact with the skin. Sensors will be cleaned&#xD;
      with soap and water before and after use. Vital signs will be measured. The self-reported&#xD;
      outcome measures will be administered by a blinded clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will participate in the assigned condition for that day as determined by&#xD;
      randomization, and HRV will be monitored throughout the condition. Immediately following the&#xD;
      1-hour condition, the sensors will be removed by a trained researcher and the self-reported&#xD;
      outcomes will again be administered under the supervision of a blinded clinician. Subjects&#xD;
      will complete forms as able, but if they require physical assistance to fill out or verbal&#xD;
      assistance in reading the questions, such assistance will be provided. Sleep quality will be&#xD;
      captured by an activity monitor. Research staff will don and doff the activity monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All sessions will be supervised by a physical therapist. Research staff will be responsible&#xD;
      for all sensor recording practices, such as instrumenting the sensors and marking therapy&#xD;
      activities on a computer tablet using the BioStampRC software. Research staff will also keep&#xD;
      a written log of activities as they are undertaken during the assessments, including notable&#xD;
      events, amount and type of assistance, or use of external devices. Logs will be consulted&#xD;
      during analysis to compare with the timestamped sensor data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audio/video recording may be utilized in order to allow a registered yoga therapist to&#xD;
      validate the yoga-based program led by the researcher-clinician physical therapist. The&#xD;
      recordings would only be viewed by the physical therapist and registered yoga therapist, and&#xD;
      destroyed after publication of the research. The videos would be stored in a&#xD;
      password-protected device; the yoga therapist and physical therapist would be the only&#xD;
      individuals with access.&#xD;

    <measure>Global Fatigue Index-Modified</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be administered before and after each condition (yoga, conventional PT, seated rest). Data will be analyzed within approximately 10 months from enrollment of first participant, and research publication will be pursued.</time_frame>
    <description>Score range: 3-15. A shortened version of the original global fatigue index with modified language to reflect present-state feelings will be utilized to measure present-state fatigue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Agitated Behavior Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be administered before and after each condition (yoga, conventional PT, seated rest) only if the person presents with agitation. Data will be analyzed within approximately 10 months from enrollment of first participant.</time_frame>
    <description>Score range: 14-56 (higher=more agitated). This outcome will only be collected when the patient presents with agitation and is actively being assessed with the Agitated Behavior Scale (ABS) on a regular basis by the nursing staff. The ABS measures behavioral aspects of agitation during the acute phase of recovery from acquired brain injury including aspects of aggression, disinhibition, and lability.</description>

    <description>The yoga-based physical therapy session will take place in an enclosed, quiet space to minimize outside noise or distraction. The lights will be dimmed, and light, instrumental, calming music will be played throughout. The group will consist of approximately 2-5 individuals depending on the physical capabilities and assistance levels required. The session will consist of an introduction to pranayama (foundational breath-based exercises) followed by asanas, or physical postures, that will be modified according to each individual's physical abilities. The session will close with a 4-5 minute savasana performed in a supine or seated position pending patient physical abilities, which consists of progressive relaxation, guided meditation, and guided motor imagery.</description>

    <description>Subjects will engage in 1 hour of a conventional PT session (or &quot;treatment as usual&quot;) led by a different physical therapist than who is leading the yoga-based session to minimize bias. There will be no restrictions on what can and cannot occur during conventional PT sessions in order to accurately represent and preserve the wide range of treatments that may occur during a physical therapy session in the inpatient setting. Examples of what may occur include, but are not limited to: gait, standing balance, functional mobility, or therapeutic exercise.</description>

    <description>All yoga-based sessions will be led by the same therapist to maximize between-session consistency. A trained researcher will also be present to provide additional cueing to subjects when required. The basic elements of the postures are similar to that of traditional physical therapy balance exercises. Cues will be provided throughout to pair appropriate breath cycles with appropriate postures consistent with a standard, able-bodied yoga program. The session will close with a 4-5 minute savasana performed in a supine or seated position pending patient physical abilities, which consists of progressive relaxation, guided meditation, and guided motor imagery.</description>
