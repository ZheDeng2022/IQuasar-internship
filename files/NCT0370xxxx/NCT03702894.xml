  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, randomized, single-center, single-dose, two-treatment, two-sequence,&#xD;
      two-period, crossover, comparative study, where each subject was randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      reference or the test formulation in each period of the study (sequences RT or TR), in order&#xD;
      to evaluate if both formulations are bioequivalent.The study was conducted in multiple&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;

      The objective of this study was to establish if two formulations of amoxicillin + clavulanic&#xD;
      acid combination are bioequivalent. Also monitoring, registration and evaluation of adverse&#xD;
      events was performed. The test formulation was Clavamox, Coated Tablets, 875 mg + 125 mg&#xD;
      (Pharmtechnology LLC, Belarus). The reference formulation was Augmentin®, Coated Tablets, 875&#xD;
      mg + 125 mg (GlaxoSmithKline Trading CJSC, Russia). 56 healthy adult volunteers of both&#xD;
      genders, with age ranging from 18 to 45 years old, were divided into two cohorts with equal&#xD;
      number of subjects (28). Each subject in a cohort received single tablet (875 mg of&#xD;
      amoxicillin and 125 mg of clavulanic acid) of the test or the reference products with 200 ml&#xD;
      of water after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, according to the pre-defined&#xD;
      randomization list, i. e. 14 subjects in each cohort received the test product and 14&#xD;
      subjects in each cohort received the reference product. Subjects fasted 4 hours after&#xD;
      administration of the study drugs during each study period. Standardized meals were provided&#xD;
      in each study period. Water was not accessible to the subjects 1 hour prior to administration&#xD;
      of the study drugs and 2 hours after administration of the study drugs in each period. In&#xD;
      each period blood samples were collected before dosing and 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.5,&#xD;
      1.75, 2.00, 2.33, 2.67, 3.00, 3.5, 4.00, 5.00, 6.00, 7.00, 8.00, 10.00 hours after dosing&#xD;
      (total number: 19). The washout period was 7 days. At the current bio-analytical stage, a&#xD;
      validated HPLC/MS/MS method are used to determine plasma concentrations of two analytes&#xD;
      (amoxicillin and clavulanic acid). ANOVA will be performed on log transformed pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and 90% confidence interval will be constructed for the ratio of&#xD;
      geometric least square means of the test and the reference products, obtained from the&#xD;
      log-transformed data. Bioequivalence will be concluded if the ratio estimate as well as its&#xD;
      90% confidence interval for each analyte, both falls within the acceptable range of 80.00% to&#xD;
      125.00% for Cmax and AUC0-t.&#xD;
