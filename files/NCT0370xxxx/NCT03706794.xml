  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about who adheres to migraine management strategies, and circumstances that&#xD;
      enhance adherence. This knowledge is required to develop patient-level interventions to&#xD;
      improve adherence to migraine management strategies. The proposed project will pilot the&#xD;
      first patient level intervention designed to improve adherence to preventive and acute&#xD;
      migraine management strategies. The study will identify people most at risk for non-adherence&#xD;
      to migraine management strategies. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a&#xD;
      tailored clinical decision support tool or education intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with a diagnosis with migraine who currently meet criteria for episodic migraine&#xD;
      (migraine with headaches that occur on fewer than 15 days per month) will be recruited from&#xD;
      local providers. After an initial screening, eligible participants will complete 30 days of&#xD;
      monitoring 3 times daily on an electronic headache diary (a smartphone app) to confirm study&#xD;
      eligibility. Participants whose eligibility is confirmed will complete an additional 2 months&#xD;
      (60 days) of monitoring headache activity and adherence to acute and preventive (medication&#xD;
      and behavioral) strategies recommended for people with migraine. Participants who show&#xD;
      suboptimal adherence during the first 3 months of monitoring (&lt;50% of eligible days) will be&#xD;
      eligible to continue to the intervention component of the study. Participants who choose to&#xD;
      continue in the study will be randomized to receive a tailored clinical decision support tool&#xD;
      or education intervention, both delivered through the smartphone app. Participants will&#xD;
      continue to self-monitor, with the intervention components active, for 3 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Adherence to Acute Migraine Management Strategies: Treat Early</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6 of the Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>When participants record headache activity they are asked about the type of headache and the level of pain they were experiencing when they took their Migraine Specific Medication (MSM). A headache episode is coded as &quot;Treat Early&quot; if a participant took their MSM when the pain is mild (as opposed to moderate or severe). Number of Treat Early is reported.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 6 of the Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Number of days per month that Migraine Specific Medication is used is taken directly from diary recordings. Overuse is considered taking MSM more than 10 times in a month. Total overuse is reported.</description>

    <description>Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) measures migraine-related functional impairment. Total score ranges from 0 - 270, higher scores indicate higher degrees of impairment.
