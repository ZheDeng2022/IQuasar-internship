  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung adenocarcinoma with inactive LKB1 has emerged as a particularly aggressive form of lung&#xD;
      cancer, with poor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Recent preclinical evidences have&#xD;
      demonstrated that LKB1-inactive lung adenocarcinoma is characterized by specific metabolic&#xD;
      vulnerabilities, which make it hypersensitive to energetic crisis. For instance, by&#xD;
      inhibiting mitochondrial metabolism and reducing ATP availability to cancer cells, the&#xD;
      antidiabetic compound metformin has anticancer activity and prevents acquired resistance to&#xD;
      cisplatin in lung adenocarcinoma with inactive LKB1. Similarly to metformin, glucose&#xD;
      starvation, which can be recapitulated in vivo by cyclic fasting or fasting-mimicking diet&#xD;
      (FMD), can cause metabolic crisis in these neoplasms. In this trial, the investigators will&#xD;
      assess for the first time the efficacy of combining standard-of-care platinum-based&#xD;
      chemoimmunotherapy with metformin plus/minus FMD in patients with LKB1-inactive, advanced&#xD;
      lung adenocarcinoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies and tumor-related causes of death&#xD;
      worldwide. In the last years, significant advances have been observed in the treatment of non&#xD;
      small cell lung cancer, in particular for the population of patients with a driver genetic&#xD;
      mutation like EGFR and ALK. For the remaining cases, the main novelty has been represented by&#xD;
      immunotherapy with anti-PD1/PDL1 agents, which have proved a benefit over previous standard&#xD;
      of care (platinum-based chemotherapy in first line and docetaxel in second line). , Only&#xD;
      patients wih tumors expressing high PD-L1 levels have had access to immunotherapy alone as&#xD;
      first line treatment. For all the remaining cases, the standard-of-care treatment in the&#xD;
      first-line setting has remained platinum-based chemotherapy for several years. This algorithm&#xD;
      has been recently changed by the approval of combined chemotherapy(platinum salt +&#xD;
      pemetrexed) and immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) as a first-line therapy for patients with lung&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma and low/absent PD-L1 expression. This regimen has entered into clinical&#xD;
      practice following the positive results of a clinical trial, showing superior outcome with&#xD;
      the combination than with chemotherapy alone. Lung adenocarcinoma with LKB1 mutations or&#xD;
      macro/micro deletions has a particularly aggressive behavior and seems to be resistant to the&#xD;
      effects of immunotherapy, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Indeed, such a&#xD;
      population appears to be disadvantaged as regards therapeutic options and requires the&#xD;
      development of different approaches. LKB1 enzyme is involved in intracellular pathways that&#xD;
      are crucial in the regulation of cancer cell metabolism. Metabolic reprogramming is a key&#xD;
      step in tumorigenesis and several metabolic pathways, including glucose uptake and&#xD;
      utilization, or lipid biosynthesis and utilization, are deregulated in cancer cells compared&#xD;
      to their normal counterpart. Cells with hypo-active or inactive LKB1 are peculiar in that&#xD;
      they show an exquisite vulnerability to energetic deprivation. Indeed, they are unable to&#xD;
      survive when exposed to nutrient deprivation or drugs that affect cancer cell bioenergetics&#xD;
      or specific metabolic processes. In particular, the class of drugs known as biguanides, which&#xD;
      include the antidiabetic compound metformin, are able to inhibit mitochondrial metabolism and&#xD;
      to reduce the intracellular concentration of ATP, and have shown antitumor activity in mouse&#xD;
      xenografts of LKB1-mutated lung adenocarcinomas. Based on the well known effects of metformin&#xD;
      on cancer cell metabolism, as well as on preclinical evidence showing synergistic activity of&#xD;
      cisplatin and metformin in lung cancer cell lines and animal models with LKB1 deletion, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that combining chemoimmunotherapy (platinum salt + pemetrexed + pembrolizumab)&#xD;
      with either metformin (MERCY arm), or metformin plus a lowcalorie, low-carbohydrate,&#xD;
      low-protein diet also known as Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) (FAME arm), may improve the&#xD;
      efficacy of standard treatment alone for patients with LKB1-inactive lung adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients considered eligible and enrolled in the study will be included in FAME, MERCY or&#xD;
      BORN arms according to the aforementioned eligibility criteria. Patients in each arm will&#xD;
      receive the following treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FAME -&gt; up to a maximum of 4 cycles of a platinum salt + pemetrexed + pembrolizumab in&#xD;
           association to metformin and to tri-weekly, 5 day-long cycles of FMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MERCY -&gt; up to a maximum of 4 cycles of a platinum salt + pemetrexed + pembrolizumab in&#xD;
           association to metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BORN -&gt; standard treatment at investigator's choice or observation only in case of&#xD;
           clinical conditions contraindicating any active therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms FAME and MERCY, the patients with stable or responding disease after 4 cycles of&#xD;
      chemotherapy will continue with maintenance pemetrexed and pembrolizumab in association to&#xD;
      metformin until disease progression and/or inacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
