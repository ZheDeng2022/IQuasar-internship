      The study is an open-label pilot study in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients following&#xD;
      surgery. Eligible patients will receive treatment with tumor treating fields therapy using&#xD;
      the Optune device starting less than 2 weeks prior to start of chemoradiation. Patients will&#xD;
      receive radiation and temozolomide at a routine treatment dose and schedule.&#xD;

      The study is an open-label pilot study in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients following&#xD;
      surgery. Eligible patients will receive treatment with tumor treating fields therapy using&#xD;
      the Optune device starting less than 2 weeks prior to start of chemoradiation. Patients will&#xD;
      receive radiation and temozolomide at a routine treatment dose and schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected toxicity is skin related, and patients will be followed closely with weekly skin&#xD;
      and neurological examinations during radiation therapy and for 8 weeks afterwards to capture&#xD;
      any delayed toxicity as they begin adjuvant therapy per routine treatment. As long as study&#xD;
      treatment is tolerated and their conditions remain stable, patients will continue the&#xD;
      treatment for up to 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrollment, an exploratory analysis of radiation dosimetry will be performed by&#xD;
      phantom modeling incorporating the Optune arrays. The study incorporates three stages of&#xD;
      recruitment to confirm the safety of combining tumor treating fields therapy with concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiation: a safety lead-in cohort of the first 6 patients enrolled, a second safety&#xD;
      lead-in cohort of 9 patients, and an expansion cohort with 15 additional patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. MGMT methylation status and IDH mutation status must be assessed at the study site or&#xD;
             patient's referral center. MGMT status will be used for stratification purposes but&#xD;
