  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plasmodium falciparum Malaria remains a major global health problem with approximately 200&#xD;
      million cases and 500,000 deaths worldwide annually, mostly in African infants. Current&#xD;
      malarial control strategies are threatened by emergence of parasite resistance to drug&#xD;
      treatment and resistance of the mosquito vector to certain insecticides. A deployable malaria&#xD;
      vaccine is therefore a key strategy for reducing malaria mortality and progressing towards&#xD;
      global eradication, but those in clinical trials are currently someway short of WHO targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ChAd63 ME-TRAP and MVA ME-TRAP are leading candidate vaccines being developed by Adrian&#xD;
      Hill's group at the University of Oxford, and collaborators. Since 2007, testing of these&#xD;
      vaccines intramuscularly in over 900 volunteers has shown them to be safe, well tolerated and&#xD;
      capable of delivering partial efficacy against malaria infection. This study will be the&#xD;
      first time studying the efficacy of giving a boosting dose of the vaccines intravenously in&#xD;
      what the investigators call a &quot;prime-target&quot; strategy. It follows very encouraging&#xD;
      pre-clinical work showing this route can target desirable immune responses to the liver to&#xD;
      fight a crucial stage of malaria infection. An ongoing recent phase I study is dose&#xD;
      escalating both these vaccines intravenously as a single dose prior to commencing this trial&#xD;
      where intramuscular and intravenous doses will be combined for the first time. The&#xD;
      investigators will initially recruit 46 healthy UK adult volunteers who will be enrolled into&#xD;
      4 vaccination arms (10 volunteers each) and an unvaccinated control group (6 volunteers) who&#xD;
      will undergo a controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). These are standardised, carefully&#xD;
      supervised infection experiments used internationally to assess vaccine efficacy. As this is&#xD;
      the first time giving intramuscular and intravenous doses of these vaccines in a combined&#xD;
      schedule, the investigators will closely profile the safety and immune response during the&#xD;
      vaccination follow-up. All trial activity will take place in Oxford.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is considered of low risk to the health of participants. Volunteers will receive&#xD;
      investigational vaccines, be infected with malaria by mosquito bite, may develop clinical&#xD;
      malaria disease, will be treated with antimalarial drugs, and will have blood taken&#xD;
      regularly. They will also be given the option to undergo a minimally invasive procedure -&#xD;
      Fine Needle Aspiration of the liver - to examine the immune response in this target organ&#xD;
      which is also considered to be low risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is the first time intravenous dose of the vaccines following intramuscular&#xD;
      prime/boost doses will be administered, once volunteers have received their intramuscular&#xD;
      doses the investigators will stagger the intravenous vaccinations to allow for interim safety&#xD;
      reviews. The first volunteer in groups 1&amp;2, once they have received their two intramuscular&#xD;
      doses, will receive their intravenous vaccine dose alone and observed for a minimum 8 hours.&#xD;
      If there have been no concerns identified at the 8 hour and 24 hour reviews identified by the&#xD;
      CI and Local Safety Committee (LSC) chair, the next two volunteers in these groups will&#xD;
      receive their intravenous vaccine dose. There will be a further safety 24 hours after these&#xD;
      volunteers have been vaccinated before the remaining volunteers are vaccinated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers are expected to have both vaccine site reactions (eg, pain, swelling, warmth in&#xD;
      the arm where the vaccine is given) and systemic reactions to vaccination (eg, fever,&#xD;
      headache, tiredness, sore muscles and joints). These are expected to resolve completely&#xD;
      within several days, and symptoms strong enough to prevent usual activities over this time&#xD;
      are expected to be uncommon.&#xD;
