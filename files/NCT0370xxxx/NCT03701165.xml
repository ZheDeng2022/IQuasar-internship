      The primary outcome of this study is to aid in the final design of the DryMouth Shield and to&#xD;
      assess the effect of the DryMouth Shield on snoring frequency. To accomplish this we will&#xD;
      compare the frequency of snores during 1) overnight polysomnography without using the&#xD;
      DryMouth Shield and 2) overnight polysomnography using the DryMouth Shield. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes of the study will include: 1) compare the difference in the volume of snores without&#xD;
      and with the use of the DryMouth Shield; 2) estimate the changes in apnea hypopnea index&#xD;
      without and with the use of the DryMouth Shield; 3) describe symptoms of dry mouth without&#xD;
      and with the use of the DryMouth Shield 4) describe symptoms of bruxism without and with the&#xD;
      use of the dry mouth shield and 5) gather patient feedback about the user experience with the&#xD;
      dry mouth shield.&#xD;

    <description>The DryMouth Shield provides an elastomeric, one-piece design with breath-actuated, one-way valves configured to create an air-tight seal between the teeth and lips, which effectively reduces oral venting and air leakage while also allowing air flow into the mouth by generating a high-volume, low resistance airflow during inhalation while sealing when the user exhales.</description>

&#xD;
          1. reports of snoring that disturbed a bed partner or housemate and&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. an objective measure of snoring such as a previous home sleep study, lab based&#xD;
             polysomnography, or smart phone application with a snoring index of at least 20%&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Current smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient's with a comorbid sleep disorder including but not limited to severe sleep&#xD;
             apnea with an apnea hypopnea index of 30 events per hour, nocturnal hypoxia&#xD;
