      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous DTIC during the first 2&#xD;
      cycles (6 weeks) of treatment when administered in combination with a fixed dose of oral&#xD;
      Lenalidomide in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma previously untreated with&#xD;
      systemic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To define the recommended Phase II doses of Lenalidomide and DTIC when administered as&#xD;
           combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of combination Lenalidomide plus DTIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of combination Lenalidomide plus DTIC.&#xD;

      Lenalidomide is related to a drug called Thalidomide, which is not widely used because of&#xD;
      certain side effects. Lenalidomide belongs to a family of drugs that work by acting on the&#xD;
      body's immune system, so that it makes more &quot;anti-inflammatory&quot; cells. This type of cell is&#xD;
      normally found in the body and is believed to help reduce the growth of cancer cells and slow&#xD;
      down the production of new cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DTIC is an anti-cancer drug. It is designed to cause cancer cell death by creating DNA breaks&#xD;
      in the nucleus of the cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have what are called &quot;screening&#xD;
      tests&quot;. These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in the&#xD;
      study. You will be asked questions about your medical history, and you will have a complete&#xD;
      physical exam, which will included measurements of your temperature, pulse, blood pressure,&#xD;
      respiratory (breathing) rate, weight and height. You will be asked about any surgeries you&#xD;
      have had and any medications you are taking. Your ability to perform daily activities will be&#xD;
      checked through simple physical tests (such as walking or squeezing a ball). You will also&#xD;
      have blood drawn (about 1 tablespoon) for routine tests and tests to measure your thyroid&#xD;
      hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG - a test that measures the electrical activity of the&#xD;
      heart). You will have a chest x-ray and CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis (below the&#xD;
      waist). You will be required to have a MRI or CT scan of the brain. If your doctor feels it&#xD;
      is necessary, you may need CT scans of the head and neck or a bone scan. To perform the bone&#xD;
      scan, a small dose of radioactive technetium is administered intravenously (IV--through a&#xD;
      needle in your vein). The technetium will collect in the areas of bone involved with&#xD;
      metastatic cancer to &quot;light up&quot; these areas on the bone scan. The results of these tests will&#xD;
      show if you are eligible to participate in the study. Women who are able to have children&#xD;
      must have a negative blood pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are still eligible to take part in the study, you will begin study treatment. You will&#xD;
      take Lenalidomide by mouth every day for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week of &quot;rest.&quot; This 21-day&#xD;
      period is referred to as one &quot;study cycle.&quot; You should only take Lenalidomide on an empty&#xD;
      stomach. You should fast for 1 hour before and after taking Lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DTIC will be given by IV on Day 1 of every study cycle. Three dose levels of DTIC will be&#xD;
      tested during this study. The first 3 participants will be given the first (lowest) dose&#xD;
      level of DTIC. After the safety of this dose of DTIC is confirmed at the starting dose level,&#xD;
      the next 3 to 6 participants will be given the second dose level of DTIC. After the safety of&#xD;
      this new dose level is confirmed, the dose of DTIC will be increased to the third (highest)&#xD;
      dose level tested in this study. When the highest DTIC dose is found that has the fewest side&#xD;
      effects when given with Lenalidomide, 10 more patients will be treated at this best dose&#xD;
      level. Patients on the lowest dose level will not have their doses changed once the highest&#xD;
      well tolerated dose is found. Once a patient starts on a dose, it will not be increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive treatment with Lenalidomide and DTIC on an outpatient basis at UT M.D.&#xD;
      Anderson Cancer Center. At the start of each 21-day study cycle, you will come in to the&#xD;
      clinic to receive a 14-day supply of Lenalidomide, and you will receive your dose of DTIC by&#xD;
      IV. You will be provided with a study drug diary each time you are given your supply of&#xD;
      Lenalidomide, to write down any side effects you experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each study visit, you will have a physical exam (including measuring your weight), and&#xD;
      your medical history will be recorded. Your doctor will ask you about any side effects you&#xD;
      are experiencing. You should bring your study drug diary, any unused medication, and empty&#xD;
      packages of medication to each study visit. Women who are able to have children will have a&#xD;
      pregnancy test performed during the study visit at the beginning of each study cycle. You&#xD;
      will have blood drawn (about 1 tablespoon) for routine tests. You will also repeat the&#xD;
      performance status tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During your study visit at the beginning of Cycle 3 (about 6 weeks after starting treatment),&#xD;
      you will be checked to see if the disease is responding to treatment. You will have a chest&#xD;
      x-ray and CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. If your doctor feels it is necessary,&#xD;
      you will also have an EKG for the heart and MRI of the brain. These tests may be done more&#xD;
      often if your doctor feels it is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will continue to receive treatment as long as the disease is shrinking or does not get&#xD;
      worse, and the study doctor decides that it is safe to do so. You will be taken off study if&#xD;
      the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are taken off study for any reason, you will be scheduled for a final study visit. You&#xD;
      will have a physical exam and will be checked for side effects related to the study&#xD;
      treatment. You will have a chest x-ray, CT scans, an ECG, and possibly an MRI as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have blood drawn (about 1 tablespoon) for routine tests. You will be asked about any&#xD;
      new symptoms that you may have experienced after the treatment was stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. DTIC has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma. The FDA has authorized Lenalidomide for use in research only. Up to 28&#xD;
      participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
