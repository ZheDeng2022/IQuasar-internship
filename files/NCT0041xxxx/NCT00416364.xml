  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are a variety of methods to repair inguinal hernias. Each has its advocate and may&#xD;
      confer advantages to individual patients. Postoperative pain, convalescence, recurrence, and&#xD;
      economics have all been evaluated however none in a randomized blinded fashion. Recently,&#xD;
      investigators have attempted to address some of these concerns with new prosthetic materials.&#xD;
      The preferred method of repair currently employs a tension free technique using mesh&#xD;
      prosthesis. The approach as advocated by Lichtenstein involves reinforcing the floor of the&#xD;
      inquinal canal with an onlay mesh. Newer approaches use a double layer mesh that reinforces&#xD;
      the floor in a preperitoneal and onlay technique (Prolene Hernia System) while obliterating&#xD;
      the internal inguinal ring or by the Mesh Plug repair (bioresorbable or permanent) which&#xD;
      reinforces the inguinal floor with an onlay mesh while obliterating the internal inguinal&#xD;
      ring. Currently no study has compared these techniques for ease of performance, postoperative&#xD;
      pain, convalescence, quality of life, or cost in a randomized double blinded fashion. NMCP is&#xD;
      uniquely qualified to compare these repairs prospectively and blinded to best assess the most&#xD;
      cost effective approach which causes the least pain. A prospective double-blinded randomized&#xD;
      trial comparing the Lichtenstein onlay mesh technique to Prolene Hernia Sytem (PHS), Mesh&#xD;
      Plug Repair (MPR), or Gore Bioresorbable plug for postoperative pain, duration of&#xD;
      convalescence, cost, impact on quality of life and ease of performance is proposed. Impact on&#xD;
      quality of life will be assessed serially with the SF 12 which is a validated survey used&#xD;
      with serial measures in the acute setting.&#xD;

      4. RESEARCH DESIGN/METHODS/SUBJECT JUSTIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General Approach To randomize between Lichtenstein, PHS, GBP,and MPR hernia repair in a&#xD;
           double blinded fashion in patients presenting to the general surgery clinic with primary&#xD;
           unilateral inguinal hernias. . Daily visual analogue pain scales (validated for this&#xD;
           purpose) will be obtained. An SF 12, quality of life instrument, validated for this&#xD;
           purpose will be provided on a weekly basis to assess impact, if any, that differing&#xD;
           hernia repairs may have. This instrument has been validated to provide serial&#xD;
           assessments in quality of life in surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (1) Research Objective 2. Comparison of operative costs between groups. 3. Comparison of&#xD;
           Visual Analogue Pain Scale between groups to assess differences in percieved&#xD;
           postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. Comparison of operative times between groups as an estimation of operative ease in&#xD;
           performing the different procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5. Comparison of Quality of life suveys (SF 12) serially between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (2) Detail how many groups or arms are in the study and what each receives Patients will&#xD;
           be assigned randomly to one of four comonly performed hernia repairs; Lichtenstein, MPR,&#xD;
           GBP, and PHS. See below for details in the procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (3) Randomization Procedures Computer generated block randomized list will assign&#xD;
           patients to one of four repairs on the morning of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methods and Materials&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Lichtenstein hernia repair: A piece of polyproplene mesh will be trimmed to fit the&#xD;
                inguinal floor. The mesh will be secured to poupart's ligament and the conjoined&#xD;
                tendon using 2-0 prolene suture. Tacking sutures of 2-0 Vicryl will be used&#xD;
                laterally to secure the mesh in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Mesh Plug hernia repair (MPR): A 2 part prosthesis (Perfix Plug) is fixed in place&#xD;
                using 2-0 vicryl. The plug is secured into the inguinal ring and the onlay mesh is&#xD;
                tacked to the same structures noted for the Lichtenstein hernia repair using 2-0&#xD;
                Vicyrl.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Prolene Hernia System (PHS): The preperitoneal space is developed through the&#xD;
                internal ring. The inner mesh is placed beneath the transversalis fascia and the&#xD;
                superficial mesh sits above the transversalis fascia. The outer mesh is fixed with&#xD;
                tacking sutures to the same structures noted for the Lichtenstein hernia repair&#xD;
                using 2-0 Vicyrl.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Gore Bioresorbable Plug (GBP): The plug is secured to the internal inguinal ring&#xD;
                with 2-0 Vicryl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Closure of the fascia of the external oblique, scarpa's fascia and skin will be accomplished&#xD;
      with 2-0 vicryl (fascia) and 4-0 monocryl sutures for all hernia repairs. Postoperative&#xD;
      management of pain will include oral narcotics and non steroidal anti inflammaory medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active duty male patients with primary unilaterial inguinal hernia seen in the General&#xD;
      Surgery Clinic will be offered participation in the protocol. An investigator or&#xD;
      Subinvestigator will explain the details of the study to eligible patients and if interested,&#xD;
      they will consent said patients. They will be randomized the morning of the operative&#xD;
      procedure. On discharge, the surgeon will recommend convalescent leave based on their&#xD;
      individual preferances (this is current standard of care) and the patient will be asked to&#xD;
      record their visual analogue pain scales daily. They will be seen in the surgery clinic&#xD;
      before expiration of the con leave and re assessed for additional need for con leave by a&#xD;
      clinic nurse (unaware of which surgical procedure the patient had ) who will provide&#xD;
      recommendations for additional con leave to the responsible surgeon. The patient will be&#xD;
      contacted weekly by and investigator and the telephone version of the SF12 will be&#xD;
      administered until 30 days postoperatively (4 samples). The responsible surgeon has final&#xD;
      responsibility for recommendation of con leave. . Operative times will be recorded from the&#xD;
      operative record and costs will be generated from actual material costs and an average of OR&#xD;
      room charges and anesthesia charges from the tidewater area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard of Care Primary inguinal hernias are repaired in a tension free fashion. The&#xD;
           lichtenstein, mesh plug repair, bioresorbable plug, and prolene hernia system are&#xD;
           commonly performed repairs. Surgeons choose one of these repairs based on personal&#xD;
           preference and ease of performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Experimental Procedure Randomization and blinding between hernia repair types,&#xD;
           collecting pain data (VAS), costs, and quality of life questionaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have propose the following changes to the protocol which have been submitted to the IRB to&#xD;
      facilitate enrollment. The protocol was approved in February 2006 with an anticipated&#xD;
      enrollment requirement of 680 patients. To date, one patient has enrolled. The majority of&#xD;
      patients have declined participation because they prefer not to return to the clinic weekly&#xD;
      until returning to work. As return to work and con leave were not primary end points of the&#xD;
      study (operative times, VAS, and QOL are the endpoints of interest), the following changes&#xD;
      are recommended to improve participation in the study.&#xD;
