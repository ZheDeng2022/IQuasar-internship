      The purpose of the study is to determine the trigger for blood transfusions in Israeli ICU&#xD;
      patients and the possible effects of anemia on the post ICU discharge course.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is a common problem in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units&#xD;
      (ICUs). The etiology is multifactorial and includes sepsis, overt or occult blood loss&#xD;
      (including frequent blood sampling), decreased production of endogenous erythropoietin, and&#xD;
      immune-associated functional iron deficiency. In the only large randomized trial addressing&#xD;
      the issue of transfusion triggers in the perioperative and critical care setting, the&#xD;
      Canadian Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) study documented an overall non&#xD;
      significant trend toward decreased 30-day mortality (18.7% vs. 23.3%, P = .11) and&#xD;
      significant decreases in mortality among patients who were less acutely ill (8.7% vs. 16.1%,&#xD;
      P = .03) in the group treated using a transfusion trigger reflected in a hemoglobin level of&#xD;
      7.0 g/dL compared with a more liberal transfusion group that received 54% more red blood cell&#xD;
      (RBC) transfusions. This data suggests that many critically ill patients can tolerate&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels as low as 7 g/dL and that a &quot;liberal&quot; RBC transfusion strategy may in fact&#xD;
      lead to worse clinical outcomes. Evidence-based transfusion guidelines for critically ill and&#xD;
      perioperative patients recommend RBC transfusion when the hemoglobin concentration is less&#xD;
      than 7 g/L and transfusion avoidance at values greater than 10 g/ L .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The restrictive blood transfusion policy results in many patients being discharged anemic&#xD;
      from the ICU. In a recent Scottish study, 87% of ICU survivors were discharged anemic&#xD;
      (defined as a hemoglobin level &lt; 13g/dl in males and 11 g/dl in females), while 24% of males&#xD;
      and 27.9% of females had a hemoglobin level &lt; 9 g/dl. While studies have shown that a&#xD;
      restrictive blood transfusion policy does not adversely affect the 30- or 60-day mortality ,&#xD;
      there is no information regarding the effect of anemia on immediate and long term morbidity&#xD;
      of ICU survivors. This may be important as anemia has been shown to decrease functional&#xD;
      status and quality of life, while treating anemia may improve functional status and decrease&#xD;
      morbidity. In addition, it is not known how many of these patients receive blood transfusions&#xD;
      following ICU discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Israel, there are no national guidelines for the administration of red blood cells in the&#xD;
      ICU and the national &quot;trigger&quot; is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Rationale The determination of the ICU &quot;trigger&quot; will determine if the ICU is&#xD;
           performing according to presently accepted standards. Determining the effect of anemia&#xD;
           after ICU discharge may allow for targeted interventions in particular groups of&#xD;
           patients which may improve recovery rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study is a non-intervention, observational, multi- center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All ICU patients over 18 years of age will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data will be collected on admission of the patient to the ICU&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily hemoglobin levels (routine morning hemoglobin) and the hemoglobin level which&#xD;
           triggered the blood transfusion (if different from the morning level) will be recorded&#xD;
           and the number and indication for red blood cell transfusions noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemoglobin level will be noted on discharge from the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemoglobin levels, length of hospital stay and occurrence of complications in the&#xD;
           post-ICU period will be noted.&#xD;
