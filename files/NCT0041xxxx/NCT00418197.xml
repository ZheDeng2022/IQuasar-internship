  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Archus Total Facet Arthroplasty System® (TFAS®) is a non-fusion spinal implant indicated&#xD;
      for treatment of patients with moderate to severe spinal stenosis. TFAS® replaces the&#xD;
      diseased facets following surgical removal. TFAS® offers the surgeon new options for treating&#xD;
      spinal stenosis patients, enabling a more comprehensive decompression via complete removal of&#xD;
      the facets. TFAS® also offers an alternative to rigid spinal fusion fixation enabling&#xD;
      intervertebral motion. The clinical trial is intended to demonstrate restoration of stability&#xD;
      and sagittal balance to the spine. TFAS® also eliminates the need for painful bone graft&#xD;
      harvest from the patient's hip which may be required with fusion procedures.&#xD;
