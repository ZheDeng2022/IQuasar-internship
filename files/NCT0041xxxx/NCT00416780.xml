      RATIONALE: Meeting together with other breast cancer patients to receive psychosocial support&#xD;
      and to learn to reduce stress may help patients cope with their diagnosis, have a better&#xD;
      quality of life, and live more comfortably.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well psychosocial support works in&#xD;
      treating women with recurrent breast cancer or stage I, stage II, or stage IV breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate theoretically derived psychosocial interventions (peer discussion support vs&#xD;
           education and stress management vs usual-care control) targeted to enhance adjustment&#xD;
           and functional status and lower morbidity among women diagnosed with and treated for&#xD;
           recurrent or stage I, II, or IV breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the psychological, behavioral, and biological pathways and their effects in&#xD;
           patients treated with these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the efficacy of these intervention in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the nature and extent of coping strategies in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the differences in patients treated with these intervention vs those patients&#xD;
           electing not to be treated with these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage&#xD;
      (early vs late). Patients with early-stage disease are randomized to 1 of 3 intervention&#xD;
      arms. Patients with late-stage disease are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms (II or&#xD;
      III).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (education and stress management): Patients undergo a 1-hour group (6-10 patients&#xD;
           per group) education session once a week for 8 weeks focusing on exchange of factual&#xD;
           information between a facilitator and patients. The session includes a 45-minute&#xD;
           lecture, discussing risks, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer; side effects from&#xD;
           treatment; nutrition during treatment; and follow-up care, followed by a question/answer&#xD;
           period and instruction in progressive relaxation techniques. Patients then receive 3&#xD;
           monthly phone calls from a project staff member to answer questions about cancer,&#xD;
           treatment, and follow-up care and to discuss the relaxation exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (peer discussion): Patients undergo a 1-hour group (6-10 patients per group) peer&#xD;
           support session once a week for 8 weeks focusing on the provision of emotional support&#xD;
           among patients and the maintenance of purpose in life. The session emphasizes on the&#xD;
           sharing of experiences, the development of a common bond, and the promotion of altruism&#xD;
           to similar others. Patients then are given an opportunity to attend 3 monthly additional&#xD;
           meetings to share critical experiences and problems they have experienced in the past&#xD;
           month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm III (control): Patients receive usual care and are not asked to attend any meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergo a 2-hour baseline interview, a 1.5-hour post intervention interview, and&#xD;
      a 1.5-hour final interview 8 months after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 350 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
