      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and transduction efficiency of adenoviral&#xD;
           mediated wild type p53 gene transfer in premalignancies of the upper aerodigestive&#xD;
           tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the efficacy of single agent adenoviral mediated wild type p53 gene&#xD;
           transfer in reversing oral premalignancies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some cancers that occur in the mouth may in some way be due to a defect in a gene called the&#xD;
      p53 gene. In this study, an adenovirus is used as a tool (a &quot;vector&quot;) to deliver the normal&#xD;
      p53 gene into cells. The parts of the adenovirus that allow it to reproduce and promote&#xD;
      infection are removed, and the experimental gene (p53) is added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to beginning this study, all participants will have a complete medical history and&#xD;
      physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight. Participants will have an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), a urine test, and blood tests, including an HIV test. At mid-cycle,&#xD;
      another white blood cell count will have to be drawn. Women able to have children must have a&#xD;
      negative blood pregnancy test. Participants will be asked what medications have been taken in&#xD;
      the past 30 days. Additionally, a chest x-ray will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo a complete head and neck examination. This includes both visual&#xD;
      [direct as well as mirror (and fiberoptic if required)] of all mucosal sites from the nasal&#xD;
      and lip areas to the back of the throat. The physician will manually examine areas of the&#xD;
      skin, salivary glands, the neck, and thyroid bed. Also, the doctor will make sure the cranial&#xD;
      nerves are working properly. Location and size of lesion(s) will be recorded and measured in&#xD;
      two dimensions. All lesions present will be photographed prior to the start of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination including a fiberoptic exam, is the established standard of evaluating&#xD;
      pre-cancerous lesion(s). Only if a concern for cancer is present , or symptoms are beyond&#xD;
      those findings of the physical examination will a CT or MRI be prescribed. These tests (CT&#xD;
      and MRI) should not have to be done since they have no established role in the evaluation,&#xD;
      management, or follow-up of these lesion(s). If utilized, a CT (computerized tomography) scan&#xD;
      is a special test using x-ray along with a computer to give detailed pictures of parts of the&#xD;
      body. An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a special test using a strong magnetic field and&#xD;
      radio frequency signals to give detailed pictures of parts of the body. An x-ray shows a&#xD;
      2-dimensional picture while a CT scan or an MRI shows 3 dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study course includes one week of treatment followed by three weeks of observation. The&#xD;
      length of the study is 6 months (6 courses) for most participants. Participants will return&#xD;
      to the clinic twice a day for Days 2 - 5 for each month of participation, and should expect&#xD;
      to spend a total of about 6 hours a day at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will receive INGN 201 in two ways. The first way will be by&#xD;
      injection in the area of the lesion. The second way will be by mouth rinse. Vital signs will&#xD;
      be checked each time before participants receive INGN 201. The injection will be given on the&#xD;
      first day of each week of the course, after a numbing (anesthetic) medication is applied to&#xD;
      prevent discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mouth rinse will be given one time on the first day and two times on Days 2 - 5 of each&#xD;
      course of INGN 201. The injection and rinse (first day of each cycle), or the two rinses&#xD;
      (Days 2 - 5 of each cycle), will be separated by at least two hours. There will be a 30&#xD;
      second rinse with 5% acetic acid, a raspberry flavored, vinegar-like liquid, followed by a&#xD;
      tap water rinse just before participants receive INGN 201. Participants will be asked to hold&#xD;
      the INGN 201 in their mouth for 30 minutes. Eating and drinking should be avoided for one&#xD;
      hour after receiving the mouth rinse. The injection and rinse series will be repeated on a&#xD;
      monthly basis for a period of six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be requested to have two biopsies (small tissue samples) of the&#xD;
      premalignant lesion taken on Day 5 of the 1st and 6th courses. These biopsies will contribute&#xD;
      to the understanding of how the experimental agent works on pre-cancerous cells. In&#xD;
      particular, the biopsies will help to determine if the experimental agent is effective in&#xD;
      killing pre-cancerous cells (this process is called apoptosis). These studies will also&#xD;
      determine if the gene therapy injections have been effective in delivering the gene (p53) to&#xD;
      the precancerous cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be observed for three more weeks after the sixth course of treatment. At&#xD;
      the end of the study, 28 days after the last dose of INGN 201, participants will have a&#xD;
      physical exam, including measurement of weight and vital signs. Participants will have a&#xD;
      medical history and blood and urine tests. These tests are done to monitor the effects of the&#xD;
      study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who develop severe side effects will be taken off study, though they may&#xD;
      continue to receive follow-up evaluations to monitor their health. Participants will be&#xD;
      counseled by their physician should the lesion(s) progress to cancer during the study or&#xD;
      follow up period. After counseling, participant may choose to have surgery to remove the&#xD;
      precancerous lesion(s), laser surgery, or observation. The participant will then be monitored&#xD;
      closely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be followed for five years, and must agree to stay in contact with&#xD;
      their personal doctor or the doctor responsible for this study even if they move after the&#xD;
      study ends. The participant's personal doctor may be asked to provide information about any&#xD;
      anticancer treatments received after the study's completion, as well as information about the&#xD;
      patient's overall health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. This experimental use of human genes is an example of gene&#xD;
      therapy. This is the first time that adenovirus gene therapy has been used for a&#xD;
      pre-cancerous condition. This is the first study to use INGN 201 as a mouth rinse. A total of&#xD;
      20 patients will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson. A maximum of 51 subjects will be entered in&#xD;
      this multi-center study.&#xD;
