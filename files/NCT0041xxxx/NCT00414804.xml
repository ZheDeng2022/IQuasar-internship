  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of SCS using the Precision&#xD;
      implantable neurostimulation device and conventional medical treatment (nerve blocks +&#xD;
      physical therapy) in subjects with recently-diagnosed Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)&#xD;
      after some more conservative treatments have failed. There are significant numbers of&#xD;
      patients with CRPS in whom conventional treatment is ineffective and SCS is used only as a&#xD;
      last resort. If SCS is effective earlier in the treatment continuum, it would provide a much&#xD;
      needed treatment alternative and increase awareness of the utility of SCS for this&#xD;
      indication. It is also possible that early intervention with SCS may limit disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard medical treatment for moderate/severe chronic pain of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome&#xD;
      (CRPS) is usually inadequate. Sympathetic nerve blocks with local anesthetics are commonly&#xD;
      employed and in some cases can be an effective option. Nerve blocks are not consistently&#xD;
      effective, however, and their utility is further compromised by a short duration of relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRPS is among the pain etiologies that can be managed via Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS); this&#xD;
      option can be quite effective at providing long-term pain relief for the management of CRPS.&#xD;
      Importantly, SCS is not usually attempted until other treatment options, including nerve&#xD;
      blocks and ablative procedures, have failed to produce adequate pain relief. No studies have&#xD;
      been performed to date comparing SCS to a series of nerve block injections plus physical&#xD;
      therapy. In this context, it may be prudent to consider SCS earlier in the treatment&#xD;
      continuum. Instead of obliging a CRPS patient to cycle through numerous rounds of injections,&#xD;
      optimal clinical pain management may be attained through early implantation of an SCS system.&#xD;
      This prospective clinical study will compare the relative efficacy of SCS with that of&#xD;
      repeated nerve blocks and physical therapy in a group of subjects with moderate-to-severe&#xD;
      CRPS pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have never had invasive treatments for CRPS pain will be randomized to either a&#xD;
      series of sympathetic blocks plus physical therapy or SCS. Changes in pain, disability, and&#xD;
      quality of life outcomes will be assessed at follow up visits as well as incidence and&#xD;
      outcomes of subjects electing to cross over to the alternate treatment option. This study&#xD;
      will generate insight into the best pain management strategies for CRPS.&#xD;
