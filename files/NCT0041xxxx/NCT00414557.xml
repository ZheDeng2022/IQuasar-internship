  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effects of quadriceps strengthening on the adductor moment in individuals&#xD;
      with medial knee OA and whether quadriceps strengthening has a different effect on the&#xD;
      adductor moment in individuals with and without knee malalignment&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although quadriceps strengthening is the cornerstone of physiotherapy management, recent&#xD;
      evidence suggests that high quadriceps strength in patients with malaligned knees may&#xD;
      increase OA progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates the effects of quadriceps strengthening on the adduction moment in&#xD;
      patients with medial knee OA with and without malalignment. 107 participants with and without&#xD;
      varus knee malalignment were recruited and randomised into an exercise or a control group.&#xD;
      Participants in the exercise group were taught five quadriceps strengthening exercises by a&#xD;
      project physiotherapist to be performed five days a week for twelve weeks at home. The&#xD;
      exercises were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quadriceps exercise over fulcrum using ankle weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Straight leg raise exercise using ankle weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Long arc knee extension exercise in sitting using ankle weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Knee extension exercise with isometric hold at 60° knee flexion using ankle weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Knee extension exercise with isometric hold at 60° knee flexion using an elastic band.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each exercise was performed at 2x10 repetitions for the first 2 weeks and 3x10 repetitions&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants visited the physiotherapist 7 times at Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10. They were&#xD;
      given the ankle weights and elastic band to bring home and instructed about the repetitions&#xD;
      and weights to use by the physiotherapist, who also checked and progressed their exercises.&#xD;
      The average duration of the physiotherapy sessions was 30 minutes. To monitor compliance,&#xD;
      each participant was given an exercise instructions sheet and kept a training diary to record&#xD;
      the exercises they had done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group received no intervention.&#xD;
