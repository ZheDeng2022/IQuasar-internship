      The purpose of the study is to see if one plan for identifying and treating tuberculosis (TB)&#xD;
      works better than another in reducing new cases of TB. The first plan is the DOTS program,&#xD;
      which provides free TB treatment to people seeking it. The second plan provides free TB&#xD;
      treatment to people seeking it and involves program staff going door-to-door in communities&#xD;
      to identify new cases of TB, DOTS plus active case-finding program (ACF). Researchers believe&#xD;
      that by detecting TB cases earlier and supervising treatment it will help to prevent&#xD;
      spreading and decrease TB in these areas. The study population will be 200,000 people in 6&#xD;
      communities of Santa Cruz and 14 communities of Northeast Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, receiving&#xD;
      DOTS or DOTS plus ACF. Individuals in the DOTS plus ACF part of the study will be interviewed&#xD;
      2-4 times during a 9 month period. Patients with symptoms will provide a sputum specimen.&#xD;
      Patients identified as having TB will begin treatment and be observed for 6.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide,&#xD;
      particularly in developing countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that&#xD;
      one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculosis&#xD;
      remains a major public health problem in Brazil, being the 15th highest TB burden in the&#xD;
      world. The goal of this project is to determine whether TB active case finding (ACF) in&#xD;
      conjunction with directly observed therapy (DOTS) results in lower incidence of TB compared&#xD;
      with routine DOTS alone. This community-randomized trial will be conducted in 20 Rio de&#xD;
      Janeiro communities within 2 APs with high rates of TB where community health workers and&#xD;
      health units are undergoing intensive training to implement DOTS programs. This will be a&#xD;
      collaborative effort between the Municipal Health Secretariat of Rio de Janeiro and the Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins University Center for Tuberculosis Research. A cluster-randomized trial will be&#xD;
      conducted to compare the impact of 2 case detection and treatment strategies on the community&#xD;
      incidence of TB. The 20 communities within 2 planning areas (APs) will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to routine DOTS based on passive case detection or DOTS+ACF, where TB cases are actively&#xD;
      detected by community outreach. In all communities, cases of TB will be identified through&#xD;
      the existing TB clinics using identical procedures for subjects reporting to the TB clinics&#xD;
      on their own accord. These subjects will be identified through traditional methods of passive&#xD;
      case finding (PCF). In DOTS+ACF communities, all households will be surveyed by community&#xD;
      health workers to identify individuals with cough for greater than or equal to 3 weeks, and&#xD;
      all symptomatic subjects will provide a spot sputum specimen for acid-fast bacilli smear at&#xD;
      the time of their household survey. Results will be returned to the subject at their home and&#xD;
      appropriate follow-up measures will be provided to confirm TB diagnoses and provide&#xD;
      treatment. The primary objective of the study is to compare TB incidence in communities&#xD;
      randomized to DOTS+ACF and DOTS alone over the 18-month period following ACF campaign. The&#xD;
      study hypothesizes that the average TB incidence in these 18 months will be 42% less in the&#xD;
      DOTS+ACF arm compared with the DOTS-arm. The study has two secondary objectives. The first&#xD;
      secondary objective will be to compare case notification rates of TB in the 2 arms of the&#xD;
      study during the ACF campaign. Researchers hypothesize that TB notification rates will be at&#xD;
      least 40% greater in the DOTS+ACF communities during the ACF period of the study. The second&#xD;
      secondary objective will be to compare treatment completion rates between the 2 arms of the&#xD;
      study. Researchers hypothesize that subjects detected through ACF will have equal treatment&#xD;
      completion rates (+/- 5%) as subjects in the DOTS-arm. Tuberculosis diagnosis is the primary&#xD;
      outcome measure. Treatment completion is the secondary outcome measure. The study population&#xD;
      will be residents of the 20 communities selected, approximately 200,000 people with no&#xD;
      restriction on age. Diagnosing subjects earlier will ensure that they are treated earlier and&#xD;
      have less time to spread the disease to their contacts.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All residents of the study communities will be eligible to be surveyed at their homes,&#xD;
        regardless of gender, age, or ethnicity. In the DOTS+ACF communities, all households will&#xD;
        be surveyed and symptomatic subjects will provide sputum specimens. The subjects will be&#xD;
        males and females with no restriction on age, with and without active TB, and living in&#xD;
        communities with a high prevalence of TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There will be no exclusion of women or minorities in this study. Pregnant women will be&#xD;
        included if they have TB or live in a household with a TB case.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children will be included if they have TB per routine practice and will be surveyed in the&#xD;
        DOTS+ACF arm for symptoms with their parent's verbal permission and presence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All residents of the 20 selected communities will be eligible to participate in the study.&#xD;
        Consent will not be requested for DOTS, because this is now the standard of care for the&#xD;
        area. Verbal consent will be requested for use of household data to analyze the&#xD;
        effectiveness of active case finding. However, even households that refuse to participate&#xD;
        in the survey (which is extremely unlikely because this is part of the routine survey in&#xD;
        which all households currently participate) will be included when calculating TB incidence&#xD;
        for the community.&#xD;
