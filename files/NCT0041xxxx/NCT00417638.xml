  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid MI-ICE-Pilot is designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Celsius Control™&#xD;
      System (CCS) endovascular catheter to reduce the infarct size resulting from acute anterior&#xD;
      myocardial infarction when used in combination with cold saline as an adjunct to immediate&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with an occluded infarct-related artery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CCS is an endovascular thermal control system that circulates cooled saline through an&#xD;
      indwelling central venous catheter in a closed-loop manner. The system has received 510(k)&#xD;
      approval from the FDA for use in temperature management in neuro-surgical and cardiac&#xD;
      patients during surgery and in recovery/intensive care. It has also received European CE mark&#xD;
      and Australian TGA approval. Animal data in a model of acute myocardial infraction support&#xD;
      the hypothesis that rapid cooling, prior to acute PCI, may reduce infarct size. Meta-analysis&#xD;
      of the previous acute MI trials ICE-IT (N = 228; 1:1 randomization, hypothermia : control,&#xD;
      Innercool Therapies, Inc.) and COOL MI-I (Radiant Medical, Inc) suggests there is a reduction&#xD;
      in infarct size as measured by 30-day SPECT in the population of patients with anterior MIs&#xD;
      who were cooled below 35 C prior to PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to investigate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of rapid&#xD;
      endovascular cooling in the setting of acute PCI in patients with anterior infarctions.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each eligible patient must meet the following inclusion criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have ECG evidence of ongoing acute anterior myocardial infarction, involving a large&#xD;
             area of myocardium, as defined by the following ECG criteria: a. Anterior infarct:&#xD;
             ST-segment elevation &gt;0.2mV measured 0.08 sec after the J point in 2 or more&#xD;
             anatomically contiguous precordial leads, V1 through V4; and/or &gt;0.2mV in lead V5 V6&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Present to the RAPID MI-ICE site within six (6) hours of the onset of acute cardiac&#xD;
             ischemic signs or symptoms (such as chest pain or pressure, arm or jaw pain, dyspnea,&#xD;
             nausea/vomiting, or syncope)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Be a candidate for PCI and have PCI planned as the immediate intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Be willing and able to comply with study procedures, including returning for the MRI&#xD;
             scan at 4 ±2 days and return for the clinical examination on Day 30&#xD;

          1. Age less than eighteen (&lt;18) years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age greater than seventy-five (&gt;75) years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Are pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. History of a prior anterior myocardial infarct or prior large myocardial infarct.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The suspected etiology of myocardial infarction is primarily related to substance&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Acute administration of a thrombolytic agent for the qualifying MI&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. If (during the screening process) the determination is made by site-study personnel&#xD;
             that initiation of cooling prior to diagnostic coronary angiography is technically not&#xD;
             feasible for any reason (should the patient be randomized to the Hypothermia Arm), the&#xD;
             prospective subject should not be enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Require an immediate surgical or procedural intervention other than PCI (e.g. CABG)&#xD;

&#xD;
         17. Personal or familial history of malignant hyperthermia&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Known end-stage renal disease (ESRD; e.g., on dialysis, or status-post renal&#xD;
