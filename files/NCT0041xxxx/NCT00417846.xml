      The purpose of this study is to determine the sensitivity of the optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      (OCT) test in detecting neovascular AMD in eyes at high risk for CNV development. In order to&#xD;
      test this hypothesis, we are conducting a multi-center clinical study at four participating&#xD;
      clinical centers. A total of 227 participants will be enrolled. Participants will be&#xD;
      followed-up for a period of two years, or until CNV develops in the study eye for which&#xD;
      treatment is recommended, to determine the occurrence of CNV. The fundamental design&#xD;
      principles of the study are simplicity and parsimony.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the sensitivity of the OCT in detecting conversion&#xD;
      to neovascular AMD by two years in eyes at high risk for CNV, with FA serving as the gold&#xD;
      standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value&#xD;
           of the OCT in detecting conversion to neovascular AMD by two years in eyes at high risk&#xD;
           for CNV, with FA serving as the gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative&#xD;
           predictive value of the OCT to the PHP or the supervised Amsler Grid in subjects who had&#xD;
           either negative PHP and/or negative supervised Amsler grid at baseline for detection of&#xD;
           neovascular AMD by two years in eyes at high risk for CNV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe features of false positives and false negatives with respect to baseline&#xD;
           characteristics seen on PHP testing, supervised Amsler grid testing, and OCT imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the relationship between new visual symptoms experienced by participants&#xD;
           prompting an interim evaluation where treatment for CNV was recommended and findings&#xD;
           seen at the previous study visit (PHP testing, supervised Amsler grid testing, OCT&#xD;
           imaging, other findings on exam, or fluorescein angiography) as well as findings from&#xD;
           the baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the physician's detection of CNV development on return study visits&#xD;
           including slit lamp biomicroscopy before viewing ancillary tests from that visit&#xD;
           (supervised Amsler grid, PHP, OCT, fundus photographs, fluorescein angiogram)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be examined upon enrollment and then followed every three months after&#xD;
      enrollment for two years or until conversion to CNV is positive and treatment is recommended.&#xD;
      Specifically, follow-up visits will occur at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months from the&#xD;
      date of the Initial Visit.&#xD;

        Participants will have neovascular AMD in the fellow eye and non-neovascular AMD in the&#xD;
        candidate study eye to be eligible for this study. Additional inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
        criteria are listed below.&#xD;

    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the&#xD;
             full duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 50 years or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Best corrected visual acuity letter score = 65 or greater (approximate Snellen&#xD;
             equivalent of 20/50 or better in the candidate study eye)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neovascular AMD in the fellow eye and no CNV in the candidate study eye (absence of&#xD;
             CNV confirmed by FA which will be graded in a masked fashion by the AMD DOC Study&#xD;
             Reading Center)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidate study eye must have evidence of at least one large druse (≥ 125µm) and focal&#xD;
             hyperpigmentation within 3600μm of the fovea and visible on color fundus photography,&#xD;
             red-free photograph, or fluorescein angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have media clear enough in the candidate study eye to permit fundus&#xD;
             photography, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography and absence of&#xD;
             any fluorescein allergies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Results of the baseline PHP and supervised Amsler grid will not affect eligibility of&#xD;
             the participant. Subjects can be eligible for further follow-up even if they have&#xD;
             positive PHP and Amsler grid&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible participants who have a positive PHP or supervised Amsler grid for that eye&#xD;
             at the initial screening visit should have a second PHP or supervised Amsler grid&#xD;
             screening visit within 2 weeks in order to repeat the PHP or Amsler test or the&#xD;
             participant may repeat the PHP or Amsler grid that day before pupillary dilation.&#xD;
             Participants with a 2nd positive PHP or supervised Amsler grid are still eligible for&#xD;
             further follow-up&#xD;

             eligible for enrollment in the study&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Significant media opacity that precludes reasonable quality retinal imaging including&#xD;
             color fundus photographs, fluorescein angiography, or OCT in the candidate study eye&#xD;
             to assess the presence of CNV&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of macular disease (e.g., pattern dystrophy, diabetic macular edema,&#xD;
