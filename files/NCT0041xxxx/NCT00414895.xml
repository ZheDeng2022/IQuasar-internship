  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to detect AR and CR in the transplanted heart by quantitative&#xD;
      assessment of myocardial blood flow and its constituents by myocardial contrast&#xD;
      echocardiography (MCE). Further we investigate the collateral circulation in these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart transplantation has become an accepted therapy for end-stage heart failure. Acute&#xD;
      allograft rejection (AR) remains a major cause of mortality in heart transplant recipients.&#xD;
      Chronic rejection (CR) determines the long-term prognosis after cardiac transplantation and&#xD;
      is responsible for more than one third of late deaths. Different non-invasive methods have&#xD;
      been evaluated for the detection of AR, but the gold standard remains endomyocardial biopsy&#xD;
      (EMB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very little is known about the impact of CR on the collateral circulation in transplant&#xD;
      patients. Since the collateral circulation of the heart is mainly part of the&#xD;
      microcirculation, it can be hypothesized that it is less developed than in &quot;normal&quot; coronary&#xD;
      atherosclerosis without microvascular lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantification of CR with non-invasive techniques has remained difficult. In this&#xD;
      context, there is a need for a reliable non-invasive test to avoid regularly invasive&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above considerations we propose that both AR and CR can be accurately detected&#xD;
      and differentiated using non-invasive quantitative myocardial contrast echocardiography&#xD;
      (MCE).&#xD;

        Prospective study with consecutive inclusion of transplanted patients undergoing follow-up&#xD;
        exams. Examinations comprise endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) and, partly, coronary angiography&#xD;
        on the subsequent day. Group A patients (i.e. those without coronary angiography) undergo&#xD;
        MCE and pharmacologic stress with adenosine, the results of which are compared with the EMB&#xD;
        done at the same day. If they have an acute rejection, they are reexamined during a&#xD;
        histologically proven rejection free period, and the results are compared with those&#xD;
        obtained during acute rejection. Group B patients (i.e. with EMB and coronary angiography)&#xD;
        undergo the same procedure as in group A. Additionally, coronary collateral flow index&#xD;
        (CFI) is obtained and an IVUS exam is performed during coronary angiography.&#xD;
