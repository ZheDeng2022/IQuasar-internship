  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vision loss from diabetes is often preventable with timely detection and treatment. Patients&#xD;
      with diabetes may not understand the importance of annual dilated eye examinations or&#xD;
      recognize the benefits of early detection of diabetic eye disease. The proposed research&#xD;
      project compares usual eye care to eye care emphasizing patient education for adult patients&#xD;
      with diabetes.&#xD;

      Patients with diabetes may not understand the importance of annual dilated eye examinations&#xD;
      or recognize the benefits of early detection of diabetic eye disease. The goal of this study&#xD;
      is to compare the efficacy of usual care to an intervention emphasizing patient education&#xD;
      targeted at a multicultural adult patient population with diabetes seeking eye care in an&#xD;
      academic health center. The specific aims of this study are to evaluate patient knowledge of&#xD;
      preventive health strategies for diabetes as they pertain to eye health and vision care, to&#xD;
      assess patient satisfaction with eye and vision care, and to promote interdisciplinary&#xD;
      collaboration in the care of patients with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ninety patients were randomized to two arms representing usual care and an intervention&#xD;
      emphasizing patient education targeted at English-speaking adults with diabetes seeking eye&#xD;
      care in an academic health center. The project was developed within the Health Professions&#xD;
      Division at Nova Southeastern University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation was comprised of a comprehensive eye health and vision examination, patient&#xD;
      education, and completion of study instruments described below. A demographic survey&#xD;
      documenting patient age, sex, physician-reported HbA1C, education, and birthplace was&#xD;
      administered to all patients at baseline. Race and ethnicity were self reported using&#xD;
      categories in current use by the National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health&#xD;
      (Bethesda, MD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to the intervention were provided with a written report at the conclusion&#xD;
      of the examination. The triplicate form included a report of eye examination findings with a&#xD;
      copy designated for the medical record, the primary care physician, and the patient. The back&#xD;
      side of the patient's copy included educational materials targeted at a layperson while the&#xD;
      physician's copy included information directed at a primary health care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to usual care received patient education at the discretion of the eye care&#xD;
      provider. Following the initial examination, all medical records were reviewed with attention&#xD;
      to communication with other health care providers, as well as other issues related to&#xD;
      continuity and coordination of care. Patients assigned to usual care were mailed additional&#xD;
      written educational materials at the conclusion of the study, after all study instruments had&#xD;
      been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to the intervention were invited to participate in a supplementary seminar&#xD;
      that reinforced the educational message delivered at the time of the initial examination. A&#xD;
      multidisciplinary (optometry, pharmacy, endocrinology) patient education curriculum&#xD;
      incorporating materials from the National Eye Health Education Program (NEHEP) Diabetic Eye&#xD;
      Disease Public Education Program, the &quot;ABC's of diabetes&quot;, an interactive activity, and a&#xD;
      question and answer session was developed for patients randomized to the intervention.&#xD;
