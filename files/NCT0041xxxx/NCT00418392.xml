    <textblock>
      The estimated recurrence rate of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is 23-50% after the first&#xD;
      episode, and the optimal treatment remains unknown. In the recently published British&#xD;
      Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines, simple aspiration is recommended as first line treatment&#xD;
      for all primary pneumothoraces requiring intervention. However, the 1 year recurrence rate of&#xD;
      this procedure was as high as 25-30%, making it inappropriate as a standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrapleural instillation of a chemical irritant (chemical pleurodesis) is an effective way&#xD;
      to shorten the duration of air leaks and reduce the rates of recurrent spontaneous&#xD;
      pneumothorax in surgical and non-surgical patients. Many chemical irritants (tetracycline,&#xD;
      talc, and minocycline) have been used to decrease the rate of recurrence in spontaneous&#xD;
      pneumothorax. Tetracycline, which was the most commonly used irritant, is no longer&#xD;
      available. Talc insufflation of the pleural cavity is safe and effective for primary&#xD;
      spontaneous pneumothorax. However, it should be applied either with surgical or medical&#xD;
      thoracoscopy. Minocycline, a derivative of tetracycline, is as effective as tetracycline in&#xD;
      inducing pleural fibrosis in rabbits. In the previous studies, we have shown that additional&#xD;
      minocycline pleurodesis is a safe and convenient procedure to decrease the rates of&#xD;
      ipsilateral recurrence after thoracoscopic treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. In&#xD;
      the present study, additional minocycline pleurodesis will be randomly administered in&#xD;
      patients with first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax after simple aspiration to&#xD;
      test if it can reduce the rate of recurrence.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary spontaneous pneumothorax most commonly occurs in young, tall, lean males (1, 2). The&#xD;
      estimated recurrence rate is 23-50% after the first episode (3). Optimal treatment of&#xD;
      patients presenting with a first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax remains unknown.&#xD;
      In the recently published British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines (4), simple aspiration is&#xD;
      recommended as first line treatment for all primary pneumothoraces requiring intervention.&#xD;
      However, the 1 year recurrence rate of this procedure was as high as 26-30% (5), making it&#xD;
      inappropriate as a standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrapleural instillation of a chemical irritant (chemical pleurodesis) is an effective way&#xD;
      to shorten the duration of air leaks and reduce the rates of recurrent spontaneous&#xD;
      pneumothorax in surgical and non-surgical patients (6, 7). Light et al. has shown that&#xD;
      intrapleural tetracycline is effective in reducing the rate of ipsilateral recurrence for&#xD;
      patients with spontaneous pneumothorax (7). However, the recently published guidelines&#xD;
      recommended that chemical pleurodesis should only be attempted if the patient is either&#xD;
      unwilling or unable to undergo surgery because the rates of recurrence of pneumothoraces&#xD;
      after surgical intervention either by thoracotomy or VATS, with or without surgical&#xD;
      pleurodesis, is far less than after chemical pleurodesis (4, 8). As a result, chemical&#xD;
      pleurodesis has rarely been used in primary spontaneous pneumothorax, and the effect of&#xD;
      additional chemical pleurodesis after simple aspiration in preventing recurrence of&#xD;
      pneumothoraces has never been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tetracycline, which was the most commonly used irritant, is no longer available. Minocycline,&#xD;
      a derivative of tetracycline, is as effective as tetracycline in inducing pleural fibrosis in&#xD;
      rabbits (9). In the previous studies, we have shown that additional minocycline pleurodesis&#xD;
      is a safe and convenient procedure that associates with lower rates of prolonged air leaks&#xD;
      and ipsilateral recurrence after thoracoscopic treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax&#xD;
      (10, 11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, additional minocycline pleurodesis will be randomly administered in&#xD;
      patients with first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax after simple aspiration to&#xD;
      test if it can reduce the rate of recurrence. This study will comply with the protocol, GCP&#xD;
      and applicable requirement of the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) of the NTUH and Far&#xD;
      Eastern Memorial Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate if&#xD;
      additional minocycline pleurodesis after simple aspiration will be effective in preventing&#xD;
      recurrence of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective The primary end point is to compare the rates of ipsilateral recurrence&#xD;

                randomization, treatment, or follow-up procedures will be removed from the study.&#xD;
                Subjects can also withdraw from the trial at any time point by their will.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized at each center with separate random number lists into one of the&#xD;
      two treatment groups using a computer-generated table numerically corresponding with the&#xD;
      treatment group. The trial treatment randomization codes will be maintained until the end of&#xD;
      the study and will be broken by investigators who were blind to the randomization procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manual aspiration Manual aspiration will be performed as follows: patients were seated in&#xD;
      semi-supine position. After skin disinfection and field preparation, a small-caliber pig-tail&#xD;
      catheter (6-10 French) will be introduced after local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine in the&#xD;
      second intercostal space, at the midclavicular line. After the catheter enters the pleural&#xD;
      space, the catheter will be fixed to the skin using sterile adhesive tape and connected via a&#xD;
      three-way valve to a 50-ml syringe. Air will be manually aspirated, until a resistance was&#xD;
      felt and air was no longer aspirated. Thereafter, a chest X-ray will be performed with the&#xD;
      catheter in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minocycline pleurodesis In the minocycline group, 30 mL of 1% lidocaine hydrochloride (300mg)&#xD;
      followed by a solution of 30 mL of normal saline containing 300 mg of minocycline (Mirosin®,&#xD;
      Taiwan Panbiotic Laboratories, Kaohsiung, Taiwan) will be instilled into the pleural cavity&#xD;
      through the pig-tail catheter or chest tube. In the observation group, nothing will be&#xD;
      administered. Administration of other chemical pleurodesis agents is prohibited during the&#xD;
      study period. Intramuscular meperidine hydrochloride (Demerol®, 50mg/ampule) will be&#xD;
      administered every 4 to 6 hours according to the patient's request if the pain became&#xD;
      intolerable, could not be relieved by oral analgesics, and visual analogue scale was greater&#xD;
      than 7. Chest radiography will be performed immediate postoperatively or the next morning.&#xD;
      VAS will be evaluated immediately 6 hours later after minocycline administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point will be rate of ipsilateral recurrence after the procedure. Secondary&#xD;
      end points include safety, early results, and long-term effects of minocycline pleurodesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate success rates: defined as complete or nearly complete and persistent lung expansion&#xD;
      immediately following manual aspiration. Immediate success for chest tube drainage is defined&#xD;
      as complete lung expansion, absence of air leakage, and chest drain removal within 24 hours&#xD;
      after catheter placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One weeks success rates are defined as complete and persistent lung expansion at one weeks&#xD;
      after the first attempt of aspiration or tube insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-year success: absence of recurrent pneumothorax during a 1-year follow-up period. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all toxicity, adverse events,&#xD;
      safety laboratory examination, vital signs, physical examination. The adverse events which&#xD;
      are not reported will be graded as mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening. Adverse&#xD;
      event will be tabulated and the incidence rates will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 300 patients (150 in each group) will be needed to reach clinical&#xD;
      significance (at the .05 level with a power of 0.9) if minocycline reduced the recurrence&#xD;
      rate from 30% to 15% and the drop out rate is 10%. A planned interim analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted after enrollment of 150 patients with at least 12 months of follow-up. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed on an intent-to-treat basis rather than in an actual treatment&#xD;
      basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up After discharge from the hospital, patients will be followed at the outpatient&#xD;
      clinics at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months where chest radiography will be performed.&#xD;
      Follow-ups will then be conducted every 6 months by a registered nurse who is blinded to the&#xD;
      group allocation by telephone conversation, according to a standard questionnaire that&#xD;
      included when the patient returns to work or school, whether a recurrence occurred, when it&#xD;
      happened, and how it is treated. Residual postoperative chest pain will be evaluated on a&#xD;
      pain score from 0 to 5, where 0 is pain free; 1 is occasional discomfort; 2 is occasional use&#xD;
      of analgesics; 3 is using nonopiate analgesics; 4 is regular pain using opiates; 5 is severe&#xD;
      and intractable pain. All patients will be followed for at least 12 months. Patients can come&#xD;
      back to the clinic or visit emergency department whenever they have chest pain, dyspnea, or&#xD;
      any signs related to the recurrence of pneumothorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function analysis Pulmonary function tests will be performed for patients able to&#xD;
      attend a hospital outpatient appointment at least 6 months after surgery. Forced vital&#xD;
      capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1.0) will be measured using a&#xD;
      spirometer of Microspiro HI-298 (Chest Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with the patients seated. A&#xD;
      minimum of three acceptable forced expiratory maneuvers will be performed and the best one&#xD;
      will be selected for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and statistical analysis The clinical data, duration of chest drainage,&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, complications, requested doses of meperidine, and data of VAS will&#xD;
      be collected. Continuous variables such as age or weight will be expressed as the mean +&#xD;
      standard deviation and analyzed by the two sample t-test. Categorical variables such as&#xD;
      gender or smoking status will be presented by frequency (%) and analyzed by the Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test. Intensity of postoperative pain measured by VAS (from 0 to 10) were summarized by&#xD;
      mean (95 percent confidence interval) and compared by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Scores of&#xD;
      residual chest pain will be analyzed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Freedom from recurrence&#xD;
      will be analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons will be made by the log-rank&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
