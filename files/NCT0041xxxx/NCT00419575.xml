  <brief_summary>

      The aim of this observational study is to evaluate an FDA approved immune system monitoring&#xD;
      assay (Immunknow, Cylex Inc. Columbia, MD) in renal transplant recipients using standard&#xD;
      immunosuppression and prophylaxis protocols from the time of transplantation through a twelve&#xD;
      month follow-up period. The primary endpoint will be the incidence of acute rejection and&#xD;
      infection and any correlation of these events to an assay that may be a measure of recipient&#xD;
      immune response. Secondary endpoints will include evaluation of renal function, patient and&#xD;
      graft survival, incidence of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder and duration&#xD;
      and extent of lymphocyte depletion.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As compared to previous eras, renal transplantation is a procedure associated with low acute&#xD;
      rejection rates and excellent one year graft survival. Despite this success, long term graft&#xD;
      survival rates have not improved significantly. The reasons for late graft loss are&#xD;
      multi-factorial, but include chronic rejection and infection. Thus, avoidance of chronic over&#xD;
      immunosuppression is tantamount in avoiding graft or patient threatening infection, while&#xD;
      avoidance of under immunosuppression is necessary to prevent graft loss from acute or chronic&#xD;
      rejection. Renal allograft loss from a particular viral pathogen, BK virus, has become&#xD;
      evident in the era of modern immunosuppression and likely reflects relative over&#xD;
      immunosuppression. We, and others, have used BK detection as an imprecise marker of over&#xD;
      immunosuppression to help guide adjustments in chronic immunosuppressive therapy. While&#xD;
      screening for the presence of BK virus is helpful in avoiding over immunosuppression and&#xD;
      potential graft loss from BK nephropathy, a correlate assay is not readily available that&#xD;
      provides evidence of under immunosuppression, indicating risk of graft loss from rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, a proven assay to measure the strength of the immune system is unavailable, and&#xD;
      the only definite markers of over or under-immunosuppression remain infection and rejection,&#xD;
      respectively. A tool to help tailor chronic immunosuppressive therapy and decrease the&#xD;
      incidence of either of these two extremes would be of significant value in helping to prolong&#xD;
      allograft survival and decrease the risk of immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplant&#xD;
      recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this observational study, we plan to use a standard immunosuppressive regimen as well as&#xD;
      standard infection prophylaxis with the addition of an immune monitoring assay (ImmunoKnow).&#xD;
      This assay measures ATP production by recipient T cells and has been proposed as a marker of&#xD;
      immune function. While of interest, there are as yet, no published studies describing the&#xD;
      utility of this test for immune monitoring in adult renal transplant recipients. As this&#xD;
      assay remains unproven as a viable tool to define over or under immunosuppression, we will be&#xD;
      blinded to the ImmunoKnow results during the course of the study. The results from the immune&#xD;
      monitoring assay will only be used in a retrospective analysis to determine if there is any&#xD;
      clinically relevant correlation between the values obtained and episodes of rejection,&#xD;
      infection, or the development of donor specific antibodies. If a significant correlation is&#xD;
      suggested, further evaluation in subsequent studies and eventual incorporation into&#xD;
      prospective patient care may be warranted.&#xD;
