  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this small study was to investigate the safety and effectiveness of OROS&#xD;
      hydromorphone HCI for the treatment of short-term, moderate to severe postoperative pain&#xD;
      following total knee replacement surgery.&#xD;

      This was a multicenter, randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on&#xD;
      chance), open-label, single dose small study. During the 36 hour study period, concomitant&#xD;
      analgesic (pain) medications and physical therapy were recorded in the patient's case report&#xD;
      form. The study duration for each patient was 36 hours after a single dose of OROS&#xD;
      hydromorphone HCI had been administered. After surgery, eligible patients had to tolerate&#xD;
      liquids, swallow a tablet, and have audible bowel sounds. Before OROS hydromorphone HCI was&#xD;
      administered, all analgesic medications were discontinued and patients with a pain score of&#xD;
      2(moderate pain) or 3 (severe pain) upon movement were eligible to enter the study and&#xD;
      receive a single oral dose of OROS hydromorphone HCI. Patients had to have stable heart&#xD;
      rates, blood pressure, respiration, oxygen saturation greater than or equal to 94% and&#xD;
      patients who had undergone regional anesthesia had to have motor and sensory recovery from&#xD;
      nerve blockade. Qualifying patients were given OROS hydromorphone HCI between 6 and 48 hours&#xD;
      after completion of the surgical procedure. Patients were randomized into 3 groups (OROS&#xD;
      hydromorphone HCI 8, 16, and 32 mg). The precise time of OROS hydromorphone HCI&#xD;
      administration was considered time zero. To maintain consistency, dosing was to occur between&#xD;
      6 am and 2 pm, if possible. Following study drug administration, patients could be given&#xD;
      rescue medication of oral hydromorphone immediate-release tablets (2 or 4 mg) for&#xD;
      breakthrough pain as needed. Oxygen saturation, vital signs, pain relief ratings, and pain&#xD;
      intensity ratings at rest and upon movement were obtained at 2-hour time intervals during the&#xD;
      first 8 hours following study drug administration, and at 4 hour intervals from 8 to 36 hours&#xD;
      following study drug administration. The study concluded 36 hours after dosing, at which time&#xD;
      a global evaluation of pain relief was obtained from each patient. One single dose of OROS&#xD;
      hydromorphone HCI (8, 16, or 32 mg) administered orally at the beginning of the 36 hour&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing primary, unilateral total knee replacement surgery where use of&#xD;
             opioid analgesics for short-term postoperative pain is required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At baseline must be able to tolerate oral liquids, swallow a tablet, and have the&#xD;
             presence of bowel sounds upon examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must demonstrate stable vital signs immediately before dosing with OROS&#xD;
             hydromorphone HCI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At baseline pain intensity upon movement must be scored by the patient as 2 or 3&#xD;
             (moderate or severe) on the Pain Intensity Rating Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At baseline patients receiving regional anesthetics/analgesics must demonstrate&#xD;
             recovery from the motor and sensory effects of the nerve blockade&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be administered OROS hydromorphone HCI between 6 and 48 hours following&#xD;
             completion of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should expect to remain hospitalized for 36 hours after study drug&#xD;

             any opioid agonist&#xD;
