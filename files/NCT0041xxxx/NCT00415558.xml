      The purpose of this prospective, single-arm, un-blinded, multi-site clinical study is to&#xD;
      assess the safety and efficacy of the Microwave Ablation System for the treatment of&#xD;
      symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) in the minimally invasive surgical (MIS)&#xD;
      procedure in approximately 30 patients at 6 investigational sites in the United States.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study population for this study will be comprised of patients who have been diagnosed&#xD;
      with symptomatic (PAF) for at least 6 months prior to study entry. Patients will be qualified&#xD;
      for the study if they meet stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria, signing an informed&#xD;
      consent and agreeing to return for followup visits at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. All study&#xD;
      patients will receive microwave ablation to treat their symptomatic PAF. The Microwave&#xD;
      Ablation System will be used during a MIS procedure on a beating heart in order to ablate a&#xD;
      specified lesion pattern.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is greater than or = 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has documented symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) refractory to&#xD;
             at least 1 antiarrhythmic (Class IA, IC, III) drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has episodes of symptomatic AF including, but not limited to, palpitations,&#xD;
             lightheadedness, fatigue, dyspnea, and/or chest pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A minimum of a 6-month history of symptomatic paroxysmal AF (documented by patient&#xD;
             report in the medical record).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A minimum of 2 discrete symptomatic paroxysmal AF episodes in the month prior to study&#xD;
             entry. Paroxysmal AF rhythm must be documented by objective evidence (12-lead&#xD;
             electrocardiogram [ECG], Holter monitor, event monitor, or other telemetry rhythm&#xD;
             strip) with the presence of sinus rhythm and/or underlying rhythm between episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has been informed of the nature of the study, agreed to its provisions, and&#xD;
             provided written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient had a cerebral vascular accident or transient ischemic attack within the&#xD;
             previous 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient had a myocardial infarction within the previous 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has underlying metabolic etiology related to AF (e.g., hyperthyroidism,&#xD;
             metabolic disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has significant underlying structural heart disease (e.g., valvular disease,&#xD;
             presence of aneurysm, left ventricular hypertrophy) requiring surgical or procedural&#xD;
             intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with prior catheter ablation procedure for the treatment of AF within the&#xD;
             previous 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has evidence of, or history of, 50% or more stenosis in any pulmonary vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient had a previous thoracic procedure resulting in sternal opening and/or&#xD;
             pericardial opening (e.g., surgical ablation, coronary artery bypass graft [CABG], or&#xD;
             valve repair).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a left atrial size &gt; 6.0 cm measured on echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 35%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient requires treatment for CAD (coronary artery disease) or has untreated unstable&#xD;
             angina.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a presence of esophageal fistula or esophageal stricture, untreated&#xD;
             esophagitis, varices, dysphagia, or odynophagia caused by anatomical abnormality or&#xD;
             other diseases contraindicating transesophageal echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a known allergy or contraindication to Coumadin (warfarin) therapy, or&#xD;
             inability to comply with Coumadin (warfarin) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a known allergy or contraindication to complying with antiarrhythmic&#xD;
             (Class IA, IC, III) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has an acute illness or active systemic infection or sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a co-morbidity with life expectancy of less than one year or protocol&#xD;
             non-compliance that would limit follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is geographically remote and/or unable to return for follow-up examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is pregnant or is planning to become pregnant during the study.&#xD;
