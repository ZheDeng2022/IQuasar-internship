  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis accounts for more than 70% of the dialysis modality in Hong Kong. Exit&#xD;
      site infection (ESI) is one of the causes leading to peritoneal catheter removal. Appropriate&#xD;
      exit-site care can prevent ESI. As the presence of a causative organism is essential in ESI,&#xD;
      eliminating organism invasion may be useful in preventing ESI. In the present study, an exit&#xD;
      site care method aiming at preventing organism invasion is developed to investigate its&#xD;
      effectiveness in reducing ESI. It is also hoped the present study can help to develop an exit&#xD;
      site care method that can reduce the frequency of exit site dressing so as to reduce the&#xD;
      burden of patients and to improve their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We'll recruit one hundred new chronic peritoneal dialysis patients into the study. The&#xD;
      patients will be divided into two groups. One group of the patients will use film-dressing&#xD;
      method (F) and the other group will use simple gauze dressing method (G). F group patients&#xD;
      will have the exit site covered with a dressing film and keep it intact for 7 days after&#xD;
      having the exit site cleaned with antiseptic solution. G group patients will clean the exit&#xD;
      site with antiseptic solution and change the simple gauze dressing daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of the two groups will be compared. The outcome will be expressed in terms of&#xD;
      exit site infection free period, peritonitis free period and exit site condition&#xD;
      classification. Patient subjective quality of life will also be compared at first and twelfth&#xD;
      month.&#xD;

    We encounter technical problems to continue with the study. (Notably difficulty in teaching the&#xD;
