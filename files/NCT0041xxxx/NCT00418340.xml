  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition. At least 20% of the population suffer&#xD;
      from IBS. The symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation, bloating and difficulty&#xD;
      with bowel motions are often disabling. Many of those affected are young and report a poor&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL) to a degree that is similar to gut inflammatory conditions like&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Yet the impact of IBS on patients' lives is often&#xD;
      underestimated. This is probably because unlike inflammatory bowel disease, in which the&#xD;
      bowel is inflammed and bleeds, the bowel in IBS looks normal. Instead the problem is of&#xD;
      abnormal functioning of the gut the cause of which is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently therapy for IBS is limited and until recently therapy has focused on treating the&#xD;
      symptoms to improve QOL primarily because the underlying mechanism of IBS is poorly&#xD;
      understood. However as more processes are being implicated in IBS e.g. visceral&#xD;
      hypersensitivity (excessive response to sensory stimuli within the gut), infection, immune&#xD;
      activation, dysmotility and abnormal gut fermentation , the potential for new therapies looks&#xD;
      promising. The evidence that gut bacteria play a role in inducing IBS symptoms is due to&#xD;
      observations of an improvement of IBS symptoms with probiotic therapy (bacterial supplements)&#xD;
      and antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with IBS are hypersensitive to colorectal distension compared with healthy controls.&#xD;
      Studies carried out in our unit have shown that visceral pain thresholds in response to&#xD;
      stress are lower in patients with IBS compared with healthy volunteers. This hypersensitivity&#xD;
      is apparent in response to both a physical and chemical stimulus but the triggers to visceral&#xD;
      hypersensitivity remain largely unknown. Animal models suggest roles for both host immune&#xD;
      response and intestinal bacteria in the induction of visceral hypersensitivity. This proposal&#xD;
      will focus on further exploration of the mechanisms underlying visceral hypersensitivity to&#xD;
      direct future targeting of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous independent studies showed that (a) bacteria reduce visceral hypersensitivity,&#xD;
      (b)probiotic therapy can alter gut immune response and (c) gut sensation is affected by the&#xD;
      type of immune cells in the gut. Our research proposal will investigate the relationship&#xD;
      between gut bacteria, the immune system and the sensory gut nerves in order to understand how&#xD;
      IBS symptoms are generated. This understanding will be the critical for effective future drug&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      This research will study&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) probiotic-induced changes in visceral hypersensitivity and immune activity The effects of&#xD;
      probiotic therapy will be assessed in a randomised placebo-controlled study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited prospectively from outpatient clinics. A flow chart of the study is shown in&#xD;
      appendix 1 of the protocol. Patient selection. IBS patients will be selected according to&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease severity will be determined at enrolment with a validated IBS symptom questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires to exclude psychiatric illness: The well-validated Hospital Anxiety Depression&#xD;
      Score (HADS)questionniaire will be used to identify patients with anxiety and depression. A&#xD;
      SCL-90 questionnaire will also be used to assess the psychological profile of patients as&#xD;
      this may have an impact on the response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotic therapy. Patients will be randomised to receive either VSL#3 (450 billion&#xD;
      lyophilized bacteria/sachet) twice daily for 4 weeks or a placebo powder containing starch&#xD;
      but no bacteria. VSL#3 was selected for use in this study because (a) it contains three&#xD;
      different Bifidobacteria strains (in addition to lactobaccilli and streptococci) and the&#xD;
      limited evidence available Bifidobacteria as the most effective probiotics in IBS 10; (b)it&#xD;
      induces IL-10 production by intestinal DC 27 and, in pouchitis studies, stimulated IL-10&#xD;
      production in vivo 38; IBS has been associated with a deficiency in IL-10 production; (c)&#xD;
      studies from one group have yielded promising results with this particular probiotic&#xD;
      preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessing the clinical response to therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physiological response to probiotic therapy: Rectal sensitivity will be assessed at&#xD;
                baseline and at day 28 of therapy. Rectal sensitivity to pressure and pain will be&#xD;
                assessed with Barostat device and electrical stimulation respectively. Barostat&#xD;
                device has been used in many other studies as a measure of sensation to pressure.&#xD;
                Electrical stimulation is currently used in clinical practice. Equipment for both&#xD;
                tests is currently in use at out physiology laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Symptomatic response to probiotic therapy: IBS symptom scores will be made at&#xD;
                baseline and at d28 of therapy. The three symptoms of IBS will be assessed to&#xD;
                determine response to therapy: abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating/ distension and&#xD;
                bowel movements, each scored on an ordinal scale (Likert scale; maximum score 7)&#xD;
                and on a 100mm visual analogue scale (VAS; maximum score 100). A composite score&#xD;
                with the sums of the 3 cardinal symptoms will also be calculated for each patient&#xD;
                (Likert scale maximum score 21) (VAS; maximum score 300).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality of life (QOL) with probiotic therapy: The SF-36 Heath-related QOL&#xD;
                questionnaire, and the IBS QOL questionnaire will be administered at baseline and&#xD;
                at day 28. This will assess the impact of IBS symptoms on the QOL and any changes&#xD;
                following probiotic therapy. Follow-up: Patients will be contacted at 6 months to&#xD;
                reassess symptom scores and QOL and determine longer-term impact of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessing Immunological response to probiotic therapy. Venepuncture will be performed&#xD;
           for collection of blood immune cells at baseline and day 28. Colonic biopsies will be&#xD;
           collected via a flexible sigmoidoscopy at entry baseline and at day 28 following the&#xD;
           physiological tests. The biopsies will be use for analysis of cytokine production and to&#xD;
           a limited phenotypic analysis of colonic immune cells (DC) with markers to be selected&#xD;
           on the basis of data from an on-going cross-sectional study looking at DC in IBS&#xD;
           compared to controls. Full analysis of blood DC will be performed at each time point.&#xD;
           Changes in DC populations and cytokine production will be secondary endpoints of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
