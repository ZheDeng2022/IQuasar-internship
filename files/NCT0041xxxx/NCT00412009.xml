      Tuberculosis (TB) patients who receive inadequate treatment or do not complete therapy are&#xD;
      more likely to remain infectious, thus contributing to the continuous spread of TB infection&#xD;
      in communities. Despite the widespread use of Directly Observed Therapy, defaulters remain an&#xD;
      important problem in TB control programmes. In Sénégal, defaulters rate reach 30%, which is&#xD;
      hampering dramatically the effectiveness of control. New strategies to deliver treatment to&#xD;
      TB patients and ensure proper adherence that are adapted to the local situations are urgently&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of the project is to improve tuberculosis treatment success rates in&#xD;
      Sénégal. The specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to assess the current situation of tuberculosis (TB) in Sénégal&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to identify the determinants of cure,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to develop measures to improve patient's compliance with the treatment that are adapted&#xD;
           to the local situation, acceptable, affordable and sustainable&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to evaluate the impact of these measures on TB control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research seeks to develop and test innovative methods to improve cure rates in&#xD;
      TB patients. It will explore the factors of success of TB treatment using inter-disciplinary&#xD;
      approach, integrating social sciences and economic analyses into TB research. The project is&#xD;
      composed of 3 comprehensive phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1: baseline assessment of the TB situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2: anthropological study, investigating various domains contributing to patients&#xD;
           cure using a range of qualitative research methods. At the end of this investigation, it&#xD;
           is expected that determinants of care will be clearly identified. On this basis,&#xD;
           suitable methods for improving patients' adherence to treatment will be tailored and&#xD;
           developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 3: these methods will be tested and compared using a cluster randomised controlled&#xD;
           trial design, in populations served by defined health centres. Their efficacy will be&#xD;
           measured in terms of improvement of the classical TB control programme indicators (cure&#xD;
           rate, defaulter rate, failure rate, death rates). The methods will also be evaluated on&#xD;
           their acceptability by the TB patients and the communities and on their feasibility&#xD;
           (duration : 24 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods to improve patients' adherence to treatment that are affordable, acceptable and&#xD;
      sustainable will be developed and tested according to qualitative and quantitative criteria.&#xD;

      General Project Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research seeks to develop and test innovative methods to improve treatment&#xD;
      success rates in TB patients in Senegal. It will explore the factors of success of TB&#xD;
      treatment using inter-disciplinary approach, integrating social sciences and economic&#xD;
      analyses into TB research. The project is composed of 3 comprehensive phases, that will be&#xD;
      run concurrently and complement each other:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1: baseline assessment of the TB situation. It is first proposed to assess the&#xD;
           magnitude of the TB problem and of the means to control it through a standard baseline&#xD;
           assessment (6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2: anthropological study, investigating various domains contributing to patients&#xD;
           cure (the patients, the community, the general health services, the policy makers and&#xD;
           the TB control staff), using a range of qualitative research methods (12 months). At the&#xD;
           end of this investigation, it is expected that determinants of care will be clearly&#xD;
           identified with a comprehensive understanding of their relation/interface. On this&#xD;
           basis, suitable methods for improving patients' adherence to treatment will be&#xD;
           developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 3: these methods will be tested and compared using a cluster randomised controlled&#xD;
           trial design, in populations served by defined health centres. Their efficacy will be&#xD;
           measured in terms of improvement of the classical TB control programme indicators (cure&#xD;
           rate, defaulter rate, failure rate, death rates). The methods will also be evaluated on&#xD;
           their acceptability by the TB patients and the communities and on their feasibility (24&#xD;
           months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of the Intervention Trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is intended to improve access to care and increase adherence to treatment,&#xD;
      targeting simultaneously DHC staff, TB patients and communities, and includes four&#xD;
      components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. improving communication between health personnel and patients through appropriate&#xD;
           training;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. decentralising treatment to remote health posts and involving community health workers&#xD;
           (CHW);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. strengthening the DOT strategy by giving patients the opportunity to choose their&#xD;
           treatment supporter; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. reinforcing supervision of health posts by the DHC team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is applied at the District Health Centre (DHC) level, which is the unit of&#xD;
      randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the detection of an average of 100 new TB cases per DHC per year, an estimated&#xD;
      coefficient of variability k=0.12, an estimated success rate in the control arm of 65% using&#xD;
      conventional TB control programmes procedures, with 80% power and a type I error of 5%, the&#xD;
      required sample size aiming to detect a difference of at least 15% in the treatment success&#xD;
      rate between the intervention and control arms is eight DHCs per arm. In order to take into&#xD;
      account the variation in recruitment of TB patients between the DHCs, the randomisation is&#xD;
      stratified on baseline detection rate of sputum smear positive cases in 2001, that were&#xD;
      classified as less than 60/100 000 and more than or equal to 60/100 000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and follow-up DHCs with a functional TB diagnosis and treatment unit, where no other&#xD;
      research projects were being undertaken, were eligible for inclusion. The study population&#xD;
      consisted of all individuals presenting to the DHC between June 2003 and May 2004 with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed sputum-smear positive pulmonary TB (at least two positive specimens), aged 15 years&#xD;
      or more, and living in the district served by the DHC. Written informed consent was obtained&#xD;
      at recruitment and patients were followed-up during the course of their eight month treatment&#xD;
      regimen, with the last patients seen in January 2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smear-negative and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis cases, as well as re-treatment cases, were&#xD;
      not eligible for the study. Patients were recruited into the study between June 2003 and May&#xD;
      2004 and followed up till January 2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints are both the proportion of recruited patients experiencing treatment&#xD;
      success (those cured + those completing treatment), and the proportion of patients defaulting&#xD;
      from treatment before completion. A &quot;cured&quot; patient is defined by a negative sputum-smear at&#xD;
      eight months and on at least one previous occasion. Patients &quot;completing treatment&quot; are those&#xD;
      missing smear results but who had finished their treatment regimen. A &quot;defaulter&quot; is defined&#xD;
      as a patient who definitely stopped treatment before completion.&#xD;
