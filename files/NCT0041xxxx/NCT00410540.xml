    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the clinical equivalence of hydromorphone and&#xD;
      morphine (immediate-release [IR] and sustained-release [SR] formulations) using the &quot;worst&#xD;
      pain in the past 24 hours&quot; item of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). The secondary objective of&#xD;
      this study was to compare hydromorphone and morphine in the following variables: other pain&#xD;
      measures, various questionnaires, and safety and tolerability variables.&#xD;

      This was a phase-3, multicenter, multinational, randomized (patients are assigned different&#xD;
      treatments based on chance), active-controlled, double-blind, multiple-ascending-dose,&#xD;
      parallel-group study in adult patients with cancer pain who receive and/or require strong&#xD;
      oral or transdermal opioid analgesics (60-540 mg of oral morphine equivalents daily). This&#xD;
      study consisted of 2 phases: an initial immediate release (IR) phase and a subsequent slow&#xD;
      release (SR) phase. Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either OROS&#xD;
      hydromorphone HCl or morphine sulfate (immediate release formulation in the immediate release&#xD;
      phase, slow release formulation in the slow release phase). In the immediate release phase&#xD;
      (2-9 days), patients were started on the appropriate initial dose of immediate release&#xD;
      medication every 4 hours (q4h), (6 doses/day) using a 5:1 conversion ratio (morphine&#xD;
      equivalents:hydromorphone dosage). If the patient had greater than 3 breakthrough-pain&#xD;
      episodes requiring additional pain medication in 24 hours, the study medication dosage was&#xD;
      increased, at most once a day. When the patient had achieved dose-stable pain control (2 days&#xD;
      with 3 or less than 3 breakthrough-pain episodes per day), the patient was permitted to&#xD;
      continue into the slow release phase. The patient was given an equivalent dosage of a slow&#xD;
      release formulation of the same drug (OROSÂ® hydromorphone HCL each day or morphine sulfate&#xD;
      slow release two times per day), administered using a double-dummy technique. Dosage&#xD;
      increases were permitted every 2 days if the patient had more than 3 breakthrough-pain&#xD;
      episodes in 24 hours. To complete the slow release phase, patients had to achieve dose-stable&#xD;
      pain control for at least 2 days.Safety assessments of physical examination, labs and adverse&#xD;
      event reporting were done. OROS hydromorphone HCL slow release 8, 16, 32, and 64mg tablets;&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with cancer pain who are currently receiving strong oral or transdermal&#xD;
             opioid analgesics or in whom strong opioid analgesics are appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who requires or are expected to require between 60 and 540 mg of oral&#xD;
             morphine or morphine equivalents every 24 hours for the chronic management of cancer&#xD;
             pain&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have pain suitable for treatment with a once-daily formulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with concomitant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with gastrointestinal (GI) disease of sufficient severity to interfere with&#xD;
             orally administered analgesia (eg dysphagia, vomiting, constipation, bowel&#xD;
             obstruction, severe gut narrowing) were not permitted to enroll&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient where the risks of treatment with morphine or hydromorphone outweighed the&#xD;
             potential benefits such as raised intracranial pressure, hypotension, hypothyroidism,&#xD;
             asthma, reduced respiratory reserve, prostatic hypertrophy, hepatic or renal&#xD;
             impairment, convulsive disorders, and Addison's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Debilitated patients were excluded.&#xD;
