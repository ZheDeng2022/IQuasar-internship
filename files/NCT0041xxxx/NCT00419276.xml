  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if following total knee replacement, putting local anesthetic-or numbing&#xD;
      medication-for five days through a tiny tube next to the nerves that go to the knee will&#xD;
      decrease the time that patients need to spend in the hospital.&#xD;

      1. Procedures that will be done as part of your normal clinical care (even if you do not&#xD;
           participate in this research):&#xD;
&#xD;
           You will have some monitors placed (such as a blood-pressure cuff) and be given some&#xD;
           medicines through your intravenous line to make you very sleepy. The anesthesiologist&#xD;
           will then place a tiny tube, called a catheter, near your nerves that will be used&#xD;
           during and following surgery. This involves carefully cleaning the immediate area in the&#xD;
           upper thigh where the catheter will be placed, numbing the site of the catheter with&#xD;
           local anesthetic placed just under the skin, placing a needle through the skin that is&#xD;
           numbed to an area near where your nerves are, putting the catheter through the needle so&#xD;
           that the tip is next to your nerves, then removing the needle leaving the catheter in&#xD;
           place. You can still go to sleep for the surgery, but you will be more comfortable when&#xD;
           you wake up because the numbing medicine will be working to take away much of the pain.&#xD;
           If you are not part of this study, you would go from the recovery room to a room in the&#xD;
           hospital for 3-5 days, and your catheter would probably be removed the morning after&#xD;
           surgery. After removal of your catheter, you would depend on oral and intravenous pain&#xD;
           medicine (&quot;opioids&quot;-like morphine) to control your surgical pain. You would go home with&#xD;
           only oral opioids since intravenous opioids cannot be provided at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Procedures that will be done only if you participate in this research study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           From the recovery room you will go to the surgical ward. During your stay in the&#xD;
           hospital you will have the ability to push a button on a small infusion pump-a little&#xD;
           device that holds and puts the medicine through the catheter to bath your nerves in&#xD;
           local anesthetic-to give yourself more medicine through the tube to your nerves if you&#xD;
           have pain. If this does not help enough, you will take pain pills to help. And if this&#xD;
           does not help enough, you will be given opioids (strong pain medicine like morphine)&#xD;
           into your intravenous line.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. On the morning after surgery, the medicine in your little infusion pump will be replaced&#xD;
           by either (1) more medicine, or (2) salt water, or &quot;normal saline&quot;. The pharmacist will&#xD;
           determine this randomly-like flipping a coin-and neither you nor the doctors/nurses&#xD;
           caring for you will know which you have. This is to keep any of us from inadvertently/&#xD;
           unconsciously affecting the results of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. You will undergo physical therapy and following this you will be checked to see if you&#xD;
           are ready to go home. This will include walking in the morning and afternoon with a&#xD;
           physical therapist. When you are ready to go home beginning on the third day after&#xD;
           surgery, you may go home with the little infusion pump and the tube that delivers the&#xD;
           fluid. You will be given a prescription for pain pills in case you need them for pain&#xD;
           relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. One of the study investigators will call you each night to ensure that you are&#xD;
           comfortable for the first 6 nights after your surgery, and you will be given the phone&#xD;
           and pager numbers of your physician (anesthesiologist) available for you to contact 24&#xD;
           hours/day, 7 days/week. A research nurse will call you for five nights beginning the day&#xD;
           after surgery to ask about your comfort level and other study-related information such&#xD;
           as your satisfaction level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. On the fourth evening following surgery your catheter will be removed. You have two&#xD;
           options available to you to remove your catheter. You can call a physician who will talk&#xD;
           you or your caregiver through this process over the phone--it will not hurt or bleed.&#xD;
           Your other option is to come back to the hospital to have a health care professional&#xD;
           remove the catheter for you. The pump, catheter and remaining fluid are disposable and&#xD;
           will not hurt people or pets, so they will be thrown away. A physician will call you the&#xD;
           night after the catheter comes out to ensure that you are comfortable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A research nurse will call you at 7 days and then 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months following&#xD;
           your surgery. Each of these calls will be less than five minutes in length during which&#xD;
           time you will be asked questions about your levels of pain, stiffness and joint&#xD;
           functional ability. Your participation will be limited to 12 months after surgery with&#xD;
           these phone calls.&#xD;
