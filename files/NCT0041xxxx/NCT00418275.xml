      Cerebrovascular disease, the third leading cause of death after heart disease and cancer in&#xD;
      developed countries, has an overall prevalence of 794 per 100,000. In the United States, it&#xD;
      is estimated that more than 400,000 patients are discharged each year from hospitals after a&#xD;
      stroke. The loss of these patients from the work force and the extended hospitalization they&#xD;
      require during recovery make serious economic impact. In Taiwan, Cerebrovascular disease is&#xD;
      the second cause of death.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with cerebral ischemia at any location producing a serious measurable deficit&#xD;
             by NIHSS scale and who received study medication within 5 hours after the onset of the&#xD;
             symptom. A serious measurable deficit by NIHSS was defined as the NIHSS  9 and  20&#xD;

             within 3 months prior to the study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a significant surgery within 14 days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of gastrointestinal or urinary tract hemorrhage within 21 days&#xD;
             prior to the study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with lumbar puncture or arterial puncture of non-compressible site within 14&#xD;
