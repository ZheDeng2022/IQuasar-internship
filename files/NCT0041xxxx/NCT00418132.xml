  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progressive systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an immune-based disease that causes abnormal&#xD;
      connective tissue growth of the skin and internal organs. At this point, there are no&#xD;
      effective therapies for treating SSc. Thalidomide is a medication that has been shown to&#xD;
      stimulate an immune response that reduces the body's synthesis of collagen, the main&#xD;
      component of connective tissue. This study will determine the effectiveness of thalidomide in&#xD;
      treating adults with SSc.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Progressive systemic sclerosis (SSc), also known as scleroderma, is a disease of the body's&#xD;
      connective tissue. It is characterized by fibrosis of the skin, or formation of scar-like&#xD;
      tissue, resulting in progressively increased restriction of joint range of motion. Fibrosis&#xD;
      of internal organs also occurs, leading to irregular heart rhythms, acid reflux, and&#xD;
      respiratory problems. Unfortunately, no therapies have been developed to effectively treat&#xD;
      SSc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease is believed to be an immunological disorder that affects T-helper type 2 (Th2)&#xD;
      cells, which stimulate the production of antibodies and interleukin-4 (IL-4), a protein with&#xD;
      profibrotic properties. T-helper type 1 (Th1) cells produce interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a protein&#xD;
      that prevents fibroblast production of collagen, a primary component of the body's connective&#xD;
      tissue. It is possible that shifting the disease's target from the Th2 cells to the Th1 cells&#xD;
      may decrease collagen production, and thereby reduce fibrosis. Thalidomide is an immune&#xD;
      modulatory drug that has been shown to stimulate production of Th1 cells. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of thalidomide in treating adults with SSc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following screening procedures, participants in this 48-week, double-blind study will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive placebo or thalidomide at a dose of 50 mg/day. The thalidomide&#xD;
      dose will be increased to 100 mg/day at Week 2, then to 200 mg/day at Week 4, and finally to&#xD;
      300 mg/day at Week 6. Participants who experience dose intolerance will immediately switch to&#xD;
      the previously tolerated dose. Inpatient hospital visits lasting 2 days will occur at the&#xD;
      beginning of the study before starting thalidomide treatment and at Weeks 16 and 48.&#xD;
      Assessments and procedures at these visits will include blood and urine collection, a&#xD;
      physical exam, a chest X-ray, an electrocardiogram, a skin biopsy, and various&#xD;
      questionnaires. Outpatient study visits will occur at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 20 and then&#xD;
      every 4 weeks until Week 44. Assessments will include measures of immune function, clinical&#xD;
      disease, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and safety. Following the Week 48 inpatient&#xD;
      visit, thalidomide will be tapered off over a 2-week period for all participants.&#xD;
