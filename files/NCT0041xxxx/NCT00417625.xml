  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in measuring cardiac&#xD;
      perfusion (blood flow). MRI of the heart can measure blood flow to heart muscle, but&#xD;
      collateral coronary arteries (vessels that supply blood to the heart muscle) may reduce the&#xD;
      accuracy of the measurements. This study will perform special measurements of coronary artery&#xD;
      flow and pressure in patients undergoing heart catheterization and catheter-based treatment&#xD;
      (angioplasty and stenting) in order to compare for accuracy with cardiac MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 21 years of age and older with coronary artery blockage may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. All participants undergo cardiac MRI, to produce images of the heart, as well as&#xD;
      special invasive blood flow testing during heart catheterization, angioplasty, and stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During MRI, the subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner (a narrow&#xD;
      cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the&#xD;
      scanning process. The procedure lasts about 45 to 90 minutes. Since the heart moves during&#xD;
      breathing, subjects are asked to hold their breath intermittently for about 5-20 seconds. A&#xD;
      medicine called dipyridamole is injected through a vein in the subject's arm to increase&#xD;
      blood flow to the coronary arteries and help detect blockages. Pictures are taken of the&#xD;
      heart before, during, and after the dipyridamole injection. Another medicine called&#xD;
      gadolinium is also given through a vein. This medicine brightens the images to measure blood&#xD;
      flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a separate catheterization, angioplasty, and stenting procedure, subjects undergo&#xD;
      additional invasive tests. The additional tests use a special guidewire to measure coronary&#xD;
      artery pressure and blood flow, as well as a special ultrasound to look inside the artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have a repeat MRI about 2 months after the catheterization.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can measure perfusion (blood flow) to heart muscle.&#xD;
      Collateral coronary arteries (natural bypasses to the heart) may reduce the accuracy of&#xD;
      perfusion measured by cardiac MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are testing the accuracy of these measurements in subjects undergoing medically necessary&#xD;
      cardiac catheterization and catheter-based treatment (angioplasty and stenting). We will&#xD;
      perform special invasive measurements of coronary artery flow and pressure during&#xD;
      catheterization in order to compare with cardiac MRI.&#xD;
