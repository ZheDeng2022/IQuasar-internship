    <textblock>
      Previously we demonstrated the beneficial effects of an Internet-based glucose-monitoring&#xD;
      system (IBGMS) in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The &quot;Diabetes Phone&quot;, a cellular&#xD;
      phone with a glucometer integrated in the battery pack, was launched in Korea in 2003. Here&#xD;
      we test the short-term effectiveness of the diabetes phone for glucose control and compare it&#xD;
      with that of IBGMS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Various strategies using electronic technologies or educational programs have been proposed&#xD;
      to improve the quality and efficiency of care for people with diabetes. In the previous&#xD;
      study, we introduced a new bidirectional communication tool for diabetes management termed&#xD;
      the Internet-Based Glucose Monitoring System (IBGMS), and demonstrated its short-term and&#xD;
      long-term effects on glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients. Other researchers have&#xD;
      also showed the effectiveness of telecommunication between health-care providers and patients&#xD;
      for maintaining appropriate blood glucose control. These systems allow patients to send data&#xD;
      to doctors, identify specific problems and receive recommendations from health-care providers&#xD;
      more frequently and with fewer time and place limitations than at traditional face-to-face&#xD;
      outpatient clinics. With the IBGMS, physicians can monitor patients' self-monitored blood&#xD;
      glucose data at regular intervals, and patients can communicate with their physicians&#xD;
      whenever they have any questions. Although bidirectional interactive communications between&#xD;
      physicians and patients can be achieved with the IBGMS, there remain time and place&#xD;
      limitations. Patients must connect to the Internet using their personal computer to input&#xD;
      their data or questions on the IBGMS, while physicians only visit the website at regular&#xD;
      intervals unless they have received questions from patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the efficiency of communication, we linked the IBGMS to the short message service&#xD;
      (SMS) delivered by cellular phone. The patients sent their data to doctors through the IBGMS&#xD;
      and then received the doctors' recommendations about adjustment of drug dosage and other&#xD;
      related data on the cellular phone. This system improved the efficiency of communication and&#xD;
      patients' satisfaction also slightly increased. However, patients were still limited by place&#xD;
      and time when sending questions and blood glucose-monitoring data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, cellular phones have been developed that can measure blood glucose level and&#xD;
      transmit data directly to a web server (Diabetes Phone). The combination of a glucometer with&#xD;
      the cellular phone function makes it easier for patients to report their self-monitored blood&#xD;
      glucose (SMBG) levels and receive feedback from their doctors. However, it was not known how&#xD;
      effective this cellular phone glucose-monitoring system would be for control of blood glucose&#xD;
      levels, compared to the IBGMS tested previously. We investigated the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      diabetes phone for blood glucose control and compared it with that of the IBGMS.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were able to operate the Internet and to&#xD;
             communicate through a mobile phone using the short message service&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant disease conditions such as symptomatic heart failure, aspartate&#xD;
             aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels more than twice the&#xD;
             normal level, renal disease and creatinine level greater than 1.5 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients were also excluded if they participated in other programs that provided&#xD;
