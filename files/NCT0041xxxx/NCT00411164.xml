  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the analgesic (a drug that relieves pain)&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of OROS hydromorphone HCI (slow release) 8 mg and 16 mg to placebo&#xD;
      (no drug) in patients with osteoarthritis (OA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This was a phase 3, randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on chance),&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, fixed-dose, parallel-group, multicenter study in adult&#xD;
      patients with OA (osteoarthritis) who were unable to consistently control or treat their pain&#xD;
      with nonopioid medications, or who had received an opioid for treatment of pain. Eligible&#xD;
      patients were randomized in an equal ratio to receive 1 of 3 treatments: OROS hydromorphone&#xD;
      HCI (slow release) 8mg, OROS hydromorphone HCI (slow release) 16 mg, or placebo (no drug).&#xD;
      All patients could take acetaminophen (less than or equal to 2000 mg per day) as rescue&#xD;
      medication for osteoarthritic pain. Rescue medication was not permitted during the washout&#xD;
      period or 6 hours before an assessment of effectiveness. The study was comprised of the&#xD;
      following periods: an analgesic (pain reliever) taper and washout period (less than or equal&#xD;
      to 2 weeks), a Titration (increase)Phase (less than or equal to 16 days), a Maintenance Phase&#xD;
      (12 weeks), and a study drug taper period (less than or equal to 1 week). At the end of the&#xD;
      washout period, all patients received OROS hydromorphone HCI (slow release) 8 mg or matching&#xD;
      placebo to be taken once daily. After 1 week, patients were to return to the study site and&#xD;
      receive new supplies of study drug. During the second week of titration (increase), patients&#xD;
      randomized to the OROS hydromorphone (slow release) 16 mg group had their dose increased from&#xD;
      8 mg daily to 16 mg daily of OROS hydromorphone (slow release). No dose adjustments were&#xD;
      allowed. After completing the Maintenance Phase or upon early termination, study drug was&#xD;
      tapered for up to 1 week as follows: one 8 mg tablet or placebo once daily for the first 2&#xD;
      days then taken every other day as appropriate to taper off the study medication. Safety&#xD;
      assessments of physical examination, vital signs, labs and adverse event reporting were done&#xD;
      at baseline, termination throughout the study. The primary measurement was the time-interval&#xD;
      weighted area under the curve(AUC) divided by the maximum AUC benefit possible for an&#xD;
      individual. The AUC was a measure of cumulative pain intensity differences from baseline for&#xD;
      the Titration and Maintenance phases. At termination, patients were assigned their baseline&#xD;
      pain value for the remainder of the trial, baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) or the&#xD;
      last available pain value for the remainder of the trial, last observation carried forward&#xD;
      (LOCF). Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) overall index score,&#xD;
      physical function, joint stiffness subscales were analyzed using the AUC ratio and change&#xD;
      from baseline using no imputation, and the baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) and&#xD;
      last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation methods. The medical outcome study (MOS)&#xD;
      sleep scale was also analyzed per protocol. OROS hydromorphone (slow release) 8 mg and 16 mg&#xD;
      tablets and placebo taken orally once daily for 17 weeks&#xD;
