      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some&#xD;
      block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill&#xD;
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving gemcitabine and bevacizumab&#xD;
      after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of gemcitabine and bevacizumab&#xD;
      and to see how well they work in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has been&#xD;
      completely removed by surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety of adjuvant, fixed-dose rate gemcitabine hydrochloride and&#xD;
           bevacizumab in patients with completely resected pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the 1-year disease-free survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the 1- and 2-year overall survival rates in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the median disease-free survival rate in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the median overall survival rate in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 100 minutes followed by bevacizumab* IV&#xD;
      over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in&#xD;
      the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *The first dose of bevacizumab is not administered until after 6 weeks have passed&#xD;
      since surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
