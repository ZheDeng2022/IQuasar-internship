    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of an experimental vaccine can protect people from&#xD;
      malaria and study its effects. Malaria, which affects many people in Mali and other countries&#xD;
      in Africa, is caused by germs spread by mosquito bites. In Mali, the disease is the leading&#xD;
      cause of death. Researchers at the Malaria Research and Training Center at the University of&#xD;
      Bamako are working with NIH to develop an experimental vaccine against the disease. The&#xD;
      vaccine, called AMA1-C1Alhydrogel (or AMA1-C1), contains a small part of the malaria-causing&#xD;
      germ. CPG-7909 is a product to improve the body's reactions to vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 18 to 45 who are in good health, who live in Don gu bougou, Mali, and plan to&#xD;
      stay there for the study duration, and who are not pregnant or breast feeding may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. There will be 24 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At an initial evaluation of 2 to 3 hours, patients will have a physical examination and&#xD;
      undergo blood and urine tests regarding the blood, kidneys, and liver. During the study,&#xD;
      patients will receive two injections of one of the two experimental malaria vaccines.&#xD;
      Injections of the same vaccine each time, 4 weeks apart, are given in an arm muscle. Patients&#xD;
      will receive either AMA1-C1 or AMA1-C1 with CPG-7909 but will not know which of the vaccines&#xD;
      they receive until the study's end. After each injection, patients will stay in the clinic&#xD;
      for 30 minutes for observation. They will return after 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 days to be examined&#xD;
      and report how they are feeling. Blood and urine samples will be collected at some visits.&#xD;
      Each clinic visit takes 1 to 2 hours. If for some reason a patient receives only one&#xD;
      injection, he or she will be asked to return to the clinic for routine visits until the&#xD;
      study's end. After the first 2 months, patients will return to the clinic once a month for 30&#xD;
      weeks. In that period, 12 blood samples will be taken. Researchers want to be sure that the&#xD;
      vaccine is not harmful as well as to measure the vaccine's effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks in this study include pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site; fever; and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal problems. Some people have had a temporary decrease in white blood cells&#xD;
      after receiving the vaccine. There is a small chance of a severe allergic reaction. However,&#xD;
      researchers will closely watch patients immediately after each injection and will give&#xD;
      treatment if a serious reaction occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive 75 kilos of rice and 75 kilos of millet (165 lb. of ...&#xD;

    <textblock>
      AMA1-C1 + CPG 7909 is a blood stage malaria vaccine candidate. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      Phase 1 study is to evaluate safety and reactogenicity of the vaccine in semi-immune adults&#xD;
      in Mali. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine. The study is&#xD;
      a double blind Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy adult volunteers. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      screened and 24 participants will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the two groups:&#xD;
      12 volunteers will receive two doses of 80 microgram AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel + 500 microgram CPG;&#xD;
      12 volunteers will receive 80 microgram AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel, both at a 1-month dosing&#xD;
      interval. Safety outcome measures are local and systemic (including laboratory) adverse&#xD;
      events. Immune responses to vaccination will be measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay&#xD;
      (ELISA) and growth inhibition assay (GIA), and will be compared between groups. Peripheral&#xD;
      blood lymphocytes will be assayed for the presence of AMA-1-specific memory B cells and for&#xD;
      the total number of memory B cells.&#xD;
