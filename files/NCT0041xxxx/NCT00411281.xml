      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of abnormal cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;
      Giving low-doses of cytarabine may be an effective treatment for Down syndrome and transient&#xD;
      myeloproliferative disorder. Sometimes the disease may not need treatment until it&#xD;
      progresses. In this case, observation may be sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase III trial is studying low-dose cytarabine to see how well it works in&#xD;
      treating infants with Down syndrome and transient myeloproliferative disorder.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether very low-dose cytarabine can improve event-free survival (EFS) rates&#xD;
           in infants with high-risk transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD), using high-risk&#xD;
           TMD patients from clinical trial COG-A2971 for historic comparison, and in infants with&#xD;
           intermediate-risk TMD, using intermediate-risk TMD patients from clinical trial&#xD;
           COG-A2971 for historic comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintain the current high overall EFS rate in low-risk TMD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter, crossover study. Patients are stratified&#xD;
      according to disease risk (high or intermediate vs low).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I (patients with high- or intermediate-risk transient myeloproliferative disorder&#xD;
           [TMD]): Patients receive very low-dose cytarabine subcutaneously twice daily on days&#xD;
           1-7. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
           progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable disease or complete or&#xD;
           hepatic clinical remission undergo observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group II (patients with low-risk TMD): Patients are observed. If symptoms of&#xD;
           intermediate- or high-risk disease develop, patients may crossover to group I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
