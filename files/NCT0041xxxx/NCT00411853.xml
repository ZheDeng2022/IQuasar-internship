    <textblock>
      We propose in this study to treat hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) patients., with a&#xD;
      novel preparation of fermented wheat germ nutriment (FWGE), in combination with the 1st line&#xD;
      hormone therapy, the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), which stopped being effective.&#xD;
      The study will be conducted during two years with 60 patients. The efficacy will be assessed&#xD;
      in terms of clinical and serological response and by specific questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This concept is based on previous reports regarding other diseases such as colon cancer,&#xD;
      where the addition of a new drug to a drug which previously had failed, improved the&#xD;
      patients' survival, the quality of life and the clinical parameters. In addition, preclinical&#xD;
      data have shown activity of that regimen in prostate cancer cell lines and in animals'&#xD;
      models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FWGE exhibits a wide variety of mode of actions, in a wide range of malignant tumors. It&#xD;
      increased the natural immune responses while decreasing the systemic inflammation often&#xD;
      present in cancer patients. It reduced the growth of human prostate tumor xenograft in mice&#xD;
      and prolonged their survival. It delayed disease progression, increased overall survivals,&#xD;
      improve quality of life and reduce oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this research is that the addition of FWGE to a drug which previously&#xD;
      had failed, would slow down disease progression in patients with advanced and thus refractory&#xD;
      cancers, improving the patients' quality of life, their clinical parameters and survival.&#xD;

      Background and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The challenge:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prostate cancer is a major worldwide health problem and is the most frequently diagnosed&#xD;
           malignancy in men today. In the United States prostate cancer is the most common&#xD;
           malignancy found in men accounting for more than 29% of all diagnosed cancer and&#xD;
           approximately 13% of all cancer deaths. Nearly one in six men will be diagnosed with the&#xD;
           disease at some time in their lives. In 2003 alone, an estimated 221,000 men in the&#xD;
           United States were diagnosed with prostate cancer. In 1999, 37,000 deaths were&#xD;
           attributed to prostate cancer in the United States, and in 2003 more than 28,000 died of&#xD;
           the disease. Hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) is one of the most aggressive&#xD;
           cancers. It is the second ranking cause of cancer-related deaths. Patients with&#xD;
           localized disease have the option of radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy as&#xD;
           definitive treatment modalities for curing the disease. However the cancer recurs in its&#xD;
           metastatic form in 20-30% of these patients. In addition, approximately 10 % of patients&#xD;
           diagnosed with the disease already have distant metastases, making localized therapy&#xD;
           irrelevant. The primary treatment for the advanced state of prostate cancer is androgen&#xD;
           deprivation therapy, to inhibit the testosterone production that facilitates prostate&#xD;
           tumor growth. Androgen deprivation therapy is administered either by surgical castration&#xD;
           or by medications that block testosterone production. While this treatment is effective&#xD;
           in 85%-95% of patients, the response time lasts approximately for 12 -24 months, after&#xD;
           which the cancer progresses to its androgen-insensitive stage. The androgen independent&#xD;
           prostate cancer cells progress to metastatic disease. Limited treatment options exist&#xD;
           for the hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) patient, and median survival time&#xD;
           rarely exceeds one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once androgen independence has occurred, conventional chemotherapy for the treatment of&#xD;
           metastatic cancer has shown limited activity in patients in addition to causing toxic&#xD;
           side effects. While new chemotherapeutic regimens and hormonal agents are being tested,&#xD;
           the survival and quality of life of these HRPC patients remains low.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The innovation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to treat progressing HRPC patients with a novel combination of 1st line of hormone&#xD;
      therapy (GnRH analogues) with the non-toxic dietary supplement fermented wheat germ nutriment&#xD;
      (FWGE). This suggestion is based on preclinical data showing activity of the regimen in&#xD;
      prostate cancer cell lines and in animal models. Furthermore, there are previous reports&#xD;
      regarding other diseases such as colon cancer, where the addition of a new treatment to a&#xD;
      therapy which had previously failed, improved patient survival, quality of life and the&#xD;
      clinical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristics of Fermented wheat germ extract (FWGE) Fermented wheat germ extract with&#xD;
      a standardized complex mixture of molecules is termed FWGE. The product is manufactured under&#xD;
      GMP conditions, and is available as a water-soluble granulate, which administered orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The compound is approved as a medical food for cancer patients. It has been recently&#xD;
      classified in the US as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe), and is used for complementing&#xD;
      the standard anticancer treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The molecular targets of FWGE include poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), major&#xD;
      histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, transketolase (TK), ribonucleotide reductase (RNR)&#xD;
      and, intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) 1. By activating the caspase-3 downstream&#xD;
      proteases, FWGE treatment results in cleavage of PARP thus, preventing DNA repair in cancer&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FWGE treatment decreases major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) in cancer cells.&#xD;
      MHC-I down regulation in cancer cells leads to an increased natural killer (NK) cells'&#xD;
      activity. NK cells are considered as the first line of anticancer immune defense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TK is the key enzyme of the reductive pentose cycle. In cancer cells this cycle is&#xD;
      responsible for supplying these cells' increased need for ribose molecules necessary for&#xD;
      synthesis the sugar chains of the nucleic acids. RNR enzymes, which are strongly inhibited by&#xD;
      FWGE, catalyze the synthesis of the DNA components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been known that a tumor can not grow bigger than 2 mm in diameter except if it is able&#xD;
      to synthesize its own blood vessels (angiogenesis process). The blood vessels in tumors lack&#xD;
      the protein ICAM-1, which is responsible for facilitating the transfer of anticancer immune&#xD;
      cells (e. g. macrophages) via the vessels' walls into the tumor. FWGE treatment increases the&#xD;
      synthesis of ICAM-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, FWGE has a wide therapeutic window: In order to observe any toxicity (effects on&#xD;
      normal cells), more than 50 times higher dosage of FWGE than the recommended one for therapy&#xD;
      is needed. This very positive toxicity profile gives a wide therapeutic window for the&#xD;
      applicability of this product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has also been shown that FWGE is a strong but, non-selective inhibitor of the&#xD;
      cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 thus, this preparation has an anti-inflammatory activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preparation has also been shown to induce apoptosis in gastric carcinoma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advantages of FWGE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The FWGE preparation is non-toxic and safe. This serves as a major consideration in its&#xD;
           selection for the treatment of advanced cancer patients who suffer from low performance&#xD;
           status and consequently have a poor quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FWGE is orally administrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The FWGE preparation exhibits a wide variety of mode of actions, in a wide range of&#xD;
           malignant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The product is able to increase the natural immune responses, while decreasing the&#xD;
           systemic inflammation often present in the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is anticipated that FWGE, by complementing therapeutic efficacy of the standard&#xD;
           hormonal anticancer treatments, could suppress disease progression, thus prolonging&#xD;
           patients' survival and improving quality of life parameters.&#xD;
