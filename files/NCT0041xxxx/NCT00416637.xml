  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some find tumor cells and kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Others&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab may also stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor .&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well bevacizumab works in treating patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether anti-vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) treatment comprising&#xD;
           bevacizumab causes changes in endothelial cell function, as measured by brachial&#xD;
           reactivity, and changes in nitric oxide (NOx), as measured by plasma/urinary/exhaled NOx&#xD;
           levels, in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether anti-VEGF-related changes in blood pressure correlate with changes in&#xD;
           brachial reactivity and NOx levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate anti-angiogenic effects of bevacizumab in neovascular tissue in the wound&#xD;
           angiogenesis model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate inhibition of wound angiogenesis with changes in VEGF-receptor 2&#xD;
           phosphorylation status and changes in NOx synthase expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the mean and associated variability of other plasma and urine markers known to&#xD;
           be associated with vascular reactivity, endothelial function, and/or tumor angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe, preliminarily, whether these changes correlate with changes in blood pressure,&#xD;
           brachial reactivity, NOx levels, or wound angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29. After the&#xD;
      third dose of bevacizumab, patients may receive additional bevacizumab in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
