      This research study will examine whether magnetic or electrical stimulation of the brain can&#xD;
      improve the involuntary closure of the eyelids in patients with blepharospasm or Meige&#xD;
      syndrome; conditions that belong to a group of neurological disorders called dystonias.&#xD;
      Blepharospasm and Meige syndrome cause excessive involuntary closure of the eyelids or&#xD;
      blinking. In an earlier study of patients with writer's cramp, which is another form of&#xD;
      dystonia, symptoms improved temporarily with brain stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested people 18 years of age or older with blepharospasm or Meige syndrome may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination&#xD;
      and a blink reflex test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo brain stimulation and evaluations before and after the stimulation to&#xD;
      test the response, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): A wire coil is held on the patient's scalp. A&#xD;
           brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that&#xD;
           stimulates the brain. The subject hears a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the&#xD;
           skin under the coil. There may be a twitch in the muscles of the face, arm or leg. The&#xD;
           subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions.&#xD;
           The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with small metal disk electrodes taped to&#xD;
           the skin of the arms or legs. TMS is done on eight of the ten test days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repetitive TMS (rTMS): The same procedure as TMS, except repeated magnetic pulses are&#xD;
           delivered in short bursts. RTMS is done on eight of the ten test days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Theta burst stimulation (TBS): A form of rTMS that involves short bursts of impulses.&#xD;
           TBS is done on four study days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cathodal transcranial DC stimulation (tDCS): Two conductive-rubber electrodes placed in&#xD;
           saline-soaked sponges are positioned over two areas of the head. A constant weak&#xD;
           electrical current flow is applied for 20 minutes. tDCS is done on two study days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physician observation: The subject's eyes are videotaped for 5 minutes before and after&#xD;
           each TMS session. A physician then counts how many times the subject blinked during the&#xD;
           5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire: Subjects are asked to rate their symptoms before and after brain&#xD;
           stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrophysiological test of the blink reflex: Wires are taped to the skin on the nose&#xD;
           and temple to record the eye movement during blinking. A thin plastic rod is placed on&#xD;
           the skin over the right e...&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Blepharospasm (BSP) is a common form of focal dystonia, but the etiology and&#xD;
      underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still obscure. BSP is characterized by excessive&#xD;
      involuntary closure of the eyelids. Pathological changes in excitability in the primary motor&#xD;
      cortex (MC) and secondary motor areas, such as the anterior cingulate (AC), pre-and&#xD;
      supplementary cortex (PMC, SMA) are suggested from electrophysiological and brain imaging&#xD;
      studies. It is conceivable that modulation of excitability in some of these areas may lead to&#xD;
      amelioration of the symptoms of BSP. Cortical excitability can be experimentally changed by&#xD;
      various well-established electrophysiological techniques non-invasively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: In this pilot protocol, studying 30 patients with BSP, we will use repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the AC, PMC, SMA and MC in two different&#xD;
      inhibitory modes: low frequency rTMS ((lf) rTMS) and continuous theta burst stimulation cTBS.&#xD;
      Furthermore, we will apply transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) in an inhibitory mode&#xD;
      (cathodal tDCS) over the MC and low intensity high frequency supraorbital electrical&#xD;
      stimulation; the latter will be performed in patients and in 7 healthy subjects. The effects&#xD;
      on blepharospasm will be objectively measured by electrophysiological measures (blink reflex&#xD;
      recovery curve (BRR), blink rate observation by an investigator blinded to the intervention,&#xD;
      and a subjective rating by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: We hypothesize that we will find variable amounts of clinical improvement in BSP&#xD;
      patients with these different methods. With this study, we aim to get more insight to the&#xD;
      underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of BSP and identify which method of non-invasive&#xD;
      brain stimulation may be clinically most efficacious.&#xD;
