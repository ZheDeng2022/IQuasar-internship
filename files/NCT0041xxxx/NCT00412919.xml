  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II trial evaluating the overall response rate, safety and tolerability to&#xD;
      azacitidine in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease with an annual incidence of 14,000 new cases in&#xD;
      the US alone. Despite initial sensitivity to corticosteroids, chemotherapy and radiotherapy,&#xD;
      relapse is inevitable and there is a median survival of only 2.5 to 3 years. The use of&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) has improved the duration of disease remission for&#xD;
      younger patients but still only results in a median survival of 5 - 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the early 1970s, azacitidine has been investigated for the treatment of acute leukemia.&#xD;
      More recently it has been investigated in the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome (a pre-leukaemic condition). It has been shown to prolong the time to development of&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or death and has now been approved for use in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azacitidine is a cytotoxic drug and is directly toxic to cells, preventing their reproduction&#xD;
      or growth. It is also able to cause cells to undergo the process whereby they mature into&#xD;
      normal cells. The Myeloma Research Group at The Alfred Hospital has looked at the effect of&#xD;
      azacitidine on human myeloma cell lines in the laboratory. Azacitidine was found to prevent&#xD;
      both cell growth and causes cell death. In mouse models with multiple myeloma azacitidine&#xD;
      prolonged their survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of azacitidine in treating&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma. The other aims of this study are to see whether treating&#xD;
      patients with azacitidine extends the time that their myeloma is under control, to determine&#xD;
      the number of cycles of azacitidine required to first achieve a response and to determine how&#xD;
      safe and tolerable azacitidine is in treating multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage a total of 14 people will participate in this project. If in this group of&#xD;
      patients azacitidine is shown to be effective as a treatment against multiple myeloma then a&#xD;
      further 10 patients will be invited to participate.&#xD;
