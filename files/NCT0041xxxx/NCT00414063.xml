      This study will examine whether there are differences in energy (calories) losses in stool&#xD;
      and urine between lean and obese people. People gain weight when the amount of calories in&#xD;
      the food they eat is greater than the amount of calories their body uses to support its&#xD;
      functions and activities. The balance between caloric intake and expenditure may be affected&#xD;
      by the amount of calories from food that is not absorbed but is lost in stool and urine. This&#xD;
      study will examine whether differences in food absorption are related to obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 45 years of age with a body mass index (BMI) of&#xD;
      18-25 kg/m2 or less than 35 kg/m2 may be eligible for this 15-day study. Participants are&#xD;
      admitted to the Clinical Research Unit at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental diets with dye marker: Subjects are fed a 2400-calorie diet and a&#xD;
           3400-calorie diet for 3 days each. On the first of the day of each diet, a blue dye&#xD;
           marker is added to the breakfast meal. A red marker is added to the breakfast meal of&#xD;
           the first day after the diet period. Urine is collected beginning after breakfast on the&#xD;
           first day of the diet and until before breakfast on the last day of the diet. Stool&#xD;
           samples are collected during the entire diet period, and until the appearance of the red&#xD;
           dye in the stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour metabolic rate in the respiratory chamber: After the first diet period, subjects&#xD;
           spend 24 hours in a respiratory chamber to measure the number of calories the body burns&#xD;
           a day and to assess the energy balance between intake and expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool sample: Stool samples are collected on days 1 and 2 of the study to look for&#xD;
           parasites or internal bleeding that may affect nutrient absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DXA scanning: This scan uses a low dose of X-rays to measure body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test: For this test for diabetes, an I.V. line (needle attached&#xD;
           to a small plastic tube) is inserted into an arm vein. The subject drinks a sugar&#xD;
           solution. Small blood samples are drawn from the I.V. before the subject drinks the&#xD;
           solution and at five intervals during the 3 (Omega)-hour test period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting blood tests: On the first day of each diet and on the day after each diet is&#xD;
           completed a blood sample is drawn before breakfast to measure hormones that may affect&#xD;
           the ability to absorb food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, some participants may be asked to repeat the experimental diets and&#xD;
      stool and urine collections.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity has risen to epidemic proportions in the world, resulting from both&#xD;
      excessive energy intake and low levels of energy expenditure. The effect of nutrient&#xD;
      absorption on energy balance, that is, the relative amount of nutrients consumed vs. the&#xD;
      amount excreted in stool, has been reported only in small studies in which energy waste in&#xD;
      feces and urine between lean and obese individuals was not found to be different. However,&#xD;
      these studies were limited by small sample sizes and were not specifically designed to&#xD;
      examine whether stool energy loss varied between lean and obese individuals. In addition,&#xD;
      little is known about the reproducibility of the measurements of energy loss in stool and&#xD;
      urine. We propose to investigate (i) whether there are significant differences in energy loss&#xD;
      (as measured in stool and urine) between obese and lean individuals, and (ii) to examine the&#xD;
      reproducibility of these measurements. Because the literature suggests a role for enteric&#xD;
      bacterial flora in obesity, we will also examine differences in such flora between these&#xD;
      groups. We plan to study 25 obese and 25 lean healthy non-smoking Caucasian men age 18 - 45&#xD;
      years old, not taking any medications (including medications for weight loss, antibiotics or&#xD;
      probiotics) for the examination of differences in nutrient energy loss. Of these subjects, 10&#xD;
      lean and 10 obese individuals will be invited to repeat the study to test the reproducibility&#xD;
      of these measurements. All participants will be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit for 15&#xD;
      days. During their stay, subjects will be fed a weight maintaining diet for 3 days, followed&#xD;
      in a random cross-over design by two experimental diets: a 2400 kcal/d or 3400 kcal/d diet&#xD;
      for 3 days. Twenty four-hour urine and feces collections will take place each day of the&#xD;
      experimental diet period. The energy content of these waste products as well as that of the&#xD;
      diet (using duplicate plate analysis) will be measured by bomb calorimetry. Bacterial&#xD;
      components in feces will be extracted by repeated fractional centrifugation to obtain&#xD;
      bacterial mass and by using 16S rDNA-based oligonucleotide probes to obtain bacterial flora.&#xD;
      Primary results will examine the differences in energy loss between lean and obese&#xD;
      individuals as well as the reproducibility of the measurements of stool and urine energy&#xD;
      content.&#xD;
