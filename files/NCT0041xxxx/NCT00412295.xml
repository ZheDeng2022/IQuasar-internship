      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. determine the safety of wavefront guided PRK&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. evaluate the efficacy of wavefront guided PRK&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. evaluate the differences in visual quality after treatment of wavefront guided PRK&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be recruited from those active duty soldiers that have requested&#xD;
             refractive surgery. Subjects must be eligible for medical care at WRAMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, of any race, and at least 21 years old at the time of the&#xD;
             pre-operative examination, and have signed an informed consent. The lower age limit of&#xD;
             21 years is intended to ensure documentation of refractive stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Manifest refractive spherical equivalent (MSE) of up to -6 diopters (D) at the&#xD;
             spectacle plane with refractive cylinder up to 3.00D.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least five images must be capturesd in both eyes (dilated) with a pupil size of at&#xD;
             least 7mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Manifest refraction and LADARWave™ refractions must be within 1.00 D and the&#xD;
             CustomCornea® software must allow for treatment with a 6.5mm minor axis and 9mm&#xD;
             ablation zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Best spectacle corrected visual acuity of 20/20 or better in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrated refractive stability, confirmed by clinical records. Neither the&#xD;
             spherical nor the cylindrical portion of the refraction may have changed more than&#xD;
             0.50D during the 12-month period immediately preceding the baseline examination, sa&#xD;
             confirmed by clinical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Soft contact lens users must have removed their lenses at least 2 weeks before&#xD;
             baseline measurements. Hard contact lens users (PMMA or rigid gas permeable lenses)&#xD;
             must have removed their lenses at least 4 weeks prior to baseline measurements adn&#xD;
             have 2 central Keratometry readings and 2 manifest refractions taken at least 1 week&#xD;
             apart that do not differ by more than 0.50D in either meridian; mires should be&#xD;
             regular.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Located it the greater Washington DC Area for a 12-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exhibits strong motivation for attending the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consent of the subject's command (active duty) to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Access to transportation to meet follow-up requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, breast feeding or intend to become pregnant during&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent topical or systemic medications that may impair healing, including&#xD;
             corticosteriods, antimetabolites, isotretinoin, amiodarone hydrochloride and/ or&#xD;
             sumatripin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical condition(s), which, in the judgement of the investigator, may impair healing,&#xD;
             including but not limited to: collagen vascular diseases and ocular herpes zoster or&#xD;
             simplex.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active ophthalmic disease, neovascularization of the cornea within 1mm of the intended&#xD;
             ablation zone, or clinically significant lens opacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of glaucoma or an intraocular pressure greater than 22mm Hg at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of keratoconus, corneal irregularity, or abnormal videokeratography in either&#xD;
             eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of recurrent erosions or epithelial baewsment dystrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known sensitivity or inappropriate responsiveness to any of the&#xD;
             medications used in the post-operative course.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any physical or mental impairment that would preclude participation in any of the&#xD;
             examinations.&#xD;
