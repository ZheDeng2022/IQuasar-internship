      RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to&#xD;
      the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving radiation&#xD;
      therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known&#xD;
      whether giving radiation therapy after surgery is more effective than no radiation therapy in&#xD;
      treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy to see how well it&#xD;
      works compared to no radiation therapy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      that has been completely removed by surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the disease-free survival of patients with completely resected non-small cell&#xD;
           lung cancer treated with conformal thoracic radiotherapy vs no radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the toxicity, in particular cardiac and pulmonary toxicity, of these regimens&#xD;
           in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the local control in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine patterns of recurrence in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess second cancers in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess prognostic factors and predictive factors of treatment effect on disease-free&#xD;
           survival and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the cost per recurrence-free year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are stratified according to participating center, prior chemotherapy (neoadjuvant&#xD;
      alone vs adjuvant vs none), number of lymph stations involved (0 vs 1 vs ≥ 2), histology&#xD;
      (squamous cell vs other), and use of pretreatment positron emission tomography scans (yes vs&#xD;
      no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Beginning within 4-8 weeks after surgery or 2-6 weeks after chemotherapy,&#xD;
           patients undergo adjuvant thoracic conformal radiotherapy once daily, 5 days per week,&#xD;
           for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients do not undergo adjuvant thoracic radiotherapy. After completion of&#xD;
           study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 700 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
