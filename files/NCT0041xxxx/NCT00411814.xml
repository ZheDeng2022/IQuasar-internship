    <textblock>
      This is a two part study. Part I is designed to test single doses of GSK678586A in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. Part II is designed to test repeat doses (two doses) of GSK679586A in patients&#xD;
      with mild asthma. Both parts are designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and the way&#xD;
      the body absorbs GSK679586A when given by intravenous infusion (through a vein in your arm).&#xD;

             follow-up visit, which ever is later&#xD;
