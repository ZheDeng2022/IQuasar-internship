    <textblock>
      Recently it has been suggested that a restrictive transfusion of units of Red Cells (URC) may&#xD;
      improve the outcome of ICU patients with anemia. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the&#xD;
      transfusion of URC may be deleterious for the hemostatic process of bleeding lesions, which&#xD;
      suggest that a restrictive transfusion may be valuable in patients which gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeding. Transfusion of URC may also increase portal pressure which may be detrimental to&#xD;
      control acute portal hypertensive bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to assess whether a restrictive transfusions may improve the&#xD;
      outcome of patients with acute nonvariceal gastrointestinal bleeding, and also whether such a&#xD;
      restrictive strategy may improve the outcome of bleeding episodes related with portal&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out with a prospective, randomized and controlled design comparing&#xD;
      the restrictive transfusion strategy with the usual nonrestrictive transfusional strategy.&#xD;
      Overall 860 patients will be included; 430 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measure will be survival. All deaths occurred within the 30 days after&#xD;
      admission, will be considered. Secondary outcomes will include rebleeding and complications&#xD;
      related to treatment, and related to the bleeding episode itself. Portal pressure will be&#xD;
      measured to assess the influence of the transfusions strategy on fluctuations of this&#xD;
      parameter, and the relationship with the clinical course of bleeding episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed at the Bleeding Unit of our hospital during a period of 3 years.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the present time there does not exist established criteria to decide when it is necessary&#xD;
      a blood transfusion in a patient with digestive hemorrhage, neither which should be the red&#xD;
      cells concentrates (RBC) amount that the most of the patients will need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical studies made in critical patients undergoing a by-pass coronary surgery, the&#xD;
      strategy of restrictive transfusion showed results similar to the one obtained with more&#xD;
      liberal strategies, even with an improvement of the survival and a smaller rate of&#xD;
      complications related to transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal models of GI bleeding (and also in human studies in the traumatic hemorrhage),&#xD;
      precocious or vigorous transfusion made hemostasia more difficult. Also an increase in the&#xD;
      rate of rebleeding has been observed, suggesting that arterial hypotension combined with&#xD;
      hypovolemia aid hemostasia, stabilize the clot. It leads to diminish by itself the rebleeding&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the same way, in patients with portal hypertension associated hemorrhage, aggressive&#xD;
      replacement of volemia causes increases on the portal pressure, and that could lead in a&#xD;
      condition of bigger difficulty for the control of the hemorrhage and greater rate of&#xD;
      recidiva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, potential complications associated with the transfusion would be seen&#xD;
      potentially reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our randomized prospective study tries to demonstrate that the use of a restrictive strategy&#xD;
      in the sanguineous transfusion in patients with acute GI upper bleeding can be at least as&#xD;
      beneficial than the habitually used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, restricted transfusion in these patients could improve short term survival, as well&#xD;
      as a smaller rate transfusion-related or rebleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In portal hypertension related hemorrhage, restricted transfusion could avoid fluctuations of&#xD;
      portal pressure caused by transfusion during the acute phase of hemorrhage, which could favor&#xD;
      hemostasia in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate if restrictive transfusion criterion in patients with acute&#xD;
      upper GI hemorrhage can maintain the rates of survival obtained using habitual transfusion&#xD;
      criteria, or to even improve them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The more important secondary targets consist in evaluating if these restrictive transfusional&#xD;
      parameters are also accompanied by a better control of the hemorrhage, and also to evaluate&#xD;
      if this is accompanied by a smaller rate of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other additional objectives would be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effect on changes in portal pressure and its correlation with the clinical evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital stay and estimation of economic cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ours is a prospective, randomized and controlled study, in which patients with acute upper GI&#xD;
      bleeding will be randomized into two groups of transfusional RBC treatment with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (of restricted transfusion), that constitutes the training group: they will receive&#xD;
      UCH transfusion when the hemoglobin descends below 70 G/L, to maintain values of hemoglobin&#xD;
      of 70 to 90 G/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (of habitual transfusion), that constitutes the group control: they will receive&#xD;
      transfusion according to habitual practice, when the hemoglobin descends below 90 G/L, to&#xD;
      maintain values of hemoglobin of 90 to 110 G/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be made by means of a closed opaque envelope that will contain the&#xD;
      treatment option that will have been obtained by means of a listing of random numbers&#xD;
      generated by computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized as soon as the inclusion criteria/exclusion has been&#xD;
      verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified according to the origin of the hemorrhage (related to portal&#xD;
      hypertension or not).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF PREDICTED SUBJECTS AND JUSTIFICATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      430 patients in every group will be required (860 altogether), to objective a mortality&#xD;
      reduction of 5%, with a global expected mortality secondary to GI bleeding at the control&#xD;
      group of 10%, with a type I error of 5% and a type II error of 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      280 patients in each group will be required (560 altogether) to objective a difference of 6%,&#xD;
      with the detailed parameters.&#xD;

      An expected period of 3 years to include this&#xD;
