    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a catheter dressing every 7th day is not&#xD;
      inferior to a catheter dressing every 3 days and if Chlorhexidine impregnated sponges are&#xD;
      effective in preventing catheter-related infections in ICUs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central venous catheters (CVCs) are often required for the care of patient admitted to the&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU), and are now indispensable in modern-day medical practice. In the&#xD;
      United States, it is estimated that 15 million CVC days occur each year in the ICU , and that&#xD;
      approximately 80,000 CVC-associated bloodstream infection (BSIs) occur each year [2]. Data&#xD;
      from the NNIS system indicate that approximately 40% of the BSIs are associated with a CVC in&#xD;
      the ICU. This definition, however, include CVC-related BSIs (CRBSIs) and primary BSIs. In&#xD;
      other multicenter surveys, primary BSIs are the leading cause of BSIs (30-35%), followed by&#xD;
      CRBSIs (20-30%), and BSIs originating from pneumonia (20%) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The attributable mortality of CRBSIs remains debated. It ranges from no increase in mortality&#xD;
      in some studies, up to an attributable mortality of 35% in others. In studies adjusting for&#xD;
      severity of illness, attributable mortality ranged between 0 and 11.5%. The excess ICU length&#xD;
      of stay is estimated 9-12 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost of CRBSIs is therefore substantial, and efforts are required to reduce the incidence&#xD;
      of theses infections. Several publications suggested that multiple strategies should be&#xD;
      implemented concomitantly. Besides the critical importance of staff education, technology&#xD;
      brings new materials that could decrease the risk for CRBSI. Several studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that antimicrobial- or antiseptic-impregnated CVCs can decrease CRBSIs in the&#xD;
      ICU setting. Furthermore, cost-benefit analysis have suggested that the use of impregnated&#xD;
      CVCs was beneficial&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent CDC Guidelines for the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections&#xD;
      recommend the use of antimicrobial- or antiseptic-impregnated CVCs in patients whose CVC is&#xD;
      expected to remain in place for more than 5 days, and in ICUs where CRBSI rate remains above&#xD;
      the benchmark rates, despite implementing a comprehensive strategy. This restricted&#xD;
      recommended use is explained by the concern for emergence of resistance, the risk of adverse&#xD;
      effects and the costs of these materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRBSI rates in France could be lower than those observed in the United States. Data from two&#xD;
      surveillance networks indicate that the rates of CRBSI range between 1 and 2 CRBSI per 1000&#xD;
      CVC days . Given these low rates, it is not clear that antimicrobial- or&#xD;
      antiseptic-impregnated CVCs would be cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since most organisms responsible for CRBSI originate from insertion site in short-term CVC,&#xD;
      there was a rationale to try to decrease bacterial colonization at cutaneous insertion site.&#xD;
      Among the other new materials under development, a chlorhexidine-impregnated sponge (Biopatch&#xD;
      TM), to be placed over the site of catheter insertion, has been proposed. In a prospective,&#xD;
      controlled, bicenter, randomized, non blinded study, dressing changes every other day&#xD;
      (control group) was compared to dressing changes every 7 days with Biopatch (Biopatch group)&#xD;
      (Maki and al., ICAAC 2000). 1,401 lines (either CVCs, peripheral arterial catheters or&#xD;
      pulmonary artery catheters) were included in 589 patients. Both groups of patients were&#xD;
      comparable. Using proportional hazard models, both CVC colonization and CRBSI were&#xD;
      significantly reduced in the Biopatch group, from 29% to 16% (HR, 0.62) for catheter&#xD;
      colonization, and from 3.3% to 1.2% (HR, 0.38) for CRBSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study demonstrated a significant reduction of CRBSI using Biopatch. Given the results&#xD;
      presented at the ICAAC sessions, there is some concern, however, about the validity of the&#xD;
      protective effect of the Biopatch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, the intervention group associated Biopatch and the extension of the time between&#xD;
      dressing changes, from 2 to 7 days. Preliminary data from cancer patients suggest that time&#xD;
      between dressing changes could be extended. In a randomized study, Benhamou et al have&#xD;
      recently compared a 4-day to a 15-day catheter-dressing change frequency in children&#xD;
      undergoing chemotherapy. They have shown that skin cultures (27 vs 23%) and bloodstream&#xD;
      infections (11 vs 13%) rates are not different between the 4-day and the 15-day groups. It is&#xD;
      therefore unclear that the reduction of CRBSI observed in the Biopatch group was only due to&#xD;
      the Biopatch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, the control group in the Maki's study did not use a &quot;placebo&quot;, i.e. a sponge not&#xD;
      impregnated with chlorhexidine. The study was therefore not blinded for the ICU staff. It is&#xD;
      strongly recommended to examine the catheter insertion site daily for local inflammatory&#xD;
      signs. Biopatch impede to monitor the insertion site, with a potential for underestimation of&#xD;
      local infections signs in these patients. It is possible that daily examination of the&#xD;
      insertion site in the control group would conduct to remove the CVC more frequently in these&#xD;
      patients, with a potential for higher rate of colonization. In addition, if a study is not&#xD;
      blinded, it is useful for the validity of the results that a group of investigators, blinded&#xD;
      to the randomized group, review the medical chart to classify catheter infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirdly, the rate if CRBSI was rather high in the control group (4.45 per 1000 line days). It&#xD;
      is not certain that the benefit of Biopatch will be the same in ICUs with lower rates of&#xD;
      CRBSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the impact of Biopatch, and the impact of&#xD;
      dressing changes (every 3 or 7 days) on the reduction of CVC infection&#xD;
