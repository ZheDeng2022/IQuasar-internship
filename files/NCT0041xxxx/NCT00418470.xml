  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) need to frequently undergo courses of IV antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy. To avoid a high number of venipunctures peripheral venous catheters (SPVC) or&#xD;
      cannulas are used. Because of the irritant action of the drugs used, SPVC's often do not last&#xD;
      for the whole antibiotic course (usually of two weeks) and the patient has to be punctured&#xD;
      again for the insertion of a new IV line. With the passing of time the veins are more&#xD;
      difficult to be found. An alternative to the use of a cannulas is the surgical insertion of a&#xD;
      central venous catheter. This intervention may have contraindications or, specially in&#xD;
      adolescents, cause unacceptable alterations of the body image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to find a way to prolong the duration of the SPVC used by CF&#xD;
      patients during antibiotic courses avoiding the irritation of the vein or a phlebitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study: randomized controlled trial. The study will see a collaboration of&#xD;
      nurses, physicians and technicians of the Tuscan CF Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients that will participate at the study will be randomly assigned to one of the two&#xD;
      groups: one group will receive the antibiotics prescribed according to the maximal dilution&#xD;
      suggested by the pharmaceutical company, the other will receive a much higher dilution (i.e.&#xD;
      a higher volume of Normal Saline), but the time of administration will be the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment will regard: the level of inflammation of the vein (with a special visual&#xD;
      scale) and the duration of the SPVC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis that is to be proved is that diluting the antibiotic in a higher volume of&#xD;
      Normal Saline it is possible to delay or prevent the irritation of the vein and the onset of&#xD;
      a phlebitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case that the hypothesis will be confirmed by this study an easy, secure, low cost and&#xD;
      immediately available system will be available to reduce the number of venipunctures&#xD;
      necessary to complete a course of IV antibiotics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a common genetic disease which affects, among other organs, the&#xD;
      respiratory tree. The major cause of mortality and morbidity in CF are pulmonary infections&#xD;
      caused by a limited number of bacteria, in particular gram negative bacteria such as&#xD;
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) which cause frequent&#xD;
      clinically acute pulmonary infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current figures show that 57.3% of patient have their lungs infected by PA and 2.9% of them&#xD;
      have their lungs infected by BCC (1). To fight pulmonary exacerbations, patients frequently&#xD;
      have to undergo antibiotic treatments, which often cannot be given orally or by aerosol but&#xD;
      have to be administered intravenously (IV). Some CF Centers have also adopted a treatment&#xD;
      protocol for patients chronically infected by respiratory pathogens in which a prophylactic&#xD;
      IV course of antibiotic is routinely given every 3 months even in the absence of clinical&#xD;
      symptoms of pulmonary exacerbations (2) An IV course of antibiotic treatment should be&#xD;
      continued for at least 10 days but usually it lasts 2 weeks (3). Completing it would&#xD;
      therefore require doing numerous venipunctures to a patient. In the USA, during 2004 some 45%&#xD;
      of patients aged 18 to 30 required at least 1 IV antibiotic course, about 25% 2 IKV course&#xD;
      and 15% 3 courses or more (1). This IV treatment regime brings a relevant burden of pain,&#xD;
      anxiety and a worsening of quality of life (4). In order to reduce the number of&#xD;
      venipunctures needed for an antibiotic course, several intravenous indwelling devices have&#xD;
      been used to administer antibiotic infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of these venous catheters are inserted in a central vessel. Among them, port caths and&#xD;
      Groshong or Broviac type Central catheters, Midline catheters are those most commonly used&#xD;
      (5-9). They are intended to last from several weeks to years. Their insertion requires a&#xD;
      surgical intervention. Such an invasive intervention may not be sometimes indicated due to&#xD;
      the patient's clinical condition. Moreover, the presence of a permanent device may influence&#xD;
      the patients' body image and autonomy, with negative consequences in the psychological&#xD;
      condition of the patient, especially in adolescence (10). Also, systemic infections may occur&#xD;
      (11), the permanent management of the device may result complicated (12-15) and it may&#xD;
      influence the patient's day-to-day life. Recently, a high incidence of thrombosis related to&#xD;
      the insertion of this kind of catheters has been described (16) The most commonly used type&#xD;
      of IV device to administer antibiotics in CF is the short peripheral venous catheter (SPVC)&#xD;
      or cannula (17, 18) which has been considered for long now the simplest, most easy-to-use and&#xD;
      economic way for administering IV therapy in CF. The use of this device allows patients not&#xD;
      to be punctured at every administration and to eventually perform the antibiotic course at&#xD;
      home avoiding hospitalisation and therefore maintaining a relatively normal daily life.&#xD;
      Moreover, compared to the previously described permanent devices, this one is less invasive,&#xD;
      it does not require a surgical intervention to be inserted, and it is intended to be&#xD;
      maintained only for the duration of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to facilitate CF people's autonomy and to reduce the conditioning of their quality&#xD;
      of life, The home administration of IV antibiotic has become increasingly common (17-21). In&#xD;
      2004, 20.1% of US CF patients received home IV treatment (1). Patients themselves and their&#xD;
      relatives are often trained by CF Centers' Nurses on how to manage the administration of the&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typical responsibilities of the CF Center's Nursing Staff is to position the SPVC, to manage&#xD;
      the venous access and the drug infusions, to evaluate the site of the cannula insertion and&#xD;
      the drug administration, and to educate patients on possible complications (21-23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course, patency of the venous access between one antibiotic administration and the&#xD;
      following is achieved by flushing the catheter at the end of each infusion either with normal&#xD;
      saline or with heparin solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the passing of time, SPVC insertion might become increasingly difficult due to the&#xD;
      repeated venous trauma, which may lead to the formation of thrombi and the progressive&#xD;
      occlusion of the vein; (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the particular respiratory pathogens (PA, BCC) affecting CF patients' lungs the doses&#xD;
      of antibiotics are much higher than those administered to non-CF patients with pneumonia.&#xD;
      Even though it sensibly lowers the risk of infectious problems, the IV administration of such&#xD;
      high doses of antibiotics, may irritate the veins' tunica intima and cause a phlebitis which&#xD;
      may occlude the vein and therefore interrupt the vein's patency. Indeed, it is well&#xD;
      established that the infusion of antibiotics and other irritant substances frequently cause&#xD;
      iatrogenic phlebitis (24-28). Other factors have been discussed as risk factors for the onset&#xD;
      of phlebitis and to a short duration of the SPVC (29); among others, the movement of the&#xD;
      patient, his/her age, the type of SPVC, the type of dressing used, the site of insertion (30)&#xD;
      the blood count, (25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The onset of phlebitis oblige healthcare providers to the repositioning of the venous&#xD;
      catheter in another site and to cause to the patient further suffering, pain and anxiety.&#xD;
      Although scarcely investigated, the problem of reducing the amount of venipunctures and pain&#xD;
      in CF patients is clinically important. A recent study by our research group has examined the&#xD;
      recalls of adult CF patients about the invasive procedures received in childhood (31). The&#xD;
      study has evidenced that repeated venipunctures imply an additional worsening of their&#xD;
      quality of life and may influence the CF child future compliance to treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far only a few studies have investigated an effective way to prolong the duration of SPVCs&#xD;
      used without causing a phlebitis, but they are substantially inconclusive (32,33) On the&#xD;
      basis of the existing studies, it can be hypothesised that the volume of fluid in which the&#xD;
      antibiotic is diluted, and consequently its concentration, may affect the veins' tunica&#xD;
      intima irritation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims and Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims at investigating whether a different concentration of the prescribed dose of&#xD;
      antibiotic in the infusate during intravenous administrations influences the inflammation of&#xD;
      the vessels and the consequent duration of SPVCs in patients with CF undergoing antibiotic&#xD;
      courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each antibiotic to be administered IV, the producer, besides the type of infusate,&#xD;
      provides also a suggested maximum concentration or a concentration range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretically it is possible to reduce the vessel's irritation by keeping the quantity of&#xD;
      drug and the time of infusion constant, but diluting the prescribed amount of antibiotic in a&#xD;
      larger volume of infusate, in a given interval of time. This would lead to a smaller number&#xD;
      of drug molecules acting as irritants on the tunica intima.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of the study is to verify the hypothesis that a greater volume of infusate&#xD;
      for constant amounts of drug dose and time, reduces the irritation of the vessel's tunica&#xD;
      intima caused by the antibiotic and allows a longer patency of the vein and a longer use of&#xD;
      the SPVC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare the outcomes of two different concentrations of antibiotic in Normal Saline,&#xD;
      which is the mostly used infusate for IV administration of antibiotics. The type of the&#xD;
      prescribed antibiotic and the time of infusion will stay the same. The CF center specialist&#xD;
      physician will continue to prescribe drugs as usual, according to intern protocols and to&#xD;
      patients' clinical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eventual purpose of the study is to reduce patients' distress and discomfort when they&#xD;
      are obliged to undergo antibiotic treatments which need invasive procedures. Indeed, if the&#xD;
      tested hypothesis would be confirmed, simply increasing the volume of normal saline in which&#xD;
      the antibiotic is diluted would lead to less vein irritation, lower incidence of phlebitis&#xD;
      and a longer permanence of the SPVC used for an IV antibiotic course. This would imply a&#xD;
      reduction of the number of venepunctures needed to complete an IV antibiotic course and a&#xD;
      reduction of patient discomfort and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, if the tested hypothesis would be confirmed, the solution proposed would be immediately&#xD;
      applicable to the clinical practice, since it would not require any authorization process.&#xD;
      Also, it would be of little expense and completely safe, unless any contraindications exists&#xD;
      to the infusion of a higher volume of Normal Saline Besides this, CF Centers' Health Care&#xD;
      Providers might have a simple, safe and relatively low-cost method to prolong the duration on&#xD;
      site of a IV antibiotic course and to reduce the number of venepunctures given to the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently this same group of researchers has carried out an observational study, partially&#xD;
      retrospective and partially prospective (34-36). We studied 87 SPVCs inserted to 36 patients&#xD;
      in 56 IV antibiotic treatment cycles in a period of 6 months (mean duration 8.3 days). It has&#xD;
      been evidenced that the gauge of the SPVC and the number of daily administrations are&#xD;
      significantly correlated to the duration on site of the cannula. In particular, SPVCs with a&#xD;
      larger gauge (G22) had longer mean duration than smaller (G24) SPVCs (9.6 days vs. 7.2 days,&#xD;
      p=0.03) SPVCs used for antibiotic courses in which the antibiotic daily dose was divided into&#xD;
      3 administrations had a longer mean duration (10.3 days) than those used in courses in which&#xD;
      the daily dose was divided into 2 administrations (6.5 days, p=0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to this study, other factors such as patients' age, the brand of the cannula, the&#xD;
      health care professional who inserted the cannula, the site of insertion (dominating or non&#xD;
      dominating arm), and the concurrent administration of oral anti-inflammatory drugs do not&#xD;
      seem to influence the duration of the SPVC on site. The results of the study lead the&#xD;
      researchers to hypothesise that the concentration of the antibiotic infusion i.e. its&#xD;
      dilution might have an impact on the local inflammation of the vessel. Indeed, since each&#xD;
      single administration was administered in the same infusion volume of 100 ml, the patients&#xD;
      who had received the daily antibiotic dose divided in 3 administrations had received the same&#xD;
      daily antibiotic dose diluted in a higher volume of fluids both daily and at each&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group is composed by Nurses, Physician and a Technician with a long experience in&#xD;
      CF research. The group has carried out also other studies aimed at finding ways o that cures&#xD;
      received by patients have as least impact as possible on their quality of life. In particular&#xD;
      the study group's interest has focused on the issue of pain in CF patients (31, 37, 38).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized controlled non-blinded clinical trial. The study will confront the&#xD;
      effect of two different antibiotic concentrations administered IV on the inflammation of vein&#xD;
      and on the duration in situ of the inserted SPVC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assignment of patients to one group or the other will be done by randomization.&#xD;
      Randomization will be launched by a researcher blind in regards to patients. Data analysis&#xD;
      will be done by a researcher blind in regards to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will not influence the usual course of therapeutic treatment chosen by the&#xD;
      specialized physician of the CF center. The only experimental variable will be the&#xD;
      concentration of the dose of antibiotic prescribed by the physician in the infusate, or the&#xD;
      volume of fluids needed to infuse the antibiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the aim of reducing the number of possible confounding variables, age range of the&#xD;
      patients, SPVC gauge and brand, type of dressing, scales used for the evaluation of&#xD;
      irritation and infiltration, type of antibiotics used, time of infusion, number of attempts&#xD;
      for SPVC insertion will be standardized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Authorization by the Ethic Committee of the Meyer Children Hospital has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects included to the study will sign an informed consent and the consent to treat their&#xD;
      personal data. They will receive written information on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed and presented in aggregated form and by no means it will be possible to&#xD;
      retrace the subjects to whom the data refer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects, Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multidisciplinary study with participation of Nurse researchers, and Physician&#xD;
      researchers They will participate in the study according to their own field of professional&#xD;
      competences and legal responsibilities as described in the laws in force in Italy. In&#xD;
      particular, Physicians will make diagnoses and order prescriptions and nurses will administer&#xD;
      therapy, choose and use the most appropriate IV devices according to the clinical condition&#xD;
      of the patient, notice and assess sign and symptoms with the use of validated scales, educate&#xD;
      and instruct the patients on the therapy. Patients recruitment to the study will be done by&#xD;
      the Physician and the Nurse together by assessing the fulfilment of inclusion criteria and by&#xD;
      informing the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Nurses participating in the study will all be in possess of the qualification to practise&#xD;
      the profession and of the graduate degree in Nursing or equivalent and will be instructed by&#xD;
      the principal investigator in regards to the use of the assessment scales used in the study,&#xD;
      the participants' inclusion criteria and the research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be included in the study subjects need to fulfil the following requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, made accordingly to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation&#xD;
           Guideline (Rosenstein BJ. J Pediatr 1998;132: 589-595)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age of 18 years or more and ability to consciously express owns informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have a prescription done by one of the CF Centre specialist Physicians of an IV&#xD;
           antibiotic course of the foreseen duration of 2 weeks, due to a pulmonary exacerbation,&#xD;
           with the association of ceftazidime 3 times daily and tobramycin once daily diluted in&#xD;
           Normal Saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  absence of clinical conditions that contraindicate the administration of 350ml of Normal&#xD;
           Saline in 30 minutes 3 times daily and of 400ml of Normal Saline in 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no simultaneous anti-inflammatory therapy administered orally, IM or IV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 days have passed from the end of the previous course.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the IV course will be given to the subject as an inpatient, and he or she will be&#xD;
           admitted to our hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two experimental groups will have the following treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Ceftazidime will be infused diluted in Normal Saline at the maximum suggested&#xD;
      concentration of 40mg per ml of infusate. Time of infusion: 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Ceftazidime will be infused diluted in Normal Saline at the concentration of 10mg&#xD;
      per ml of infusate. Time of infusion: 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both group Tobramycin will be infused diluted in Normal Saline at the concentration of&#xD;
      1mg per ml of infusate (i.e., one half of the maximum suggested concentration of 1mg per ml&#xD;
      of infusate). Time of infusion: 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured outcomes will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the irritation level of the first vein that is cannulated for the course. The assessment&#xD;
           will be done utilizing the &quot;Phlebitis Scale&quot; of the Standard of Practice of the&#xD;
           Intravenous Nurses Society (39). The Scale is described in the &quot;Clinical Protocol&quot;&#xD;
           Section..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the number of days that the first SPVC used for the treatment course stays in situ&#xD;
           before removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each of the two groups calculation will be done on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of subjects who will score 0 or 1 on the &quot;Phlebitis Scale&quot; for each single day&#xD;
      of observation (1st day, 2nd day… up to the 14th) The mean duration of the first SPVC&#xD;
      inserted for the treatment course&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between proportions will be analysed with the Chi-square test. Differences&#xD;
      between means of in situ durations of SPVCs will be analysed using the Student t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical significance level is established at 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The removal of the first SPVC inserted for the antibiotic course concludes the participation&#xD;
      of the subject to the study. The SPVC will be removed in the following cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the IV course&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the phlebitis level is 2 or more on the &quot;Phlebitis Scale&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the infiltration level is 1 or more on the &quot;Infiltration Scale&quot; of the Standard of&#xD;
           Practice of the Intravenous Nurses Society (39). The Scale is described in the &quot;Clinical&#xD;
           Protocol&quot; Section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If pain is rated 3 or more on a numeric pain scale from 0 to 10 (40). If the subject&#xD;
           needs to prolong the antibiotic therapy for more than 14 days the participation of the&#xD;
           subject to the study will be over after the 14th day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same subject can be readmitted to the study if 30 days have passed from the end of the&#xD;
      previous course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject is a drop-out if&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  He or she asks to remove the SPVC or takes it away autonomously or decides to refuse&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient starts having contraindications to the volume of Normal Saline infused&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient starts taking anti-inflammatory drugs orally or IM or IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient refuses the prescribed therapy for more than 3 administrations or for 2&#xD;
           consecutive administrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One or both prescribed antibiotics are modified by the specialized physician of the CF&#xD;
           Centre because of changed clinical conditions of the subject; modification of the dose&#xD;
           of ceftazidime or tobramycin does not interrupt the participation to the study if the&#xD;
           concentration of the infusate remains the same. If this is the case the volume of Normal&#xD;
           Saline will be changed according to the new dose subscribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The SPVC is used for taking a blood sample or for the injection of any drug other than&#xD;
           ceftazidime and tobramycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The prescribed concentration is not respected, even if this happens only one time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data on the level of inflammation of the vein taken up to the moment of drop out will be&#xD;
      included in the analysis according to the intention to treat. The duration of the SPVC will&#xD;
      not be taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining the sample numerosity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CF Center of Tuscany takes care of 191 patients. 78 patients (41%) are adults and&#xD;
      potentially recruitable for the study. All patients of the Tuscan Regional CF Center are seen&#xD;
      in the Outpatients clinic regularly to evaluate clinical status and microbiology of&#xD;
      respiratory tract secretions. According to the data found with the preliminary study done by&#xD;
      this same group of research (34), the antibiotic courses that match the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      for this study in one year will be about 50 in the Tuscan CF Centre of Florence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the numerosity of the sample for the t-test on the differences between means of&#xD;
      SPVC durations, we fixed a power of the trial of 0.8. In the absence of reference measures,&#xD;
      we hypothesise a minimum expected difference between the SPVC duration in the two&#xD;
      experimental groups equal to that found in the preliminary study carried out by this research&#xD;
      group (34) between patients who were given IV antibiotics 2 times a day and those who&#xD;
      received them 3 times a day, that is, 3.8 days. Also, we hypothesize a standard deviation&#xD;
      within each group equal to that found in the two groups of the preliminary study, that is, 5.&#xD;
      On the basis of these expected values, the numerosity of the two experimental groups was&#xD;
      determined in 30 for each group. Such number will be increased of a number of subjects equal&#xD;
      to the number of drop-outs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simple randomization method will be utilized. One of the participants of the research group&#xD;
      will do the randomization and will have no other role in the study. He will be blind&#xD;
      concerning patients and will not know neither their identity nor their clinical status. Every&#xD;
      time that a patient will be recruited into the study by the researchers, the Physician and&#xD;
      the Nurse that have done the recruitment will contact the researcher responsible for the&#xD;
      randomization to communicate that a new patient has been included without giving any&#xD;
      information on the patient. The person responsible for randomization will flip a 50 cent Euro&#xD;
      coin into the air and will communicate the result. The recto of the coin (the one indicating&#xD;
      the coin value) means inclusion into the Group A. The verso of the coin (the one with the&#xD;
      national insign) means inclusion into the Group B. The person responsible for randomization&#xD;
      will be reachable by telephone on a dedicated mobile phone during all the CF Center opening&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will end when both groups will have reached the numerosity established a priori,&#xD;
      plus the number of drop-outs.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Clinical protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of patients In occasion of a patient's visit to the CF Center Outpatient Clinic,&#xD;
      the Physician decides, on the basis of the clinical conditions of patient, of laboratory&#xD;
      tests, of results of sputum culture and other instrumental and imaging diagnostic tests,&#xD;
      whether he or she needs an antibiotic treatment, of what type and by which way of&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the physician decides to prescribe an antibiotic, the inclusion criteria are verified. If&#xD;
      all the criteria are satisfied, the subject is eligible for the inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be invited to participate to the study and will be given the necessary&#xD;
      information. After answering to all his/her questions, if the patient accepts the inclusion,&#xD;
      the Physician and the Nurse will collect his/her written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently the Nurse will call the researcher in charge of randomisation and will ask him&#xD;
      the group to which the patient is assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the Nurse will collect the initial data of the patient in the recruitment form.&#xD;
      Then he will insert the SPVC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Way of administration of treatment To administer the treatment only Gauge 22 SPVCs Intima BD&#xD;
      will be used. Before the insertion of SPVC the use of a local anaesthetic cream will be&#xD;
      proposed to the patient, if not clinically contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before insertion, the insertion site will be disinfected with Amukine 5% solution. Skin hair&#xD;
      will not be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the insertion the SPVC will be fixed to the skin with a sterile transparent dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dressing will not be changed or taken away during the experimentation in order to avoid&#xD;
      displacement of the cannula. The SPVC will be closed with a needleless lock cap for all&#xD;
      assessed subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each infusion will be administered during a total of 70 minutes: 30 minutes for the&#xD;
      ceftazidime and 40 minutes for the tobramycin. There will be no flushing between the first&#xD;
      and the second antibiotic. At the end of each infusion, the cannula will be flushed with 1.5&#xD;
      ml of a heparin solution (25 U/ml in Normal Saline). During the experimentation the SPVC&#xD;
      cannot be used for any other therapy nor for the taking of blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of the concentrations as for the research protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1 indicates the dilutions to be prepared for each single administration of ceftazidime,&#xD;
      according to the prescribed dose Group A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2000 mg.... 50 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2500 mg.... 62,5 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3000 mg.... 75 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2000 mg.... 200 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2500 mg.... 250 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3000 mg.... 300 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 2 shows the dilution to prepare for every single administration of tobramycin,&#xD;
      according to the prescribed dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  150 mg.... 75 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  200 mg.... 100 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  250 mg.... 125 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  300 mg.... 150 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  350 mg.... 175 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  400 mg.... 200 ml&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to facilitate the preparation of the antibiotics to infuse according to the&#xD;
      concentrations shown by the research protocol, a pharmaceutical company will prepare Normal&#xD;
      Saline bottles prefilled with the volumes needed for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the moment of recruitment in the study the following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age and sex, FEV1 (percentage of the predicted), body mass index, PCR, microorganism in the&#xD;
      sputum culture, number of attempts needed to insert the SPVC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every day, before the IV midday administration a researcher will assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The state of irritation of the vein in which the SPVC is inserted, using the &quot;Phlebitis&#xD;
           scale&quot; of the Standard of Practice of the Intravenous Nurses Society (39), as follows&#xD;
           Grade Clinical Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 0.... No symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 1.... Erythema at access site with or without pain&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 2.... Pain at access site with erythema and/or edema&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 3.... Pain at access site with erythema and/or edema. Streak formation.&#xD;
                Palpable venous cord&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 4.... Pain at access site with erythema and/or edema. Streak formation.&#xD;
                Palpable venous cord &gt;1 inch in length. Purulent drainage&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The state of infiltration of the vein in which the SPVC is inserted, using the&#xD;
           &quot;Infiltration scale&quot; of the Standard of Practice of the Intravenous Nurses Society (39)&#xD;
           As follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 0.... No symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 1.... Skin blanched, edema &lt;1 inch in any direction, cool to touch, with or&#xD;
                without pain&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 2.... Skin blanched, edema 1-6 inches in any direction; cool to touch; with&#xD;
                or without pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 3.... Skin blanched, translucent; gross edema &gt;6 inch in any direction; cool&#xD;
                to touch; mild-moderate pain; possible numbness.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 4.... Skin blanched, translucent; skin tight, leaking, skin discoloured,&#xD;
                bruised, swollen; gross edema &gt;6 inch in any direction; deep pitting tissue edema;&#xD;
                circulatory impairment; moderate-severe pain;infiltration of any amount of blood&#xD;
                product, irritant, or vesicant&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The pain experienced locally by the patient using the numeric pain scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Adverse events, the physical activity performed and any other event related to the&#xD;
           antibiotic course which may have occurred in the previous 24 hours, as described by the&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will ascertain, with questions and other checks, that in the previous 24 hours&#xD;
      the dilution provided in the research protocol has been respected and that no violations of&#xD;
      the protocol have occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In rare cases, patients who have started the course as inpatients may continue it at their&#xD;
      home, as described before (23). In these cases patients will be given a high resolution&#xD;
      mobile videophone. The researcher will phone to the patient, will interview him and will&#xD;
      assess the insertion site using the videophone. The validity of this kind of distance&#xD;
      evaluation has been recently showed by a study performed on leg ulcers (41).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the assessor scores the insertion site 2 or more in the &quot;Phlebitis Scale&quot;, or 1 or more in&#xD;
      the &quot;Infiltration scale&quot;, or the patient reports a local pain of 3 or more in the pain&#xD;
      numeric rating scale, the SPVC is removed and the observation of the subject in the study&#xD;
      ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality controls&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 4 months the Principal Investigator will verify the number of recruited patients and of&#xD;
      the quality of collected data, analysing all the daily assessment forms. In case of drop-outs&#xD;
      the number of patients to be recruited will be increased by an equal number of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 8 months the Principal Investigator will retrain all the collaborators involved in the&#xD;
      study in particular with regard to: recruiting, vein cannulation, knowledge of the research&#xD;
      protocol, preparation of antibiotic dilutions, use of scales, training of patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this research we will not use any method or drug which deviate from the normal clinical&#xD;
      practice; we will apply usual operational procedures for prevention of Clinical Risk approved&#xD;
      for the Hospital by the Local Committee for Patient Safety and Clinical Risk Management, as&#xD;
      provided by the Tuscan Regional Government Decree n. 1387/2004). Also, the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator is a member of such Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events relating to the participation to the study will be constantly monitored. A&#xD;
      member of the study group will be always reachable by phone by patients for any problem that&#xD;
      may occur during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be stored in a Microsoft Access 2000 database. Statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed by an independent free-lance Statistician, not belonging to the Researchers'&#xD;
      Institution.&#xD;
