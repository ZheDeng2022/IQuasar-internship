  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic chemotherapy for metastatic colon cancer is often used in the neoadjuvant setting&#xD;
      for patients undergoing liver resection. This treatment is given either to keep the tumor at&#xD;
      bay or reduce its size before the time of resection. While many metastatic tumors might&#xD;
      appear to respond well and even radiographically disappear following neoadjuvant therapy, it&#xD;
      is unclear whether grossly or radiographically negative areas of previous disease are&#xD;
      microscopically free of tumor cells. As such, when possible, resection boarders typically&#xD;
      follow 1 cm margins from the tumor size prior to neoadjuvant therapy. These margins might be&#xD;
      necessary to encompass all histologically present disease or they might be unnecessarily&#xD;
      large, serving only to increase the mortality and morbidity of the operation. This study&#xD;
      begins to address this question by a histological examination of the pattern of cell death in&#xD;
      areas of metastases removed after neoadjuvant therapy. Furthermore, clinical cases in which&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy allowed for resection of previously unresectable cancer will be examined&#xD;
      to determine whether there is an increased rate of recurrence despite &quot;negative&quot; resection&#xD;
      boundaries in these cases.&#xD;
