      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs or substances to keep cancer from&#xD;
      forming, growing, or coming back. The use of lycopene, a substance found in tomatoes, may&#xD;
      keep prostate cancer from forming in patients at high risk of developing prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lycopene in&#xD;
      preventing prostate cancer in patients who are at high risk of developing prostate cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the toxicity and safety of lycopene administered as a food-based delivery system&#xD;
           as a chemoprevention agent in patients who are at a high risk of developing prostate&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution in patients receiving this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize surrogate endpoint biomarkers (SEBs) in the peripheral blood, buccal&#xD;
           mucosa, and the prostate itself, which will provide evidence of biological activity&#xD;
           relevant to a chemoprevention effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Characterize the oxidative stress state of the individual by studies of DNA&#xD;
                oxidation in the prostate and buccal mucosa, as well as DNA oxidation and lipid&#xD;
                peroxidation within the peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Define the effects of lycopene through a food delivery system on prostate histology&#xD;
                (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia), markers of cellular proliferation [PCNA],&#xD;
                and apoptosis in the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluate the effects of lycopene on the serum levels of total prostate-specific&#xD;
                antigen (PSA), free PSA, and PSA density.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide the basic knowledge in reference to toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and SEBs needed&#xD;
           to proceed to a large phase II or III lycopene study in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral lycopene in tomato paste and olive oil, once, twice, or three times&#xD;
      daily for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of lycopene until the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients&#xD;
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo buccal scrapings and blood collection periodically during study for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and biomarker studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
