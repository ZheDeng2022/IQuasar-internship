  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will quantify the intraocular pressure elevation in the immediate time period&#xD;
      following intravitreous injection. With more widespread use of intravitreous injections in&#xD;
      patients that may require several injections per year, it is important to document the sudden&#xD;
      increase in intraocular pressure, including the maximum intraocular pressure and the time&#xD;
      required for the intraocular pressure to return to baseline. This data may be useful in&#xD;
      stimulating additional studies to evaluate the long term ocular effects of repeated&#xD;
      intravitreous injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the intraocular pressure increases significantly following intravitreous&#xD;
      injection and then returns to baseline during the initial thirty minutes following&#xD;
      ranibizumab injection.&#xD;

      We will assess the trend of intraocular pressure immediately following intravitreal injection&#xD;
      of ranibizumab 0.5 mg (0.05 mL) by taking serial intraocular pressure readings every five&#xD;
      minutes for thirty minutes after injection. This study is a prospective descriptive data&#xD;
      collection consisting of measuring intraocular pressure immediately following intraocular&#xD;
      injection, and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes following injection of ranibizumab 0.5&#xD;
      mg.&#xD;
