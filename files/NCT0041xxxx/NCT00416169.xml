  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and tolerability and the efficacy of&#xD;
      galantamine treatment in subjects with Pick Complex/ Frontotemporal Dementia (PC/FTD). The&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of galantamine therapy will be assessed over the entire treatment&#xD;
      period (26 weeks). The 8 week withdrawal period will be used to confirm the safety of&#xD;
      galantamine withdrawal in this subject group and it impact on any symptom improvement&#xD;
      achieved during the first 18 weeks of galantamine treatment ( symptom improvement would be&#xD;
      expected to stabilize or decline on withdrawal of an effective therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy objective is to explore the effect of galantamine on behavior as&#xD;
      measured by the Frontal Behavioral Inventory during the randomized withdrawal period. In&#xD;
      addition, for subjects with primary progressive aphasia (limited ability for languages), the&#xD;
      effects of galantamine on language will be explored using the Aphasia Quotient of the Western&#xD;
      Aphasia Battery, and for all subjects the Clinical Global Impressions will be used to explore&#xD;
      global change.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pick Complex (PC) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are a group of neurodegenerative&#xD;
      dementias, initially characterized by frontotemporal lobar atrophy, that have overlapping&#xD;
      clinical presentations and pathologic findings. Although the pathogenesis of Pick&#xD;
      Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia remains unknown, and the neurotransmitter changes in Pick&#xD;
      Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia are not well characterized, there is evidence for decreased&#xD;
      cholinergic receptor binding in several cortical regions and decreased serotonin binding in&#xD;
      the hypothalamus, frontal cortex, and temporal cortex. Galantamine is a reversible&#xD;
      cholinesterase inhibitor. Recent studies indicate that galantamine is also an allosteric&#xD;
      modulator at nicotinic cholinergic receptor sites. This nicotinic modulation appears to not&#xD;
      only potentiate the response to acetylcholine binding, but also to modulate release of&#xD;
      several other neurotransmitters, including serotonin. This pilot study will explore the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability and efficacy of galantamine 8 mg and 12 mg twice a day treatment in&#xD;
      subjects with Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia. The study comprises an 18 week, open&#xD;
      label, galantamine treatment phase followed by an 8 week, randomized, double blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled withdrawal phase. The safety and tolerability of galantamine therapy will be&#xD;
      explored during both the open label and randomized withdrawal periods. The 8 week randomized&#xD;
      withdrawal period will be used to confirm the safety of galantamine withdrawal in this&#xD;
      subject group and its impact on possible symptom improvement achieved during the open label&#xD;
      period as a marker for efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expectation is that subjects who remain on galantamine for the additional 8 weeks will&#xD;
      continue to improve or will remain stable with regard to their behavior, language, cognition,&#xD;
      and global function, whereas subjects who are assigned to placebo will show a decline in some&#xD;
      of these functions. This approach will allow an assessment of the effects of galantamine&#xD;
      treatment (challenge) and galantamine withdrawal (de-challenge).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve a maximum of 40 subjects with Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia.&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive galantamine 4 mg twice a&#xD;
      day for 4 weeks followed by 8 mg twice a day for 4 weeks. At 8 weeks, the dose of galantamine&#xD;
      will be maintained at 8 mg or increased to 12 mg twice a day based on tolerability. At the&#xD;
      end of 12 weeks the dose of galantamine will be maintained at 8 or 12 mg twice a day or&#xD;
      reduced to 8 mg twice a day, based on tolerability. The dose will be fixed for the remainder&#xD;
      of the open label treatment period. Following 18 weeks of galantamine treatment, subjects&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned (1:1) to continued treatment with galantamine (at the same dose) or&#xD;
      placebo for an additional 8 weeks. Subjects and caregivers will be contacted by phone during&#xD;
      the study and encouraged to contact the site at any time if they have concerns. If the&#xD;
      subject's symptoms appear to be substantially worsening, and the investigator determines that&#xD;
      the subject has deteriorated, he will advise the subject and caregiver about possible early&#xD;
      completion of the study (early escape). Subjects electing early escape will complete final&#xD;
      efficacy and safety assessments, then discontinue study medication. Once they have completed&#xD;
      the study, they will begin the treatment of their choice in consultation with their&#xD;
      physician. Subjects will be seen for assessment at Visit 1 (screening), Visit 2 (baseline),&#xD;
      Visits 3 and 4 (12 and 18 weeks after the start of open label galantamine treatment), and&#xD;
      Visit 5 (8 weeks after the start of the double blind withdrawal period or at early escape) or&#xD;
      upon premature discontinuation. The subject and caregiver will return for an unscheduled&#xD;
      visit if, in the judgment of the investigator, the subject requires clinical assessment&#xD;
      between visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject selection criteria will ensure inclusion of subjects who have a clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      Pick Complex/Frontotemporal Dementia established by published consensus criteria and&#xD;
      supported by neuroradiologic confirmation. The subjects selected for the study will have a&#xD;
      diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia or frontotemporal dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be monitored by assessment of adverse events,&#xD;
      electrocardiograms, physical examinations, blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and laboratory&#xD;
      tests. Efficacy on symptoms will be explored by measuring changes in the Frontal Behavioral&#xD;
      Inventory (FBI), the Aphasia Quotient (AQ) of the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), the Mini&#xD;
      Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS), the Frontal&#xD;
      Assessment Battery (FAB), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the Alzheimer's Disease&#xD;
      Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Scale, the Clinical Global&#xD;
      Impressions (CGI) Scales of Severity or Change, and subscales of the WAB and FBI. Changes in&#xD;
      the results of neurologic examinations will also be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The descriptive analyses will be performed, no hypotheses are specified for statistical&#xD;
      testing. Safety and efficacy assessments will be summarized. Safety and Efficacy changes will&#xD;
      be calculated from the screening/baseline of the galantamine treatment period to Week 18&#xD;
      (open label galantamine treatment period) and Week 26 (entire study for subjects randomized&#xD;
      to galantamine for the 8 week withdrawal period). Comparisons between the placebo and&#xD;
      galantamine treatment groups will use the changes in safety and efficacy parameters from&#xD;
      Weeks 18 to 26 (the double blind, placebo controlled, randomized withdrawal period). Using a&#xD;
      flexible dosing regimen, subjects will receive galantamine as oral tablets up to 8 or 12 mg&#xD;
      twice per day for 18 weeks. Subjects will then be randomly assigned (1:1) in a double blind&#xD;
      fashion to galantamine at the same dose or to placebo for an additional 8 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
