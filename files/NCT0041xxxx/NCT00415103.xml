      The purpose of this trial is to determinate the security, tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      aprepitant plus palonosetron versus granisetron in the prevention of nausea and emesis&#xD;
      induced by chemotherapy in patients treated with haematopoietic progenitors transplant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with haematopoietic cancer (as leukaemia and lymphomas) that are treated with high&#xD;
      doses of intense chemotherapy for the haematopoietic progenitors transplant experiment&#xD;
      intense nausea and emesis related to this chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of regimens with antagonist of 5HT3 receptors (ondansetron, tropisetron,&#xD;
      granisetron) seems to have reduced the magnitude of the problem in the first 24 hours after&#xD;
      the beginning of the chemotherapy. However, in spite of the use of these drugs, it is very&#xD;
      frequency to observe intense nausea and emesis induced by chemotherapy especially in the&#xD;
      latest period (after 24 h).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MASCC guides establish that It is not possible to give firm recommendations in the prevention&#xD;
      of the NVIQ for these patients. Currently, the treatment of this problem in patients that go&#xD;
      through a total body irradiation is made with antagonist of 5HT3 receptors with or without&#xD;
      Dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is neither recommendation regarding the antiemetic prophylaxis in chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatments with high emetogenic power of several days duration. However, there is controversy&#xD;
      about the use of high doses of steroids to avoid the latest emesis in transplant patients (&#xD;
      because of the high doses of steroids, Its continuous use during several days in this&#xD;
      clinical situation and because of the possible worsening of the immunodeficiency inherent to&#xD;
      the oncohematology illness/the previous chemotherapy treatment received by the patient). In&#xD;
      patients that go trough a haematopoietic progenitor's transplant, many teams prefer to avoid&#xD;
      the use of steroids. Main clinical guides do not offer firm recommendations regarding&#xD;
      antiemetic prophylaxis protocols in the TPH and antagonists of 5-HT3 receptors are commonly&#xD;
      used in practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMENO-1 study demonstrated that the incidence of NVIQ is high even with an anti-5HT3 daily&#xD;
      prevention (experimenting vomits or requiring rescue treatment for 81% of the TPH receptors),&#xD;
      this significantly ameliorated their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are new drugs with new action mechanisms and a probable synergy between them&#xD;
      that increase control of the NVIQ out of the transplant field. For that reason we have&#xD;
      designed a study with the purpose of evaluating whether these new drugs ameliorate the&#xD;
      control that we currently have of NVIQ (which is far from optimal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid differences in terms of posology regimes, granisetron will be used as the common&#xD;
      treatment with one daily dose of 3mg/day. The new experimental regime that we propose&#xD;
      includes two newly commercialized drugs with complementary and different mechanisms of action&#xD;
      that have demonstrated their efficacy and their security in the very emetogenic chemotherapy&#xD;
      administrated only one day: aprepitant and palonosetron.&#xD;
