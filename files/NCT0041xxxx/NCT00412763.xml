  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to assess whether Silymarin therapy shortens illness&#xD;
      or prevents complications in patients with acute hepatitis. We will specifically compare&#xD;
      responses in acute hepatitis patients treated with Silymarin to those given a control&#xD;
      preparation of a vitamin supplements in a double blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

      The study is designed as a double-blinded placebo controlled trial. We compare a 4 week&#xD;
      course of therapy with silymarin tablets and a low-dose vitamin preparation (placebo) and&#xD;
      then follow-up for a total of 8 weeks to assess treatment response. Outcomes of our&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial are improvement in symptoms and signs, normalization of liver&#xD;
      functions, time to resuming normal activities, and and sense of well-being. This protocol&#xD;
      follows the standard therapeutic care for acute hepatitis except that the patients will&#xD;
      receive either a herbal supplement (silymarin), which many patients are taking anyway, or a&#xD;
      vitamin placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Freshly collected serum will be tested for anti-HAV IgM, anti-HBc Igm, anti-HBs, HBs Ag,&#xD;
      anti-HCV antibody, HCV-RNA, anti-HDV IgM, anti-HEV IgM, CMV and EBV and for alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferase (ALT), AST, direct and total bilirubin.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients admitted to the fever hospital and presenting with symptoms and signs that&#xD;
             may be consistent with a diagnosis of acute hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent (&lt;1 month) history of illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Elevation of ALT &gt; 2.5 normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 13 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History suggestive of severe drug-induced acute hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children 12 years and younger.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspected hypersensitivity to Silymarin or vitamin preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of advanced liver disease e.g. history or presence of ascitis, bleeding&#xD;
             esophageal varices, and hepatic encephalopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are critically ill, with multisystem failure or cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Substance abuse such as IV drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other conditions, which in the opinion of the investigator would make the patient&#xD;
             unsuitable for enrollment or could interfere with the patient's participation in and&#xD;
             completion of the protocol.&#xD;
