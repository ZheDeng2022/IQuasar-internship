    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility, effectiveness, and duration of&#xD;
      treatment response of periosteal electro-acupuncture (osteopuncture) for osteoarthritis&#xD;
      (OA)-associated chronic knee pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is painful in 6.8% of men and 11.4% of women age 63-93, with over 20&#xD;
      million Americans affected nationwide, and may lead to a variety of untoward consequences&#xD;
      including limitations in physical function, postural instability, sleep disturbance,&#xD;
      psychosocial disability, and substantial utilization of health care resources. While oral&#xD;
      analgesics represent the mainstay of treatment for chronic pain associated with knee OA,&#xD;
      non-responders with limiting comorbidities may have few therapeutic alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this research study are to (1) reduce pain severity and disability in&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults with OA-associated chronic knee pain using periosteal&#xD;
      electroacupuncture (osteopuncture), and (2) improve the physical performance, psychosocial&#xD;
      function, sleep, and appetite of these individuals. 88 older adults with persistent knee pain&#xD;
      and x-ray evidence of OA, no other rheumatologic disorders, no history of knee surgery, and&#xD;
      no prominent pain in sites other than the knee(s) will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      osteopuncture or control osteopuncture once a week for 6 weeks. All outcome measures for pain&#xD;
      and disability, as well as physical performance, psychosocial function, sleep, and appetite,&#xD;
      will be collected pre-treatment, at the completion of the 6-week protocol, and 3 months&#xD;
      later.&#xD;
