  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of a portable biofeedback device on&#xD;
      improving sleep latency and other sleep variables such as nocturnal awake time and daytime&#xD;
      functioning in persons with primary insomnia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that when compared to normal controls, persons with insomnia exhibit&#xD;
      increased cognitive and physiological arousal and higher overall metabolic rate during sleep,&#xD;
      particularly at sleep onset. There is evidence that reducing this arousal may impact sleep&#xD;
      latency and nocturnal awake time. Although relaxation treatments have been integrated into&#xD;
      behavioral therapies, there are numerous barriers to their implementation in real world&#xD;
      settings. The present study is designed to examine the effect of a portable biofeedback&#xD;
      device designed to induce physiological relaxation as compared to an inactive sham control&#xD;
      device condition in reducing sleep onset latency in persons with primary insomnia over a 4&#xD;
      week period at three separate research sites.&#xD;
