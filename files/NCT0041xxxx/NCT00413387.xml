    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic disease that is estimated to affect over 25 million people both in the&#xD;
      U.S. and in Europe (i.e. approximately 10% of the total population). Pharmacological therapy&#xD;
      is used to treat reversible airway obstruction, inflammation and hyper-reactivity.&#xD;
      Medications include preventive treatments in forms of antinflammatory/antiallergic agents&#xD;
      (i.e. glucocorticosteroids, leukotriene antagonists, cromolyn sodium) and reliever&#xD;
      treatments, in forms of bronchodilators (i.e. β-adrenergic agonists, anticholinergics). In&#xD;
      patients treated with inhaled glucocorticosteroids whose asthma is not fully controlled,&#xD;
      national and international guidelines recommend a stepwise approach. Recent evidence-based&#xD;
      clinical trials show that the addition of a LABA to inhaled glucocorticosteroids is more&#xD;
      beneficial in terms of asthma control than increasing the dose of corticosteroids alone.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe persistent asthma for at least 6 months,&#xD;
             according to GINA revised version 2002 guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Forced expiratory volume (FEV1) or peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) &gt; 50% and &lt;&#xD;
                  80% of the predicted normal;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Asthma not adequately controlled with the current therapies, defined as presence&#xD;
                  of daily asthma symptoms &gt; once a week and night-time asthma symptoms &gt; twice a&#xD;
                  month, and daily use of short-acting β2-agonists. These findings are to be based&#xD;
                  on recent medical history and are to be confirmed in the 2-week run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Treatment with inhaled corticosteroids at a daily dose ≤ 1000 μg of BDP or&#xD;
                       equivalent. The daily dose of inhaled corticosteroids taken at visit 1 will&#xD;
                       be assessed taking into account the following ratios between the doses of&#xD;
                       the different steroids: fluticasone propionate : BDP CFC = 1 : 2; budesonide&#xD;
                       : BDP CFC = 4 : 5; flunisolide : BDP CFC = 1 : 1. The ratios between inhaled&#xD;
                       steroids are irrespective of the formulations (i.e. spray aerosol or powder)&#xD;
                       used. When BDP is given in the new extra-fine HFA-134a formulation (as&#xD;
                       QVAR®, 3M Healthcare), the ratio with BDP CFC is set as 2 : 5. Therefore,&#xD;
                       the maximum allowed daily dose of inhaled corticosteroids at study entry&#xD;
                       will be: budesonide 800 μg, fluticasone propionate 500 μg, flunisolide 1000&#xD;
                       μg, BDP 1000 mcg, BDP HFA extra-fine 400 μg.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Positive response to the reversibility test in the screening visit, defined&#xD;
                       as an increase of at least 12% (or, alternatively, of 200mL) from baseline&#xD;
                       value in the measurement of FEV1 30 minutes following 2 puffs (2 x 100 µg)&#xD;
                       of inhaled salbutamol administered via pMDI. The reversibility test can be&#xD;
                       avoided in patients having a documented positive response in the previous 6&#xD;
                       months.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  A co-operative attitude and ability to be trained to correctly use the&#xD;
                       metered dose inhalers and to complete the diary cards.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Written informed consent obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  At the end of the 2-week run-in period, the presence of daily asthma&#xD;
                       symptoms (of at least mild intensity) and nighttime asthma symptom (of at&#xD;
                       least mild intensity) &gt; once a week, as well as of daily use of relief&#xD;
