  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), blood vessel leakage, and inflammation&#xD;
      contribute to the progression of the eye disease, age-related macular degeneration (AMD),&#xD;
      which is the leading cause of irreversible, severe loss of vision in people 55 years of age&#xD;
      and older in the developed world. TG100801 is a new drug that inhibits ocular angiogenesis,&#xD;
      vascular leak, and inflammation in laboratory studies, and may have great utility in the&#xD;
      treatment of diseases such as AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, ocular tolerability, and blood&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of TG100801 at escalating doses in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
