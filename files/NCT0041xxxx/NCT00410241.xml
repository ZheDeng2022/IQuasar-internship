      This study will examine genome sequencing in clinical research. Genome sequencing is a&#xD;
      process in which researchers analyze (or sequence) part or all of the genome from a single&#xD;
      person. The human genome is the material in cells that includes thousands of genes. Gene&#xD;
      changes that cause or contribute to disease can be passed on from one generation to the next.&#xD;
      This study first focuses on heart disease. Later, researchers hope to study other conditions&#xD;
      and genes, with the eventual goal of sequencing most or all of participants genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants ages 45 to 65 years of age and who do not smoke, may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Patients will come to the NIH Clinical Research Center for an initial study to last about&#xD;
      half a day. They will donate a blood sample and complete a short survey. Then they will meet&#xD;
      the genetic counselor to learn more about genome sequencing. Those who join the study will&#xD;
      undergo the following procedures and evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family history and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of height and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Noninvasive heart tests, including electrocardiogram and echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drawing of about 3 ounces of blood (5 to 6 tablespoons); part of the blood sample will&#xD;
           be used for research and another part for clinical testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multidetector computed tomography (CT), a test to measure coronary artery calcification,&#xD;
           that is, condition of inflexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive a letter with results of the clinical laboratory values and&#xD;
      evaluations. There will be recommendations for follow-up with the patient s doctors. Risks in&#xD;
      this study include exposure to radiation from the CT test. The radiation amount used is about&#xD;
      the same that a person normally receives from natural sources, such as from the sun, outer&#xD;
      space, and radioactive materials found naturally in the earth s air and soil. Another slight&#xD;
      risk involves reactions to a contrast agent that may be used in the echocardiogram. Side&#xD;
      effects can be headache, nausea or vomiting, a warm sensation, and dizziness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the samples that patients provide, researchers will start by sequencing about 400 genes&#xD;
      related to heart disease. Analysis will take months to complete. Genome sequencing is&#xD;
      difficult to do, and researchers have much to learn about the genes they sequence and the&#xD;
      gene changes they find. If the researchers find gene changes that are important to the health&#xD;
      of a participant, they will contact that participant and give him/her the choice of learning&#xD;
      such results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may or may not have a direct benefit for participants. Patients would get free&#xD;
      clinical testing for cholesterol, diabetes, and other conditions, as well as information&#xD;
      about gene changes. Knowledge gained will benefit people in the future as researchers learn&#xD;
      about the relationship between gene changes and health.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of ClinSeq is to research large-scale medical sequencing (LSMS) in a clinical&#xD;
      research setting. It was developed at a time (approximately 2007) when little was known about&#xD;
      the processes and outcomes of doing so. By conducting LSMS and returning individual results&#xD;
      to participants, we intended to investigate some of the technical, medical, and genetic&#xD;
      counseling issues that accompanied the implementation of LSMS in the clinical setting. Three&#xD;
      of our objectives have been met and the relevant findings have largely been published&#xD;
      including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Developing methods for recruiting and consenting a large, racially-diverse cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuing to improve upon existing algorithms for generating and interpreting sequence&#xD;
           data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Build and offer this cohort as a resource for addressing biomedical research questions&#xD;
           including investigating the association of genomic variants with traits and phenotypes&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is still much to be learned regarding LSMS, much of which is pertinent to our&#xD;
      original aim of improving our understanding of socio-behavioral aspects of implementation of&#xD;
      LSMS in a clinical research setting. Remaining objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand patient outcomes (e.g., health behavior, communication, personal utility,&#xD;
           emotional) following the receipt of medically actionable results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the impact of an intervention designed to promote better understanding of&#xD;
           the&#xD;
&#xD;
      accuracy of genetic sequencing among those consenting to LSMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the outcomes of returning negative secondary findings reports via a&#xD;
           website and compare two versions of a slide developed to improve women s understanding&#xD;
           of their residual risk for breast cancer following the receipt of such a report.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify genetic risk factors for diabetes and other metabolic diseases related to&#xD;
           glucose metabolism.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group A&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recruitment and enrollment to Group A is complete. For the most part, the same inclusion&#xD;
        and exclusion criteria and justifications applied to the A1, A2, and A3 cohorts, but&#xD;
        exceptions have been noted for some criteria. Overall, those criteria included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Criterion #1 (A1): 25% of the participants in this cohort have known coronary artery&#xD;
        disease (CAD), which is defined as history of: myocardial infarction, silent myocardial&#xD;
        infarction, stent placement, re-vascularization, 50% or more arterial blockage, a calcium&#xD;
&#xD;
        score greater than the 95th centile based on their age, gender and race (using the MESA&#xD;
        calculator at www.mesa-nhlbi.org/Calcium), or a strong family history of CAD along with a&#xD;
        personal history of a potentially CAD-related biochemical phenotype, such as elevated&#xD;
&#xD;
        lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Justification: Because CAD was initially the target phenotype under study, it was&#xD;
             critical to include a minimal number of participants with documented disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Criterion #2 (A1 &amp; A2): Individuals eligible for this study are required to be&#xD;
                  non-smokers at the time of enrollment, for our purposes defined as someone who&#xD;
                  has not smoked regularly during the previous 12 months (Wilson et al., 1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Justification: Because our study originally aimed to identify the genetic&#xD;
             underpinnings of CAD, we excluded individuals who were smokers because it is a&#xD;
             significant, known risk factor for CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -Criterion #3 (A1 and A2): Individuals without CAD must be 45-65 years of age, and&#xD;
             individuals with CAD must be 35-65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Justification: We selected our age range based on the manifestations of our target&#xD;
             phenotype. We selected the lower limit of this cutoff in order to recruit a cohort&#xD;
             whose coronary artery calcification (CAC) measurements range from normal to diseased,&#xD;
             and it has been shown that abnormal CAC is infrequent below this age (Janowitz,&#xD;
             Agatston, Kaplan, &amp; Viamonte, 1993). The lower limit of the age range&#xD;
&#xD;
        has been expanded in the case of CAD participants to allow for the enrollment of&#xD;
        individuals with particularly severe personal or family history of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
        An upper age limit of 65 was chosen to allow for longitudinal study of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Criterion #4 (A3): Individuals must be 18-65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Justification: As with the A1 and A2 cohort, an upper age limit of 65 was chosen to&#xD;
             allow for longitudinal study of participants. However, in contrast to the A1 and A2&#xD;
             cohorts, a lower age limit of 18 was chosen because we are no longer primarily&#xD;
             interested in a cardiovascular disease phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -Criterion #5 (All Cohorts): Subjects must reside in the metropolitan DC and Baltimore&#xD;
             areas or travel to the CRC on a regular basis for follow-up, or be willing to travel&#xD;
             to the NIH as needed for protocol participation at their own expense (with the&#xD;
             exception of some participants with CAD who had extremely compelling personal or&#xD;
             family history of disease and we agreed to cover the cost of their transportation,&#xD;
             meals and lodging covered for clinical visits because they could not otherwise&#xD;
             participate).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Justification: This criterion is designed to minimize subjects reluctance to&#xD;
             participate in ongoing study activities, such as ancillary studies and return to&#xD;
             receive genetic testing results.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -Criterion #6: First-degree relatives of enrolled ClinSeq participants are not&#xD;
             eligible unless they fall into Group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Justification: These individuals share on average 50% of their genes on autosomal&#xD;
             loci, thus possibly reducing the power of a study, such as ClinSeq , with a focus on&#xD;
             common diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Criterion #7: Individuals who are directly involved with gathering and analyzing&#xD;
                  the clinical and genotyping data, including the Principal Investigator, the&#xD;
                  Associate Investigators, the ClinSeq staff involved with the subjects at the&#xD;
                  clinical level (such as the Nurse Practitioner, Genetic counselor, etc.), and the&#xD;
                  staff at NISC involved with generating and analyzing the sequence data are&#xD;
                  ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Justification: Participation of these individuals may present a conflict of interest&#xD;
             (COI) and lead to adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -Criterion #9: Individuals who are already enrolled in another study that provides&#xD;
             genome or exome sequencing, such as the GENE-FORECAST Study (14-HG_0048) are&#xD;
             ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Justification: The results that we provide will no longer be needed by the&#xD;
             participant. In addition, the results will no longer be novel to the participant,&#xD;
             making them ineligible for all social and behavioral research aimed at understanding&#xD;
             the impact of return of results. Because this severely limits their participation in&#xD;
             the project, we propose to exclude these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -Criterion #11: Adults who cannot or may become unable to consent are excluded from&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Justification: Because the study is interested in learning how people make consent&#xD;
             decisions, their attitudes, and use of personal testing results, these individuals are&#xD;
             excluded from the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following participants are/were eligible for projects related to Objectives 1A-C &amp; 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Objective 1A: Participants eligible for this project must be over 18 years old and&#xD;
             have received a medically actionable genetic result in the last six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             --Justification: Only individuals with a result can be interviewed and surveyed&#xD;
             because we are interested in their experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Objective 1B: Recruitment and data collection are complete. Eligibility criteria&#xD;
             included: (1) consenting to the ClinSeq project between 2012-2018, (2) completion of&#xD;
             the Baseline Survey, and (3) being over 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Objective 1C: Recruitment and data collection are complete. Eligibility for inclusion&#xD;
             in this project were based on: (1) having a negative secondary finding report&#xD;
             available from exome sequence data analysis, and (2) consenting to participate in a&#xD;
             randomized control trial of results return.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Justification: Only participants with negative secondary findings results were&#xD;
                  included in the study since the project is focused initially on return of these&#xD;
                  results only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Objective 2: Recruitment and data collection are complete. Participants eligible for this&#xD;
        group had a variant of interest identified in a gene/genes related to diabetes or other&#xD;
        metabolic diseases related to glucose metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        --Justification: We are interested in understanding whether specific genetic variants have&#xD;
        phenotypic consequences thus, having a variant is required for inclusion of a subject s&#xD;
        data in our dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group B&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recruitment and enrollment to Group B is closed. The eligibility for Group B was distinct&#xD;
        from Group A. Group B eligibility required:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Criterion #1: Having a relative enrolled in Group A&#xD;
&#xD;
        --Justification: There are were two justifications for including relatives in Group B of&#xD;
        the study. The first is that we wished to initiate standard of care approaches for known&#xD;
        disease entities. For example, it is clinically indicated to perform family studies of&#xD;
        relatives of persons with familial hypercholesterolemia to identify persons at high risk&#xD;
        for this life-threatening disorder. The second was that we may&#xD;
&#xD;
        sometimes needed additional genetic data on the families to help us determine if a genetic&#xD;
        variant is associated with a disease phenotype (both in cases where we had some evidence of&#xD;
        the link between the variant and disease thus the variant was suspected to cause disease&#xD;
        and in cases where we had little to no evidence of such a link thus the variant may cause&#xD;
        disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Criterion #2: Being over 18 years old, unless the phenotype under study affects children&#xD;
&#xD;
        --Justification: We excluded children unless the disease causes symptoms in childhood&#xD;
        because of our concern that such genetic testing could pose a risk to these children&#xD;
        without known benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        No Exclusion as the recruitment and enrollment is closed.&#xD;
