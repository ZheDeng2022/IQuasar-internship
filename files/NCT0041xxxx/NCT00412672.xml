  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the current proposal is that collateral flow is an important determinant of&#xD;
      myocardial protection during an ischemic event. Increased collateral flow for any given area&#xD;
      at risk will decrease the myocardial damage caused by the occlusion of the infarct related&#xD;
      epicardial artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is further hypothesized that myocardial salvage provided by collateral flow will decrease&#xD;
      infarct size and this in turn will decrease LV dilatation post-myocardial infarction.&#xD;

      The hypothesis of the current proposal is that collateral flow is an important determinant of&#xD;
      myocardial protection during an ischemic event. Increased collateral flow for any given area&#xD;
      at risk will decrease the myocardial damage caused by the occlusion of the infarct related&#xD;
      epicardial artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is further hypothesized that myocardial salvage provided by collateral flow will decrease&#xD;
      infarct size and this in turn will decrease LV dilatation post-myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two primary endpoints are infarct size as assessed by increase of biochemical cardiac&#xD;
      markers and coronary collateral perfusion index (CPI) as obtained by transthoracic MCE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extent of LV remodelling, i.e., LV dilatation as assessed by serial assessment of LV&#xD;
      dimension by LV angiogram and/or echocardiography, respectively.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to give informed consent e.g. because of mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with cardiogenic shock&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with myocardial infarction secondary to occlusion of a recently&#xD;
             revascularized vessel (subacute stent thrombosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe arrhythmias&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose door-to-balloon time exceeds 120 minutes&#xD;
