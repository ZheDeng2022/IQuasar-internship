    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety of 500mg of aspirin added to IV TPA at standard doses to&#xD;
      prevent re-occlusion of cerebral vessels after successful reperfusion. In ischemic stroke&#xD;
      brain arteries are occluded either by an embolus originating in the heart or large vessels&#xD;
      leading to the brain or by a process of acute thrombosis of the cerebral arteries over a&#xD;
      ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. Rupture of the plaque exposes thrombogenic elements within&#xD;
      the plaque and leads to accumulation and activation of platelets and induction of the&#xD;
      clotting cascade eventually leading to acute thrombosis and occlusion of the artery. TPA is&#xD;
      currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat heart and brain problems&#xD;
      caused by blockage of arteries. It activates plasminogen and leads to disintegration of the&#xD;
      thrombus/embolus. It is effective only if begun within 3 to 4.5 hours of onset of the stroke&#xD;
      because of potential deleterious side effects including life threatening symptomatic&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) when the drug is administered outside of this time window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reperfusion of the ischemic brain (i.e. timely opening of the occluded artery) with TPA is&#xD;
      associated with improved outcome. However, in about 33% of patients that have successfully&#xD;
      reperfused after TPA the artery re-occludes within the first few hours resulting in worsening&#xD;
      neurological symptoms and worse functional outcome. This re-occlusion is speculated to result&#xD;
      from re-thrombosis over an existing ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. This is explained by the&#xD;
      relatively short half life of TPA leaving the exposed ruptured plaque intact which leads to&#xD;
      re-activation of platelets and clotting factors and re-thrombosis. Thus, we hypothesize that&#xD;
      the addition of an antiplatelet agent to TPA would result in lower rates of re-occlusion&#xD;
      after AIS. The FDA approved TPA for patients with AIS but discouraged the concomitant use of&#xD;
      anti-platelet or anti-thrombotic drugs for the first 24hours after administration of TPA&#xD;
      because of concerns that such therapy may result in increased rates of intracerebral&#xD;
      hemorrhage. Aspirin is a well known platelet anti-aggregant that works by inhibition of&#xD;
      cycloxygenase 1 and reduction in thromboxane A levels. It has a rapid onset of action and&#xD;
      additional potential beneficial anti-inflammatory effects in patients with AIS. The&#xD;
      international stroke study showed that acute treatment of stroke patients with 500mg of&#xD;
      aspirin is safe and feasible and results in better outcome. Furthermore, the drug was safe in&#xD;
      these circumstances with an ICH rate of only .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this clinical trial is to examine the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination of aspirin with rt-TPA in patients with AIS.&#xD;

      Background and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of acute ischemic stroke consists of thrombolytic drugs aiming at opening occluded&#xD;
      vessels. Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) is the only drug approved by the FDA (1, 2). The&#xD;
      use of TPA is significantly limited by a relatively narrow therapeutic window of up to 3-4.5&#xD;
      hours following stroke onset (3, 4). Use of TPA outside of this time window is associated&#xD;
      with an unacceptably high risk of hemorrhage including symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage&#xD;
      (sICH) (5, 6). While TPA is efficacious in reducing stroke associated disability its effects&#xD;
      are limited by the phenomenon of early re-occlusion after successful reperfusion of the&#xD;
      occluded artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous reports have shown that among patients receiving IV TPA within 3 hours of stroke&#xD;
      onset 61% re-perfuse at 1 hour, with about 67% of these having partial recanalization and 33%&#xD;
      complete recanalization of the occluded artery (7). reperfusion rates at 2 hours tend to be&#xD;
      much lower ranging around 30-40% implying early re-occlusion (8). Indeed it was found that&#xD;
      25% of the patients that have successfully reperfused will re-occlude the artery within 2&#xD;
      hours (7). Re-occlusion of an already reperfused artery was more common in elderly patients&#xD;
      with severe ipsilateral carotid stenosis and higher NIHSS scores and was associated with poor&#xD;
      outcome (7). We speculate that re-occlusion is much more common in atherothrombotic strokes&#xD;
      compared with embolic stroke. In embolic stroke TPA disintegrates the occluding embolus&#xD;
      frequently and there is no remaining exposed endothelium or plaque that would trigger&#xD;
      thrombosis (9). In contrast, in atherothrombotic stroke TPA disintegrates the occluding&#xD;
      thrombus leading to re-perfusion less frequently (9) and the exposed thrombogenic elements&#xD;
      within the ruptured plaque remain in place triggering repeated platelet activation and&#xD;
      re-thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because primary reperfusion is less frequent in patients with atherothrombotic large vessel&#xD;
      stroke and re-occlusion is more common in these patients and both these processes involve&#xD;
      platelet aggregation and activation at the site of thrombosis we argue that addition of&#xD;
      anti-platelet agent would be able to increase reperfusion rates and decrease re-occlusion&#xD;
      rates in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirin is the most commonly used antiplatelet agent in stroke patients. It has a relatively&#xD;
      long half life and a relatively rapid onset of therapeutic effect(10, 11). Furthermore, an&#xD;
      additional aspirin bolus may reverse a state of aspirin resistance in patients suffering a&#xD;
      stroke while on aspirin(12, 13). Aspirin is safe when given to patients with acute stroke as&#xD;
      soon as the diagnosis is made (14, 15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the FDA approval of TPA use for stroke patients had a pre-requisite of not using&#xD;
      concurrent anti-thrombotic drugs in the 24 hours after TPA administration the safety of&#xD;
      aspirin needs to be studied in a randomized trial. However, it should be noted that pre-TPA&#xD;
      aspirin use was not associated with an increased ICH risk in patients given the drug (16) and&#xD;
      therefore pre-morbid aspirin use is not considered a contraindication for TPA administration&#xD;
      in acute stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized double blind study exploring the safety of adding 500 mg of&#xD;
      aspirin given P.O. to standard doses of IV TPA.&#xD;
&#xD;

      METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients (n=20/group) will be recruited after obtaining informed consent. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive rt-TPA 0.9mg/kg (10% of the total dose as an IV bolus and the&#xD;
      reminder IV over 60 minutes) + placebo or rt-TPA 0.9mg/kg + aspirin P.O. at a dose of 500mg&#xD;
      at the time of TPA administration.. Randomization will be accomplished using an IVRS&#xD;
      automated system. Randomization will be into time tiers of 0-1.5 hours from symptom onset,&#xD;
      1.5-3 hours from symptom onset and 3-4.5 hours from symptom onset for each dose tier. Overall&#xD;
      60 patients (30 TPA + active drug and 30 TPA only are to be recruited). Study medications&#xD;
      will be supplied by the hospital and will have a total volume, color and odor that will be&#xD;
      identical to placebo. At the end of recruitment the randomization codes will be opened and&#xD;
      the data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will determine the safety of continuing the study in&#xD;
      the next dose tier. Samples will be collected for safety data (renal, hepatic and coagulation&#xD;
      studies) and sent to local laboratories in each center. Investigators will be notified&#xD;
      immediately on any lab results by fax and email. ECGs will be read at a central facility and&#xD;
      investigators will be notified on any abnormal result immediately via fax and email. All AE&#xD;
      and SAE will be reported immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVALUATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamics: Patients will be monitored non-invasively for blood pressure, heart rate,&#xD;
      oxygen saturation q2rhs in the first 24 hours post stroke and then every 6 hours for the next&#xD;
      24 hours and then every 12 hours for the reminder of the hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coagulation tests: PT, PTT and PLT blood counts will be evaluated daily in the first 3 days&#xD;
      of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests: Blood chemistry, liver function tests and cardiac enzymes will be evaluated&#xD;
      daily for the first 3 days and then at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac rhythm: ECG will be evaluated daily on a 12 lead recording on the first 3 days of&#xD;
      hospitalization and then at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT: Brain CT will be obtained prior to drug administration and in included patients repeated&#xD;
      scans will be obtained at 96-120 hours to evaluate final infarct size. In cases of suspected&#xD;
      hematoma brain CT would be obtained immediately and the number of patients sustaining an ICH&#xD;
      following drug administration will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) will be recorded and promptly&#xD;
      evaluated by the data safety monitoring board that will decide whether or not these events&#xD;
      are drug related and which will have the authority to prematurely terminate the study in case&#xD;
      an unexpected SAE emerges and appears to be drug related. AE and SAE will be defined&#xD;
      conventionally such that AE is any adverse event and SAE as an AE necessitating prolongation&#xD;
      of hospitalization or any adverse event that is potentially life threatening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEUROLOGICAL Included patients will be examined before and after randomization with the&#xD;
      National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) on days 1,2,3,5 and discharge and on&#xD;
      outpatient visits at months 1 and 3-post stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME Patients will be evaluated with the Barthel index (BI) and modified Rankin&#xD;
      score (MRS) administered on discharge day and during outpatient visits at month 1 and 3-post&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must meet all of the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke with onset less than 4.5 hours prior to the planned&#xD;
             start of intravenous alteplase. Acute ischemic stroke is defined as a measurable&#xD;
             neurological deficit of sudden onset, presumed secondary to focal cerebral ischemia.&#xD;
             Stroke onset will be defined as the time the patient was last known to be without the&#xD;
             new clinical deficit. Patients whose deficits have worsened in the last 4.5 hours are&#xD;
             not eligible if their first symptoms started more than 4.5 hours before. If the stroke&#xD;
             started during sleep, stroke onset will be recorded as the time the patient was last&#xD;
             known to be at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Disabling neurological deficit attributable to acute ischemic stroke in the middle&#xD;
             cerebral artery territory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. NIHSS less than or equal to 18 for left hemisphere strokes, NIHSS less than or equal&#xD;
             to 16 for others.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Evidence of MCA occlusion (stem or branch) prior to drug administration by TCD, CTA or&#xD;
             MRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age 18-85 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Able to sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For MRI Arm only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Screening MRI diagnostic of focal cerebral ischemia corresponding to the clinical&#xD;
             deficits. The MRI evaluation must involve echo planar diffusion weighted imaging, MRA,&#xD;
             and MRI perfusion. A normal appearing MRA with an appropriate perfusion deficit is&#xD;
             eligible. An apparent stenosis or occlusion on MRA with normal appearing perfusion&#xD;
             distally will not be eligible. Poor quality or uninterpretable MRA will not make&#xD;
             patient ineligible. Patients who have a normal appearing DWI are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Evidence on PWI MRI or a perfusion defect corresponding to the acute stroke syndrome.&#xD;
             The PWI will be assessed by relative mean transit time (MTT) images obtained prior to&#xD;
             the start of rt-TPA therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded from study participation for any of the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current participation in another study with an investigational drug or device within,&#xD;
             prior participation in the present study, or planned participation in another&#xD;
             therapeutic trial, prior to the final (day 30) assessment in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Absence of acoustic window to insonate the MCA on the involved side.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Time interval since stroke onset of less than 3 hours is impossible to determine with&#xD;
             high degree of confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Symptoms suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage, even if CT or MRI scan is negative for&#xD;
             hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Evidence of acute myocardial infarction defined as having at least two of the&#xD;
             following three features: 1) Chest pain suggestive of cardiac ischemia; 2) EKG&#xD;
             findings of ST elevation of more greater than 0.2 mV in 2 contiguous leads, new onset&#xD;
