      Abstract: Post-operative pulmonary complications after cardiac surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background The Catharina Hospital performs approximately 1700 heart operation each year. One&#xD;
      third of the patients stay at the Catharina hospital during their entire post-operative&#xD;
      period. Two years ago they abolished the pulmonary support by a physiotherapist.&#xD;
      Subjectively, the pulmonary complications increased over the last two years. During an&#xD;
      investigation of the contentment of the patients an increase of the pulmonary problems came&#xD;
      forward after eliminating the pulmonary support. There have been no further examinations to&#xD;
      the pulmonary complications post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The aim of this study is to give the department of cardio-thoracic surgery an&#xD;
      advice about the post-operative pulmonary support for patients who underwent heart surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study a budgetary analysis will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods 120 patients are prospectively randomised in three groups. Randomisation takes place&#xD;
      through block randomisation every three weeks. 40 patients will be supported by a&#xD;
      physiotherapist. Another 40 patients will be supported by the nurses on the cardiothoracic&#xD;
      surgery ward and the last 40 patients will use an incentive therapy with 'Airlife' by a&#xD;
      self-management method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population are all patients undergoing heart surgery and spend their entire&#xD;
      post-operative period at the Catharina Hospital. In- and exclusion criteria are specified in&#xD;
      the protocol on pages 3 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome The primary outcome is to qualify the pulmonary complications within the three&#xD;
      groups. These complications will be objectified by measuring peak flow, an instrument to&#xD;
      determine the lung function, and an x-ray of the thorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome is the contentment of the patient, which will be determined by a&#xD;
      VAS-score (Visual Analogue Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks There are no risks for the patient when participating on this study. The patient will&#xD;
      have to fill in the VAS-score and measure lung function with the peak flow at two different&#xD;
      moments. The study takes place in a clinical setting. There is no extra insurance in&#xD;
      conformity with the advice of the METC.&#xD;
