    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and long-term effectiveness of coronary&#xD;
      stenting with the ABT 578-eluting balloon expandable stent (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) vs.&#xD;
      the sirolimus-eluting balloon expandable stent (Cordis Johnson &amp; Johnson, Warren, New Jersey)&#xD;
      and the paclitaxel-eluting stent (Taxus liberte, Boston Scientific) for the treatment of&#xD;
      coronary stenosis in routine clinical practice.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have documented that a slow-release polymeric sirolimus-eluting stent&#xD;
      (Cypher, Cordis) and paclitaxel-eluting stent (Taxus, Boston Scientific) reduce neointimal&#xD;
      formation and result in decrease of angiographic restenosis and target lesion&#xD;
      revascularization at 1-3 years in the multicenter randomized clinical trials RAVEL, SIRIUS,&#xD;
      and TAXUS I-VI.From these studies, the two leading drug-eluting stents (DESs) of the Cypher&#xD;
      and Taxus have been widely and rapidly accepted as a standard treatment of coronary lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, randomized studies were conducted to reveal different outcomes of the different two&#xD;
      DESs. These studies showed that the sirolimus-eluting stent was better than the&#xD;
      paclitaxel-eluting stent in terms of lower angiographic restenosis rate or the two DESs were&#xD;
      similar in angiographic outcomes. A recent meta-analysis supported results of the former&#xD;
      randomized studies. Patients receiving sirolimus-eluting stent had a significantly lower risk&#xD;
      of restenosis and target vessel revascularization compared with those receiving&#xD;
      paclitaxel-eluting stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a recent approval of new DES, ABT-578-eluting stent (Endeavor, Medtronic, Minneapolis,&#xD;
      MN), other comparison studies have been conducted to compare Endeavor ABT-578-eluting stent&#xD;
      with the sirolimus-eluting stent and paclitaxel-eluting stent. ABT-578 and sirolimus share&#xD;
      some common structural and biological properties. The ENDEAVOR clinical trials are currently&#xD;
      in progress to evaluate a phosphoryl choline (PC)-coated ABT-578-eluting stent for the&#xD;
      prevention of restenosis. The Endeavor ABT-578-eluting stent utilizes a cobalt alloy&#xD;
      balloon-expandable stent (Driver; Medtronic) with a geometry similar to the stainless steel&#xD;
      stent used in this preliminary study (S7; Medtronic). The Endeavor ABT-578-eluting stent also&#xD;
      employees a PC strut surface coating as the drug delivery reservoir with a dose of 10 ug/mm&#xD;
      of ABT-578. The Endeavor ABT-578-eluting stent, however, differs from the stent used in this&#xD;
      experimental study by the addition of a drug-free PC coating to serve as a diffusion barrier&#xD;
      to retard drug release from the polymer reservoir. Angiographic analysis at 4 months in the&#xD;
      100-patient focal de novo lesion ENDEAVOR I feasibility study demonstrated a mean in-stent&#xD;
      percent diameter stenosis of approximately 14% and a late lumen loss of 0.3 mm with a low&#xD;
      frequency of target lesion revascularization (1%). The clinical outcomes from the ENDEAVOR II&#xD;
      (1,500 patients randomized to ABT-578 or bare metal stent) and the ENDEAVOR III (436 patients&#xD;
      randomized 3:1 to ABT-578 or Cypher) trials as well as other ongoing studies showed efficacy&#xD;
      of the PC-coated ABT-578-eluting stent. In ENDEAVOR III study, the Endeavor stent had larger&#xD;
      late loss and higher binary restenosis in both the analysis segment and stented segment. In&#xD;
      contrast, the TLR rates are not statistically different between the Endeavor (6.0%) and the&#xD;
      Cypher (5.3%, p=1.0) stents. This result of this study raised several questions to warrant&#xD;
      further randomized studies 1) is the angiographic superiority of Cypher stent applied to the&#xD;
      more complex lesions, 2) why is the TLR rate similar in spite of significantly different&#xD;
      angiographic outcomes, 3) which is better in the Endeavor and the Taxus stents, etc. The&#xD;
      ENDEAVOR IV study is being conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of the Endeavor stent&#xD;
      versus the Taxus stent. However, the inclusion of ENDEAVOR IV study was also limited that&#xD;
      this study did not include all complex lesions. Because of the limitations of current&#xD;
      ENDEAVOR series, a further large randomized study for the concurrent comparison of the three&#xD;
      DESs in the treatment of real-world practice would be needed.&#xD;
