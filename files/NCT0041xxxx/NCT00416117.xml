  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mounting evidence does support the combined use of manual physical therapy (MPT)and exercise&#xD;
      for patients with cervicogenic headache and mechanical neck pain. However, there is&#xD;
      insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of MPT and exercise for patients with neck&#xD;
      disorders with radicular symptoms. Our purpose for this study was to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a manual physical therapy and exercise program as compared to a minimal&#xD;
      intervention approach in the treatment of patients with mechanical neck pain, with or without&#xD;
      upper extremity symptoms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prior to randomization, potential participants underwent a standardized history and&#xD;
      examination of the cervical spine and upper quarter. We collected demographic information&#xD;
      that included each patient's age; gender; medication use; imaging results; and the location,&#xD;
      nature, and duration of symptoms. Self-report measures included the NDI and VAS pain scales.&#xD;
      Physical exam measures included cervical range of motion measurements with a gravity&#xD;
      inclinometer, passive accessory motion testing to assess cervical spine segmental mobility&#xD;
      and pain provocation, an upper quarter neurological screening, and special tests commonly&#xD;
      used to identify cervical impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants meeting all inclusion criteria were randomized into one of two treatment groups:&#xD;
      1) manual physical therapy and exercise (MTE) or 2) minimal intervention (MI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the MTE group received manual physical therapy interventions specifically&#xD;
      targeted to impairments identified during the physical examination. Physical therapists chose&#xD;
      manual interventions consisting of thrust and non-thrust joint manipulation/mobilization,&#xD;
      muscle energy, and soft-tissue mobilization/stretching techniques that are commonly&#xD;
      referenced and used in clinical practice. We provided all patients in the MTE group with a&#xD;
      standard home exercise program of cervical retraction, deep neck flexor strengthening, and&#xD;
      cervical rotation range of motion exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the MI group received a basic treatment plan consistent with general practitioner&#xD;
      care. We provided all patients with a basic regimen of postural advice, encouragement to&#xD;
      maintain neck motion and daily activity levels, cervical rotation range of motion exercise,&#xD;
      and instructions to continue any prescribed medication use. Minimalist physical therapy&#xD;
      treatments consisted of sub-therapeutic pulsed (10%) ultrasound at 0.1w/cm2 for 10 minutes&#xD;
      applied to the cervical spine and cervical rotation range of motion exercises. We provided&#xD;
      these treatments to maintain the patients' expectations for physical therapy treatment and&#xD;
      subsequent improvement, and to standardize the therapist-patient interaction time&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention period lasted 3 weeks with both groups receiving treatment twice weekly for&#xD;
      up to 6 sessions. We standardized treatment time for both groups by using a one-hour initial&#xD;
      evaluation and treatment session and thirty-minute follow-up treatment sessions. Patients did&#xD;
      not have to complete all six visits if their symptoms had fully resolved. The treating&#xD;
      therapist instructed and supervised all exercises to ensure proper patient technique and&#xD;
      understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We collected outcome measure data at baseline and at the patient's 3-week, 6-week and 1-year&#xD;
      follow-ups. All outcome measures were collected by physical therapists that were blinded to&#xD;
      treatment group allocation.&#xD;
