  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if tree nuts (Almonds, Hazelnuts, Pistachios, Peanuts, Macadamia nuts, Pecans,&#xD;
      Walnuts and Cashews) improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, as assessed by HbA1c and&#xD;
      serum fructosamine, and to assess whether these outcomes relate to improvements in&#xD;
      cardiovascular health (i.e. plasma lipids and measures of oxidative stress, inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers and nitric oxide generation). The investigators have found that nuts tend to&#xD;
      reduce the glycemic index of bread and have little effect of raising blood glucose on their&#xD;
      own. Therefore the investigators believe that they would be ideal foods to displace high&#xD;
      glycemic foods from the diet and lower the dietary glycemic load. This will result in&#xD;
      improved blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes, with additional benefits on coronary heart&#xD;
      disease risk factors due to other effects of nuts.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to study the effect of nuts on glycemic control and to confirm their&#xD;
      lipid lowering effects in type 2 diabetes. The consumption of nuts with their high&#xD;
      unsaturated fat, vegetable protein (arginine) and fiber contents will decrease the glycemic&#xD;
      load of the diet and improve glycemic control. The investigators anticipate that the&#xD;
      favorable fatty acid profile of nuts along with the vegetable protein will improve the blood&#xD;
      lipid profile in type 2 diabetes and thereby establish a cardiovascular risk reduction&#xD;
      associated with nuts in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, flavonoids and vitamin E present in high concentrations in nuts, and known to&#xD;
      have antioxidant activity may help to counter the elevated oxidative stress and inflammation&#xD;
      experienced by diabetics. The investigators will therefore determine the effect of nut&#xD;
      feeding on measures of oxidative stress (including oxidized low-density lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterol (LDL-C), considered to be of direct relevance to coronary heart disease),&#xD;
      inflammation (C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A and interleukin-6) and nitric oxide&#xD;
      metabolism (blood nitric oxide and nitrotyrosine levels). These data would further add to&#xD;
      interest in nuts in relation to cardiovascular disease risk reduction and diabetic&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Diet: A diet conforming to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and National&#xD;
      Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Nuts, soy and&#xD;
      dietary supplements (vitamins, minerals, herbal remedies) will be excluded in the background&#xD;
      diet during all phases of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment diets:(1) Full-Dose Nut Diet: Raw nuts will be added as supplements to the&#xD;
      subject's usual diet. Subjects with calorie needs of 2,400 kcal or greater, assessed by Lipid&#xD;
      Research Clinic (LRC) tables, will receive the full-dose supplement (100 g/d of nuts,&#xD;
      approximately 600 kcal). Subjects requiring between 1,600-2,400 kcal daily will receive 75%&#xD;
      of the full-dose supplement (75 g/d of nuts, approximately 450 kcal). Subjects requiring less&#xD;
      than 1,600 kcal daily will receive 50% of the full-dose supplement (50 g/d of nuts,&#xD;
      approximately 300 kcal). (2) Half-Dose Nut Diet: Raw nuts will be added as supplements to the&#xD;
      subject's usual diet. Subjects with calorie needs of 2,400 kcal or greater, assessed by LRC&#xD;
      tables, will receive half of the full dose of the nut supplement (50 g/d of nuts,&#xD;
      approximately 300 kcal) with the rest of the calories provided by the muffin (2 muffins are&#xD;
      300 kcal) for a total of 600 kcal. Subjects requiring between 1,600-2,400 kcal daily will&#xD;
      receive 75% of the half-dose supplement (37.5 g/d of nuts and 1.5 muffins, approximately 450&#xD;
      kcal). Subjects requiring less than 1,600 kcal daily will receive 50% of the half-dose&#xD;
      supplement (25 g/d of nuts and 1 muffin, approximately 300 kcal). (3): The full-dose control&#xD;
      supplement will be four 150 kcal muffins. Control supplements will be matched with the energy&#xD;
      content of the nut supplements, i.e. either 600 kcal/d (4 muffins); 450 kcal/d (3 muffins);&#xD;
      300 kcal/d (2 muffins). The macronutrient composition of the muffins will conform to an NCEP&#xD;
      Step 2 diet with 25% total fat, &lt;7% saturated fat by use of corn oil as the oil commonly used&#xD;
      in healthy baked goods, with 18% protein (the average for our subject population) using added&#xD;
      skim milk powder, and zero cholesterol. Muffins will be made with whole wheat flour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet History: one-week weighed diet histories will be obtained prior to the start and at&#xD;
      weeks 4, 8 and 12 of the study for assessment of macronutrients, dietary fiber and fatty&#xD;
      acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palatability/Satiety: for palatability and satiety, subjects will record their ratings using&#xD;
      a 7-point bipolar semantic scale at monthly intervals during each study phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry and Blood Pressure: height at recruitment and body weight, blood pressure,&#xD;
      waist and hip circumference, and body composition will be taken immediately prior to and at&#xD;
      each clinic visit (wk 0, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12) during the study.&#xD;
