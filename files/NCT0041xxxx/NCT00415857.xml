  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if using the PR1 peptide vaccine&#xD;
      (PR1) without PEG-Intron® (interferon) or in combination with interferon can reduce or&#xD;
      eliminate disease in patients who have CML that is in cytogenetic remission after treatment&#xD;
      with imatinib mesylate, but who still have small amounts of disease able to be noticed&#xD;
      (detected). Researchers want to see if giving low doses of interferon together with PR1 may&#xD;
      make the vaccine more effective. The safety of treatment in this study will also be studied.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Your disease responded well to treatment with imatinib mesylate. It is in complete&#xD;
      cytogenetic remission. This means that the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), a change in genetic&#xD;
      material that is believed to lead to leukemia, is no longer detectable (by the standard&#xD;
      chromosome analysis) in your bone marrow and blood cells. A molecular remission, which is&#xD;
      what researchers want you to achieve, means a greater reduction or a complete elimination of&#xD;
      the Ph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The small amounts of disease can be detected using a technique called polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (PCR). This is a very powerful test that can detect very small amounts of disease&#xD;
      that can still be present in the bone marrow and/or blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PR1 is an experimental vaccine made from a protein that is found in large amounts in leukemia&#xD;
      cells in CML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imatinib mesylate (which you are already receiving as standard therapy) is designed to bind&#xD;
      to certain proteins on the tumor cells, which may prevent the cells from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interferon is a drug that was used as standard therapy for patients with CML before imatinib&#xD;
      mesylate was available. It can help the immune system to function more effectively (causing&#xD;
      leukemia cells to show more PR1), which may make leukemia cells a better target to be killed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have &quot;screening tests.&quot; These tests&#xD;
      will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. You will have a&#xD;
      complete physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs (blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate, temperature, and breathing rate). You will have your complete medical history recorded.&#xD;
      You will have blood drawn (about 2 tablespoons) for routine tests. Women who are able to have&#xD;
      children must have a negative blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine pregnancy test. You will also&#xD;
      have blood drawn (about 1 tablespoon) to see if you have the necessary protein (called&#xD;
      HLA-A2) needed for the vaccine to recognize your cells. You will also have additional blood&#xD;
      drawn (about 1 tablespoon) to test (using the PCR test) the levels of leukemia in your blood.&#xD;
      You will have a bone marrow aspiration. To collect a bone marrow aspiration, an area of the&#xD;
      hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is&#xD;
      withdrawn through a large needle. You will have a chromosome test done on the number of&#xD;
      chromosomes in your bone marrow (collected from your bone marrow aspiration). You will not&#xD;
      have an additional procedure performed on you for this test. For this test, all of your&#xD;
      chromosomes in 20 cells in your bone marrow will be counted to see if there may be any&#xD;
      unhealthy changes (such as the Ph) present as well as how many may be present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive PR1 through a&#xD;
      small needle just under your skin (subcutaneous injection). Imatinib mesylate will continue&#xD;
      to be given to you by mouth at the dose that you are taking now as part of your standard&#xD;
      therapy. PR1 will be mixed with a substance called Montanide ISA 51 VG, which is a regular&#xD;
      procedure that will help your immune system respond to PR1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to one of 2 treatment groups.&#xD;
      Participants in one group will receive a subcutaneous injection of interferon with each PR1&#xD;
      vaccination. Participants in the other group will receive PR1 vaccination without interferon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of what group you are assigned to, you will also receive, with each PR1&#xD;
      vaccination, a growth hormone called GM-CSF. The purpose of GM-CSF is to boost your immune&#xD;
      system (in response to the PR1 vaccine) to help kill your leukemia. It is given as a&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection in your arms or your thighs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive a total of 4 doses of the PR1 vaccine. The first 3 vaccinations&#xD;
      are given every 3 weeks, and the last vaccination is given 18 weeks after the start of&#xD;
      therapy in this study. You will receive all of these vaccinations at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every time you come in for an injection of PR1, you will have a physical exam, including&#xD;
      measurement of your vital signs. You will have blood drawn (about 2 tablespoons) for routine&#xD;
      tests, and you will have blood drawn (about 1 tablespoon) for the PCR test. After you receive&#xD;
      the last vaccination, you will continue having the PCR test every 3 months to test the level&#xD;
      of leukemia in your blood and to see if your disease is responding to the vaccine. You will&#xD;
      have a bone marrow aspiration at 1 month and 6 months after the last vaccination. To measure&#xD;
      the response of your immune system to PR1, blood will be drawn (about 2 tablespoons each)&#xD;
      before the first vaccination, at Weeks 6, 18, 22 and 6 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be taken off this study if intolerable side effects occur or your disease progresses&#xD;
      (comes out of remission).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. PR1 mixed with Montanide ISA-51 VG is authorized by the FDA&#xD;
      for use in research only. Interferon and GM-CSF are FDA-approved and commercially available.&#xD;
      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

    <description>Molecular response rate is number of respondents compared to total participants. Molecular Response is defined as a greater than a one-log reduction of Breakpoint Cluster Region-Abelson Murine Leukemia (BCR-ABL) transcript levels by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the baseline level at the time vaccination was initiated, or a disappearance of BCR-ABL transcripts, as measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), occurring within 6 months from the last vaccination. Participants receive a series of 4 vaccinations administered at 3-week intervals and the fourth (final) vaccination administered 3 months after the third vaccination with blood draw to test PCR following every 3 months to test the level of leukemia in the blood and to see if disease is responding to the vaccine.</description>

    <time_frame>Period of 18 weeks (i.e., one vaccination each on weeks 0, 3, 6, and 18).</time_frame>
    <description>Immunologic Response (immune response) is defined as an increase of ≥ 0.5 PR1-HLA-A2 [human leukocyte antigen-A2 (HLA-A2)] tetramer cells / μl at the time of either the 3rd or 4th vaccination compared to the pre study absolute PR1-HLA-A2 tetramer cells / μl. Participants receive a total of 4 vaccinations over a period of 18 weeks (i.e., one vaccination each on weeks 0, 3, 6, and 18).

        <title>Molecular Response Rate</title>
        <description>Molecular response rate is number of respondents compared to total participants. Molecular Response is defined as a greater than a one-log reduction of Breakpoint Cluster Region-Abelson Murine Leukemia (BCR-ABL) transcript levels by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the baseline level at the time vaccination was initiated, or a disappearance of BCR-ABL transcripts, as measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), occurring within 6 months from the last vaccination. Participants receive a series of 4 vaccinations administered at 3-week intervals and the fourth (final) vaccination administered 3 months after the third vaccination with blood draw to test PCR following every 3 months to test the level of leukemia in the blood and to see if disease is responding to the vaccine.</description>
