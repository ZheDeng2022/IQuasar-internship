      RATIONALE: An educational program may be effective in increasing monthly skin&#xD;
      self-examinations to detect melanoma in healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well an educational program works in&#xD;
      increasing monthly skin self-examinations to detect melanoma in healthy participants.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the incidence of monthly thorough skin self-examinations (TSE) for early&#xD;
           detection of melanoma in healthy participants who are under routine care by their&#xD;
           primary care physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the impact of the intervention package and the resulting change in TSE&#xD;
           performance, in terms of visits to healthcare providers for skin problems, in these&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the efficacy of this intervention package in improving performance of TSE in&#xD;
           these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate potential effect of this intervention on health care resource use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a controlled, randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks prior to their appointment with their physician, participants undergo a baseline&#xD;
      assessment. During the appointment, participants are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (control): Participants receive written educational materials and watch a video on&#xD;
           healthy dietary habits during their appointment. They receive nutrition tip sheets,&#xD;
           including information related to reducing fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol in the&#xD;
           diet, at 2 and 6 months after their initial appointment. Participants also undergo&#xD;
           telephone assessments at 2, 6, and 12 months after their initial appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (skin self-examinations): Participants undergo a 10- to 15-minute face-to-face&#xD;
           counseling session with the study intervention specialist and receive training in&#xD;
           thorough skin self-examination (TSE) directly after their appointment. They also receive&#xD;
           written educational materials and watch a 25-minute video designed to motivate and teach&#xD;
           them to do TSE. Two weeks later, participants receive a follow-up call from the same&#xD;
           study intervention specialist. Participants receive tailored feedback at 2 and 6 months&#xD;
           and a motivational postcard at 4 months after their initial appointment. Participants&#xD;
           also undergo telephone assessments as in arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating physicians seeing participants in both arms attend a 60-minute educational&#xD;
      session regarding skin cancer detection, prevention, identification, and triage, supplemented&#xD;
      by written materials. They are also trained and prompted to deliver a 30-second message&#xD;
      emphasizing the desirability of performing monthly TSE during their appointment with&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the study intervention, participants are offered the educational&#xD;
      materials of the intervention arm to which they were not randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,135 participants will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
