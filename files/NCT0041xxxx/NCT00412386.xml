  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a form of congenital heart disease (the person is born with&#xD;
      it). With BAV, the heart valves in the aorta (the blood vessel that takes blood away from the&#xD;
      heart to the body) are not formed right. A person with BAV has only 2 leaflets instead of&#xD;
      three and the valve leaflets are often thickened. This can result in the block of blood flow&#xD;
      across the valve (aortic stenosis) and/or valve leakage (aortic valve regurgitation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From our experience at least 1/3 of patients with BAV will eventually develop complications.&#xD;
      Many patients with BAV do not develop significant problems until well into adulthood. The&#xD;
      most common problem in BAV patients is aortic dilatation and/or dissection. At this point, we&#xD;
      do not know on who or why aortic dilatation or dissection occurs.It is unclear whether the&#xD;
      enlargement is because of abnormal blood flow patterns, as a result of the shape of the&#xD;
      bicuspid valve, or whether it is because the way the aortic valve and/or vessel is formed. In&#xD;
      other words, the abnormal shape of the aortic valve may cause blood to flow in a different&#xD;
      way than it normally would, causing damage to the aorta as blood leaves the heart. There may&#xD;
      be a problem with the way the aortic valve connects to the aorta, which causes the aorta to&#xD;
      get larger or break down over time. It is also possible that the wall of the aorta in&#xD;
      patients with BAV is weaker than it would be in patients without BAV. At this point, we do&#xD;
      not know. It is believed by the investigators that if we can determine why the aorta gets&#xD;
      larger or tears, we can minimize the effects or prevent them altogether.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will collect blood and cardiac MRI images from forty-five (45) patients at&#xD;
      Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Egleston. There will be a study group (patients with BAV)&#xD;
      and a control group of patients (patients scheduled for a cardiac MRI but without BAV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled patients will have blood drawn by nursing staff from a peripheral vein and&#xD;
      collected in tubes for testing the day of their MRI scan. This test is called a plasma matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinase level. It is believed that patients who have bicuspid aortic valves and&#xD;
      dilated aortas have high plasma levels of this protein. This study will compare the MRI&#xD;
      images and plasma matrix protein levels of all the patients participating in the study.&#xD;

      Introduction-Background The reported incidence of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) based largely&#xD;
      on autopsy studies varies between 0.4% to 2.25% of the population. At least a third of&#xD;
      patients with a bicuspid aortic valve will eventually develop complications which include&#xD;
      aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, infective endocarditis, aortic dilatation, aortic&#xD;
      aneurysm formation, or aortic dissection. Given that in combination all other forms of&#xD;
      congenital heart disease are thought to be present in 0.8% of live births, Ward has suggested&#xD;
      that bicuspid aortic valves are likely to result in more morbidity and possibly mortality&#xD;
      than the effects of all other congenital heart defects combined. Since many patients with&#xD;
      bicuspid aortic valves do not develop significant problems until well into adulthood,&#xD;
      clinicians have not focused much attention on the &quot;normally&quot; functioning bicuspid aortic&#xD;
      valve. However, at a mean age of 17.8 years 52% of males with normally functioning aortic&#xD;
      valves already have aortic dilatation, implying that associated aortic stenosis and/or&#xD;
      regurgitation is not an obligate precursor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have demonstrated an association between bicuspid aortic valves and&#xD;
      dilatation of the aorta. Gurvitz et al. performed echocardiographic measurements of the&#xD;
      aortas of children and found that those with bicuspid aortic valves had significantly larger&#xD;
      aortas compared with controls, regardless of the presence of aortic stenosis or&#xD;
      regurgitation. Nevertheless, the definition of clinical predictors of the risk for the&#xD;
      development of aortic dilatation/dissection and an understanding of the mechanisms leading to&#xD;
      aortic dilatation are lacking. Specifically, it remains unclear as yet whether such&#xD;
      dilatation is secondary to abnormal flow patterns and shear stresses resulting from the&#xD;
      bicuspid valve morphology or whether it is a manifestation of a distinct underlying&#xD;
      structural problem with not only the aortic valve but also the aortic root including the&#xD;
      ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fernandes et al. recently reviewed the echocardiograms of 1,135 children with bicuspid aortic&#xD;
      valves and found that there were differences among the patients related to aortic valve&#xD;
      morphology. For instance, associated moderate or greater aortic stenosis was present in 9.7%&#xD;
      of patients with fusion of the intercoronary commissure of the aortic valve, vs 25.9% of&#xD;
      patients with fusion of the right-coronary and non-coronary commissure, and in none of the&#xD;
      patients with fusion of the left coronary and non-coronary aortic valve leaflets. Moreover,&#xD;
      fusion of the right coronary and non-coronary cusps resulted in a two-fold higher risk of at&#xD;
      least moderate aortic regurgitation compared with the other types of bicuspid aortic valves.&#xD;
      However, this generalized division of bicuspid aortic valves into three types based on which&#xD;
      commissure is fused is likely an oversimplification, and Fernandes did not report on the&#xD;
      relationship between valve morphology and aortic root dilatation. However, Novaro et al.&#xD;
      found that adult patients (mean age of 54 year) with fusion of the right/non-coronary&#xD;
      commissure tended to have larger mid-ascending aortas compared with patients with fusion of&#xD;
      the intercoronary commissure, but the difference did not reach statistical significance.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, both personal clinical observations and recent publications support the&#xD;
      assertion that individual bicuspid aortic valves may function quite differently from one&#xD;
      another. For instance, there are bicuspid aortic valves in which there are two nearly&#xD;
      symmetric leaflets whereas others may have a dominant cusp to varying degrees, resulting in a&#xD;
      markedly eccentric orifice when the valve opens. In an elegant experimental model using&#xD;
      excised bicuspid valves analyzed with intravascular ultrasound and high-resolution&#xD;
      videography, Robicsek et al demonstrated that asymmetric bicuspid valves &quot;induced extensive&#xD;
      recirculation vortices in the ascending aorta.&quot; They found that the vortex was not &quot;trapped&quot;&#xD;
      in the sinuses of Valsalva as it is in a normal tricuspid aortic valve, but instead is&#xD;
      extended into the ascending aorta and aimed toward the right anterolateral aspect of the&#xD;
      aorta (the convexity of the aorta). This correlates with published reports and our own&#xD;
      personal experience in performing clinical cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) studies&#xD;
      on patients with bicuspid aortic valves and aortic root dilatation in whom there is oft-noted&#xD;
      asymmetry in the pattern of dilatation of the ascending aorta and resulting in an oval-shaped&#xD;
      rather than a circular aortic root and ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extrapolating from the studies of Robicsek, variations present in the geometry of bicuspid&#xD;
      valves are likely to result in varying degrees of turbulence even in the absence aortic valve&#xD;
      stenosis. In theory, the turbulent blood flow directed at a particular segment of the aortic&#xD;
      wall may result in local changes to the aortic wall leading to asymmetric aortic dilatation.&#xD;
      These changes are postulated to result from receptors present on both endothelial and smooth&#xD;
      muscle cells that have the ability to adapt to sheer stress by altering local gene expression&#xD;
      which in turn modulates the tension between focal adhesion sites, integrins, and the&#xD;
      extracellular matrix. Moreover, fibrillin-1, which is deficient in patients with dilated&#xD;
      aortic roots and Marfan syndrome, has also been found to be deficient in the aortas of&#xD;
      patients with bicuspid aortic valves. Similarly, Cotrufo et al. found asymmetric patterns of&#xD;
      matrix protein expression and content and asymmetric patterns of elastic medial wall&#xD;
      degeneration in the aortic walls of patients with bicuspid aortic valves. In addition, these&#xD;
      investigators found differences between patients with bicuspid aortic valves and associated&#xD;
      stenosis vs regurgitation, suggesting that focally-directed aortic turbulence may be&#xD;
      influencing local gene expression and potentially explaining the asymmetric pattern of aortic&#xD;
      dilatation that is often observed. Lastly, several recent studies have highlighted the&#xD;
      relationship between circulating plasma MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels either in aortic dilatation in&#xD;
      adult patients with thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysms or in adults with aortic&#xD;
      dilatation secondary to systemic hypertension. In addition, histologic examination of aortic&#xD;
      aneurysm tissue in adult patients with bicuspid aortic valves demonstrated increased MMP-2&#xD;
      expression vs. aortic aneurysms in adults with trileaflet aortic valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently investigators have used cardiac MRI (CMR) to study flow patterns in the aorta. CMR&#xD;
      is a noninvasive technique that permits 3-dimensional anatomic characterization as well as&#xD;
      assessment of aortic flow. Markl et al. have used time-resolved 3-dimensional phase-contrast&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (3D-PCMRI) techniques to characterize aortic flow in both normal&#xD;
      adults and in adults after aortic root replacement. These authors established that&#xD;
      3-dimensional magnetic resonance velocity mapping was a useful technique to visualize and&#xD;
      qualitatively assess the complex aortic flow patterns in both normal controls and in patients&#xD;
      with aortic pathology. Similarly, Kvitting et al., who studied both adult volunteers and 2&#xD;
      patients with Marfan syndrome following aortic valve sparing operations, found that the&#xD;
      alterations to the normal aortic sinus architecture following surgery resulted in a loss of&#xD;
      the normal vortical flow patterns seen in the aortic sinuses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop clinically feasible MRI imaging strategies to perform a complete evaluation of&#xD;
           structure and functional dynamics of the heart, including the aortic valve, aortic root,&#xD;
           and ascending aorta, as well as full volumetric 3-D ciné flow velocity encoding of the&#xD;
           entire aortic root region and proximal ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Define qualitative and quantitative metrics to characterize different types of bicuspid&#xD;
           aortic valve morphology and flow patterns. These metrics will be based on structural&#xD;
           information and the blood flow patterns in the aortic root, observed in MRI studies of&#xD;
           patients with diagnosed bicuspid aortic valves, as compared to observation in control&#xD;
           subjects with known normal aortic valves and anatomy of ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Correlate different bicuspid aortic valve morphologies and observed characteristic flow&#xD;
           patterns with the risk of development of aortic dilatation at various levels of the&#xD;
           aorta, such as the aortic root, proximal ascending aorta, and distal ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quantify plasma concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix&#xD;
           metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels as well as the levels of their specific tissue&#xD;
           inhibitors, respectively tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) and tissue&#xD;
           inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in controls and bicuspid aortic valve&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Correlate biochemical markers of extracellular matrix degradation (both MMP and TIMP)&#xD;
           with the presence or absence of aortic dilatation in both controls and in patients with&#xD;
           bicuspid aortic valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design We will prospectively perform cardiac magnetic resonance studies on 30 patients,&#xD;
      ages 10-18 years with known bicuspid aortic valves (BAV), and on 15 normal control subjects.&#xD;
      The BAV patient population will consist of 15 patients with aortic root dilatation for body&#xD;
      surface area as determined by published pediatric echocardiographic normal values and 15&#xD;
      without aortic dilatation. Echocardiographic normals indexed for body surface area will be&#xD;
      used, as there are no published normal CMR values for aortic dimensions in pediatric patients&#xD;
      using cine MR techniques; however aortic measurements by echocardiography and CMR in a&#xD;
      pediatric patient population have been shown to reveal no significant differences except for&#xD;
      the descending aorta. Since either significant aortic stenosis or regurgitation has been&#xD;
      associated with aortic dilatation, patients will be excluded if they have more than mild&#xD;
      stenosis or regurgitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As in previous published reports, mild aortic stenosis will be classified as a mean gradient&#xD;
      across the aortic valve &lt;17 mmHg on routine clinical echocardiography. Mild aortic&#xD;
      regurgitation will be defined on routine clinical echocardiography as resulting in a left&#xD;
      ventricular end-diastolic dimension &lt;2 standard deviations below the mean for body surface&#xD;
      area and the absence of pan-diastolic retrograde flow on pulsed Doppler evaluation of the&#xD;
      abdominal descending aorta. Studies will be performed without sedation, but with&#xD;
      breath-holding instructions as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls will consist of 15 patients with normal aortic valves and aortas who are undergoing&#xD;
      clinically indicated CMR studies for reasons such as chest pain or assessment for&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy and who are found to have structurally/functionally normal hearts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI Methods Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) studies will be performed in a GE 1.5 T MR&#xD;
      system with Release 12M4 cardiovascular software. MR imaging will focus on of visualization&#xD;
      in high definition of the anatomy of the aortic valve and aortic root utilizing 2-dimensional&#xD;
      and 3-dimensional FIESTA cine MR sequences. Flow data will be acquired using 2-dimensional,&#xD;
      or, whenever allowed within imaging time constraints, fully 3-dimensional phase velocity&#xD;
      mapping sequences with full vector-encoding of velocities at 200 cm/s maximum velocity&#xD;
      encoding VENC, adjusted up if velocity aliasing is observed. For 2-D flow acquisitions in&#xD;
      planes across the main flow direction the in-plane directional components may be acquired at&#xD;
      lower velocity encoding to achieve higher accuracy. To resolve blood flow and cardiovascular&#xD;
      anatomy as a function of the cardiac phase (cine imaging), image acquisition will be&#xD;
      synchronized with the vector cardiogram to reconstruct approximately 16-20 cine images&#xD;
      representing the different phases of the cardiac cycle. Initial data acquisition for&#xD;
      structural and velocity-encoded imaging will be performed with standard pulse sequence&#xD;
      software as supplied by General Electric with the imaging device. These scans will initially&#xD;
      be acquired in free-breathing mode. A series of 5-10 studies on normal volunteers will be&#xD;
      conducted to optimize the protocol within those constraints, and develop guidelines for an&#xD;
      prescribed add-on imaging protocol, ideally limited to not more than 20 minutes of scan time,&#xD;
      for acquisition of the aortic scans. Priority solutions for respiratory motion compensation&#xD;
      during the acquisition depending on the demonstrated reliability of the available options&#xD;
      (free-breathing, breath-holding, respiratory k-space ordering, navigator- or belt &amp;&#xD;
      bellows-monitored respiratory gating) in these volunteer test studies, and based on the&#xD;
      capability of each study subject to accommodate these options. The scans defined in this&#xD;
      protocol will be added initially to the clinical protocol of all subjects in the study. In&#xD;
      parallel with the protocol development and implementation by standards pulse sequence&#xD;
      methods, we will pursue a collaboration effort with the MRI imaging resource center at&#xD;
      Stanford University. The Stanford group has developed a highly optimized image acquisition&#xD;
      method which allows fully vector-encoded 3-D respiration-ordered acquisition of an&#xD;
      arbitrarily positioned rectangular 3-D imaging volume. We anticipate that this acquisition&#xD;
      software, which will require running specialized pulse sequence software and off-line image&#xD;
      reconstruction on one of our computer workstations, will improve the coverage and overall&#xD;
      resolution of the flow-encoded data significantly. We have the required expertise and&#xD;
      research software tools available from General Electric, but currently only enabled for&#xD;
      research on the WCI scanner at Emory. For this project, but possibly concurrently with&#xD;
      transition of software development efforts for other research projects (Noquist project) we&#xD;
      will request authorization from GE to run the required research patches on the Egleston 1.5T&#xD;
      GE instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma MMP and TIMP quantification methods Blood samples will be taken from peripheral veins&#xD;
      by nursing staff.MMP and TIMP levels will then be measured using commercially available&#xD;
      sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits which have previously been validated&#xD;
      for use in human tissue homogenates.Serum MMP levels will be determined using MMP-2 and MMP-9&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies.Levels of TIMP-1 and -2 will be determined using monoclonal antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image Processing Methods Visualization and quantitative analysis of velocity mapping data&#xD;
      will be performed, initially exclusively, utilizing in-house HeartViz software developed by&#xD;
      Marijn Brummer, Ph.D.The current version of the software allows fully interactive 3-D dynamic&#xD;
      integrated display of structural information through texture-mapped slice display and&#xD;
      time-resolved volume rendering, in conjunction with dynamic flow vector field visualization&#xD;
      from multiple flow acquisitions in the same view. This software has been developed by the&#xD;
      investigators during the past ten years, and has been proposed and used for evaluation of a&#xD;
      variety of congenital and acquired cardiac diseases, including aortic coarctations, VSD,&#xD;
      aortic dissections, and peri-atrial tumors.&#xD;
