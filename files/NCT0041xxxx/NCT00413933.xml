    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the comprehensive multidisciplinary&#xD;
      intervention (geriatrician, physical therapist and occupational therapist falls risk&#xD;
      assessment and intervention)is effective in the falls prevention in the community dwelling&#xD;
      elderly.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Falls and related injuries among elderly people are a major public health problem&#xD;
      worldwide.All older people with recurrent falls or assessed as being at increased risk of&#xD;
      falling should be considered for an individualized multifactorial intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In successful multifactorial intervention programmes the following specific components are&#xD;
      common - against a background of the general diagnosis and management of causes and&#xD;
      recognized risk factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  home hazard assessment and intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vision assessment and referral&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medications list review with modification/withdrawal We will address to 4000 randomly&#xD;
           chosen patients from study population (elderly (65+) men and women, living in Beer-Sheva&#xD;
           and Ofakim , Israel and belonging to Clalit HMO). This telephone interview will be&#xD;
           conducted to reveal falls in last 12 months. The people who do fall (1 + falls) will be&#xD;
           invited to research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In that meeting the research assistant will explain about the study aims and ask them to sign&#xD;
      informed consent. Those who do not agree to participate - will be referred to their family&#xD;
      doctor for further assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who agree to participate in the study will fill in questionnaire about falls (causes,&#xD;
      circumstance, results). All will pass through: cognitive assessment by the Mini-Mental State&#xD;
      Examination (MMSE), affective assessment by the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS),&#xD;
      functional assessment by Barthel Index (BI), visual assessment by Snellen charts and basic&#xD;
      gait assessment by a &quot;Timed get Up and Go&quot; test (TU&amp;G).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that fulfill inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to the intervention&#xD;
      group or the control group. All participants will be instructed to call to the research&#xD;
      assistant closely to each fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All information about assessment of patients in both groups will be transferred to the family&#xD;
      physician. Their family physician according to his opinion will treat patients from usual&#xD;
      care group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A geriatrician, physiotherapist and occupational therapist will observe patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group. OT will conduct a home visit to assess hazard and level of risk factor&#xD;
      for falling. Results of assessment will be discussed on multi- disciplinary team meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to this plan each patient in this group will receive one or more following&#xD;
      interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Written recommendation to the family physician for medication adjustment. As well, the&#xD;
           geriatrician will discuss with family physician these recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recommendation to the family physician to refer the patient to optometrist/&#xD;
           ophthalmologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Physical therapy: each subject in intervention group will get 15 weekly sessions (each&#xD;
           session - 45 minutes) of specified exercise from a physical therapist that specializes&#xD;
           in fall prevention and walking device recommendations. All subjects will get brochure&#xD;
           for home exercise. It will be expected for intervention group to exercise twice daily,&#xD;
           each time for 20 minutes in addition to the PT sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Occupational therapy: OT will make recommendation for changing any unsafe environments&#xD;
           in the home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First follow-up (four months after baseline assessment):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. OT will make a second home visit to each subject of the intervention group to check&#xD;
           recommendation fulfillment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study assistant will repeat baseline assessment (MMSE, GDS, BI, TU&amp;G and visual&#xD;
           assessment by Snellen chart).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Information about falls and injuries as well as health care utilization will be&#xD;
           collected from Clalit computerized system and Soroka Medical Center data base.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Information about medication adjustment and changes will be collected from Clalit&#xD;
           computerized system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second follow-up (12 months after baseline assessment ) :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study assistant will repeat baseline assessment (MMSE, GDS, BI, TUG test and visual&#xD;
           assessment by Snellen chart).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Information about falls and injuries as well as health care utilization will be&#xD;
           collected from Clalit computerized system and Soroka Medical Center data base.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Information about medication adjustment and changes will be collected from Clalit&#xD;
           computerized system.&#xD;
