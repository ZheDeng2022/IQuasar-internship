  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare standardized chiropractic treatment (spinal&#xD;
      manipulation) to back surgery (microdiscectomy) for patients with sciatica secondary to&#xD;
      lumbar herniated disc refractory to medical management.&#xD;

      Context: Operative management of lumbar radiculopathy caused by lumbar disc herniation (LDH)&#xD;
      in patients refractory to medical management provides rapid and effective symptom relief.&#xD;
      However, both short and long term benefits of surgery continue to be scrutinized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare clinical efficacy of Chiropractic Treatment against Microdiscectomy in&#xD;
      patients suffering from sciatica secondary to LDH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial allowing crossover,&#xD;
      recruitment 2000-2004, 1 year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Elective primary care physician referrals made directly to neurosurgical spine&#xD;
      surgeons at the Foothills Hospital and Medical Centre, University of Calgary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Forty consecutive consenting patients with sciatica from LDH refractory to at least&#xD;
      three months of non-operative care and found appropriate for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Surgical microdiscectomy or standardized chiropractic treatment. Crossover to&#xD;
      the alternate treatment allowed after 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures: McGill Pain Score, Roland Morris Disability Index, Aberdeen Pain&#xD;
      Scale, and SF-36 General Health Survey before treatment initiation and after 3, 6, 12, 24 and&#xD;
      52 weeks.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consecutive patients presenting through elective referral by primary care physicians&#xD;
             to one of the three participating spinal neurosurgeons (SC, SJD, RJH) between December&#xD;
             2000 and May 2004 were screened for symptoms of unilateral lumbar radiculopathy&#xD;
             secondary to LDH at L3/4, L4/5 or L5/S1. Detailed surgical histories and physical&#xD;
             examinations were performed on each referred patient by the consulting neurosurgeon&#xD;
             and correlated with evidence of appropriate root compression on MR imaging. Patients&#xD;
             who had failed at least 3 months of non-operative management including treatment with&#xD;
             analgesics, lifestyle modification, physiotherapy, massage therapy and / or&#xD;
             acupuncture, and who were felt appropriate for microdiscectomy by the neurosurgeon&#xD;
             were asked to consider study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radicular symptoms &lt; 3 months duration&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Substance abuse&#xD;
