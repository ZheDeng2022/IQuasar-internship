             past medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and&#xD;
             laboratory tests at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vital signs within the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female subjects must have been surgically sterilized at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
             screening, with supportive clinical documentation OR Postmenopausal women must have no&#xD;

          -  Smokers (use of tobacco products in the previous 3 months). Smokers will be defined as&#xD;
             any subject who reports tobacco use or has a urine cotinine greater than 300 ng/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in any clinical investigation involving medical intervention within 4&#xD;
             weeks before study start&#xD;

          -  Donation or loss of 400 ml or more of blood within 8 weeks prior to before study start&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant illness within 2 weeks before study start&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A past personal or close family medical history of clinically significant ECG&#xD;
             abnormalities or of a prolonged QT-interval syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of autonomic dysfunction (e.g. history of fainting, orthostatic hypotension).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of acute or chronic bronchospastic disease (including asthma and chronic&#xD;
             obstructive pulmonary disease, treated or not treated),&#xD;

             urticaria, eczematous dermatitis). A known hypersensitivity to the study drug or drugs&#xD;
             similar to the study drug particularly benzodiazepines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,&#xD;
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs or which may jeopardize the subject in&#xD;
             case of participation in the study, including bowel, gastrointestinal, renal,&#xD;
             pancreatic, hepatic, hematological, immunological, or neurological disorders.&#xD;
