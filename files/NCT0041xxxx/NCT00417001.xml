    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy for investigation of lower gastrointestinal complaints or for colon cancer&#xD;
      screening is one of the more frequent procedures performed by the Divisions of General&#xD;
      Surgery and Gastroenterology. Traditionally, this has been performed while under conscious&#xD;
      sedation (medication induced) which may improve patient acceptance and tolerance of the&#xD;
      procedure but adds to the operative risk of the procedure. The investigators propose a&#xD;
      randomized prospective blinded trial to assess the utility of adding pleasing olfactory&#xD;
      stimulation to the inhaled oxygen during the conscious sedation for colonoscopy in an effort&#xD;
      to reduce the total doses of sedatives required while maintaining a similar level of&#xD;
      sedation. This may decrease the overall period of recovery for the patient, increase the&#xD;
      number of procedures which may be accomplished, and decrease the potential complications&#xD;
      related to conscious sedation.&#xD;

      4. RESEARCH DESIGN/METHODS/SUBJECT JUSTIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General Approach Two hundred and eighty four patients presenting to the endoscopy clinic&#xD;
           will be offered participation in the study. They will be randomized to either 1 ml of&#xD;
           sterile water or 1 ml of cherry scented flavoring (Lorann Oils Inc, Lansing MI)&#xD;
           (identical oil used by our pediatric anesthesiologists for scenting the anesthesia mask&#xD;
           during the induction phase of general anesthesia). These will be connected to the inline&#xD;
           oxygen tubing via an Leukens trap with oxygen flowing at 4 liters/ minute rate and&#xD;
           titrated to maintain a pulse oximetry saturation level of over 90%. The water or&#xD;
           flavoring will not be nebulized into the oxygen. The oxygen will pass through the&#xD;
           inactive Leukens trap container and pick up whatever aroma is present. A BIS monitor&#xD;
           (Aspect Medical Systems Newton MA) will be applied. Data will be recorded at 5 minute&#xD;
           intervals (BIS scores). The BIS score will not be used to titrate the sedative&#xD;
           medications since the literature is controversial as to whether a given BIS score is&#xD;
           consistently considered adequate sedation. Total recovery time (post procedure), BIS&#xD;
           scores, and sedative doses will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Research Objective To determine if the addition of pleasing olfactory stimulation&#xD;
                can reduce the total dose required for sedatives, decrease the recovery time&#xD;
                required but maintain the same levels of sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Detail how many groups or arms are in the study and what each receives ' Two groups&#xD;
                will be used. One will receive inhalation of cherry flavored essential oil and the&#xD;
                other sterile water.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Randomization Procedures A computer generated block randomized schedule will be&#xD;
                used. The patients will be randomized the day of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methods and Materials Two hundred and eighty four consecutive patients presenting for&#xD;
           elective colonoscopy with endoscopist provided sedation (ASA 1 and 2 per NMCP policy)&#xD;
           will be offered participation in the trial. They will be consented the day of the&#xD;
           procedure by one of the subinvestigators and randomized to either receive olfactory&#xD;
           stimulation by cherry flavored oil (via in line aerosol chamber similar to nebulizer&#xD;
           treatments) or sterile water. A standard volume of 1 ml will be placed in the chamber&#xD;
           without additional water. A BIS monitor will be placed and BIS scores recorded at time&#xD;
           zero (prior to sedation) and every 5 minutes during the procedure. The BIS score will&#xD;
           not be used to titrate sedation rather the clinical parameters used by the endoscopist&#xD;
           will be used (pulse oximetry, blood pressure, heart rate, clinical level of arousal)&#xD;
           because it is controversial in the literature using BIS scores to titrate conscious&#xD;
           sedation. The BIS scores will provide an additional rough estimate as to the equivalence&#xD;
           of levels of sedation during the procedure. Total doses of medications, BIS scores,&#xD;
           procedure duration, and recovery duration will be recorded.&#xD;
