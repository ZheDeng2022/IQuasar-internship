  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this repeated dose study is to develop recommended dosing information for&#xD;
      initiation of therapy with OROS Hydromorphone in patients with chronic non-malignant pain&#xD;
      converting from other strong oral or transdermal opioids. It will also assist in the&#xD;
      development of a recommended starting dose by which patients can be titrated to an&#xD;
      appropriate maintenance dose of OROS Hydromorphone HCI. The safety profile for OROS&#xD;
      Hydromorphone HCI will also be evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This single-blind (with respect to dose), repeated dose study evaluating patients with&#xD;
      chronic non-malignant pain was conducted in tandem with a similar protocol in patients with&#xD;
      chronic cancer pain. A total of 463 patients were enrolled and evaluated in these studies.&#xD;
      Patients receiving chronic opioid therapy were converted to once daily OROS hydromorphone&#xD;
      using oral morphine equivalents. Supplementary immediate-release (IR) hydromorphone was&#xD;
      provided for breakthrough pain. The dose of OROS hydromorphone was escalated after every 2&#xD;
      days of therapy until no more than 3 doses of immediate-release(IR) hydromorphone were&#xD;
      required in a 24-hour period. Once a patient could be maintained on a stable dose of OROS&#xD;
      hydromorphone for 3 consecutive days, the patient entered a 2-week maintenance phase.&#xD;
      Patients who completed the study were eligible for participation in an OROS hydromorphone&#xD;
      long-term extension study, Study DO-109. The hypothesis is the 24-hour controlled-release&#xD;
      form of oral hydromorphone may provide consistent pain relief, convenient dosing, and&#xD;
      enhanced compliance while possibly decreasing the incidence of side effects associated with&#xD;
      peak (high) and trough (low) fluctuations in plasma drug concentrations typically seen with&#xD;
      immediate-release dosage formulations. Patients received OROS Hydromorphone HCI at Visit 2,3,&#xD;
      and 4(either 8,16,32, and/or 64mg tablets) taken orally. OROS Hydromorphone HCI doses were&#xD;
      titrated after every two days of therapy as necessary until dose stabilization occurred,&#xD;
      followed by a two week Maintenance Therapy Phase.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have chronic non-malignant pain, including pain associated with AIDS, who&#xD;
             are currently receiving strong oral or transdermal opioid analgesics, or patients who&#xD;
             are currently receiving opioids plus non-opioid combination analgesics, and have&#xD;
             persisting pain&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients who require at least 45 mg of oral morphine or opioid equivalent every 24&#xD;
             hours for the management of chronic non-malignant pain&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients who can reasonably be expected to have stable opioid requirements for the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients intolerant of or hypersensitive to hydromorphone (or other opioid agonists)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients who have dysphagia or are unable to swallow tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with severe respiratory compromise or severely depressed ventilatory function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with any gastrointestinal disorder, including pre-existing severe GI&#xD;
             narrowing(pathologic or iatrogenic), that may affect the absorption or transit of&#xD;
             orally administered drugs or have an acute abdominal condition that may be obscured by&#xD;
             opioids&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with clinically significant impaired renal or hepatic function, Addison's&#xD;
             disease, hypothyroidism, prostatic hypertrophy, or urethral stricture&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients who are known active drug abusers or alcoholics&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with any significant CNS disorder, including but not limited to head injury,&#xD;
             intracranial lesion, increased intracranial pressure, seizure disorder, stroke within&#xD;
             the past 6 months, and disorders of cognition&#xD;
