  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study, conducted by the National Cancer Institute and the Massachusetts General&#xD;
      Hospital, will investigate genetic factors that contribute to the development of chordoma in&#xD;
      people from some families. Chordoma is a very rare, potentially fatal, slow-growing bone&#xD;
      tumor derived from remnants of embryonic material. This study will determine the feasibility&#xD;
      of conducting a larger study aimed at identifying new families with multiple members affected&#xD;
      by chordoma to study the genetic basis of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      English-speaking persons diagnosed with chordoma when they were 18 years of age or younger&#xD;
      and who were treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Radiation Oncology&#xD;
      between 1988 and the end of the study period may be eligible for this protocol. The age range&#xD;
      of these patients is currently from about 5 months to 33 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients (or parents of minor patients) will be mailed a packet with instructions for&#xD;
      completing the following procedures at home:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide permission for researchers to obtain medical records relating to the patient's&#xD;
           chordoma and any other serious medical conditions he or she has had, and to obtain a&#xD;
           piece of the patient's stored tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a questionnaire about the patient's close blood relatives, including parents,&#xD;
           brothers, sisters, and any more distant relatives who have had chordoma or a cancer or&#xD;
           tumor which started in the brain or spine. The questionnaire will also include&#xD;
           demographic information, such as education, marital status, ethnicity, religion, and&#xD;
           household income.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect two samples of cheek cells (only from patients 6 years and older). Patients'&#xD;
           packets include instructions and materials for collecting the cells. Parents of children&#xD;
           6 to 9 years old will collect cells from the child's mouth using a sterile soft-bristled&#xD;
           brush contained in a tube. They will brush the inside of the child's cheek with the&#xD;
           brush for about 30 seconds and then place the brush back in the tube. They will repeat&#xD;
           this procedure with a second brush. Patients 10 years of age and older will rinse their&#xD;
           mouth for about 45 seconds with a mouthwash provided in their packets and then spit the&#xD;
           mouthwash into a collection container. They will repeat the procedure several hours&#xD;
           later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will return the signed permission forms, questionnaires, and cheek cell&#xD;
      samples to the researchers in a pre-addressed stamped envelope, which is also provided in the&#xD;
      packet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chordoma is a rare, slow growing, potentially fatal bone tumor derived from remnants of&#xD;
      vestigial or ectopic notochord. It occurs almost exclusively in the axial skeleton (skull&#xD;
      base, vertebrae, sacrum and coccyx), is somewhat more frequent in males than females, and has&#xD;
      a median age at diagnosis of 58.5 years, with a range from early childhood to over 70 years.&#xD;
      This typically sporadic tumor usually presents at an advanced stage and the associated&#xD;
      mortality is high due to local destruction or distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, we identified several families with chordoma in multiple relatives in a pattern&#xD;
      consistent with transmission of an autosomal dominant trait. Using clinical and genotyping&#xD;
      information from three such families, we mapped a familial chordoma gene to chromosome 7q33.&#xD;
      Now, we need to identify more multiplex chordoma families to participate in studies to fine&#xD;
      map and clone this gene. To do this, we established collaboration with Dr. Norbert Liebsch,&#xD;
      Department of Radiation Oncology (DRO), Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Boston. Since&#xD;
      1975, this department has treated ~500 patients with chordoma of the skull base or cervical&#xD;
      spine from all over the world; about 400 of these patients speak English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a pilot study based on up to 80 English-speaking MGH chordoma patients&#xD;
      diagnosed age 18 years for whom Dr. Liebsch is the physician of record. We chose this group&#xD;
      because of Dr. Liebsch's personal knowledge of the patients and the fact that young age at&#xD;
      diagnosis may indicate increased genetic susceptibility to chordoma. A major purpose of the&#xD;
      pilot study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a larger study encompassing the&#xD;
      remaining (~320) English-speaking MGH chordoma patients. The major goal of the full study&#xD;
      would be to identify new multiplex chordoma families to participate in clinical and gene&#xD;
      mapping studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection components of the pilot study include 1) a family medical history&#xD;
      questionnaire completed by each patient/parent or next of kin in person or over the&#xD;
      telephone, 2) collecting buccal cells from each patient ~ age 6 years via a mailed buccal&#xD;
      cell collection kit, 3) abstracting information about each patient's past medical history&#xD;
      from the DRO/MGH medical records, and 4) obtaining paraffin blocks or slides on each&#xD;
      chordoma/other primary cancer from the MGH Pathology Department or relevant outside&#xD;
      institutions. DNA from buccal cells and tumor will be used for molecular studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will re-contact any family from the pilot study who reports chordoma or astrocytoma in at&#xD;
      least one blood relative of the MGH patient. If we confirm these diagnoses we will invite&#xD;
      selected family members to participate in clinical and gene mapping studies conducted under a&#xD;
      separate NIH approved protocol. We will consider the pilot study to be a success if up to 30-&#xD;
      35 of the 80 chordoma patients/parents/next of kin participate in it, OR if we identify a new&#xD;
      multiplex chordoma family that is willing to participate in clinical and gene mapping&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

&#xD;
        All English-speaking persons diagnosed with chordoma at age 18 years or less either at MGH&#xD;
        or elsewhere, and treated by DRO, MGH between 1988 and the end of the study period (n&#xD;
        =100). Ages will range from 5 months - 33 years. There is no age limit fo the&#xD;
        self-administered questionnaire or the telephone interview because a parent can complete it&#xD;
        on behalf of any case who is less than 18 years, but collection of buccal cells will be&#xD;
        limited to cases older than or equal to age 6 years.&#xD;
