  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of exercise training on insulin&#xD;
      resistance in subjects with coronary artery disease independent of changes in weight, diet,&#xD;
      or the effect of an acute bout of exercise. We hypothesized that subjects with CAD and high&#xD;
      normal or impaired glucose tolerance performing 12 weeks of aerobic exercise training while&#xD;
      on a non weight-reducing diet, would have a greater decrease in insulin resistance than&#xD;
      controls measured at 72 hours following their last bout of exercise.&#xD;

      Objectives To determine the effects of exercise training on insulin resistance in CAD&#xD;
      subjects without diabetes, independent of changes in weight, diet, or the effect of acute&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the Research Ethics Review Boards at London and Hamilton. All&#xD;
      participants provided written and verbal informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria The study population will include men and women over 18 years of age&#xD;
      identified from the practices of local cardiologists, whose fasting plasma glucose&#xD;
      concentration is 5.4-7.7 mmol/L, and who had confirmed CAD (diagnosed on the basis of a&#xD;
      previous myocardial perfusion study or cardiac catheterization, or a history of a myocardial&#xD;
      infarction or coronary artery angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria Individuals will be excluded if they had known type 1 or 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      clinical heart failure, uncorrected significant valvular or congenital heart disease,&#xD;
      significant obstructive pulmonary disease (forced expiratory volume in 1 sec / forced vital&#xD;
      capacity &lt; 0.5), uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure &gt; 220 / 120 mm Hg), participation&#xD;
      in a regular exercise program within the preceding three months, inability to perform&#xD;
      exercise training, atrial fibrillation, a permanent pacemaker or regularly used&#xD;
      corticosteroid. Individuals who had experienced a myocardial infarction, unstable angina,&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or coronary artery angioplasty within the 3 months&#xD;
      prior to study entry were also excluded. Furthermore, individuals were excluded if their&#xD;
      run-in phase fasting blood glucose was &lt; 5.4 mmol/L or &gt; 11.1 mmol/L at 2 hours following the&#xD;
      75 gram oral glucose load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit Individuals who satisfied the above criteria underwent a screening visit&#xD;
      comprising a full explanation of the study, appropriate history and physical evaluation by&#xD;
      one of the study physicians (NGS or RSM). Height (m), weight (kg), waist and hip&#xD;
      circumference (cm), and percentage body fat using bioelectrical impedance were measured. A&#xD;
      75g OGTT, using fasting and 2 hour samples, was then performed following an overnight (≥12&#xD;
      hour) fast. Participants satisfying the study selection criteria subsequently entered the&#xD;
      run-in-phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in Phase The study dietician assessed all participants and administered a 24-hour food&#xD;
      recall and semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. An individualized isocaloric AHA&#xD;
      Phase I diet with written and verbal instructions was prescribed to each patient.&#xD;
      Participants were also taught how to complete a three-day measured food record. The purpose&#xD;
      of the run-in phase was to have participants follow an AHA Phase I diet for at least 3 weeks,&#xD;
      therefore the duration of the run-in phase was zero, three, or six weeks depending on the&#xD;
      patient's current diet as determined by the study dietician. At the midpoint of the run-in&#xD;
      phase, food records were reviewed to ensure completeness of food descriptions, preparation&#xD;
      methods, portion sizes, and additional dietary counseling was provided as required. Baseline&#xD;
      testing was carried out on completion of the run-in diet phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Testing Measurements included OGTT, waist circumference, body fat, a symptom-limited&#xD;
      CET with measurement of oxygen consumption, and the 3-hour FSIGT to determine insulin&#xD;
      resistance. The CET was performed on the first day of the subject's baseline assessments. On&#xD;
      the morning of the CET participants were instructed to take their usual medications, to eat&#xD;
      only a light breakfast and to abstain from caffeine. VO2 was continuously measured throughout&#xD;
      the CET and the peak VO2 served as the index of exercise capacity. The CET was conducted&#xD;
      according to accepted guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FSIGT was performed 72 hours following the baseline CET after an overnight fast.&#xD;
      Intravenous cannulas were placed in the antecubital vein of each arm. A glucose injection&#xD;
      (500mg/kg as a 50% solution) was given over 1 minute starting at time 0 minutes. Blood&#xD;
      samples for the determination of glucose and insulin were taken at -10, -5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8,&#xD;
      10, 12, 14, 16, 19, 22, 24, 25, 27, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, and 180&#xD;
      minutes following the conclusion of the glucose infusion. Twenty minutes following the start&#xD;
      of the intravenous glucose, 0.04 U/kg of human insulin (Novolin R) was injected. Insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity was determined using the validated MINMOD-IS technique. The MINMOD-IS&#xD;
      determination was made by one of the investigators (DF) blinded to the patient's group&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After satisfactory completion of baseline testing, participants were randomized to either&#xD;
      12-weeks of ET or UA. Randomization was computer generated following a non-blocked strategy&#xD;
      and delivered using sealed envelopes. All individuals recording the outcome measurements were&#xD;
      blinded to the group allocations of the participants. In order to maintain a stable weight&#xD;
      throughout the study and in addition to the well-controlled AHA Phase I diet, ET participants&#xD;
      underwent supervised weekly weigh-ins and were prescribed supplemental food in proportion to&#xD;
      the AHA Phase I diet by the study dietician if weight loss of ≥ 1 kg occurred on two&#xD;
      consecutive weekly supervised weigh-ins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the UA group were instructed to continue their usual activity and to follow&#xD;
      the AHA Phase I diet that was used in the week prior to randomization and to weigh themselves&#xD;
      weekly on the same home scale, first thing in the morning with minimal attire. Participants&#xD;
      contacted the study dietician if ≥ 1 kg weight change occurred over two weeks. Appropriate&#xD;
      dietary adjustments were then made to ensure a stable weight. The ET group was prescribed&#xD;
      exercise 4 times/week for 12 weeks. This exercise comprised walking, stationary cycling or&#xD;
      treadmill exercise for 40 minutes per session at 75% of their baseline CET peak heart rate&#xD;
      with 5-minute warm up and cool down periods. Participants were taught how to monitor their&#xD;
      heart rate during exercise and to adjust their exercise intensity accordingly. Two of these&#xD;
      sessions were conducted under supervision at the Hamilton Health Science Cardiac&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Program while the remaining sessions were carried out at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten to 12 weeks following randomization all participants underwent endpoint assessments,&#xD;
      which comprised the same testing as baseline. These assessments were OGTT &amp; clinical&#xD;
      evaluation (week 11), CET (week 12) and FSIGT (72 hours after CET). All participants were&#xD;
      instructed not to perform any exercise training between the final CET and FSIGT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Issues Fifty subjects overall were required to satisfy the study's sample size&#xD;
      assumptions that at least a 15% decrease of insulin resistance with ET compared to UA could&#xD;
      be demonstrated with 80% power, a 2-tailed alpha error of 5%, and a potential 20% loss to&#xD;
      follow up rate. A Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test was used to compare the change in MINMOD-IS over the&#xD;
      course of the study between the ET and UA groups. Remaining analyses comparing outcomes&#xD;
      between the ET and UA groups utilized independent t-tests for continuous data with normal&#xD;
      distributions and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Tests for continuous data that were not normally&#xD;
      distributed. Regression analyses were done to evaluate relationships between the change of&#xD;
      MINMOD-IS during the study and other important study variables such as changes in weight and&#xD;
      peak VO2. Analyses were deemed significant if a two-tailed P-value of &lt; 0.05 was achieved.&#xD;
      All values are reported as the mean +/- standard deviation unless otherwise specified.&#xD;
