  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to investigate the role of genes that may point to a&#xD;
      higher risk of developing a glioma. Researchers will use new gene mapping techniques to study&#xD;
      how high-risk factors are passed on through a family's genes and increase the risk of&#xD;
      developing gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose an international multi-center, multidisciplinary study consortium, GLIOGENE, to&#xD;
      identify susceptibility genes in high-risk familial brain tumor pedigrees using the most&#xD;
      sophisticated genetic analysis methods available. To address our hypothesis, we propose the&#xD;
      following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Establish a cohort of 400 high-risk pedigrees for genetic linkage analysis. To date,&#xD;
      we have identified and collected biologic samples from 20 high-risk families that have met&#xD;
      our criteria of 2 or more relatives diagnosed with a brain tumor. From the 15 centers in the&#xD;
      United States and Europe, we will screen and obtain epidemiologic data from approximately&#xD;
      17,080 gliomas cases to identify a target of 400 families for genetic analysis. We will&#xD;
      establish a cohort of the first and second-degree relatives from these glioma cases to obtain&#xD;
      new knowledge about how cancer aggregates in glioma families. We will also acquire&#xD;
      biospecimens (blood and tumor tissue), and risk factor data from relevant family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Identify candidate regions linked to familial brain tumors. To strengthen evidence of&#xD;
      linkage to regions found in our preliminary analysis and to identify additional regions&#xD;
      linked to brain tumors, we will genotype informative glioma pedigrees identified in aim 1&#xD;
      using Affymetrix 10K GeneChip with markers spaced throughout the genome, and conduct a&#xD;
      genome-wide multipoint linkage scan with these markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Fine map the regions established in Aim 2 by genotyping selected SNPs from genome&#xD;
      databases. We will attempt to further refine the regions identified in Aim 2 to less than 1cM&#xD;
      by using approximately 1,500 - 2,000 carefully selected SNPs. The prioritization of regions&#xD;
      will be based on a combination of the strength of evidence for linkage from families of&#xD;
      various ethnic backgrounds and the presence of obvious candidate genes.&#xD;

      A consortium (group) of researchers wants to learn more about gliomas as well as the risk&#xD;
      factors (such as environmental and genetic information) for patients with this kind of brain&#xD;
      tumor. Participants in this study will be part of a glioma genetic epidemiology study (herein&#xD;
      referred to as &quot;GLIOGENE&quot;) involving eleven centers in the United States (U.S.) and five&#xD;
      centers in Europe. The eleven centers in the U.S. are: The University of Texas MD Anderson&#xD;
      Cancer Center (MD Anderson); Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital (TCH);&#xD;
      Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH); Case Western Reserve University (CWRU); Columbia&#xD;
      University Medical Center (CUMD); Duke University (Duke); Mayo Clinic Rochester (Mayo);&#xD;
      Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC); University of California, San Francisco&#xD;
      (UCSF); University of Illinois, Chicago (UIC); and Evanston Northwest Healthcare (ENWH). The&#xD;
      five centers in Europe are: Gertner Institute, Israel (Gertner); Institute of Cancer&#xD;
      Epidemiology, Denmark (ICE); Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), United Kingdom (U.K.);&#xD;
      Tampere University Hospital (TU) and Umeå University Hospital, Sweden (Umeå).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have about 3 tablespoons of blood drawn. If&#xD;
      you are unable to donate blood, researchers will collect a saliva sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, if you have 2 or more family members with a glioma, a trained research&#xD;
      interviewer will ask you questions using a questionnaire that will take about 30-40 minutes&#xD;
      to complete. The topics in the questionnaire will include demographic data (such as age and&#xD;
      race), environmental exposures, medical history, family history of cancer and other&#xD;
      conditions, and other lifestyle factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will only use any names and contact information of relatives or other potential&#xD;
      research participants provided to MD Anderson in order to contact those individuals to find&#xD;
      out if they are eligible and desire to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before your blood and/or saliva is sent to TCH for banking, your name and any personal&#xD;
      identifying information will be coded to protect your privacy. MD Anderson will not have&#xD;
      oversight of any leftover blood and/or saliva that will be banked by THC for additional&#xD;
      research. Blood and saliva that are collected will only be used by researchers involved in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither you nor your physicians will receive individual reports of this research. Results&#xD;
      will not be placed in your health records. All information will be kept confidential and used&#xD;
      only for research purposes. For the results, your sample, contact and medical information&#xD;
      will be linked by assigning an identification number (instead of your name).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that any participant has participated in prior glioma studies conducted by&#xD;
      Melissa L. Bondy (ID00-098 or ID 91-036), signing the informed consent for this study will&#xD;
      allow us to use their specimens previously collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a rare chance that a research team member could be accidentally exposed to your&#xD;
      blood or body fluids. If that occurs, extra blood (about 2 teaspoons) may be drawn to test&#xD;
      for infections such as hepatitis and HIV (the AIDS virus). An existing blood sample may be&#xD;
      used for these tests instead. You will be told that your blood is being tested and the&#xD;
      results of your test. Researchers will ask how you would like to receive the results, such as&#xD;
      by phone or certified letter. The test results and your name, address, date of birth, and sex&#xD;
      will be recorded in the confidential MD Anderson medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you test positive for hepatitis or HIV, the test results and your name, address, date of&#xD;
      birth, and sex will be shared with appropriate health authorities as required by law. You&#xD;
      will also be given a list of places in your area so that you can receive further testing and&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation will be over in this study after the data has been collected and&#xD;
      finalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 17,080 participants will take part in this&#xD;
      multicenter study. Up to 9,000 will be enrolled at M.D. Anderson.&#xD;
