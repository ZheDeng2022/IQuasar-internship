      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this phase I-II study is to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I: Assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib in a weekly schedule with&#xD;
           bevacizumab given every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Using the MTD established in phase I, assess efficacy of the combination as&#xD;
           indicated by progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response rates and duration of response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 year survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative and quantitative toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) prior to treatment, prior to cycle 2, and/or at the&#xD;
           time of progression&#xD;

      Bortezomib is designed to enter cells and interfere with a substance found inside cells that&#xD;
      is responsible for allowing cells to divide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avastin® is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the&#xD;
      growth of blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, depending on when you enroll, you&#xD;
      will be assigned to one of up to 4 treatment groups. There will be 3 participants in each of&#xD;
      the first few groups, and an additional 30 participants in the last group. The first few (2&#xD;
      or 3) groups are part of the first phase of the study, and the last group (3rd or 4th) is&#xD;
      part of the second phase. All participants will receive the same dose level of Avastin®. The&#xD;
      amount of bortezomib you receive will depend on when you enroll in the study. The exact dose&#xD;
      of bortezomib that you receive will be based on your height and weight. In the first phase of&#xD;
      the study, groups of participants will be assigned to one of 2 bortezomib dose levels. The&#xD;
      first group will receive the highest dose. The next groups will receive either that same dose&#xD;
      level, or if intolerable side effects occurred, a lower dose level. For the second part of&#xD;
      the study, the last group will receive the highest dose level that did not cause intolerable&#xD;
      side effects in the other groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cycle of treatment is 3 weeks (21 days). Bortezomib will be given once a week for the first&#xD;
      2 weeks of each cycle. Avastin® will be given every 3 weeks. (On Day 1 of each cycle, you&#xD;
      will receive both bortezomib and Avastin®.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bortezomib will be injected through a needle in your vein. Each injection will last about 3-5&#xD;
      seconds. After receiving each dose of bortezomib, the clinic staff will check how well you&#xD;
      are tolerating the drug. During that time, you will be asked about any side effects you may&#xD;
      be experiencing. Your doctor may decrease or pause the dose of bortezomib if you experience&#xD;
      certain side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avastin® will be given as an infusion through a needle in your vein, over 90 minutes. If you&#xD;
      tolerate the 90-minute infusion well, the second infusion will be given over 60 minutes. If&#xD;
      you tolerate the 60-minute infusion well, all following infusions will be given over 30&#xD;
      minutes. If you do not tolerate the shorter infusion time, future infusion times will be&#xD;
      increased until a tolerable level is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 weeks, you will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and&#xD;
      weight. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You will have a&#xD;
      performance status evaluation. On Day 8 of each cycle of treatment, blood (about 2 teaspoons)&#xD;
      will be drawn for routine tests. The level of protein in your urine will be monitored at&#xD;
      least every 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue receiving study treatment for as long as the cancer responds to the&#xD;
      treatment or for up to 1 year. Your doctor may decide to take you off this study if you&#xD;
      experience intolerable side effects or your health gets worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have stopped taking the study treatment, you will have a physical exam, including&#xD;
      measurement of vital signs. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You&#xD;
      will have a performance status evaluation, chest x-ray, and a CT or MRI scan. On an&#xD;
      indefinite basis, the study nurse will contact you by telephone from time to time to see how&#xD;
      you are doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Bortezomib has been FDA approved and it is registered in&#xD;
      Europe for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior&#xD;
      therapy. Avastin® has been FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer. However, bortezomib and Avastin® are not FDA-approved for this&#xD;
      type of cancer, and they have been authorized for use together in research only. Up to 42&#xD;
      patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
