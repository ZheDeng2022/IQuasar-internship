    <textblock>
      Current improvements of the design of the upper limb prosthesis include advanced technology&#xD;
      in control systems and electronic circuitry that mimic human motion and improve function of&#xD;
      the prosthesis. Often times these improvements require large amounts of power, circuitry and&#xD;
      excess mass distally along the prosthesis that may require greater effort from the user. Poor&#xD;
      function of an upper limb prosthesis may cause awkward compensatory motion. Aberrant&#xD;
      movements, such as these compensatory movements are known to cause greater stress to&#xD;
      remaining joints. Amputees are forced to decide if the extra function provided by the&#xD;
      advanced electronics is worth carrying the extra mass which may cause fatigue, socket issues&#xD;
      and greater stress on the remaining joints. An example is the wrist rotator component of an&#xD;
      upper limb prosthesis which may allow greater function and reduce compensatory motion, but&#xD;
      adds mass distally, potentially causing greater torques on remaining joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GOALS OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two main goals of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine the impact of an upper limb prosthesis without a wrist rotator on the&#xD;
           compensatory motion and torques in the remaining joints during common tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the impact of the location (distally or proximally) of a wrist rotator on a&#xD;
           upper limb prosthesis on the compensatory motion during common tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There will be a statistically significant difference in range of motion of the upper&#xD;
           limb joints between healthy subjects, braced subjects and upper limb amputees during&#xD;
           four common tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There will be a statistically significant difference in joint upper limb joint torques&#xD;
           between healthy subjects, braced subjects and upper limb amputees during three common&#xD;
           tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There will be a statistically significant difference in upper limb angles and joint&#xD;
           torques between mass added distally and mass added proximally during common tasks.&#xD;

      PROBLEM STATEMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current improvements of the design of the upper limb prosthesis include advanced technology&#xD;
      in control systems and electronic circuitry that mimic human motion and improve function of&#xD;
      the prosthesis. Often times these improvements require large amounts of power, circuitry and&#xD;
      excess mass distally along the prosthesis that may require greater effort from the user. Poor&#xD;
      function of an upper limb prosthesis may cause awkward compensatory motion. Aberrant&#xD;
      movements, such as these compensatory movements are known to cause greater stress to&#xD;
      remaining joints. Amputees are forced to decide if the extra function provided by the&#xD;
      advanced electronics is worth carrying the extra mass which may cause fatigue, socket issues&#xD;
      and greater stress on the remaining joints. An example is the wrist rotator component of an&#xD;
      upper limb prosthesis which may allow greater function and reduce compensatory motion, but&#xD;
      adds mass distally, potentially causing greater torques on remaining joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SYNOPSIS OF CURRENT LITERATURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restricted motion and excess weight of an upper limb prosthesis have been documented as&#xD;
      complaints among amputees [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Through surveys Atkins et al.&#xD;
      determined that amputees would like the wrist component of the prosthesis to perform more&#xD;
      movements. This study also listed drinking from a glass and opening a door, top priorities&#xD;
      among amputees [7]. This suggests that the wrist component on a prosthetic arm is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many examples throughout scientific literature showing how kinetic, kinematic and&#xD;
      metabolic analyses of gait have lead to the improvement of lower limb prosthetic design&#xD;
      criteria [8],[9]. In 2003, Twiste et al. conducted a literature review on rotation and&#xD;
      translation of the anatomic joints during prosthetic gait. The abstract from this review&#xD;
      mentions that more accurate kinematic gait analysis showing optimized gait patterns could&#xD;
      help manufacturers design prosthetic components to mimic these patterns [9]. The effects of&#xD;
      mass perturbations on lower limb amputees have been investigated to determine how inertial&#xD;
      properties of a prosthesis should be evaluated [10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have also been studies involving upper limb motion, but the amount is limited. The&#xD;
      range of motion of the upper limb of healthy and braced subjects performing activities of&#xD;
      daily living have been recorded and analyzed [11],[12],[13]. These studies have looked at the&#xD;
      effect of wrist position, but not on the mass of a wrist component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GOALS OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two main goals of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine the impact of an upper limb prosthesis without a wrist rotator on the&#xD;
           compensatory motion and torques in the remaining joints during common tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the impact of the location (distally or proximally) of a wrist rotator on a&#xD;
           upper limb prosthesis on the compensatory motion during common tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There will be a statistically significant difference in range of motion of the upper&#xD;
           limb joints between healthy subjects, braced subjects and upper limb amputees during&#xD;
           four common tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There will be a statistically significant difference in joint upper limb joint torques&#xD;
           between healthy subjects, braced subjects and upper limb amputees during three common&#xD;
           tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There will be a statistically significant difference in upper limb angles and joint&#xD;
           torques between mass added distally and mass added proximally during common tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Participants Ten healthy adult volunteers with no history of upper limb injury will&#xD;
      participate in this study. Five men and five women will participate. These ten subjects will&#xD;
      make up the control group and then will be braced to simulate a below elbow prosthesis. Seven&#xD;
      unilateral upper limb amputees will participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Protocol An 8 camera infrared Vicon motion analysis system will be used for the&#xD;
      collection and analysis of movement data. Nineteen spherical reflective markers will be&#xD;
      placed on the boney landmarks of the upper limbs and torso of the subjects to describe&#xD;
      segments or local coordinate systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A static trial will be collected for each subject to help determine the joint centers.&#xD;
      Subject parameters such as body mass, height, and shoulder depth, wrist and hand thickness&#xD;
      will be collected for use in calculations. Kinematic data will be collected at 120 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to complete four tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drinking from a cup&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Opening a door&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lifting a 5 lb. box&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Turning a steering wheel ( kinetic analysis of this task will be excluded)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The healthy subjects will complete each task during following interventions: (1) no&#xD;
      intervention (2) braced restricting forearm and wrist motion, (3) braced with 96 g (mass of&#xD;
      average prosthetic wrist rotator) added near the elbow, (4) braced with 96 g added near the&#xD;
      wrist. The amputees will complete interventions (3) and (4) mentioned above without a wrist&#xD;
      rotator but simulating the mass of one. Three trials will be collected for each experimental&#xD;
      test condition and these trials will be averaged as a representative for each subject. The&#xD;
      order of the tests will be randomly assigned for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of Experiment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will look at the effects of the absence of wrist and forearm motion on shoulder,&#xD;
      elbow and torso motion during four activities. This study will combine between-subject and&#xD;
      within-subject analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent factor (between subjects): restriction of wrist and forearm movement (simulating&#xD;
      no wrist rotator component on prosthesis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Braced group - simulating a below elbow upper limb prosthesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prosthesis wearing group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated factor (with-in subjects): added mass (simulating the mass of wrist rotator)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No added mass of a wrist rotator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mass of a wrist rotator added proximally (near elbow)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mass of a wrist rotator added distally (near wrist)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-way analysis of variance with one repeated measure will be used to analyze the main&#xD;
      effects and the interaction effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Processing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder, elbow and torso motions and torques will be computed using a program written in&#xD;
      Vicon Bodybuilder language. The positions of the markers placed on the subject will be&#xD;
      digitized and torso, upper arm, lower arm and hand segments will be determined. Euler angles&#xD;
      will be computed. Inverse dynamics and anthropometrics will be used to compute forces and&#xD;
      torques. The following outcome measures will be compared:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shoulder abduction and flexion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elbow flexion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Torso bending (L/R)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shoulder joint force and torque&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elbow joint force and torque&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum, minimum and range of these outcome measures will be compared between subjects&#xD;
      and with-in subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREDICTED RESULTS/DISCUSSION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drinking from a cup:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Braced and prosthesis wearing groups will have greater shoulder abduction to compensate&#xD;
           for the lack of forearm rotation and wrist extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adding the mass (wrist rotator) distally will cause a greater force and torque at the&#xD;
           elbow. This increase of forces at the elbow will be greatest in the amputee group due to&#xD;
           possible injury to the brachialis at its insertion on the tuberosity of the ulna.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opening a door:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Braced and prosthesis wearing groups will have greater shoulder abduction to compensate&#xD;
           for the lack of forearm rotation and wrist extension. These groups may also compensate&#xD;
           by the bending the trunk instead of increasing shoulder abduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Due to the increased shoulder range of motion in the coronal plane, the braced and&#xD;
           prosthesis wearing group will have a greater torque at the shoulder joint. This increase&#xD;
           of shoulder joint torque will increase when the mass (wrist rotator) is added distally&#xD;
           due to the increase in the lever arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifting a 5 lb. box:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This task will require minimal wrist deviation, wrist flexion/extension and minimal&#xD;
           forearm rotation. It is included in this study because it is a bilateral task&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Braced and prosthesis wearing groups will greater shoulder abduction and lesser shoulder&#xD;
           flexion due to the limitations of the forearm and wrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shoulder and elbow joint forces and torques will be greater on the sound hand for the&#xD;
           amputee group because they will used the prosthesis only as a guide to the task.&#xD;
           However, the opposite could occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Turning a steering wheel:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Braced and prosthesis wearing groups will have greater shoulder abduction to compensate&#xD;
           for the lack of wrist flexion and extension. However, compensation could also occur in&#xD;
           trunk bending.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For this task the amputee subjects will first complete it with a sound arm and then the&#xD;
           prosthesis to determine where compensation occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTRIBUTIONS This work will provide many contributions to the biomechanics field and&#xD;
      prosthetic design field. One important aspect of studying human maladies is to have a set of&#xD;
      control data to use for comparison. Documenting kinematic data of the upper limb during four&#xD;
      common tasks will allow for a comparison when studying many upper limb problems or injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work will help determine if location of new components should be considered in design,&#xD;
      fitting and instruction of the upper limb prosthesis. It may also help to bridge the gap&#xD;
      between the technological innovation of the engineering field and the clinical astuteness of&#xD;
      the prosthetists that are in contact with the end users on a daily basis.&#xD;
