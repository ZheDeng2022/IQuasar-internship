  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, open-label, sequential treatment study in patients who are receiving&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, or colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      (See Section 4.2.1 for eligible treatment regimens.) The study will take place during the&#xD;
      first 2 cycles of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the first dose of chemotherapy, patients will be instructed on how to complete their&#xD;
      patient diary, which will include a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for nausea and a VAS for&#xD;
      pain. In addition, the diary will include a section to list their current pain medications&#xD;
      (see Sample Patient Diary in Appendix I). After being instructed, patients will complete the&#xD;
      VAS for nausea and for pain, as well as listing their current pain medications. Patients will&#xD;
      then receive chemotherapy on Day 1 of Cycle 1 in combination with the pre-defined standard&#xD;
      serotonin antagonist/corticosteroid regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning on Day 2, the diary will be completed for 5 consecutive days (Days 2-6). Each day,&#xD;
      patients will complete a diary entry pertaining to the preceding 24 hours. The entry will&#xD;
      include the number and time of any emetic episodes, any antiemetic rescue medications used,&#xD;
      VAS for nausea, and side effects of treatment. On the last day of the diary (Day 6), the&#xD;
      entry will include the above daily parameters but will also include a VAS for pain. In&#xD;
      addition, the patient will complete a diary entry pertaining to the 5-day study period that&#xD;
      will include pain medications used. Patients will also complete the Functional Living Index -&#xD;
      Cancer (FLIC) questionnaire (see Sample Function Living Index - Cancer questionnaire in&#xD;
      Appendix II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who either have at least one vomiting episode or at least one report of significant&#xD;
      nausea (VAS &gt; 25 mm) during the first 5-day study period will be eligible for the second&#xD;
      phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the second phase will receive a second cycle of the same chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      antiemetic regimen for the second cycle will be the same serotonin antagonist/corticosteroid&#xD;
      regimen as they received in Cycle 1, with the addition of Cesamet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Cycle 2 of treatment, patients will receive Cesamet 1 mg the night before chemotherapy is&#xD;
      to be administered. On the day of chemotherapy (Day 1 of Cycle 2), Cesamet 2 mg will be given&#xD;
      1 to 3 hours before the chemotherapy is administered, in addition to the same serotonin&#xD;
      antagonist/corticosteroid regimen as they received in Cycle 1. Patients will receive an&#xD;
      additional dose of Cesamet 2 mg the evening of Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive Cesamet 2 mg BID on Days 2-5. Patients will complete the same 5-day&#xD;
      diary and FLIC questionnaire as they did in Cycle 1. Beneficial effects of Cesamet will be&#xD;
      estimated by comparing the results of the second cycle to the results of the first cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for the first 2 cycles of chemotherapy only.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have signed an IRB-approved informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must be receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy for the first time with&#xD;
             one of the following neoplasms/regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-small cell lung cancer receiving paclitaxel and carboplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Breast cancer receiving cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Colorectal cancer receiving a FOLFOX regimen .&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1 (see Appendix I).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be &gt;18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must either be not of child bearing potential or have a negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration. Patients are considered not of&#xD;
             child bearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a&#xD;
             hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are&#xD;
             postmenopausal for at least 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use effective contraceptive measures&#xD;
             during study treatment and for a reasonable time thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function based on requirements specified in&#xD;
             prescribing guidelines for the chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have adequate renal and hepatic function based on requirements specified&#xD;
             in prescribing guidelines for the chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with pre-existing nausea or vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with other potential causes of nausea or vomiting, including uncontrolled&#xD;
             brain metastases, bowel obstruction, or gastrointestinal hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with prior adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients receiving concurrent radiotherapy to the brain or upper abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients currently taking other antiemetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity to a cannabinoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with a serious uncontrolled intercurrent medical illness, including serious&#xD;
             infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with a current or previous psychiatric disorder (including manic depressive&#xD;
             illness and schizophrenia), as the symptoms of these disease states may be unmasked by&#xD;
             the use of cannabinoids. Cesamet should be used with caution in individuals receiving&#xD;
             other psychoactive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with hypertension or heart disease, since Cesamet can elevate supine and&#xD;
             standing heart rates and cause postural hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with a history of other malignancy within the last 5 years, which could&#xD;
             affect the diagnosis or assessment of these study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any patient who is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Any patient who is unable to comply with the requirements of the study.&#xD;
