  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to identify the brain regions in which activity is&#xD;
      affected by SCS. Baseline cerebral blood flow scans with the device turned off will be&#xD;
      generated compared to scans produced with the device operating at parameters which produce&#xD;
      optimal coverage of the painful areas. The relationship between cerebral blood flow and pain&#xD;
      rating scores will be evaluated in both conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) is known to be effective in pain management. Some evidence&#xD;
      exists that SCS may cause changes in cerebral blood flow. This study will be a novel PET&#xD;
      examination of activity in brain regions affected by SCS. This activity will be compared with&#xD;
      the pain intensity and distribution. Further, by examining cerebral blood flow at different&#xD;
      doses of stimulation, relationships between SCS, brain perfusion, and pain relief can be&#xD;
      drawn. This study will contribute to the elucidation of the mechanism of action of SCS.&#xD;
