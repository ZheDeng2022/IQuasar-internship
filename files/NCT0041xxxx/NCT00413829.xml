      This study is an evaluation of the short term effects on CNV perfusion of a same-day&#xD;
      administration of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with Visudyne® and an intravitreal injection of&#xD;
      Lucentis® (ranibizumab, 0.3 mg). An evaluation of the short term effects on CNV perfusion of&#xD;
      this combined treatment is needed for better understanding of treatment effects.&#xD;

      The primary objective is to quantify the short term effects on CNV perfusion of the same-day&#xD;
      administration of photodynamic therapy with Visudyne® and an intravitreal injection of&#xD;
      ranibizumab. These short term effects will be assessed with visual acuity measurements and&#xD;
      ophthalmic examinations including indocyanine green (ICG) and fluorescein angiography (FA) as&#xD;
      well as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) measurements. The primary variable for this&#xD;
      assessment is the incidence of CNV closure one week after combined therapy as assessed with&#xD;
      high speed ICG angiography. Fluorescein and ICG angiography will be performed using a&#xD;
      scanning laser ophthalmoscope (HRA). All angiographic studies and OCT examinations will be&#xD;
      evaluated by the Bern Photographic Reading Center in a masked fashion. Visual acuity&#xD;
      assessments will be performed with Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like&#xD;
      visual acuity testing charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective is to explore the effect of the same-day administration of photodynamic&#xD;
      therapy with Visudyne® and an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  on retinal thickness as measured by OCT over time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in change of total lesion area, area of CNV assessed by FA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in mean change of VA from baseline over time&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients 50 years of age or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization lesions secondary to AMD, either&#xD;
             predominantly classic, occult, or minimally classic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CNV lesion in the study eye is ≤5400 microns in greatest linear dimension&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score between 73 and 24&#xD;
             letters, inclusively, in the study eye using ETDRS-like grading charts (approximately&#xD;
             20/40 to 20/320) measured at 4 meters&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to return for follow up scheduled visits for a 6 months period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only one eye will be assessed in the study. If both eyes are eligible, the one with&#xD;
             the worse visual acuity will be selected for treatment and study unless, based on&#xD;
             medical reasons, the investigator deems the other eye the more appropriate candidate&#xD;
             for treatment and study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a BCVA of &lt; 33 letters (approximately 20/200) in both eyes&#xD;

             posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Spherical equivalent of the refractive error in the study eye demonstrating more than&#xD;
             -8 diopters of myopia&#xD;
