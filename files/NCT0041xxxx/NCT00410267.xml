    <textblock>
      Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) is a new alternative to anti-glaucoma medications for&#xD;
      the treatment of primary open angle glaucoma. After SLT, many patients experience mild to&#xD;
      moderate inflammation inside the eye - specifically in the front chamber of the eye (the part&#xD;
      in front of the colored part of the eye). This mild front chamber reaction is typically&#xD;
      treated with anti-inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids and nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Some physicians do not use these agents as they feel they&#xD;
      may interfere with the way the laser works to treat glaucoma. Topical (applied to the&#xD;
      surface) corticosteroids can cause an increase in the pressure of the eye (intraocular&#xD;
      pressure or IOP), cataract formation, or a possible increase in infection with long-term use.&#xD;
      These side effects have not been reported to occur with NSAIDs, which are effective in&#xD;
      controlling pain after SLT and reducing signs of inflammation such as irritation, swelling,&#xD;
      tenderness, and soreness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study will compare an NSAID, ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% (Acular LS), with a&#xD;
      corticosteroid, prednisolone acetate 1% (Pred Forte), and with a placebo, which contains no&#xD;
      active medicine (Refresh Tears). Ketorolac tromethamine 0.4%, prednisolone acetate 1%, and&#xD;
      Refresh Tears are all FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved for use in inflammation&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;

      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is no study that proves that any one of the three study medications is better&#xD;
      than the others for care after SLT. We plan to compare the effect of these anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drops in participants after selective laser trabeculoplasty to see if one works better at&#xD;
      helping lower the pressure inside the eye after SLT or whether participants would do just as&#xD;
      well with non-medicated eye drops. We will also see how well these drops reduce any potential&#xD;
      discomfort and swelling that arise.&#xD;
