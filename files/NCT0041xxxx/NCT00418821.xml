      The purpose of this study is to determine if laronidase is present in the breast milk of&#xD;
      post-partum women receiving Aldurazyme® (laronidase) and the effects of Aldurazyme&#xD;
      (laronidase) on the growth, development, and immunologic response of their breastfed infants.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Be pregnant, planning to breastfeed post-partum, and receiving Aldurazyme (laronidase)&#xD;
             therapy while breastfeeding.&#xD;
