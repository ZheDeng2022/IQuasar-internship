      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Epi-Lasik in U.S. Army&#xD;
      personnel who have naturally occurring myopia with or without astigmatism. The data from this&#xD;
      control group will be collected in such a way as to be comparable to data sets from study&#xD;
      groups undergoing wavefront guided PRK, conventional PRK, and related laser refractive&#xD;
      surgery procedures.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Active duty US Army Soldiers eligible for care at WRAMC&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female, of any race, and at least 21 years old at the time of the&#xD;
             pre-operative examination, and have signed an informed consent. The lower age limit of&#xD;
             21 years is intended to ensure documentation of refractive stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Manifest refractive spherical equivalent (MSE) of up to 6.00 diopters (D) at the&#xD;
             spectacle plane with refractive cylinder up to 3.00 D.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Manifest refraction and LADARWaveâ„¢ refractions must be within 1.00 D.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Best spectacle corrected visual acuity of 20/20 or better in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Demonstrated refractive stability, confirmed by clinical records. Neither the&#xD;
             spherical nor the cylindrical portion of the refraction may have changed more than&#xD;
             0.50D during the 12-month period immediately preceding the baseline examination, as&#xD;
             confirmed by clinical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Soft contact lens users must have removed their lenses at least 2 weeks before&#xD;
             baseline measurements. Hard contact lens users (PMMA or rigid gas permeable lenses)&#xD;
             must have removed their lenses at least 4 weeks prior to baseline measurements and&#xD;
             have 2 central keratometry readings and 2 manifest refractions taken at least 1 week&#xD;
             apart that do not differ by more than 0.50 D in either meridian; mires should be&#xD;
             regular.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject must expect to be located in the greater Washington DC area for a 12 month&#xD;
             period post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Consent of the subject's command (active duty) to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Access to transportation to meet follow-up requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become pregnant during&#xD;
             the study. Female subjects will be given a urine pregnancy test prior to participating&#xD;
             in the study to rule out pregnancy. [Pregnancy and breastfeeding are contraindications&#xD;
             to refractive surgery in general, including epi-lasik, whether participating in this&#xD;
             study or not]&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Concurrent topical or systemic medications that may impair healing, including&#xD;
             corticosteroids, antimetabolites, isotretinoin (Accutane), amiodarone hydrochloride&#xD;
             (Cordarone) and/or sumatripin (Imitrex).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Medical condition(s), which, in the judgment of the investigator, may impair healing,&#xD;
             including but not limited to: collagen vascular disease, autoimmune disease,&#xD;
             immunodeficiency diseases, and ocular herpes zoster or simplex.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active ophthalmic disease, neovascularization of the cornea within 1mm of the intended&#xD;
             ablation zone, or clinically significant lens opacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Evidence of glaucoma or an intraocular pressure greater than 22 mm Hg at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Evidence of keratoconus, corneal irregularity, or abnormal videokeratography in either&#xD;
             eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of recurrent erosions or epithelial basement dystrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with known sensitivity or inappropriate responsiveness to any of the&#xD;
             medications used in the post-operative course.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any physical or mental impairment that would preclude participation in any of the&#xD;
             examinations.&#xD;
