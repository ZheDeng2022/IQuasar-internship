    <textblock>
      This randomized control study (sponsored by the NIH, NIDDK) is aimed at reducing BMI in&#xD;
      overweight adolescents at risk for the development of type 2 diabetes. The study will examine&#xD;
      whether an integrated primary care, web and cell-phone-based intervention can produce initial&#xD;
      and sustained improvements in anthropometric, behavioral, metabolic, and physiological&#xD;
      outcomes in overweight adolescents. The primary goal is to reduce BMI (Body Mass Index)in&#xD;
      overweight adolescents.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a common disease that plagues over 16 million adults in the&#xD;
      United States (American Diabetes Association [ADA], 2002). Over the past decade, the number&#xD;
      of adults diagnosed with diabetes has risen dramatically. The high rates of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      have been associated with the simultaneously rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity, and&#xD;
      diminished levels of physical activity in the population (Wing, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes is increasing in children and adolescents in the U.S. and worldwide (ADA,&#xD;
      2000). Several studies have demonstrated higher risk of type 2 diabetes in African-American,&#xD;
      Hispanic, and American Indian children and adolescents (Glaser, 1997; Dean, 1992;&#xD;
      Pinhas-Hamiel, 1996; Rosenbloom, 1999). Other characteristics, or risk factors, that may be&#xD;
      used to identify children at high-risk for developing type 2 diabetes include obesity, family&#xD;
      history, and physiologic manifestations of insulin resistance (ADA, 2000). Up to 85% of&#xD;
      children with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese at diagnosis. A majority of children&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes have at least one parent or first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Physiologic findings of insulin resistance that are present in large percentages of children&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes include acanthosis nigricans, polycystic ovarian syndrome, hypertension&#xD;
      and lipid disorders (ADA, 2000). Among US children, the mean age at diagnosis of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes is between 12 and 14 years (Moran, 1999; Goran MI, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is commonly found in children with type 2 diabetes, and the increasing incidence of&#xD;
      children with type 2 diabetes has been attributed to the growing problem of pediatric&#xD;
      overweight and obesity (Fagot-Camapagna, et.al, 2000). It is often hypothesized that an&#xD;
      industrialized, or &quot;Westernized&quot; lifestyle of excessive energy intake and sedentary behavior&#xD;
      partially explains the recent emergence of type 2 diabetes and obesity in youth (Hill &amp;&#xD;
      Peters, 1998; Koplan &amp; Dietz, 2000). Evidence that the number of years being obese is&#xD;
      positively correlated with diabetes risk (Everhart, 1992), supports intervening in&#xD;
      adolescence to minimize the number of years of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity and physical inactivity are thought to be the main modifiable determinants of this&#xD;
      disease, and interventions targeting diet and physical activity have been surprisingly&#xD;
      effective in preventing diabetes in high-risk adults (Tuomilehto, 2001; NIDDK, 2001). There&#xD;
      are no published studies that examine the efficacy of similar lifestyle interventions aimed&#xD;
      at children and adolescents. Our rationale for intervening on these behaviors with high-risk&#xD;
      adolescents is based on these findings, as well as the following: (a) the majority of&#xD;
      adolescents do not meet current guidelines for physical activity and nutrition and (b) there&#xD;
      is a steep age-related decline in physical activity that peaks in the teen years. In its&#xD;
      March 2000 Consensus Statement of Type 2 Diabetes In Children and Adolescents, the ADA expert&#xD;
      panel stated that, &quot;Primary care providers have an obligation to encourage lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications that might delay or prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes in children at high&#xD;
      risk. Lifestyle interventions focusing on weight management and increasing physical activity&#xD;
      should be promoted in all children at high risk for the development of type 2 diabetes.&quot;&#xD;
      (ADA, 2000).&#xD;
