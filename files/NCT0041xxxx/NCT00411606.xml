      An objective of this study is to standardize temperature values derived from thermograms of&#xD;
      the facial region. It is anticipated that the mean temperature of a defined region of&#xD;
      interest, such as the eyes, nose, or sinuses, might be useful for future applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will attempt to determine normal temperature ranges based on participants'&#xD;
      age and gender.&#xD;

      Medical thermography is a noninvasive technique that allows an examiner to visualize and&#xD;
      estimate the temperature of the skin surface. An infrared scanning device is used to convert&#xD;
      infrared radiation emitted from the skin surface into electrical impulses that can be&#xD;
      captured as an image called a thermogram. During the past 20 years medical thermography has&#xD;
      been used to study the pathology in the vascular, muscular, neural and skeletal systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An objective of this study is to standardize temperature values derived from thermograms of&#xD;
      the facial region. It is anticipated that the mean temperature of a defined region of&#xD;
      interest, such as the eyes, nose, or sinuses, might be useful for future applications. This&#xD;
      protocol addresses the definition of overall health, symptomology, and anthropometrical&#xD;
      features (age, weight, height, body mass index and gender), and what effect, if any, each has&#xD;
      on mean temperature. Environmental conditions, mapping procedures, and image evaluations will&#xD;
      also be standardized. We will attempt to determine normal temperature ranges based on&#xD;
      participants' age and gender. Future use of standardized values will be to assess the&#xD;
      severity of rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms being experienced by a subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will make one visit to our clinic. They will be asked to acclimate to room&#xD;
      temperature for at least 30 minutes. Subjects are requested not to consume hot drinks or food&#xD;
      for at least an hour before imaging and not to use any skin preparations such as creams or&#xD;
      talcum powder. A picture of the participant's face will be taken using the thermal camera&#xD;
      which will demonstrate the temperature of each facial area of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please note that participants in this study will take part on a completely voluntary basis.&#xD;
      No payment will be provided.&#xD;
