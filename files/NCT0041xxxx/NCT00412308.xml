      The study will compare outcomes between individuals with sub-acute, ventilator-dependent&#xD;
      tetraplegia using high (20 cc/kg) vs. low (10 cc/kg) tidal volumes during mechanical&#xD;
      ventilator support.&#xD;

      While respiratory failure in people with SCI is common, clinicians have not come to a&#xD;
      consensus on the best strategy to manage the mechanical ventilation of these individuals or&#xD;
      whether to manage people with SCI differently from other patients. The Consortium for Spinal&#xD;
      Cord Medicine has developed Clinical Practice Guidelines using protocols established at Craig&#xD;
      Hospital in the 1980s and 1990s, but these are based only on clinical experience and&#xD;
      retrospective, cohort data using historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These guidelines suggest that patients should be ventilated with tidal volumes (VT)of 20-25&#xD;
      cc/kg of ideal body weight (IBW). This recommended VT is at least twice as large as&#xD;
      conventional VT used for general medical and surgical patients requiring mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. However, there is a clinical belief that people with SCI should be ventilated at&#xD;
      higher VT to prevent atelectasis, to decrease the risk of pneumonia, and to facilitate&#xD;
      weaning. This belief was fostered by a retrospective, concurrent cohort comparison study of&#xD;
      individuals with SCI, which found that the use of high VT on the ventilator (mean 25.3 cc/kg,&#xD;
      PAP&lt;40) was associated with more rapid resolution of atelectasis and more rapid weaning from&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation than the use of low VT (mean 15.5). Therefore, people with SCI have&#xD;
      been clinically managed using high VT for the past 2-3 decades without prospective data to&#xD;
      confirm these clinical impressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time that these ventilator strategies evolved in the care of patients with SCI,&#xD;
      several clinical studies in general medical and surgical patients requiring mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation suggested that high VT leading to higher airway pressures could actually promote&#xD;
      lung injury. This occurred when higher VT increased the risk of over-distending the airways&#xD;
      and creating volume-related trauma.16-19 In multiple studies, VT of only 10-15 cc/kg IBW was&#xD;
      found to produce alveolar over-distention, stretch injury and barotrauma. This work led to&#xD;
      the belief that low VT of 6-8 cc/kg IBW could be helpful in protecting mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated individuals from ventilator-induced lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether these findings and recommendations apply to individuals with SCI requiring mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation is unclear. At least one study of mechanically ventilated individuals without&#xD;
      acute respiratory distress syndrome suggests that the use of low VT (6 cc/kg) increases the&#xD;
      risk of atelectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the lack of prospective, evidence-based data regarding optimal VT for persons with a SCI&#xD;
      who are ventilator-dependent, clinicians may be inclined to use lower VT to prevent lung&#xD;
      injury, unless there is more definitive data to show that higher volumes are as safe as low&#xD;
      VT and that higher VT facilitate more rapid weaning from mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized, controlled study to compare outcomes between individuals&#xD;
      with sub-acute, ventilator-dependent tetraplegia using high (20 cc/kg) tidal volume (VT) vs.&#xD;
      low (10 cc/kg) VT during mechanical ventilator support. While the use of lower tidal volumes&#xD;
      in the general pulmonary community is more common, we and others in the SCI rehabilitation&#xD;
      community have used 20 cc/kg IBW tidal volumes or higher to manage and attempt to wean&#xD;
      individuals with SCI on mechanical ventilation. This study will address the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of using higher VT in ventilator weaning. A series of objective measures and&#xD;
      standardized protocols are implemented to ensure equivalent pulmonary management and weaning&#xD;
      processes in individuals, regardless of their randomization status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For individuals with sub-acute ventilator-dependent tetraplegia, providing high tidal&#xD;
           volumes (VT = 20 cc/kg) will result in more rapid weaning from mechanical ventilation&#xD;
           than use of low tidal volumes (VT = 10 cc/kg) in an 8-week trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For these individuals, use of high tidal volumes will result in fewer episodes of&#xD;
           atelectasis and ventilator acquired pneumonia (VAP) compared to use of low tidal&#xD;
           volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be no difference in the incidence of a) barotrauma or b) ARDS between those&#xD;
           using high tidal volumes compared to those using low tidal volumes.&#xD;
