  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the first part of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      ascending doses of valproic acid (also known as Depacon) administered as intravenous infusion&#xD;
      (IV) in doses ranging from 15 mg/kg to 250 mg/kg in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the study will also be to determine the safety and tolerability of single&#xD;
      ascending doses of valproic acid administered as IV in trauma subjects with hemorrhagic&#xD;
      shock.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study will be a single center study intended to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of valproic acid dosages at 15 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, 90 mg/kg, 120 mg/kg,&#xD;
      150 mg/kg 180 mg/kg, 210 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg. Up to 72 healthy subjects (9 dose groups of 8&#xD;
      subjects) will receive single doses of valproic acid or placebo via a 60-min IV infusion in a&#xD;
      ratio of 3:1 active drug: placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study will be a multicenter, double blind, placebo-controlled study in trauma&#xD;
      patients with hemorrhagic shock who are able to give consent or severe trauma patients with&#xD;
      hemorrhagic shock in whom a legally authorized representative can give consent. Up to 12&#xD;
      patients (2 dose groups of 6 patients) will receive single doses of valproic acid or placebo&#xD;
      via a 60-min IV infusion in a ratio of 2:1 active drug : placebo. The dose levels in Part 2&#xD;
      will be the two highest doses that are demonstrated to have acceptable safety profile based&#xD;
      on the review of safety data from Part 1.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female volunteers between the ages of 18 and 65 years, inclusive, in good&#xD;
             health based on medical history, physical examination, ECG, and routine laboratory&#xD;
             tests (blood chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and drug screen).&#xD;
