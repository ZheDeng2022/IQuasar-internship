  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a curative treatment by radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer, between 20% and 50%&#xD;
      of patients may have a biological relapse as a progressive re -rise of PSA. After prostate&#xD;
      brachytherapy with low flow, this rate is between 2% and 6%. Depending on risk factors&#xD;
      initially present, some patients will have a micro metastatic disease at the time of re-rise,&#xD;
      but others will have a true local recurrence purely intra-prostate. Local recurrence after&#xD;
      radiotherapy is associated with a high incidence of distant metastatic relapse and poor&#xD;
      overall survival. For these reasons, the possibility of offering a local treatment for this&#xD;
      selected population of patients can have a major therapeutic interest and allow changing a&#xD;
      situation often considered palliative to the possibility of a second curative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no consensus regarding the optimal management of patients with purely&#xD;
      local recurrence after prostate irradiation at first intention. When an external radiotherapy&#xD;
      or brachytherapy is performed as first choice in a patient with prostate cancer, several&#xD;
      remedial treatments have been proposed, with controversial results the decision-making for&#xD;
      clinicians and for difficult patients. These main therapeutic options remedial (surgery,&#xD;
      cryotherapy and brachytherapy) have the potential for complications such as rectal injury,&#xD;
      impotence or incontinence Brachytherapy is a new salvage treatment being evaluated in the&#xD;
      United States (Phase II study of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group No. 0526). Several&#xD;
      retrospective trials have shown very encouraging results in terms of acute toxicity and&#xD;
      biochemical control in the short term. Thus, a team from Mount Sinai in New York recently&#xD;
      published for the first time 10 years retrospective results with this approach. In their&#xD;
      experience after treatment failures with external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy, a dose&#xD;
      of 122 Gy was delivered over 90% of the prostate gland. Doing this they observed biochemical&#xD;
      control rates and survival specific of 54 % and 96 %, respectively at 10 years, with an&#xD;
      hormone treatment associated (median 6 months) in 84 % of cases. Four patients had grade 3&#xD;
      toxicity or higher (11%). To reduce the rate of late toxicities the team from the University&#xD;
      Of California San Francisco (UCSF), tested focal brachytherapy guided by functional MRI (MRI&#xD;
      spectroscopy) to re-treat local recurrence after initial brachytherapy as monotherapy or&#xD;
      boost. By delivering 144 Gy on recidivism objectified on MRI, the authors observed that a&#xD;
      minimal dose of 37Gy covered 90 % of the prostate gland to treat the risk of microscopic&#xD;
      disease. Doing this, the rate of observed toxicities and biochemical control appeared&#xD;
      encouraging, with a median follow-up of 2 years, since no grade 3 toxicity was observed and&#xD;
      74% of patients achieved a PSA nadir &lt;0.5 ng / mL without associated hormone. In case of&#xD;
      external radiation or brachytherapy, several attempts proposed to associate an injection of&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid gel to the prostate - rectum interface to spare healthy tissue irradiated and&#xD;
      thus reduce the rate of radiation proctitis. The feasibility of implementing this gel has&#xD;
      been demonstrated in patients with non- irradiated tissues. No inherent toxicity of the&#xD;
      injection of hyaluronic acid gel has been described after prostate brachytherapy first line.&#xD;
      The feasibility of this injection remains unproven to date on patients previously irradiated&#xD;
      externally or by brachytherapy. We hypothesize that the risk of radiation proctitis and&#xD;
      fistulas front prostate could be reduced using this technique in this indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to carry out a French prospective multicenter phase II trial combining&#xD;
      brachytherapy remedial with an injection of hyaluronic acid after surgery to reduce the risk&#xD;
      of radiation proctitis and / or recto -urinary fistula in a patient population hyper-&#xD;
      selected with a high probability of isolated local recurrence.&#xD;
