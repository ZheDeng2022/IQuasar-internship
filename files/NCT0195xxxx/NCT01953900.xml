  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of GD2-T cells (also called&#xD;
      iC9-GD2-CAR-VZV-CTLs) in combination with a varicella zoster vaccine and lymohodepleting&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Additionally, we will learn what the side effects of this treatment are and to&#xD;
      see whether this therapy might help patients with advanced osteosarcoma and neuroblastoma.&#xD;
      Because there is no standard treatment for recurrent/refractory osteosarcoma and&#xD;
      neuroblastoma at this time or because the currently used treatments do not work fully in all&#xD;
      cases, patients are being asked to volunteer to take part in a gene transfer research study&#xD;
      using special immune cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect&#xD;
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer:&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from&#xD;
      infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special&#xD;
      infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with&#xD;
      viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with&#xD;
      cancers. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have found from previous research that a new gene can be put into T cells that&#xD;
      will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. Investigators now want to see if a new&#xD;
      gene can be put in these cells that will let the T cells recognize and kill sarcoma and&#xD;
      neuroblastoma cells. The new gene is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and consists of&#xD;
      an antibody called 14g2a that recognizes GD2, a protein that is found on sarcoma and&#xD;
      neuroblastoma cells (GD2-CAR). In addition, it contains parts of the CD28 and OX40 genes&#xD;
      which can stimulate T cells to make them live longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have found that CAR-T cells can kill some of the tumor, but they don't last&#xD;
      very long in the body and so the tumor eventually comes back. T cells that recognize the&#xD;
      virus that causes chicken pox, varicella zoster virus (VZV), remain in the bloodstream for&#xD;
      many years especially if they are stimulated or boosted by the VZV vaccine. Investigators&#xD;
      will therefore insert the GD2-CAR gene into T cells that recognize VZV. These cells are&#xD;
      called iC9-GD2-CAR-VZV-specific T cells but are referred to as GD2-T cells for simplicity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients give blood to make GD2-T cells that are grown and frozen. To get the GD2-CAR to&#xD;
      attach to the surface of the T-cell, a gene is inserted into the T-cell. As described in the&#xD;
      Brief Summary, the gene contains the GD2-CAR. This is done using part of a virus (known as a&#xD;
      retrovirus) that has been put into a vector made for this study and that will carry the&#xD;
      antibody gene into the T cell. This retrovirus vector also helps identify the T cells in the&#xD;
      patient's blood after they have been injected. Because the patients have received cells with&#xD;
      a new gene in them they will be followed for a total of 15 years to see if there are any long&#xD;
      term side effects of gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When enrolled on this study, patients will be assigned to one of three groups of different&#xD;
      doses of GD2-T cells. The first group of patients will receive a lower dose of GD2-T cells.&#xD;
      Once that dose schedule proves safe, the next group of patients will be started at the higher&#xD;
      dose. Patients will receive treatment with with cyclophosphamide (cytoxan) and fludarabine&#xD;
      for 3 days before receiving the T-cell infusion. These drugs will decrease the numbers of&#xD;
      your own T cells before we infuse the GD2-T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive the GD2-T cells by an intravenous line. Before patients receive the&#xD;
      injection, they may be given a dose of Benadryl and Tylenol. The injection will take between&#xD;
      1 and 25 minutes. The research team will follow patients in the clinic after the injection&#xD;
      for 1 to 4 hours. Two weeks after receiving the dose of GD2-T cells, patients will receive a&#xD;
      dose of the VZV vaccine. This will be given as an injection under the skin that will take&#xD;
      less than a minute. The treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at&#xD;
      Texas Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital. Patients may need to stay in Houston&#xD;
      for up to 4 weeks after the infusion so the research team can monitor patients for side&#xD;
      effects. The research team will follow patients in the clinic or through communication with&#xD;
      their primary doctor after the GD2-T-cell injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests before treatment--&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being treated, patients will receive a series of standard medical tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam and History&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A urine pregnancy test. If you a patient is pregnant, both the patient and her parents&#xD;
           will be informed of the pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of their tumor by routine imaging studies. We will use the imaging study&#xD;
           that was used before to follow the patient's tumor (Computer Tomogram (CT), Magnetic&#xD;
           Resonance Imaging (MRI), or Positron Emission Tomography(PET/CT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests during and after treatment--&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the infusions and&#xD;
      afterwards:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of their tumor by routine imaging studies at 6 weeks after the infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way the GD2-T cells are working and how long they last in the body,&#xD;
      an extra amount of blood, based on the patient's weight, up to a maximum of 60 ml (12&#xD;
      teaspoons) of blood will be taken on the day of the GD2-T- cell infusion(s), (before and at&#xD;
      the end of the T-cell infusion(s)), 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the GD2-T-cell infusion(s) and&#xD;
      every 3 months for 1 year, at 15 months and 18 months, then every 6 months for 4 years, then&#xD;
      yearly for a total of 15 years. One additional blood sample might be drawn 3 to 4 days after&#xD;
      the GD2-T-cell infusion(s); this is optional. Blood may be drawn at additional time points&#xD;
      based on the patient's response to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the time points listed above, if the Tcells are found in patient's blood at a certain&#xD;
      amount, an extra 5ml of blood may need to be collected for additional testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For children, the total amount of blood drawn will not be more than 3 ml (less than 1&#xD;
      teaspoon) per 2.2 pounds of body weight on any one day. This volume is considered safe, but&#xD;
      may be decreased if the patient is anemic (have a low red blood cell count).&#xD;
