    <textblock>
      This pilot research trial studies collecting, analyzing, and storing samples from patients&#xD;
      with triple negative breast cancer (breast cancer cells that do not have estrogen receptors,&#xD;
      progesterone receptors, or large amounts of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein)&#xD;
      that has spread to other places in the body receiving anti-cancer therapy. Studying samples&#xD;
      of tissue, blood, buccal swab, saliva, and urine in the laboratory from patients receiving&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapy may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA) and identify biomarkers related to cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the safety and feasibility of collecting, analyzing and storing clinically&#xD;
      annotated panomic and other data from serially monitored subjects with metastatic triple&#xD;
      negative breast cancer (TNBC) who receive care from up to ten oncology practices across the&#xD;
      United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether molecular changes associated with resistance to treatment can be&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To understand subject perceptions regarding panomic data and its application to cancer&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To apply other technologies to the characterization of subject tumors as they become&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of tissue biopsy, blood, buccal mucosa, saliva, and urine at&#xD;
      baseline. Additional biopsies may be performed prior to treatment change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of biopsy, patients are followed up at 1 day and 7 days. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed indefinitely or for as long as they agree to be in the study, depending on the&#xD;
      availability of resources.&#xD;
