    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics of multiple doses of GCC-4401C in healthy male subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      multiple doses of GCC-4401C in healthy male subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-six subjects are planned for enrollment. The study consists of five cohorts (10 mg, 20&#xD;
      mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg) with eight subjects per cohort. In the 20 mg cohort, six&#xD;
      additional subjects will receive rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) 20 mg as an active comparator in&#xD;
      open-label fashion. Within each of the five cohorts, six subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      GCC-4401C and two subjects will be randomized to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the single dose safety, tolerability, and PK after oral administration&#xD;
           of GCC-4401C in healthy male subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the multiple dose pharmacodynamics after oral administration of&#xD;
           GCC-4401C in healthy male subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine an appropriate dose range and dosing regimen of oral GCC-4401C for&#xD;
           subsequent clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the PK and PD of GCC-4401C with an active rivaroxaban (Xarelto®)group at 20&#xD;
           mg in healthy male subjects.&#xD;

The dose selection for this clinical study was based on the safety, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics results of the single dose study.&#xD;
GCC-4401C was well tolerated in the single ascending dose study up to the highest single oral dose administered of 80 mg from 2.5 mg in 48 subjects.&#xD;
The study consists of five cohorts (10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg) with eight subjects per cohort.&#xD;
In the 20 mg cohort, six additional subjects will receive rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) 20 mg as an active comparator in open-label fashion.</description>
