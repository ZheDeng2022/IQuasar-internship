      The purpose of this study is to determine the possibility and compliance of performing anal&#xD;
      Pap smear and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) DNA testing on women with high grade lower genital&#xD;
      tract dysplasia or cervical cancer and determining the prevalence of anal dysplasia in this&#xD;
      population using a high-resolution anoscopy (HRA). In addition, it is being done to&#xD;
      potentially develop screening, diagnostic and treatment protocol for anal dysplasia in women&#xD;
      with high-grade lower genital tract dysplasia or cervical cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anal cancer incidence is increasing and although women compose more than half of all cases&#xD;
      and those with HPV related lower genital tract dysplasia/malignancy have an even greater risk&#xD;
      screening is currently not recommended. We therefore propose performing a prospective cohort&#xD;
      study to determine the prevalence of anal dysplasia in women with high-grade lower genital&#xD;
      tract dysplasia using high-resolution anoscopy HRA. This will then potentially lead to the&#xD;
      development of a screening, diagnosis and treatment schema that can be implemented in all&#xD;
      women with high-grade lower genital tract dysplasia. This study can potentially have a high&#xD;
      impact on health delivery in women at high risk for anal cancer as this can transform the&#xD;
      current treatment of anal cancer to a preventive screening program. This can later be&#xD;
      implemented throughout Ontario and in all centers that treat women with cervical dysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of anal intraepithelial neoplasm (AIN also known as anal cancer) has increased&#xD;
      in Ontario over the last 20 years. Two-thirds of the cases are found in women. The average&#xD;
      time between diagnosis of anal cancer and previous cervical dysplasia or cancer is&#xD;
      approximately 20 years. This study is giving the opportunity to detect and treat pre-invasive&#xD;
      lesions and potentially prevent the development of anal cancer. Currently, no screening,&#xD;
      diagnosis or treatment recommendation for anal dysplasia found in women with high-grade lower&#xD;
      genital tract dysplasia.&#xD;
