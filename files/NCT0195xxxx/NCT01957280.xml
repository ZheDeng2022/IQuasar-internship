  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the PK, safety, and tolerability of patritumab&#xD;
      produced by a new manufacturing process (denoted as &quot;Process 2 patritumab&quot;). The data from&#xD;
      this study will allow Process 2 patritumab to be compared to Process 1 patritumab to allow&#xD;
      for any dose adjustments, if needed, and to bridge data from studies previously conducted&#xD;
      with Process 1 patritumab to studies to be conducted with Process 2 patritumab. The&#xD;
      hypothesis for this study is that the pharmacokinetics of Process 2 patritumab will be&#xD;
      comparable to those of Process 1 patritumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Process 2 patritumab will be administered intravenously as a single, loading dose of 18 mg/kg&#xD;
      over approximately 60 minutes at Cycle 1 Day 1 followed by 9 mg/kg administered every 21 days&#xD;
      as a maintenance dose starting at Cycle 2 Day 1. This study will be conducted in 2 phases: a&#xD;
      main study and an extension phase. The PK profile of Process 2 patritumab will be compared to&#xD;
      historical data for Process 1 patritumab. Specifically, the PK parameters (AUC0-21d and Cmax&#xD;
      as primary endpoints) for Process 2 patritumab 18 mg/kg (loading dose) will be compared to&#xD;
      the PK parameters of Process 1 patritumab 18 mg/kg. Process 2 patritumab serum concentrations&#xD;
      will be compared to Process 1 patritumab serum concentrations collected in the Phase 1 and&#xD;
      Phase 2 studies by population PK methods and will be reported separately.&#xD;
