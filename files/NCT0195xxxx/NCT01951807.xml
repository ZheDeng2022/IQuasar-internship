  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects that have received medical treatment for ovarian cancer can be both physically and&#xD;
      emotionally demanding for patients. The purpose of this study is to determine whether two&#xD;
      common pyschological interventions (Communication Skills Intervention and Supportive&#xD;
      Counseling) may improve the well-being of ovarian cancer patients compared to usual care.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Very little is known in the psycho-oncology literature about why psychological interventions&#xD;
      are effective or for how long these interventions exert an impact. Given many cancer patients&#xD;
      experience recurrence and/or progression, it is important to know whether our relatively&#xD;
      brief interventions facilitate how patients cope with this most-feared medical event. From a&#xD;
      theoretical perspective, the study will advance our understanding of the mechanisms for&#xD;
      change for two common treatment approaches, supportive and cognitive behavioral therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled and upon completion of a baseline survey, randomized to into one of&#xD;
      three arms - Communication Skills Intervention, Supportive Counseling, and Usual Care.&#xD;
      Subjects will complete surveys during the course of the interventions.&#xD;
