  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myeloablative allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) are prone to frequent&#xD;
      secondary malnutrition to metabolic and digestive troubles due to conditioning regimen,&#xD;
      treatments (antibiotics, immunosuppressive therapy…) and graft complications (graft versus&#xD;
      host disease). In the absence of appropriate nutritional support, myeloablative conditioning&#xD;
      lead to a rapid serious denutrition. But, it is known as negative independent prognostic&#xD;
      factor of overall survival of patients who presented malignant hemopathy treated by high-dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy or AHSCT. Furthermore, it increases hospitalisation delay and decreases quality&#xD;
      of life. In AHSCT with myeloablative conditioning, introduction of nutritional support is&#xD;
      recommended. However, type of nutritional support remains not clearly defined. Parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition is user but favour infections and secondary effects potentially decrease by&#xD;
      intravenous glutamine. Few previous studies with low number of patients, mainly retrospective&#xD;
      or combining allo-and auto HSCT had shown feasibility, acceptable tolerance and low cost of&#xD;
      enteral nutrition (EN). A recent prospective no-randomized study in 45 adults patients who&#xD;
      had undergone AHSCT with myeloablative conditioning find a significant decrease of day-100&#xD;
      mortality (5% vs 30%), of infection mortality, of median duration of parenteral nutrition&#xD;
      (PN) and prevalence of GvH (Graft versus Host Disease) grade III-IV in EN (enteral nutrition)&#xD;
      group. These results had to be confirmed by a randomized study. As EN is 4 to 5 more cheaply&#xD;
      than PN, besides mortality/morbidity stakes for the patient, this study could have potential&#xD;
      economic interest.&#xD;

      EN (enteral nutrition) or PN (parenteral nutrition) artificial nutrition will be launched at&#xD;
      D1-D2 of the transplantation (D0 being the day of the transplantation),without taking into&#xD;
      account the oral intake. This helps in particular to launch the EN after the stage of&#xD;
      significant digestive problems related to the conditioning and before the mucositis&#xD;
      appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EN group: According to the HAS and SFNEP (Societe francophone nutrition clinique)&#xD;
      recommendations and the good practice rules, a polyurethane or silicone NGT(Naso gastric&#xD;
      tube), 8 to 10 French units, will be inserted and its positioning will be controlled by&#xD;
      radiography before the EN beginning. Polyurethane and silicone are very well tolerated by&#xD;
      nasal and oesophagus mucosa and have a long life duration allowing keeping the same tube&#xD;
      during 2 to 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PN group: PN will be administrated by a central venous catheter, which is usually inserted in&#xD;
      allo-HSCT patients to allow the administration of chemotherapy and of the different&#xD;
      parenteral treatments.&#xD;
