  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder carcinoma is the most common malignancy of the urinary tract. Approximately 75-85% of&#xD;
      patients with bladder cancer present with a disease that is confined to the mucosa or&#xD;
      submucosa. These categories are grouped as non-muscle-invasive bladder tumors(i.e.&#xD;
      superficial tumors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an estimated 67,160&#xD;
      newly diagnosed cases and 13,750 deaths in the United States in 2007. The 5-year survival&#xD;
      rate is 82% for all stages combined. The standard of treatment for patients with superficial&#xD;
      bladder cancer is surgical transurethal resection (TUR) of tumors, with an 80% early success&#xD;
      rate. However, nearly 70% of these patients will develop tumor recurrence, with 25% showing&#xD;
      progression to muscle-invading disease, within 5 years with TUR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore necessary to consider adjuvant therapy in all patients. The absolute risks of&#xD;
      recurrence and progression do not always indicate the risk at which a certain therapy is&#xD;
      optimal. The choice of therapy may be considered differently according to what risk is&#xD;
      acceptable for the individual patient and the urologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravesical chemotherapy and immunotherapy are widely used as adjuvant therapies after TUR,&#xD;
      to prevent recurrence and progression of superficial disease. Systemic therapy is typically&#xD;
      reserved for higher stage, muscle-invading, or metastatic diseases. The urinary bladder is an&#xD;
      ideal organ for regional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urethra provides easy access of therapeutic agents to the urinary bladder. The presence&#xD;
      of the specialized asymmetric unit membrane on the urothelium serves as a barrier and limits&#xD;
      the absorption of molecules or particulates into the systemic circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for intravesical therapy is to maximize the exposure of tumors located in the&#xD;
      bladder cavity to therapeutics agents while limiting the systemic exposure and thereby&#xD;
      limiting the host toxicities; the primary goal is to eradicate existing or residual tumors&#xD;
      through direct cytoablation or immunostimulation. The unique properties of the urinary&#xD;
      bladder render it a fertile ground for evaluating novel approaches to regional therapy,&#xD;
      including local hyperthermia, co-administration of permeation enhancers, bioadhesive&#xD;
      carriers, and gene therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the developing treatments for high-risk superficial bladder cancers is the combination&#xD;
      of intravesical chemotherapy and hyperthermia (HT), called chemohyperthermia (C-HT). The most&#xD;
      common form of C-HT uses the Synergo HT system, in which local HT is administered via direct&#xD;
      microwave irradiation of the urothelium by means of a 915-MHz intravesical microwave&#xD;
      applicator. The target intravesical temperature is set between 41.8C and 44.8C and is&#xD;
      measured by five thermocouples integrated in a 20-F treatment catheter. To avoid injury, the&#xD;
      urethra is continuously cooled. Due to extensive global experience with its use and a&#xD;
      significant amount of preclinical data demonstrating improved antineoplastic efficacy when&#xD;
      heated, mitomycin C (MMC) is the most common intravesical chemotherapy agent used in&#xD;
      conjunction with HT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common adverse events during treatment were bladder spasms and bladder pain.&#xD;
      Literature reports bladder spasms in 21.6% of patients, and bladder pain in 17.5%. Bladder&#xD;
      spasms tended to occur more frequently with the prophylactic schedule, whereas pain was&#xD;
      present equally in the prophylactic and ablative schedules but more commonly after the&#xD;
      ablative schedule. In the first days following C-HT, storage LUTS (frequency, dysuria,&#xD;
      urgency, nocturia) (25.6%) and hematuria (6.0%) are the most common adverse events. Most&#xD;
      studies mention that these symptoms were mild and transient, resolving spontaneously within a&#xD;
      few days of treatment. One study described severe cystitis complaints in three patients&#xD;
      (16%), but other studies have not confirmed these adverse events. Two studies report the&#xD;
      development of a contracted bladder and severe urinary incontinence after ablative C-HT.&#xD;
      However, the possibility cannot be excluded that previous transurethral resection and&#xD;
      intravesical chemotherapy might have contributed to this event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the appearance of bothersome storage LUTS, patient should be managed by existing&#xD;
      guidelines. Based on AUA/SUFU Diagnosis and Treatment of Overactive Bladder (Non-Neurogenic)&#xD;
      in Adults Guidelines published in 2012 patients should be diagnosed, followed and treated&#xD;
      according to the suggested algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, we would like to assess the severity of OAB symptoms and their response to a&#xD;
      standard OAB treatment according to AUA Guidelines for Non-neurogenic OAB as well as to&#xD;
      assess urodynamic study variables in those who didn't respond to a standard medical treatment&#xD;
      and bothered by their OAB symptoms.&#xD;
