    <textblock>
      This small (&quot;pilot&quot;) study is designed to provide information on whether the combination of&#xD;
      psychotherapy with the drug MDMA is safe and helpful for people with post traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD). The researchers will use the results of this study to design more studies of&#xD;
      this treatment. The study compares a comparator (placebo) and a full dose. For each session,&#xD;
      there will be an initial dose possibly followed 1.5 to 2.5 hours later by a dose half the&#xD;
      size of the initial dose. The study will measure symptoms of PTSD, depression, general&#xD;
      psychological well-being, sleep quality, feelings that the self or world is unreal&#xD;
      (dissociation), potentially positive effects of surviving traumatic events and cognitive&#xD;
      function (thinking, memory and attention). People experiencing pain or tinnitus (ringing in&#xD;
      the ears) will record their symptoms throughout the study. Seven people will be randomly (by&#xD;
      chance) assigned to receive full-dose MDMA and five will be randomly assigned to receive a&#xD;
      comparator. There will be three preparatory psychotherapy sessions before the first&#xD;
      experimental session, and subjects will have supportive or &quot;integrative&quot; sessions after each&#xD;
      MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session. Subjects will meet with a male and female&#xD;
      psychotherapist for all experimental sessions and for sessions before and after each&#xD;
      experimental session. Subjects who received comparator can enroll in Stage 2, where they will&#xD;
      have three open-label MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions, meaning everyone will know they&#xD;
      are receiving an active dose of MDMA. Subjects receiving full dose in Stage 1 will have a&#xD;
      third experimental session.. Symptoms of PTSD and other symptoms will be measured again at&#xD;
      least 12 months after each subject has started the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder that can develop after&#xD;
      people experience a traumatic event, such as a rape, car accident or other life threatening&#xD;
      event. PTSD is a worldwide health problem. PTSD is treated with psychotherapy or drugs, but&#xD;
      these treatments do not help everyone. 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted&#xD;
      psychotherapy might be a potential treatment for PTSD. MDMA is the active ingredient in&#xD;
      ecstasy. Before it was made illegal, some psychotherapists combined MDMA with psychotherapy&#xD;
      to help treat people with psychological problems, including PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 2 randomized, dose comparison, double-blind study to assess safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of manualized MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in treating chronic, treatment-resistant&#xD;
      PTSD. Seven subjects will be randomized to receive full dose MDMA (full dose condition) and&#xD;
      five subjects will receive a comparator (comparator condition), with an optional supplemental&#xD;
      half-dose available 1.5 to 2.5 hours after the initial dose. Global Clinician-Administered&#xD;
      PTSD Scale (CAPS) score one month after two sessions of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is the&#xD;
      primary outcome measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDMA or comparator will be administered in two blinded experimental sessions lasting up to&#xD;
      eight hours and scheduled three to five weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The will last up to one and a half years, including approximately three to five months of&#xD;
      psychotherapy, and a long-term follow up visit scheduled a year after the final experimental&#xD;
      session. Study subjects will have a medical and psychiatric examination to assess eligibility&#xD;
      for enrollment. Once in the study, they will see the same male and female psychotherapist for&#xD;
      the entire study. The subject will learn more about MDMA-assisted psychotherapy and the&#xD;
      investigators will learn more about the subject during three preparatory sessions occurring&#xD;
      before the first experimental session. During experimental sessions, subjects will receive an&#xD;
      initial dose of either full dose MDMA or placebo along with psychotherapy, and one and a half&#xD;
      to two and a half hours later, the subject may have a supplemental half the size of the&#xD;
      initial dose. Vital signs and psychological distress will be measured throughout the&#xD;
      experimental session. There will be three integrative psychotherapy sessions after each&#xD;
      experimental session, including one occurring the day after an experimental session. Subjects&#xD;
      will express, understand and connect any of their thoughts or feelings about PTSD symptoms&#xD;
      and their causes, and they will discuss their experience during experimental sessions with&#xD;
      the therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will learn the dose of MDMA they received one month after the second MDMA-assisted&#xD;
      psychotherapy session. Subjects who received full dose will complete Stage 1, with a third&#xD;
      open-label session, and subjects who received comparator dose MDMA will go on to Stage 2, an&#xD;
      open label period of the study that is nearly identical to stage 1, but with one instead of&#xD;
      three preparatory sessions and one of two active doses of MDMA used in all three experimental&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of PTSD, depression, dissociation, general psychological well-being, sleep quality&#xD;
      and potential positive effects of experiencing traumatic events will be measured in all&#xD;
      subjects at baseline, one month after the second experimental session and 12 months after&#xD;
      their final experimental session, and any subjects reporting pain or tinnitus at the start of&#xD;
      the study will record these symptoms throughout the study.Subjects who received the full dose&#xD;
      and go on to the third experimental session will complete questionnaires and measures of PTSD&#xD;
      and other symptoms two months after the third experimental session. Subjects who received&#xD;
      comparator dose MDMA will be tested one month after their second Stage 2 experimental session&#xD;
      and two months after the third experimental session. Measures of cognitive function will be&#xD;
      given to subjects in Stage two months after their third experimental session, and to Stage 2&#xD;
      subjects two months after their third Stage 2 session. People will also complete measures of&#xD;
      their experience of the experimental session soon after each experimental session. At least&#xD;
      12 months after their final Stage 1 or Stage 2 session, measures of PTSD symptoms, other&#xD;
      symptoms, sleep quality, general well-being and and post traumatic growth will be assessed&#xD;
      again, and subjects will complete a questionnaire on the benefits and harms of study&#xD;
      participation and other life events and views related to study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the effects of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with comparator versus&#xD;
      full dose MDMA, and it will also assess the duration of any changes in symptoms a year after&#xD;
      MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>Clinician-administered and scored assessment of PTSD symptoms via structured interview, including global symptom severity, dichotomous diagnostic score and subscale scores. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-4 (CAPS-4) is a clinician administered and scored assessment of PTSD symptoms via structured interview based upon PTSD diagnosis in DSM-4. It contains symptom subscales, a CAPS-4 total severity score, and a diagnostic score. The total severity score is a sum of symptom frequency and intensity scores for the subscales B (re-experiencing), C (avoidance) and D (hypervigilance) and ranges from 0 to 136, with higher scores indicating greater severity of PTSD symptoms. Change from CAPS administered at Baseline to primary endpoint 1 month after 2nd experimental session</description>

        <title>Change in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale Score</title>
        <description>Clinician-administered and scored assessment of PTSD symptoms via structured interview, including global symptom severity, dichotomous diagnostic score and subscale scores. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-4 (CAPS-4) is a clinician administered and scored assessment of PTSD symptoms via structured interview based upon PTSD diagnosis in DSM-4. It contains symptom subscales, a CAPS-4 total severity score, and a diagnostic score. The total severity score is a sum of symptom frequency and intensity scores for the subscales B (re-experiencing), C (avoidance) and D (hypervigilance) and ranges from 0 to 136, with higher scores indicating greater severity of PTSD symptoms.
