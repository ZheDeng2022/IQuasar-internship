    <textblock>
      This research evaluates the effectiveness of a new drug called belatacept (Nulojix) for the&#xD;
      prevention of acute rejection and preservation of kidney function in transplant patients.&#xD;
      Belatacept was approved in 2011 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and&#xD;
      is being marketed as Nulojix. The pharmaceutical company sponsoring this study is&#xD;
      Bristol-Myers Squibb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Belatacept is a prescription medicine used in adults to prevent transplant rejection in&#xD;
      people who have received a kidney transplant. Transplant rejection happens when the body's&#xD;
      immune system senses that the new transplanted kidney is different or foreign, and attacks&#xD;
      it. Belatacept is used with corticosteroids and certain other medicines to help prevent&#xD;
      rejection of your new kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the research is to understand whether the new drug, belatacept, is better than&#xD;
      other anti-rejection drugs, such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus that are typically used in&#xD;
      the treatment against kidney rejection in transplant patients.&#xD;

      Research Hypothesis: Switching to a belatacept-based immunosuppression regimen after kidney&#xD;
      transplant will have a significant impact on antibody and T cell-mediated immune response as&#xD;
      compared with control patients as measured in peripheral blood at 6 months after belatacept&#xD;
      switch and comparable safety and efficacy as compared with calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) based&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To analyze the effect of switching from CNI to belatacept in patients with&#xD;
      evidence of CNI toxicity on the development and maintenance of immune memory in response to&#xD;
      both alloantigen and viral antigens commonly encountered after transplant, and to assess the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of conversion to belatacept as maintenance immunosuppression in&#xD;
      combination with prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Open label, single center clinical trial. Patients with evidence of CNI&#xD;
      toxicity will be eligible for switch to belatacept-based regimen within the first three&#xD;
      months after transplant. All enrolled subjects will also receive concomitant maintenance&#xD;
      immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study: 6 months, with option to extend to 12 months of belatacept treatment&#xD;
      Number of Subjects: 20 Study Population: Kidney transplant recipients within the first three&#xD;
      months of their first transplant with evidence of CNI toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donor specific antibody testing at Month 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cell surface cytokine secretion in response to donor cell antigen by direct and indirect&#xD;
           stimulation at Month 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cell surface cytokine secretion in response to CMV and EBV antigens by direct and&#xD;
           indirect stimulation at Month 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunophenotyping to determine overall immune profile at Month 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient and functional graft survival in stable renal transplant recipients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donor specific antibody testing at Months 1 and 3 (and month 12 if continuing in study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cell surface cytokine secretion in response to donor cell antigen by direct and indirect&#xD;
           stimulation at Months 1 and 3 (and month 12 if continuing in study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cell surface cytokine secretion in response to CMV and EBV antigens by direct and&#xD;
           indirect stimulation at Months 1 and 3 (and month 12 if continuing in study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment: Study patients will&#xD;
      receive intravenous belatacept at 5mg/kg every two weeks at day 1 and weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8,&#xD;
      and then monthly at months 3, 4, and 5. At month 6 patients may elect to continue for an&#xD;
      additional six month period of belatacept administration. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
      (PBMCs) and sera for antibody testing will be collected at time of study entry and at 4, 8,&#xD;
      12, and 24 weeks after belatacept start, frozen and banked at our center, and analyzed in&#xD;
      batch fashion for development of humoral and cell mediated immunity. Patients who elect to&#xD;
      receive an additional 6 months of belatacept treatment will undergo additional immunologic&#xD;
      analysis at 1 year after study entry.&#xD;
