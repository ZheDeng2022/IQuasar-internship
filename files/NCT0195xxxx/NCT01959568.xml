      Purpose: to assess the efficacy and safety of double tamponade versus silicone oil tamponade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: parallel-group study with balanced [1:1] stratified block randomization. Eligible&#xD;
      participants are all adults aged 18 or over with first diagnosed rhegmatogenous total retinal&#xD;
      detachment with retinal breaks located both in upper and lower retina. Also investigators&#xD;
      include those patients with total retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy&#xD;
      (PVR) in which it is impossible to remove epiretinal membranes completely during the surgery&#xD;
      (with arbitrary retinal breaks localization). Exclusion criteria are severe concomitant eye&#xD;
      pathologies (glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, macular hole, traumas etc) and eye length more&#xD;
      than 27mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized in two groups (test group and control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the test group patients undergo subtotal vitrectomy, epiretinal membrane removal,&#xD;
      perfluorodecalin (PFD) tamponade, retinal photocoagulation. After that the surgeon replaces ½&#xD;
      of PFD volume by &quot;conventional&quot; SO (with density less than one of water). The result is&#xD;
      vitreous cavity (VC) filled in a half with PFD and in another half - with SO. In the control&#xD;
      group patients undergo subtotal vitrectomy, epiretinal membrane removal, PFD tamponade,&#xD;
      retinal photocoagulation and PFD-SO exchange, so the result is VC filled with &quot;conventional&quot;&#xD;
      or heavy SO, depending on predominant retinal breaks location. 30 days after the surgery in&#xD;
      both groups tamponing agents are removed from VC and VC is filled with sulfur hexafluoride&#xD;
      gas (SF6) which dissolves during 1 month. Follow-up is at least 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with standard examinations, after SF6 gas dissolution investigators perform spectral&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) and microperimetry. With OCT investigators measure&#xD;
      thickness of retinal inner and outer nuclear layers. With microperimetry investigators&#xD;
      determine light sensitivity in 12° and 4° zones from the fixation point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: reattachment rate, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular&#xD;
      pressure (IOP), thicknesses of inner and outer nuclear layers according to the OCT, light&#xD;
      sensitivity according to microperimetry, the rate of cataract formation in phakic eyes and&#xD;
      the rate of tamponing agents emulsification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For final analysis each group will include 145 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT, microperimetry data and visual acuity will be compared between the groups using&#xD;
      Student's t-test; proportions will be compared using exact Fisher's test.&#xD;

      The investigators include in the study all successive patients operated by the same surgeon.&#xD;
      The study takes place in the S.N. Fyodorov &quot;Eye Microsurgery&quot; Federal State Institution&#xD;
      located in Moscow, Russian Federation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized in two groups with stratified block randomization. Strata were&#xD;
      defined by combination of two binary prognostic factors: duration of retinal detachment (less&#xD;
      than 3 months and ≥ 3 months) and PVR (present/absent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early interim analysis will be performed in order to reveal possible adverse effect of&#xD;
      long-term PFD tamponade. For interim report success will mean the rate of post-surgical BCVA&#xD;
      &gt;/= 20.200. Groups sizes for interim analysis will be 35 patients in each group. For interim&#xD;
      analysis the investigators choose group sizes able to reveal 30% absolute difference in&#xD;
      functional success rate with one-sided test (to detect possible toxicity of double tamponade&#xD;
      for the retina) having power of 0.8 and significance level of p=0.05. In the final analysis&#xD;
      success will mean retinal reattachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For final analysis each group will include 145 participants, so that the investigators are&#xD;
      able to detect 15% difference in reattachment rate with power of 0.8 and significance level&#xD;
      of p=0.05. Group sizes were computed with exact Fisher's test function in G*Power 3.1.7&#xD;
      software (Erdfelder, Faul, &amp; Buchner).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT is performed with Cirrus HD-OCT system (Zeiss Meditec Inc). Microperimetry is performed&#xD;
      with MP-1 microperimeter (Nidek). All the examinations are assessed by one ophthalmologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allocation concealment is implemented with the help of a third party, who stores the&#xD;
      randomization list and prepares envelopes containing directions what method of tamponade to&#xD;
      employ in each particular patient. Patients are blind to the method of tamponade.&#xD;
