  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of vintafolide alone compared&#xD;
      to vintafolide plus paclitaxel and paclitaxel alone in participants with with 100% positive&#xD;
      folate receptor (FR) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis of this study is the vintafolide alone and/or vintafolide + paclitaxel&#xD;
      will improve progression free survival (PFS) in participants with FR (100%) TNBC compared to&#xD;
      paclitaxel alone.&#xD;

      During the screening stage, participants will be required to have a diagnostic computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scan with etarfolatide (EC20) to identify target lesions and determine&#xD;
      eligibility for treatment. After successful screening, during the treatment stage,&#xD;
      participants will receive study drug (vintafolide, vintafolide + paclitaxel, or paclitaxel)&#xD;
      for approximately four 28-day cycles.&#xD;
