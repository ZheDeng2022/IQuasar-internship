      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using a patient-centered&#xD;
      smart phone application for insulin self-titration on glycemic control. Over a 18-month&#xD;
      period, suboptimally controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on oral antidiabetic agents,&#xD;
      thus requiring insulin treatment patients, will be recruited from the Singapore General&#xD;
      Hospital (SGH). Patients randomized to the intervention group will be instructed to&#xD;
      self-adjust their insulin dose using a smart phone application designed to guide&#xD;
      self-titration; patients randomized to the control group will receive the usual clinical&#xD;
      care. The primary outcome measure is change in glycated hemoglobin level (HbA1c), 6 months&#xD;
      post-enrollment. The investigators hypothesize that using a smart phone application for&#xD;
      insulin self-titration is effective in improving glycemic control in T2DM patients compared&#xD;
      with usual care.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) require insulin therapy after suboptimal&#xD;
      glycemic control with oral antidiabetic agents. Initiating insulin therapy and adjusting&#xD;
      dosage is vital in improving clinical outcomes among patients with diabetes. However, timely&#xD;
      and appropriate dosage titration is challenging for many patients. Doctors also contend with&#xD;
      many patients lacking the confidence to self-titrate insulin. Hence, reinforcing patients'&#xD;
      self-empowerment is important in diabetes management. Developing tools that facilitate dosage&#xD;
      adjustment of insulin may have substantial benefits to glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using a patient-centered&#xD;
      smart phone application for insulin self-titration to improve glycemic control relative to&#xD;
      usual care in patients with T2DM. The specific aim of the study is to determine the technical&#xD;
      and clinical feasibility of a patient-centered smart phone application for insulin&#xD;
      self-titration on glycemic control (HbA1c) of suboptimally controlled patients with T2DM who&#xD;
      are starting insulin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 24-week study is a randomized controlled trial that will involve participants recruited&#xD;
      from Singapore General Hospital, a 1500-bed tertiary care hospital. The target population&#xD;
      will consist of insulin naive patients with T2DM (30-70 years old) with suboptimal glycemic&#xD;
      control (HbA1c â‰¥ 7.5%) while on oral antidiabetic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty patients will be recruited in the study and randomized into either the intervention or&#xD;
      control group in equal numbers (n=40) within strata defined by provider (i.e., within each of&#xD;
      the five doctors). Patients will be nested within providers, and randomization within each&#xD;
      provider will be performed in blocks of 4 subjects: 2 for the intervention and 2 for the&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be recruited over a 18-month period from the Singapore General&#xD;
      Hospital. All patients newly initiated on insulin therapy will receive standard diabetes&#xD;
      education from Diabetes Nurse Educators (DNEs). The research coordinator and doctors will&#xD;
      work closely with the DNEs to identify eligible patients for this study. When a patient is&#xD;
      eligible to participate in the study, the research coordinator will provide a study&#xD;
      information brochure and explain the study design to the patient. Investigators will obtain&#xD;
      an informed consent from patients prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of a smart phone application in self-titration of insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Variable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difference in change in glycemic control (HbA1c) between the intervention and the control&#xD;
      group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruited patients will receive once-daily injections of insulin detemir, a long-acting&#xD;
      insulin, to be given at bedtime. The physicians are free to keep patients on all oral&#xD;
      antidiabetic agents, except for thiazolidinediones. All recruited patients will receive free&#xD;
      glucometers and test strips.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be a comparison of mean reduction in HbA1c at 24 weeks&#xD;
      post-randomization in the treatment and control groups in the context of a linear&#xD;
      mixed-effects model with random effects for patients and doctors. The study is randomized, so&#xD;
      baseline features and potential confounders should be approximately balanced between the&#xD;
      treatment and control groups. However, the sample size is small (80 patients in total) so the&#xD;
      mixed-effects model will be adjusted for covariates selected using forward stepwise variable&#xD;
      selection with the AIC criterion. Potential covariates include age, gender, whether the&#xD;
      patient themselves has a smart-phone, and treatment satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mixed-effects model allows all non-missing data to be used in the analysis without&#xD;
      imputation. However, for the estimate of the difference in reduction in HbA1c to be unbiased,&#xD;
      it is required that the distribution of the data missingness conditional on the variables in&#xD;
      the model and the observed data does not depend on the values of the missing data, so that&#xD;
      the data is missing-at-random.This is a common and a reasonable assumption. However, it is&#xD;
      possible that the analysis of attrition will indicate that additional covariates need to be&#xD;
      included in the mixed-effects model. With the aim of developing a tailored analysis plan for&#xD;
      a definitive study, a few additional models for comparison of mean reduction in HbA1c will&#xD;
      also be considered. For example, a linear mixed-effects model with random slope and intercept&#xD;
      for each patient and doctor which incorporates the intermediate HbA1c measurements for each&#xD;
      patient will also be fit. It is unknown a priori whether such a model will have reduced power&#xD;
      because of patients attaining equilibrium titration at different times or if such a model&#xD;
      will have increased power because it uses more observations albeit on the same group of&#xD;
      patients. Depending on the rate of attrition and whether attrition is related to covariates,&#xD;
      a propensity score for missingness may be developed and models fit which are adjusted for or&#xD;
      stratified by this score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary examination of efficacy will be through a linear mixed-effects model with random&#xD;
      effects for each doctor and patient, under the assumption that the distribution of&#xD;
      missingness conditional on the covariates and observed data does not depend on the missing&#xD;
      data values. However, the investigators will examine several analyses for appropriateness&#xD;
      including simple comparisons of the reductions in HbA1c between the treatment and control&#xD;
      groups under last-observation-carried-forward, which is expected to be fairly conservative,&#xD;
      and worst-observation-carried-forward, which is expected to be extremely conservative. What&#xD;
      these methods lack in rigor may be offset by their simplicity.&#xD;

    <description>The smart phone application (Diabetes Pal), will guide patients on self-titration of insulin. Patients will be required to key in the CBG readings into the application. Up-titration of insulin dose will be carried out once every 3 days and the recommended insulin dose will be based on the mean of 3 CBG readings and a pre-specified titration algorithm. The process of using the insulin self-titration application will continue until the patient has reached the target pre-breakfast CBG.</description>
