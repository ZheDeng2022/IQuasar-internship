  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of many neurodegenerative diseases is unknown. A few studies have suggested the&#xD;
      role of infection in the gastrointestinal tract in the etiology and pathogenesis of&#xD;
      neurological diseases such as idiopathic Parkinson. For example, infection with Helicobacter&#xD;
      pylori has been suggested to play a role in Parkinson disease. In addition, bacterial&#xD;
      pathogens such as spirochetes and bacterial products such as cyanobacterial toxins have been&#xD;
      speculated as the contributing factors in the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&#xD;
      (ALS). The effect of microbial composition of the gut in the pathogenesis of ALS is&#xD;
      suspected. The difference in the bacterial profile of the gut has been documented in diseases&#xD;
      such as inflammatory bowel disease and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this IRB protocol is to create a human tissue bank and to obtain patients'&#xD;
      demographic information for future investigation of the role of bacterial pathogens and the&#xD;
      role of gut flora composition in the development of neurodegenerative diseases including but&#xD;
      not limited to ALS, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to create a bank of fecal and blood samples and&#xD;
      associated coded demographic information for future investigation of the microbial etiology&#xD;
      and pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases including but not limited to Amyotrophic&#xD;
      Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 300 adult participants (open to all races and both sexes) subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited (i.e. 100 healthy controls, 100 subjects with other neurodegenerative diseases (not&#xD;
      ALS) and 100 subjects with ALS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria permit all adults aged &gt;18 years of age with the diagnosis of ALS who are&#xD;
      willing to provide informed consent and patients who do not have a diagnosis of ALS and are&#xD;
      willing to provide informed consent. Subjects who do not provide informed consent, have acute&#xD;
      bacterial infection of the GI tract, and/or are being treated with antibiotics or probiotics&#xD;
      within 28 days prior to sampling are excluded. A separate blood sample will not be taken from&#xD;
      a subject if the maximum amount of samples allowed have been collected for standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival to the clinic, staff will provide the stool tissue bank protocol informed&#xD;
      consent / HIPAA authorization document to eligible subjects for review. If subjects indicate&#xD;
      a willingness to participate, the research coordinator or one of the participating&#xD;
      investigators will review the informed consent form / HIPAA authorization with the subjects&#xD;
      and answer any questions. If subjects agree to participate, they will sign the informed&#xD;
      consent form / HIPAA authorization. Copies of the document will be made for subjects;&#xD;
      originals will be filed in a locked cabinet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological materials will be collected from the patient using either one or both of the&#xD;
      following methods: as biological samples obtained specifically for the study (e.g. stool&#xD;
      samples from all participating patients) or as extra material obtained specifically for&#xD;
      research in addition to material collected as part of routine care (e.g., blood samples).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to consider participating in the stool tissue bank protocol. If&#xD;
      subjects consent to donate extra samples for the bank, the samples will be obtained by the&#xD;
      physicians or the clinic staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two 10 ml venous blood samples for the ALS tissue bank will be collected 1) in a serum&#xD;
      separator, and 2) in a tube containing the anticoagulant, EDTA (lavender top). Stool samples&#xD;
      will be collected in sterile plastic cups. The blood and stool samples will be put on ice or&#xD;
      refrigerated as promptly as possible until delivered to the ALS Research Laboratory at Cannon&#xD;
      Research Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be de-identified by labeling with a research code prior to entering the&#xD;
      laboratory. All information pertaining to the sample including a copy of the consent form and&#xD;
      the master list of the research coding will be secured in a locked file cabinet. Personal&#xD;
      health information (PHI) obtained will be entered into a separate security-protected database&#xD;
      utilizing encryption technology and accessible only to authorized personnel. The samples,&#xD;
      once coded, will be given to the appropriate laboratory technician for processing and&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be centrifuged, the plasma and serum samples will be aliquoted in 1 ml&#xD;
      tubes and stored at -80 C. The blood cells, separated from plasma, will be processed for DNA&#xD;
      isolation immediately or stored at -80 C for later DNA extraction. Four ~25 mg aliquots of&#xD;
      stool samples will be stored in sterile tubes at -80 C for future analysis. Storage freezers&#xD;
      are locked, connected to emergency power and monitored by an alarm system that notifies&#xD;
      laboratory personnel of malfunctions, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a data collection form will be completed by the research staff to collect&#xD;
      demographic, medical history, etc. as shown in Appendix C. The form will be linked to the&#xD;
      tissue samples by an individual research code. This information is necessary for defining the&#xD;
      tissue samples collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No formal sample size determination will be performed for this tissue bank protocol.&#xD;
