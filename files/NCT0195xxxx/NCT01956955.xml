      Purpose and rationale: Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and often fatal disease,&#xD;
      with an approximately 30% mortality rate without treatment. Treatment is important to reduce&#xD;
      mortality and recurrence in acute PE. Therapeutic options for PE include subcutaneous low&#xD;
      molecular weight heparin (SC LMWH), intravenous unfractionated heparin (IV UFH), subcutaneous&#xD;
      unfractionated heparin and subcutaneous fondaparinux with or without thrombolysis. In the&#xD;
      treatment of acute PE, SC LMWH has been shown, at least, as effective and safe as IV UFH [4].&#xD;
      Compared to IV UFH, SC LMWH associated with lower mortality, fewer recurrent thrombotic&#xD;
      events and less major bleeding. Current guidelines recommend use of SC LMWH for most&#xD;
      hemodynamically stable patients with PE and they say that SC LMWH have not been tested in the&#xD;
      setting of acute massive PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that SC LMWH is as safe as IV UFH in the&#xD;
      treatment of acute PE in combination with thrombolytic treatment.&#xD;

      1. Introduction 1.1. Background Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and often fatal&#xD;
           disease, with an approximately 30% mortality rate without treatment [1]. Treatment is&#xD;
           important to reduce mortality and recurrence in acute pulmonary embolism.&#xD;
           Anticoagulation is the mainstay of the therapy for acute PE. It decreases the mortality&#xD;
           rate to 3 to 8 percent, when effective therapy is instituted as quickly as possible [2,&#xD;
           3]. In those cases, therapeutic options include subcutaneous low molecular weight&#xD;
           heparin (SC LMWH), intravenous unfractionated heparin (IV UFH), subcutaneous&#xD;
           unfractionated heparin and subcutaneous fondaparinux with or without thrombolysis [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the treatment of acute PE, SC LMWH is at least as effective and safe as IV UFH [4].&#xD;
           In general, compared to IV UFH, SC LMWH associated with lower mortality, fewer recurrent&#xD;
           thrombotic events and less major bleeding [5]. Current guidelines recommend the use of&#xD;
           SC LMWH for most haemodynamically stable patients with PE and they say that SC LMWH have&#xD;
           not been tested in the setting of hypotension and shock [3, 6]. However, it seems to be&#xD;
           more feasible to use it because of its advantages such as easy administration route,&#xD;
           i.e. SC. We have been using SC LMWHs in the cases with acute PE with or without&#xD;
           requirement of thrombolysis in our clinical practice since they were available, because&#xD;
           of their advantages for practical use and their use in primary or secondary care&#xD;
           settings in the patients with because of PE suspicion just before their admission to our&#xD;
           hospital. In our 10 years' clinical experience, we observed comparable hemorrhage risk&#xD;
           (3.7% vs 0.7% and 12.1% vs 3.8%, for major and minor hemorrhage risk, respectively) with&#xD;
           the use of LMWH plus thrombolysis in the cases with massive PE, even compared the cases&#xD;
           treated with LMWH alone without massive PE (7). Yet, there is no head to head study&#xD;
           comparing LMWH with UFH in the treatment of massive PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will evaluate safety of LMWH use with thrombolytic treatment in the management&#xD;
           of acute PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Purpose The purpose of this study, because of its practical use such as no need for&#xD;
           monitoring, is to demonstrate that SC LMWH, enoxaparin, is to be a safe alternative to&#xD;
           IV UFH in the management of acute PE cases, who require thrombolytic treatment, in&#xD;
           combination with thrombolytic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Objectives 2.1. Primary aim The primary aim of the study is to compare the major&#xD;
           hemorrhage risk between the use of LMWH plus thrombolytic treatment and UFH plus&#xD;
           thrombolytic in the treatment of acute massive PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Secondary Aim The secondary aim of the study is to compare the minor hemorrhage&#xD;
           risk and mortality (five day and one year mortality) between the use of LMWH plus&#xD;
           thrombolytic treatment and UFH plus thrombolytic in the treatment of acute massive PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigational plan 3.1. Study design This is a single-center randomized study in acute&#xD;
           PE patients who require thrombolytic treatment and have no contraindication to use of&#xD;
           anticoagulation, comparing safety of SC LMWH versus IV UFH when used with thrombolytic&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After a baseline evaluation for the diagnostic procedures and providing informed&#xD;
           consent, eligible patients who are diagnosed as acute PE and require thrombolytic&#xD;
           treatment but have no contraindication to use any study drug including alteplase, LMWH&#xD;
           (enoxaparin) or heparin will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2. Study setting A tertiary care, university, hospital, which is the biggest hospital&#xD;
           in eastern part of Turkey and serving more than 7 cities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3. Study period Between January 2011 and December 2013 3.4. Rationale of study design&#xD;
           LMWHs have been used in the treatment of PE and their use becomes popular in many&#xD;
           centers because of practical administration route, SC versus infusion, no need for&#xD;
           monitoring and close follow up. However, there is no previous data on the use of LMWHs&#xD;
           in the cases who require thrombolytic and, for this reason, no recommendation about&#xD;
           their use in the current guidelines. Because some cases were administered LMWH before&#xD;
           admission to a hospital for thrombolytic treatment and they were required immediate&#xD;
           administration of thrombolytic treatment, their use with thrombolytic is likely although&#xD;
           there is no recommendation for such use. Because the adverse events associated with the&#xD;
           use of LMWH with thrombolytic treatment in the cases who require thrombolytic were&#xD;
           comparable even with the cases who use LMWH alone and do not require thrombolytic (7),&#xD;
           we planned to compare LMWH and UFH in the cases who require thrombolytic treatment that&#xD;
           the latter is the only choice in those cases according to the current guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study will provide data comparing safety of LMWH versus UFH in the treatment of&#xD;
           acute PE cases who require thrombolytic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The randomized study was selected to make head to head comparison in the evaluating the&#xD;
           safety of LMWH versus UFH in the treatment of acute PE cases who require thrombolytic&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           No stratification was applied for randomization. 3.5. Randomization method The&#xD;
           randomization order was determined using a computer-generated list of random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.6. Ethical considerations Local ethical committee approved the protocol of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Population 4.1. Study population: The study population will consist approximately 120&#xD;
           adult cases with a clinical diagnosis of acute PE who require thrombolytic treatment and&#xD;
           have no contraindication to use of anticoagulation in a single center, tertiary&#xD;
           university hospital. It is anticipated that approximately 150 patients will need to be&#xD;
           screened in order to randomize into the 2 treatment arms of the study with a&#xD;
           randomization ratio of 1:1; therefore, approximately 60 patients will be assigned to&#xD;
           each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3. Screening for eligibility All patients with clinical suspicion of PE (major risk&#xD;
           factors, clinical manifestations) were underwent chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG),&#xD;
           echocardiographic evaluation and computerized thorax (CT) angiography with a 16-slice&#xD;
           multidetector CT (if there was no contraindication).&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4. Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Key inclusion criteria that the patient must fulfill to be eligible for the study&#xD;
           include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adults, age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients who have signed the study informed consent form prior to initiation of any&#xD;
                study-related procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acute massive PE patients who require thrombolytic treatment. 4.5. Exclusion&#xD;
                criteria Patients fulfilling any of the following criteria are not eligible for&#xD;
                inclusion in this study. No additional exclusions may be applied by the&#xD;
                investigator, in order to ensure that the study population will be representative&#xD;
                of all eligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients who have a contraindication to use of anticoagulation and thrombolysis,&#xD;
                such as active bleeding, stroke, cranial trauma, or neurologic surgery within the&#xD;
                preceding 6 months, current pregnancy, major surgery, or biopsy within the&#xD;
                preceding 7 days, major trauma within the preceding 10 days, gastrointestinal&#xD;
                bleeding within the preceding 1 months during their admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients who received any anticoagulation medication prior to admission to the&#xD;
                hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Treatment 5.1. Investigational and control treatments (Exposure) Investigational&#xD;
           treatment: LMWH, enoxaparin, plus alteplase Control treatment: UFH plus alteplase 5.2.&#xD;
           Treatment arms After providing informed consent, patients will be assigned to 1 of the&#xD;
           following 2 treatment arms in a ratio 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fixed dose SC LMWH (enoxaparin)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weight adjusted dose of UFH. In both treatment arms, patients will also receive&#xD;
                thrombolytic treatment, a bolus of 10 mg of alteplase followed by 90 mg over 2-h&#xD;
                infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3. Treatment and monitoring After thrombolytic treatment, a bolus of 10 mg of alteplase&#xD;
      followed by 90 mg over 2-h infusion, patients either administered a constant heparin infusion&#xD;
      (18 U/Kg per hour) adjusted to maintain an activated partial thromboplastin time of 46-70 s&#xD;
      or SC LMWH received enoxaparin. After fibrinolytic therapy (FT), 4-6 hour later, activated&#xD;
      partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was checked. According to initial SC LMWH use time, fixed&#xD;
      dose SC LMWH, enoxaparin, was administered subcutaneous every 12 hours. Both groups&#xD;
      overlapped with warfarin on the 1st day to 5th day or the day achieved targeted international&#xD;
      normalized ratio (INR) level. The patients were kept on warfarin, aiming for an INR between&#xD;
      2.0 and 3.0 for 3 months or more, depending on the presence of major risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4. Schedule of measurements The clinical evaluation (physical exam, blood pressure, pulse&#xD;
      rate &amp; oxygen saturation) was performed before and after starting fibrinolytic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The echocardiographic examination and interpretation were performed before starting&#xD;
      fibrinolytic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. 5. Data collection and follow-up Data collection was performed on admission, during&#xD;
      hospitalization and at discharge. At least a year-follow up was planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Definitions 6.1. Adverse Events Major hemorrhage; stroke (confirmed by computed&#xD;
      tomography), hematoma&gt;5 cm, oral or gastrointestinal bleeding or another bleeding with&#xD;
      concomitant hypotension that required treatment with intravenous fluids, blood transfusion,&#xD;
      surgical control, discontinuation of FT regimen, decrease &gt;15% points in hematocrit or &gt;5&#xD;
      g/dl reduction in hemoglobin [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minor hemorrhage; decrease between 10-15% points in hematocrit or 3-5 g/dl reduction in&#xD;
      hemoglobin [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality: Hospital mortality on day 5 and one year mortality. 6.2. Other definitions Massive&#xD;
      PE; is defined as acute PE with sustained hypotension (systolic arterial pressure &lt;90 mm Hg&#xD;
      or a drop in systolic arterial pressure of at least 40 mm Hg for at least 15 minutes) and&#xD;
      cardiogenic shock (including an altered level of consciousness, oliguria, or cool, clammy&#xD;
      extremities) [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent PE; clinical suspicion of new PE symptoms, new signs on electrocardiogram&#xD;
      in-hospital with or without clinical instability, or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Statistical Analysis Plan 7.1. Sample size and power: 120 acute massive PE patients. We&#xD;
      should have &gt;80% power (2-sided testing and significance level &lt;0.05) to detect a 20%&#xD;
      absolute bleeding risk increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2. Statistical methods Statistical analysis will be performed with SPSS for Windows version&#xD;
      17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be expressed in percent, mean and standard deviation, odds ratio and 95% confident&#xD;
      interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the two-tailed Student t test for comparisons of continuous variables between&#xD;
      patients with SC LMWH plus thrombolytic and UFH plus thrombolytic and Pearson Chi square test&#xD;
      for comparisons of categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival estimations will be done by Kaplan-Meier Survival Probability estimates and Cox&#xD;
      regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings will be considered statistically significant if a P value of &lt;0.05 was obtained.&#xD;
