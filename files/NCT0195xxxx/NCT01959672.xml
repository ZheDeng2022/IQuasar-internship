    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well combination chemotherapy with or without oregovomab&#xD;
      followed by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and nelfinavir mesylate works in&#xD;
      treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread to nearby organs or tissues. Drugs&#xD;
      used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and&#xD;
      fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as oregovomab, can block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain&#xD;
      cells. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that sends&#xD;
      x-rays directly to the tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause less damage&#xD;
      to normal tissue. Drugs, such as nelfinavir mesylate, may make tumor cells more sensitive to&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Giving combination chemotherapy with or without oregovomab followed by&#xD;
      SBRT and nelfinavir mesylate may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, (gemcitabine [gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride], leucovorin [leucovorin calcium], fluorouracil [5-FU]) with or without&#xD;
      oregovomab, followed by hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) concurrently with&#xD;
      nelfinavir (nelfinavir mesylate) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer that is&#xD;
      cancer antigen (CA)125 positive (&gt;= 10) or CA125 negative (&lt; 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, (gemcitabine, leucovorin, 5-FU) with or&#xD;
      without oregovomab, followed by SRT concurrently with nelfinavir in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic cancer that is CA125 positive (&gt;= 10) or CA125 negative (&lt; 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the cellular and humoral immune responses to active immunotherapy with&#xD;
      oregovomab/monoclonal antibody in patients with pancreas cancer with CA125 level greater than&#xD;
      10 undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate tumor and organ motion with 4-dimensional (4D) computed tomography (CT) and&#xD;
      respiratory gating system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the effect of tumor/organ motion on the dosimetry, local control and&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate inter- and intra-fractional target motion with Calypso system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV), leucovorin&#xD;
      calcium IV over 30 minutes, and fluorouracil IV over 24 hours on days 1 and 8. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 3 weeks for 7 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMMUNOTHERAPY: Patients with CA125 level &gt;= 10 receive oregovomab IV over 15-30 minutes on&#xD;
      day 15. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses (weeks 1, 4, 7) and post- radiation&#xD;
      therapy for 1 course (week 14). Patients may receive an additional 3 courses concurrently&#xD;
      with chemotherapy upon recovery from surgery based on CA125 level. Patients also receive&#xD;
      nelfinavir mesylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 5 weeks beginning on day 15 of week 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEREOTACTIC RADIATION THERAPY: Beginning in week 11, patients undergo SBRT in 5 fractions&#xD;
      over 5 consecutive days. Upon completion of radiation therapy, patients resume nelfinavir&#xD;
      mesylate for 14 days (week 12-13). Patients without metastasis and with resectable disease&#xD;
      undergo surgery in week 17-18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,&#xD;
      every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

IMMUNOTHERAPY: Patients with CA125 level &gt;= 10 receive oregovomab IV over 15-30 minutes on day 15. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses (weeks 1, 4, 7) and post- radiation therapy for 1 course (week 14).

Patients also receive nelfinavir mesylate PO BID for 5 weeks beginning on day 15 of week 9.&#xD;
STEREOTACTIC RADIATION THERAPY: Beginning in week 11, patients undergo SBRT in 5 fractions over 5 consecutive days. Upon completion of radiation therapy, patients resume nelfinavir mesylate for 14 days (week 12-13). Patients without metastasis and with resectable disease undergo surgery in week 17-18.</description>

IMMUNOTHERAPY: Patients with CA125 level &gt;= 10 receive oregovomab IV over 15-30 minutes on day 15. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses (weeks 1, 4, 7) and post- radiation therapy for 1 course (week 14). Patients may receive an additional 3 courses concurrently with chemotherapy upon recovery from surgery based on CA125 level. Patients also receive nelfinavir mesylate PO BID for 5 weeks beginning on day 15 of week 9.&#xD;
STEREOTACTIC RADIATION THERAPY: Beginning in week 11, patients undergo SBRT in 5 fractions over 5 consecutive days. Upon completion of radiation therapy, patients resume nelfinavir mesylate for 14 days (week 12-13). Patients without metastasis and with resectable disease undergo surgery in week 17-18.</description>
