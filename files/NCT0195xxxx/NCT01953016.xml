      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People with primary immune deficiency diseases (PIDD) have weak immune systems. This makes&#xD;
      it hard for their bodies to fight infection. The Immune Deficiency Foundation has a network&#xD;
      to collect data about people with PIDD. It is called the United States Immunodeficiency&#xD;
      Network. It will help doctors and scientists better understand these disorders. The goal is&#xD;
      to get medical data for everyone with these disorders in the U.S. and Canada. Data will be&#xD;
      stored in a registry. Researchers can use it to study if these disorders are increasing. They&#xD;
      can also learn how the disorders are diagnosed and treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect data on people with primary immune deficiency disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People who have a PIDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data can be added with no record of personal identity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data can be added with identity kept separate. This data will be linked to the registry&#xD;
           by a code number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data for the registry includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory data&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this protocol is to provide a resource for clinical and laboratory research&#xD;
      through enrollment of known immunodeficiency patients into a national registry, the US&#xD;
      Immunodeficiency Network (USIDNET). The registry data will expand NIH s and the nation s&#xD;
      knowledge base about immune deficiency disorders and genetic mutations that lead to these&#xD;
      disorders. Additional registrants from NIH protocols will not only increase the understanding&#xD;
      of the molecular basis of these disorders, but also will serve to document and track the&#xD;
      incidence and progression of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this proposal is to create a mechanism for depositing NIH data into USIDNET.&#xD;
      The patient Registry is designed to obtain longitudinal data on a large number of patients&#xD;
      with primary immunodeficiency diseases, and genetic carriers of these defects in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about the phenotypic variations seen in a large number of individual patients&#xD;
           with the same rare molecular diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the natural history of these genetic disorders of immunity and establish&#xD;
           genotype-phenotype correlations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn effects of various treatment protocols used in these patients over time, including&#xD;
           unexpected side effects that may be unique to a particular diagnostic group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate quality of life using standard tools and correlate these with genotype and&#xD;
           treatment history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To promote collaborative research amongst interested investigators by identifying a&#xD;
           larger pool of potential research subjects than would be available at their own&#xD;
           institutions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify patients with a specific diagnosis for potential participation in&#xD;
           multi-institutional clinical trials designed for diagnosis or therapy or their specific&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
