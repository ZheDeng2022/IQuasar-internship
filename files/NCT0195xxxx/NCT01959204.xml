    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV study to characterize the pharmacokinetics and to evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      Oxycodone Oral Solution administered to pediatric and adolescent subjects for postoperative&#xD;
      pain. It is an open label, multicenter study conducted at up to 10 sites. Subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled preoperatively up to 14 days before surgery with the expectation that they will&#xD;
      require intravenous (IV) access after the surgery for at least 24 hours and postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia with an opiate level medication. After dosing with Oxycodone Oral Solution (0.1&#xD;
      mg/kg for children ages 2 to 6, 0.08 mg/kg for ages 7 to 12, 0.07 mg/kg for ages 13 to 17,&#xD;
      and a dose to be determined based on pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling from the interim analyses&#xD;
      for subjects under age 2), subjects will be carefully monitored for safety. A total of 110&#xD;
      pediatric and adolescent male or female subjects will be enrolled, including a minimum of 20&#xD;
      subjects under age 2 (5 subjects ages 0 to &lt;2 months, 5 subjects ages 2 to &lt;6 months, and 10&#xD;
      subjects ages 6 months to &lt;2 years), 30 ages 2 to 6 years, 30 ages 7 to 12 years and 30 ages&#xD;
      13 to &lt;17 years. Subjects within each age group will be evenly distributed by age and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis will be run after 10 subjects ages 2 to 6 years, 10 ages 7 to 12 years&#xD;
      and 10 ages 13 to &lt;17 years have completed the study. The interim analysis will include PK,&#xD;
      pulse oximetry readings, vital sign measurements, adverse events (AEs) and concomitant&#xD;
      medications. The dose of Oxycodone Oral Solution that the subjects ages 6 months to &lt;2 years&#xD;
      will receive will be based on PK modeling from the interim analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional interim analysis will be run after at least half of the subjects aged 6 months&#xD;
      to &lt;2 years have completed the study. The interim analysis will include PK, pulse oximetry&#xD;
      readings, vital sign measurements, AEs and concomitant medications. The dose of Oxycodone&#xD;
      Oral Solution that the subjects ages 0 to &lt;2 months and 2 months to &lt;6 months will receive&#xD;
      will be based on PK modeling from the interim analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a Screening period within 14 days of surgery; a predose check-in&#xD;
      (Day -1); a treatment period after surgery (Day 1, Time Zero); and an End of Study&#xD;
      assessment. The total duration of the study, excluding Screening, will be approximately 1&#xD;
      full day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects who provide assent (7 to &lt;17 years old) and whose parent(s) or legal&#xD;
      guardian(s) provide consent as required will have study assessments performed at Screening.&#xD;
      Following surgery, subjects will receive standard care, including parenteral analgesia with a&#xD;
      nonoxycodone, nonoxymorphone medication that will not interfere with the measurement or&#xD;
      metabolism of oxycodone. At this time (during Day -1), they will have a predose check-in to&#xD;
      have eligibility confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After subjects ages 2 to &lt;17 have been postoperatively cleared to transition to oral pain&#xD;
      medication, Oxycodone Oral Solution will be administered at Time Zero of Day 1 in place of&#xD;
      the standard analgesic medication. The first 10 subjects in each of the 2 to 6, 7 to 12 and&#xD;
      13 to &lt;17 age groups, who will be included in the first interim analysis, will only receive 1&#xD;
      dose of Oxycodone Oral Solution. Subjects in these age groups enrolled in the study after the&#xD;
      interim analysis is completed may receive additional doses every 4-6 hours as needed. If pain&#xD;
      control is inadequate with Oxycodone Oral Solution, the investigator may administer an IV&#xD;
      dose of ketorolac (0.5 mg/kg) every 6 hours or an IV dose of Morphine Sulfate (0.1 mg/kg)&#xD;
      every 4 hours as rescue medication for breakthrough pain after dosing. Use of other rescue&#xD;
      pain medication is permissible in accordance with hospital pain management guidelines or&#xD;
      facilities standard of care. Any rescue medications used will be provided by the study site&#xD;
      pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After subjects under age 2 have been postoperatively cleared to transition to oral pain&#xD;
      medication, they will receive a single dose of Oxycodone Oral Solution at Time Zero of Day 1&#xD;
      in place of the standard analgesic medication. The dose will be determined based on PK&#xD;
      modeling from the interim analyses. If pain control is inadequate with Oxycodone Oral&#xD;
      Solution, as indicated by a score of moderate to severe (4-10) on the FLACC, the subject will&#xD;
      be given Fentanyl via Nurse-Controlled Analgesia (NCA). The Fentanyl will be provided by the&#xD;
      study site pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo an End-of-Study assessment at least 24 hours after receiving the first&#xD;
      dose of Oxycodone Oral Solution. At that time, if the study staff determines that it is safe&#xD;
      to do so, subjects will be discharged from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by monitoring AEs, clinical laboratory test results, vital sign&#xD;
      measurements, temperature, pulse oximetry, and physical examination findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Faces, Legs, Activity, Crying, Consolability Scale (FLACC) will be used to measure pain&#xD;
      prior to and 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes after the dose of Oxycodone Oral&#xD;
      Solution in subjects under age 2. The FLACC will also be administered prior to the subject&#xD;
      receiving each dose of Fentanyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial blood samples for PK analysis will be collected for the determination of plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of oxycodone and its metabolites (noroxycodone, oxymorphone and&#xD;
      noroxymorphone) prior to the first dose (within 15 minutes of dosing); 5, 15, 30, and 60&#xD;
      minutes after dosing; and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing. For subjects under age&#xD;
      2, serial blood samples for PK analysis will be collected prior to the first dose (within 15&#xD;
      minutes of dosing); 15, 30, and 60 minutes after dosing; and 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after&#xD;
      dosing.&#xD;
