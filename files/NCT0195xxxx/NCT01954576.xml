    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well Novocure's Tumor Treating Electric Fields&#xD;
      (NovoTTF) therapy works in treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. NovoTTF&#xD;
      therapy uses a low intensity electric current to kill tumor cells. NovoTTF therapy may be&#xD;
      effective treatment for brain cancer.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed GBM (WHO grade IV); rare GBM variants (e.g. gliosarcoma,&#xD;
             giant cell GBM, small cell GBM, GBM with oligodendroglioma features, GBM with PNET&#xD;
             features) are allowed. Patients will be eligible if the original histology was&#xD;
             low-grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of GBM is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received radiotherapy of at least 45 Gy and temozolomide chemotherapy as initial&#xD;
             treatment for GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unequivocal evidence of recurrent or progressive GBM before or after bevacizumab&#xD;
             treatment first based on radiographic appearances then confirmed by histologic&#xD;
             confirmation through biopsy or resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with Gliadel wafer is allowed if it has been at least 3 months from&#xD;
             placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There must be an interval of at least 12 weeks from the completion of radiotherapy to&#xD;
             start of device treatment. When the interval is less than 12 weeks from the completion&#xD;
             of radiotherapy, the histological confirmation of progression must be unequivocal per&#xD;
             RANO criteria. The use of PET scan, perfusion imaging, and MRspectroscopy to&#xD;
             differentiate between true early progression and pseudoprogression prior to biopsy or&#xD;
             resection of probable recurrent tumor is per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 22 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status of at least 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned biopsy or resection of recurrent tumor for therapeutic and/or diagnostic&#xD;
             purpose, and with adequate bone marrow, hepatic, cardiac, and renal function to&#xD;
             undergo this planned procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients who have undergone or will undergo stereotactic biopsy of recurrent or&#xD;
             progressive tumor, a post-operative MRI is not required, provided that the pre-biopsy&#xD;
             MRI is within 21 days of registration. If the preoperative scan is more than 21 days&#xD;
             before registration, the scan needs to be repeated. If the steroid dose is increased&#xD;
             more than 50% between the date of biopsy and registration, a new baseline MRI is&#xD;
             required on a stable or decreasing steroid dosage for at least 3 days even if the&#xD;
             previous MRI was within 21 days of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients who have undergone or will undergo open resection of recurrent or&#xD;
             progressive tumor, residual disease following resection is not mandated for&#xD;
             eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual disease&#xD;
             post-resection, a MRI scan should be done no later than 96 hours in the immediate&#xD;
             post-resection period and within 21 days prior to registration. If the 96-hour scan is&#xD;
             more than 21 days before registration, the scan needs to be repeated. If the steroid&#xD;
             dose is increased more than 50% between the date of imaging and registration, a new&#xD;
             baseline MRI is required on a stable or decreasing steroid dosage for at least 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned treatment with NovoTTF Therapy alone per FDA-approved indication. NovoTTF&#xD;
             Therapy must start within 14 days of registration, but not less than 7 days or more&#xD;
             than 21 days from stereotactic biopsy (if applicable) and not less than 21 days or&#xD;
             more than 42 days from open resection (if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of tissue from the initial diagnosis and the recurrent tumor that is&#xD;
             estimated to be of sufficient quality and quantity for both genomic DNA and total RNA&#xD;
             isolation; preferably some of the tissue would be snap frozen for high quality RNA&#xD;
             preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because the genetic analyses described in Section 8.0 will be performed under HRPO#&#xD;
             201111001 (&quot;Analysis of Histological, Genomic, Molecular, and Clinical Factors in CNS&#xD;
             Cancer: the Neuro-Oncology Group&quot;), for patients enrolling in this trial at WUSM, it&#xD;
             is required that WUSM patients must also enroll in HRPO# 201111001. The genetic&#xD;
             analyses for UF patients will take place at WUSM under the auspices of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recovery from the toxic effects of prior therapy to not more than grade 1 or &gt;3 weeks&#xD;
             from prior therapy to registration, whichever is later.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must agree to forgo any other treatments, including but not limited to&#xD;
             cytotoxic or biologic chemotherapies, that are intended to treat the recurrent GBM&#xD;
             while receiving treatment with NovoTTF Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants of childbearing age must use effective contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other malignancy that required active chemotherapy within the previous 12 months&#xD;
             prior to registration and the disease is not currently progressing and/or metastatic.&#xD;
             The exception is basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, which were treated&#xD;
             with local resection only or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to undergo brain MRI due to medical or personal reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bevacizumab-na√Øve patients: These patients may not have more than one prior relapse&#xD;
             not counting the current relapse being treated by this protocol and must have received&#xD;
             at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, which must have included temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bevacizumab-refractory patients: These patients may not have more than 2 prior&#xD;
             relapses not counting the current relapse being treated by this protocol and must have&#xD;
             received multiple chemotherapy regimens, including a temozolomide regimen and a&#xD;
             bevacizumab regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the patient had a surgical resection for relapsed disease and no anti-cancer&#xD;
             therapy was instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the patient undergoes another surgical&#xD;
             resection, this is considered one relapse. For patients who had prior therapy for a&#xD;
             low-grade glioma, the surgical diagnosis of the recurrent tumor as GBM will be&#xD;
             considered the first relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents that are intended as treatments&#xD;
             of recurrent GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, recent heart attack within the previous 12 months or severe heart&#xD;
             problems, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Implanted pacemaker, programmable shunts, defibrillator, deep brain stimulator, vagus&#xD;
             nerve stimulator, and other implanted electronic devices in the brain or the spinal&#xD;
             cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infra-tentorial tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to hydrogel.&#xD;
