      To evaluate the macular, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and choroidal thickness alterations&#xD;
      by using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in polycystic ovary syndrome&#xD;
      (PCOS) and to compare them with healthy reproductive-age women controls.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      PCOS was diagnosed according to Rotterdam criteria that include (i) oligomenorrhea (interval&#xD;
      between periods was ≥35 days) or amenorrhea (absence of vaginal bleeding for 6 months); (ii)&#xD;
      hyperandrogenism; (iii) polycystic ovaries and exclusion of other PCOS-like syndromes, such&#xD;
      as adrenal dysfunction, Cushing's syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia,&#xD;
      androgen-secreting tumors, enzyme deficiency (21-hydroxylase in particular),&#xD;
      hyperprolactinemia, and thyroid dysfunction. Ultrasonographic diagnosis of polycystic ovaries&#xD;
      was based on the presence of multiple cysts (≥12 small follicles in each ovary [2-9 mm in&#xD;
      diameter]) arranged peripherally and scattered throughout the dense core of stroma (the&#xD;
      necklace appearance of follicular cysts), and/or increased ovarian volume &gt;10 ml on pelvic or&#xD;
      vaginal ultrasound examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were allocated in control group had regular menstrual cycle and normal ovarian&#xD;
      morphology detected by ultrasounds. None of the participants in both groups were pregnant.&#xD;
      All patients were evaluated in follicular phase of their menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. Following this detailed&#xD;
      ophthalmologic examination, the third-generation Spectralis OCT device was used for the&#xD;
      assessment. The OCT assessments of involved in the study were performed by the same&#xD;
      experienced technician. The procedure was achieved without pupillary dilatation and under the&#xD;
      same intensity of dim room lighting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macular thickness was determined automatically and was analyzed by OCT software. Fast Macular&#xD;
      Thickness Map option was utilized for the macular measurements. During the assessments,&#xD;
      macular thickness and volume analysis were used. We selected the macular map analysis&#xD;
      protocol on the Spectralis to display numeric averages of the measurements for each of the 9&#xD;
      subfields as defined by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) The&#xD;
      peripapillary RNFL thickness parameters that were automatically calculated by the fast RNFL&#xD;
      mode and divided into regions included temporal quadrant thickness, temporal superior&#xD;
      quadrant thickness, nasal superior quadrant thickness, nasal quadrant thickness, nasal&#xD;
      inferior quadrant thickness, temporal inferior quadrant thickness, and average thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method of obtaining enhanced depth imaging (EDI) OCT images has been reported previously.&#xD;
      The resultant images were viewed and measured with the contained Heidelberg Eye Explorer&#xD;
      software. Choroid imaging was obtained by activating the EDI button. The choroid was manually&#xD;
      measured from the outer border of the hyperreflective line corresponding to the retinal&#xD;
      pigment epithelium to the inner surface of the sclera. The measurements of subfoveal&#xD;
      choroidal thickness were done by one of the authors in a masked fashion without knowledge of&#xD;
      subject information.&#xD;
