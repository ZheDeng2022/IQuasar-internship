  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomised control trial comparing the effects of a pre-operative very low&#xD;
      calorie diet (VLCD) on wound healing in the morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits and disadvantages of a very low calorie pre-operative diet are not clear. Some&#xD;
      centres ask their patients to take a VLCD 2-6 weeks before bariatric surgery with the aim of&#xD;
      shrinking the liver to make surgery easier. Studies have shown that after this diet the liver&#xD;
      does shrink and therefore operating may be easier but this did not necessary translate into&#xD;
      significant lesser operative times. The effects of operating during a catabolic phase have&#xD;
      not been evaluated. Theoretically a low calorie diet before surgery is similar to starving a&#xD;
      patient and can potentially create a state of malnutrition. This is rarely advisable before&#xD;
      surgery and can lead to poor wound healing and poor healing of bowel anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will ascertain if there is any difference in wound healing rates in these morbidly&#xD;
      obese patients (BMI&gt;40kg/m2)undergoing a Laparoscopic Roux en Y gastric by pass in groups who&#xD;
      have taken the preoperative diet compared to those who were not on a special diet. Skin&#xD;
      wounds will be evaluated. This will potentially reflect the general state of healing of the&#xD;
      patient which includes the healing of bowel anastomosis. Surrogate markers will be employed&#xD;
      to evaluate the pre-morbid nutritional state, effectiveness of dieting, subsequent wound&#xD;
      healing (collagen production, markers for the different aspects of wound healing) and impact&#xD;
      on liver cell death .This study will be able to tell us how safe this calorie deficient diet&#xD;
      is in these morbidly obese patients before surgery.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective single blinded randomised controlled study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: There is no difference in wound healing between patients on a very low&#xD;
      calorie diet and those not on a diet prior to a Laparoscopic Roux en Y gastric bypass (LRYGB)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients referred to King's College Hospital for weight loss surgery who are morbidly&#xD;
      obese (BMI&gt;40) who undergo LRYGB will be eligible. All patients undergo an introductory group&#xD;
      education session after which they are counselled one to one where the patient and the&#xD;
      clinician decide on the most appropriate bariatric procedure. Only those who will undergo a&#xD;
      laparoscopic roux en y gastric bypass will be offered the opportunity to participate in the&#xD;
      study by a member of the research team. The study is open to all irrespective of age, sex,&#xD;
      ethnicity and religion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written information will be given in the appropriate language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be placed in 2 broad groups based on whether&#xD;
      they smoke or not. In each group, patients will be randomly chosen in two subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I:taking the pre operative diet Group II:no special diet. A preoperative, low energy&#xD;
      diet will be used for 4 weeks. The diet contains 3 pints of semiskimmed milk. This is&#xD;
      equivalent to 1704 ml and provides a total intake of 800kcal, 82 g carbohydrate, 61 g protein&#xD;
      and 30g fat in a day. Each patient will also take multivitamin and mineral supplementation.&#xD;
      This will further be supplemented with a minimum of 2 litres of energy free liquids (water,&#xD;
      diet fizzy drinks, mineral water, black tea / coffee or squash (no added sugar)) per day. The&#xD;
      longterm safety and success of VLCD has been demonstrated.It does cause shrinkage of the&#xD;
      liver and can decrease the patients weight prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics and medical history will be taken&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre diet, post diet and prior to surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anthropometric measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Height, Weight, BMI, Hip:Waist ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Routine prediet blood tests and for routine preoperative evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This includes full blood count,Lipid profile,Renal profile,Bone profile,Liver Function&#xD;
           Tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Serum CK 18 (M30 and M65) levels before and after the diet, which is a marker of liver&#xD;
           apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Imaging:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan - body composition (prediet,post diet&#xD;
                and at 3 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Ultrasound before and after the diet:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The length and breadth of the liver will be measured, which will allow an estimate of&#xD;
           the cross-section of the liver at a well defined constant point on each patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Two punch biopsies (4mm) from the abdominal wall where the patient is likely to have a&#xD;
           laparoscopic port, before start of the diet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per operatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elliptical excision of skin of the operating ports during the operation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Operative difficulty score assessed by blinded surgeon and independent observer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post operatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be followed at 1 week, 8 weeks, 3 months and then will continue to be followed&#xD;
      according to our usual bariatric protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound Healing Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine all wounds and define presence of wound infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Two 4 mm punch biopsies of one of the healing wounds will be taken under local&#xD;
           anaesthesia, at 7 days and 90 days postoperatively&#xD;
