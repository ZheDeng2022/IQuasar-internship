  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if mapping blood vessel patterns with optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT) will help identify life-threatening choroidal tumors in their early stages&#xD;
      and improve overall patient survival through early detection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uveal melanomas are melanocytic tumors that arise in the pigmented tissues of the eye: the&#xD;
      iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Iris melanomas rarely metastasize (spread to other tissues&#xD;
      or organs). In contrast, uveal melanomas arising in the ciliary body and choroid are highly&#xD;
      malignant (cancerous and invasive to other tissues or organs). Despite having excellent local&#xD;
      tumor control rates, uveal melanoma remains a life-threatening cancer, and even eye-sparing&#xD;
      therapy with radiation treatment often leads to significant loss of vision. Therefore&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with uveal melanoma must cope with not only a life-threatening illness,&#xD;
      but also the frightening prospect of significant vision loss. Choroidal melanomas located in&#xD;
      the posterior pole, an anatomical area of the eye which includes the optic nerve and macula&#xD;
      (central retina), are of particular concern with regards to visual outcome, as radiation&#xD;
      treatment to these areas for even the smallest of tumors is often associated with severe&#xD;
      vision loss. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of small choroidal melanomas is critical to&#xD;
      patient survival. When tumors with metastatic potential are recognized and treated at an&#xD;
      early stage, survival prognosis improves dramatically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to learn if malignant (life-threatening) choroidal tumors versus&#xD;
      benign (non-life-threatening) tumors will show distinct blood vessel patterns using&#xD;
      functional optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography. Angiography is the mapping of&#xD;
      blood vessels. The investigators believe that OCT angiography can provide data which may help&#xD;
      in identifying life-threatening tumors at the earliest stages and improve overall survival&#xD;
      for patients with this type of melanoma.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adults older than age 18 with small (&lt; 3mm) choroidal tumors located within the&#xD;
             posterior pole region which can be imaged using OCT technology. Subjects with&#xD;
             benign-appearing and malignant-appearing lesions meeting these criteria will be&#xD;
             enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to maintain stable fixation for OCT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal failure requiring&#xD;
             dialysis or kidney transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in&#xD;
             the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular&#xD;
             disease, and glycemic control).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 (systolic above 180 OR diastolic above 110). If blood&#xD;
             pressure is brought below 180/110 by anti-hypertensive treatment, subject can become&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating at the time of enrollment due to unknown safety of&#xD;
             fluorescein angiography. Women that become pregnant during the course of the study may&#xD;
             remain enrolled; however, flurorescein and ICG angiography will not be performed until&#xD;
             they are no longer pregnant or nursing an infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving treatment for uveal melanomas will be excluded from the&#xD;
             longitudinal natural history portion of this study, but may enroll for a single study&#xD;
             visit prior to treatment of their melanoma. They will then be eligible to enroll in&#xD;
             IRB 9501, which will follow radiation-treated patients longitudinally.&#xD;
