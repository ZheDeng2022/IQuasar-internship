  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new study have shown that high nighttime blood pressure (BP) and/or non-dipping (lack of&#xD;
      fall in blood pressure during nighttime) is a strong predictor for the risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and mortality in patients with hypertension. Three factors seem to affect the night&#xD;
      time blood pressure: chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or the way&#xD;
      ambulatory blood pressure is monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to analyse the importance of these three factors on nighttime&#xD;
      bloodpressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central 24 hour blood pressure monitoring provides another measure of daily fluctuations in&#xD;
      blood pressure than peripheral 24 hour blood pressure monitoring, because measurement is&#xD;
      painless and does not interfere with activities during the daytime or night-time sleep&#xD;
&#xD;
      In chronic kidney disease and OSA the decrease in nocturnal BP is lower than in healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In chronic kidney disease the decrease in the nocturnal BP is inversely correlated to the&#xD;
      severity of OSA, the severity of kidney disease, and blood pressure during daytime.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      150 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD III-IV) and 75 healthy subject is examined with&#xD;
      both central and peripheral 24 hours blood pressure monitoring, 1 night home polygraphy to&#xD;
      determine whether the subject has obstructive sleep apnea, and if so the degree (AHI), blood-&#xD;
      and urine samples to determine levels of u-AQP2 og u-ENaCɣ, PRC, p-AngII, p-Aldosterone,&#xD;
      p-Avp og p-Endothelin.&#xD;
