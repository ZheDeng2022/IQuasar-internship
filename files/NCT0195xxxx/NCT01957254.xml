  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endotoxin is the major mediator of gram-negative bacteria which cause the systemic&#xD;
      inflammation and result in microcirculatory dysfunction, and it leads to multiple organ&#xD;
      dysfunction and death in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. The goal of this study&#xD;
      is to measure the endotoxin activity of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock at&#xD;
      certain time points, and furthermore, to compare the difference of endotoxin activity among&#xD;
      different pathogens, infection source, and antibiotics. The study will enroll severe sepsis&#xD;
      and septic shock patients. The endotoxin activity will be measured at certain time points&#xD;
      according to the protocol.&#xD;

      Endotoxin is the major mediator of gram-negative bacteria which cause the systemic&#xD;
      inflammation and result in microcirculatory dysfunction, and it leads to multiple organ&#xD;
      dysfunction and death in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to measure the endotoxin activity of patients with severe sepsis&#xD;
      and septic shock at certain time points, and furthermore, to compare the difference of&#xD;
      endotoxin activity among different pathogens, infection source, and antibiotics. The study&#xD;
      will enroll severe sepsis and septic shock patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endotoxin activity will be measured by Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) test. Limulus&#xD;
      Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) test will be used to detect and quantify serum level of endotoxin. The&#xD;
      critical component of the LAL reagents used in endotoxin tests is derived from blood cells&#xD;
      (amebocytes) of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus. It contains the proteins of the blood&#xD;
      clotting mechanism, which is triggered by endotoxins. LAL reagents are primarily used to test&#xD;
      for endotoxins in injectable pharmaceuticals, biological products, and medical devices. They&#xD;
      are also used in renal dialysis centers and a wide range of other applications. LAL tests are&#xD;
      described in the Bacterial Endotoxins Test chapter in the United States Pharmacopeia (Chapter&#xD;
      85) and in the equivalent chapters in the European Pharmacopoeia (Chapter 2.6.14) and the&#xD;
      Japanese Pharmacopoeia (Part I, General Tests, No. 6). We will adopt the chromogenic method&#xD;
      as purchased from the Associates of Cape Cod Inc. (ACC). The LAL reagent is formulated with a&#xD;
      synthetic substrate which gives a yellow color when acted upon by endotoxin activated enzyme.&#xD;
      The test is read at 405 nm, usually in a microplate reader. The severity of multiple organ&#xD;
      dysfunction and 28-day mortality will be followed up.&#xD;
