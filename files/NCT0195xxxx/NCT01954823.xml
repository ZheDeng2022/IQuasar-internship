  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common chronic neurological disease affecting young&#xD;
      adults, with onset usually at the age 20-40. Disease modifying therapies are available to MS,&#xD;
      as well as drugs to improve patients' symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choosing the optimized treatment for each patient is a challenge to neurologists since&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers for therapy are yet to be validated and approved. Current therapy&#xD;
      decisions are based predominantly on clinical evaluation of disability and disease relapses.&#xD;
      Adherence to treatment in MS is sub-optimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past few years a growing involvement of patients in their healthcare is noted,&#xD;
      specially in chronic diseases, and Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) are being incorporated as&#xD;
      part of therapy evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several electronic patients diaries to track adherence to therapy, PRO and drugs side effects&#xD;
      in diseases such as epilepsy are available. A mobile interactive patient diary (e-diary)&#xD;
      tailored for persons with MS was developed. Users can enter data on drugs intake, drugs-side&#xD;
      effects and disease symptoms and receive reminders regarding adherence to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the benefits of the use of an e-diary for MS patients on&#xD;
      healthcare. In order to achieve this goal, 80 MS patients will be randomized into two groups:&#xD;
      a study group with access to the e-diary and a control group. After a period of one year,&#xD;
      satisfaction with the e-diary will be assessed. The effect of the use of the e-diary on&#xD;
      quality of life, on clinical outcomes and on adherence to therapy will be evaluated by&#xD;
      comparing the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will indicate the possible contribution of an e-diary for the evaluation of drugs&#xD;
      safety and efficacy and of patient adherence to therapy, to be applied in clinical trials and&#xD;
      towards improvement of MS patient' care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common chronic neurological disease affecting young&#xD;
      adults, with onset usually at the age 20-40. Women are affected 3-4 times more than men. The&#xD;
      disease is characterized by 2 main phenotypes: relapsing-remitting or progressive course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS is a complex multi-factorial disease, with underlying both genetic and environmental&#xD;
      factors. Different populations have different susceptibility (Compston and Coles 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical disability is due to distraction of the Central Nervous System (CNS) myelin (mainly&#xD;
      oligodendrocytes) due to 3 processes (Franklin 2002; Franklin and Ffrench-Constant 2008;&#xD;
      Frischer, Bramow et al. 2009):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inflammation- immune cells with aberrant activity invade the brain and spinal cord and&#xD;
           cause distraction of CNS myelin (process called demyelination and secondary&#xD;
           neurodegeneration - axonal and neuronal loss)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Primary neurodegeneration (axonal and neuronal loss) - without prominent inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Repair - the inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes are followed by an attempt of&#xD;
           the CNS to repair - however, this partial and incomplete repair is often the basis of&#xD;
           residual deficits and disability (Chandran, Hunt et al. 2008) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      These processes cause damage of the CNS, brain and spinal cord, leading to deficiencies in&#xD;
      several neurologic systems such as motoric, sensory, sphincters, visual and cognitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS is diagnosed by a clinical evaluation of the neurologist in conjunction with the detection&#xD;
      of inflammation in the white matter in the CNS through MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the increased understanding of the disease, in the last 10-15 years there are new&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection immunotherapies available (COPAXON / TEVA; Interferon -beta: Avonex.&#xD;
      Betaferon and Rebif) and Tysabri infusion . These drugs can cause side effects at such an&#xD;
      extent that treatment may have to be discontinued. Recently an oral drug Gilenya was released&#xD;
      to the market, and additional oral drugs such as Laquinimod and BG-12 (Dimethyl Fumarate) are&#xD;
      at different phases of development. However these can attenuate the disease (reduce the&#xD;
      number of relapses per year) but cannot cure it. Also, they are beneficial in only ~40 % of&#xD;
      the Relapsing -Remitting patients. Currently there are no treatments for patients with the&#xD;
      Progressive Disease - who have gradual increased disability (Murray 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous steroids are the short term treatment for acute relapses. In addition to the long&#xD;
      term immunomodulatory drugs, disease modifying drugs (DMD), there are also drugs used to&#xD;
      alleviate some of the MS symptoms, such as Provigil, for fatigue and Fampyra for improvement&#xD;
      of walking disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the growing number of drugs available for the treatment of MS and its symptoms, the&#xD;
      evaluation of treatment success is essential so the best treatment can be fitted to each&#xD;
      individual. Presently, there are no objective tools for assessment of treatment efficiency.&#xD;
      MRI is an expensive procedure that does not add much information beyond the clinical exam.&#xD;
      CSF (cervical spine fluid) is an invasive and painful examination which can help in MS&#xD;
      diagnosis but is not related to disease course. Treatment evaluation is based mainly in two&#xD;
      parameters: disability (measured by EDSS) and annual relapse rate. Both measures have&#xD;
      disadvantages: 1) EDSS indicates mostly motorical disability and does not take into account&#xD;
      other implications of the disease, such as cognitive problems and fatigue, 2) the number of&#xD;
      relapses per year may differ among neurologists, since generally only relapses with&#xD;
      indication to steroids treatment are taken into consideration and steroids indication&#xD;
      variates among neurologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past few years a growing involvement of patients in their healthcare can be noted.&#xD;
      Healthcare organizations recognize the importance of this involvement both because of an&#xD;
      increasing public demand and because patient involvement is being considered positive to the&#xD;
      health system, specially in chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Reported Outcome-PRO can be defined as &quot;evaluation of treatment success based on the&#xD;
      patient point of view&quot;. The patient grades the intensity of symptoms related to the disease&#xD;
      or side effects of the treatment and report his general well being with the help of measures&#xD;
      such as Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). PRO can be an useful measure in treatment&#xD;
      evaluation for some reasons: First, patients today expect to know about drugs side effects&#xD;
      not only from the medical staff point of view but also from the view of other patients taking&#xD;
      the drug (Basch 2010). Secondly, one of the bigger challenges today in the management of MS&#xD;
      is treatment adherence. It has been shown that about 50% of the patients discontinue disease&#xD;
      modifying therapy before completing two years of treatment (Bruce and Lynch 2011). PRO could&#xD;
      contribute to the identification of the reasons for non-adherence allowing interventions for&#xD;
      adherence improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main difficulties for collecting PRO are: 1) the patient capability of relating to the&#xD;
      physician during an encounter all the relevant symptoms he had since the last visit, and 2)&#xD;
      the fact that the patient's report has to be compared to his adherence to therapy. Recently&#xD;
      the FDA, recognizing the importance of the use of PRO, has founded a consortium for&#xD;
      developing and evaluating PRO (Riazi 2006; Goldman 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An electronic diary (e-diary) tailored for persons with MS was developed. The diary is an&#xD;
      Internet application that can be used through the web or iphones. Data on medical history,&#xD;
      drugs intake, drugs side effects and disease symptoms (including intensity) can be entered by&#xD;
      the user. The application can produce graphs based on the data entered and send reminders to&#xD;
      the user's email or cellular phone. It can give the physician a complete insight on patient&#xD;
      adherence and on the outcomes according to the patient's view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A similar diary for persons with epilepsy has been used by thousands of persons in the past&#xD;
      two years (https://my.epilepsy.com/irody/login-page.php) (Fisher 2010; Le 2011). In face of&#xD;
      the importance of patient involvement in medical decisions and since that are not objective&#xD;
      measures of treatment success in Multiple Sclerosis that can be used routinely, an electronic&#xD;
      diary can contribute to the evaluation of therapy, regarding both efficiency and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of this study are to assess the contribution of the use of an e-diary by people&#xD;
      with MS on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adherence to therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quality of life and clinical outcomes; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Collection of data on disease symptoms, treatment side-effects, and PRO and its&#xD;
           relevance for clinical decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second aim of this study is to assess the e-diary usability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis Patient use of an electronic diary will contribute to patient adherence&#xD;
      to treatment and to clinical outcomes and will allow collection of reliable data on symptoms,&#xD;
      side effects and treatment outcome from the patient point of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work plan outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS Patients, visiting the Multiple Sclerosis Center at the Carmel Medical Center and being&#xD;
      treated by DMD or symptomatic drugs for MS will be invited to participate in this study.&#xD;
      After recruitment and signing an informed consent for the study, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized in two groups: the first one, the study group, will have access to a MS patients&#xD;
      e-diary during one year, and in parallel will continue to receive standard medical follow-up.&#xD;
      The second one, the control group, will receive standard medical care only. Participants of&#xD;
      both groups will be asked to fill questionnaires on demographic data, quality of life and&#xD;
      therapy adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The e-diary allows data entry and retrieval through computers or iPhones. Users can enter&#xD;
      data on medications, medical visits, drugs side effects, receive reminders and produce&#xD;
      graphic and textual reports of the data entered. Participants will use the diary for one year&#xD;
      and details of the use will be automatically collected. In the end of this period, clinical&#xD;
      and personal data of each group on baseline and after one year and of the two groups will be&#xD;
      compared. Users' and medical team satisfaction of the e-diary will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants: 100 MS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS patients will be recruited through the MS center clinic at Carmel Medical Center after&#xD;
      receiving an explanation from Prof. Miller, or the attending neurologist authorized by Prof&#xD;
      Miller to do so, on the study aims and protocol, and signing an informed consent, including&#xD;
      the release of Clalit Health Services from any responsibility regarding information security.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized in two groups: the first one, the study group, will have&#xD;
      access to a MS patients e-diary during one year, and in parallel will continue to receive&#xD;
      standard medical follow-up. The second one, the control group, will receive standard medical&#xD;
      care only. Information regarding their personal and family medical history, including data&#xD;
      such as demographic and ethnicity data, data on smoking and dietary habits, vitamins intake,&#xD;
      other diseases, education and occupation will be collected from both groups via the &quot;Personal&#xD;
      information questionnaire&quot;. Participants will also fill the MSTAQ (Multiple Sclerosis&#xD;
      Treatment Adherence Questionnaire) questionnaire on adherence to treatment at baseline, after&#xD;
      6 months and one year, and the MSQoL-54 (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 Instrument)&#xD;
      questionnaire on quality of life at baseline and after one year. Medical staff will fill the&#xD;
      &quot;Clinical questionnaire&quot; detailing patient clinical status prior to the study and the&#xD;
      Clinical Follow-up questionnaire&quot; after 6 months and one year. These questionnaires will be&#xD;
      filled in printed forms during participants visits to the clinic. When necessary, data will&#xD;
      also be collected from medical records. Data collected through participants and physician&#xD;
      filled forms and from medical records will be stored on an Excel or Access data base. In&#xD;
      addition, data regarding the use of the diary will be automatically collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of the electronic diary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study group will receive a code to access the e-diary through a computer&#xD;
      or an iPhone. Participants that don't have an I-phone may be granted one for the study&#xD;
      period. The data entered in the diary will be maintained in a secured Internet server and&#xD;
      will not include any identified data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diary can collect data on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical data: information on diseases, treatments and attending physicians&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diary: daily report of drugs intake, symptoms and their intensity and additional&#xD;
           relevant data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reminders: the application can send reminders on drug intake or medical appointments to&#xD;
           cellular phones or emails&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reports: textual and graphical reports of the data in the diary can be created The&#xD;
           e-diary was developed for patient use and data entered is not automatically accessed by&#xD;
           the medical staff. Patients will be instructed to bring the reports produced by the&#xD;
           diary to their medical appointments. In addition, patients will be instructed to contact&#xD;
           by phone the medical staff at the clinic in case they feel any change and/or&#xD;
           deterioration in their medical condition, as habitual in our clinic.Participants of the&#xD;
           study group will receive instructions on how to use the diary and technical assistance&#xD;
           will be available during the study. Follow-up on diary's use will take 1 year. The&#xD;
           medical follow-up of participants will be as usual in the MS center for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding the use of the diary will be collected directly from the application,&#xD;
      including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of entries&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of entries&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency and pattern of use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pages visited&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time elapsed between a clinical event and report to the clinical staff&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Access by computer or Iphone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adherence to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical related data Participants showing low/no access to the application will be&#xD;
           contacted by the medical team and will be encouraged to use the diary. These contacts&#xD;
           will be taken into consideration during statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the follow-up period participants of the study group and the medical staff will fill&#xD;
      the &quot;Questionnaire for Diary evaluation&quot; regarding satisfaction from the tool. Medical staff&#xD;
      will fill the &quot;Clinical follow-up questionnaire&quot; for the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the end of the follow-up period, data collected directly from the application and data&#xD;
      from the questionnaires will be analyzed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Adherence to treatment: In the study group, adherence to treatment will be assessed by&#xD;
      data registered on the e-diary and by questionnaires applied on baseline, after six months&#xD;
      and one year. In the control group, adherence to treatment will be assessed by questionnaires&#xD;
      only. Questionnaires from the two groups will be compared. In addition, the study group&#xD;
      questionnaire on adherence will be compared to data on adherence registered in the e-diary .&#xD;
      2) Health-related quality of life and clinical outcomes: Clinical data such as EDSS, number&#xD;
      of relapses and hospitalizations will be collected by questionnaires completed by the medical&#xD;
      team. Quality of life will be assessed by questionnaires completed by the two groups on&#xD;
      baseline and after one year and the results will be compared. Since patients can ask to visit&#xD;
      the clinic or to call the medical team beyond regular follow-up if they feel necessary, the&#xD;
      number of these visits and calls in the two groups will be compared. 3) Data captured in the&#xD;
      e-diary: Data entered by the study group in the e-diary will be compared to data entered in&#xD;
      the Electronic Medical Record by the medical team during regular follow-up of the control&#xD;
      group. Data from both groups will be classified according to various parameters such as:&#xD;
      relating to efficacy or safety of therapy, physician response and physical or emotional&#xD;
      symptom. 4) E-diary usability: Adherence to the diary will be assessed from data on the&#xD;
      pattern of use of each participant. Satisfaction will be assessed through questionnaires&#xD;
      applied both to patients and to attending physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical issue:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will not be affected by participation in the study. Data collection and handling&#xD;
      will be coded to assure privacy of participants and will be handled by Prof. Ariel Miller and&#xD;
      his authorized staff. All the keys to the codes will be saved. Participants' regular&#xD;
      follow-up and visits to the clinic will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected through participants and physician filled forms and from medical records will&#xD;
      be stored in an Excel or Access data base. The database is password protected, Prof Ariel&#xD;
      Miller, and his authorized staffs are responsible for its update and data verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continuous variables will be presented by mean, median and standard deviation. The&#xD;
      categorical variables will be presented in percentages. Differences in demographic and&#xD;
      clinical characteristics between the study group and the control group will be assessed using&#xD;
      Chi square test for the categorical variables, Independent t-test or Mann Whitney, as&#xD;
      appropriate, for the continuous variables. Differences in each group separately between&#xD;
      baseline and after 1 year will be assessed using McNemar test for the categorical variables,&#xD;
      paired T-Test or Wilcoxon paired test, as appropriate, for the continuous variables. For more&#xD;
      than two time points, Friedman test will be used. Multivariate logistic regression will be&#xD;
      used to identify which variables are independently associated to an increase in&#xD;
      adherence.Values p&lt;0.05 will be considered to be significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timetable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is scheduled for two years. Follow-up on the use of the electronic diary&#xD;
      will take up to one year and afterwards the data will be analyzed.&#xD;
