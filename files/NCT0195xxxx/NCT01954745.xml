  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a drug called cabozantinib as a possible treatment cancer&#xD;
      of the bile duct. Cabozantinib is a drug that targets specific pathways inside the cells of&#xD;
      the body. By blocking the c-MET and VEGFR2 pathways from sending signals, cabozantinib may&#xD;
      prevent cells from multiplying. This drug has been used in other research studies and&#xD;
      information from those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to stop the&#xD;
      growth of bile duct cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see how well cabozantinib works in&#xD;
      slowing the growth of bile duct cancer. The investigators are also assessing the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of cabozantinib in participants with this type of cancer.&#xD;

      After the screening procedures confirm that the participants are eligible to participate in&#xD;
      the research study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-stage design will be employed in this study where at least 9 of the 20 patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the first stage need to be progression-free at 16 weeks before the second stage&#xD;
      can proceed. If this criterion is met, an additional 24 patients will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      second stage for a total of 44 patients in the study. Patients will be treated with&#xD;
      cabozantinib 60 mg daily administered orally continuously for 28-day cycles. Tumor&#xD;
      assessments will be performed every 8 weeks until documented disease progression by RECIST&#xD;
      criteria or drug intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary for each&#xD;
      treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days (4 weeks), during which time the&#xD;
      participant will be taking the study drug, cabozantinib daily. The diary will also include&#xD;
      special instructions for taking the study drug(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will continue to take cabozantinib for as long as it is tolerated without any&#xD;
      unacceptable side effects and the cancer does not get worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests and procedures will be done during the research study:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The subject has received prior treatment with a small molecule kinase inhibitor or a&#xD;
             hormonal therapy (including investigational kinase inhibitors or hormones) within 14&#xD;
             days or five half-lives of the compound or active metabolites, whichever is longer,&#xD;
             before the first dose of study treatment. Note: Subjects with prostate cancer&#xD;
             currently receiving LHRH or GnRH agonists may be maintained on these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is unable to swallow tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are known to be HIV-positive are excluded from this study. HIV&#xD;
             positive individuals are at increased risk of lethal infection when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive agents, and cabozantinib has not adequately been tested in this&#xD;
             population. Also, antiretroviral therapy may have pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             cabozantinib that have not been fully characterized yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cabozatinib,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with cabozantnib. These&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may not be receiving any other study agents concurrently while on this study&#xD;

Cabozantinib: Cabozantinib 60 mg (free base weight) per day will be administered daily and continuously for a cycle length of 28 days. Subjects will be provided with a sufficient supply of study treatment and instructions for taking the study treatment on days without scheduled clinic visits. After fasting (with exception of water) for 2 hours, subjects will take study treatment daily with a full glass of water (minimum of 8 oz/ 240 mL) and continue to fast for 1 hour after each dose of study treatment.</description>
