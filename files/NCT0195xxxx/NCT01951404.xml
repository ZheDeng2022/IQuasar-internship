      Kidney patients on dialysis commonly die because of heart disease. One of the biggest&#xD;
      problems in their hearts is that the muscle wall of the heart thickens. This makes it less&#xD;
      efficient. We found in patients with mild kidney disease that a drug normally used to treat&#xD;
      gout (allopurinol) had the remarkable side effect of being able to reduce this thickening of&#xD;
      their heart wall. In this new study we aim to find out if this benefit of allopurinol also&#xD;
      occurs in severe kidney patients i.e. those on regular dialysis. We also are trying to figure&#xD;
      out the best dose of allopurinol to use. To do this we are planning a study where we will&#xD;
      recruit patients with kidney disease who are on dialysis. The 1st phase of the trial will be&#xD;
      to determine the best dose of allopurinol to use and the second phase will be to do a&#xD;
      clinical trial where patients will be randomly allocated to either this optimum dose of&#xD;
      allopurinol or a dummy medication (placebo) and will receive one year of treatment. They will&#xD;
      have a special scan of the heart using an MRI machine to measure the extent of thickening of&#xD;
      their heart muscle before they start on treatment and will have a further MRI scan when their&#xD;
      one year treatment finishes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1- the dose finding study, will involve 10 patients who will have between 3 and 7&#xD;
      visits to the hospital scheduled around 4 to 17 dialysis sessions. The later study will&#xD;
      involve up to 76 patients who will be asked to attend the hospital up to 8 times over a 13&#xD;
      month period.&#xD;

      The ALTERED trial is a randomised, double blinded, placebo controlled multi-centre study&#xD;
      conducted in NHS Tayside, NHS Ayrshire &amp; Arran &amp; NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde to compare&#xD;
      allopurinol (dose to be confirmed from dose escalation study noted above) at either, 100mg,&#xD;
      200mg, 250mg, 300mg or 350mg to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled in this trial for a period of between 12 to 13 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening visit an initial history and clinical examination will be performed.&#xD;
      Participants will then undergo an echocardiogram to ensure no significant heart failure&#xD;
      unless they have had an ECHO in the previous 4 years..Should the participant be eligible for&#xD;
      the study they will have a Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan prior to their&#xD;
      baseline (Randomisation) visit. They will also have bloods taken for safety analysis, have a&#xD;
      12 lead ECG done, vital signs recorded and if they agree have 24 hour BP monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient is known to be eligible they will return - for the first randomisation,&#xD;
      dosing visit at any time up to four weeks after screening. At this randomisation visit post&#xD;
      dialysis session, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either placebo or&#xD;
      allopurinol 100mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will continue on allopurinol/placebo 100mg for 2 weeks, with dosing after each dialysis&#xD;
      session only. They can have FMD, PWV and PWA measurements taken. All participants will be&#xD;
      offered the opportunity to opt in or out of the FMD, PWV and PWA measurements, which are&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If study drugs are tolerated, the dose would be increased at weekly intervals after the 200mg&#xD;
      dose to the allopurinol dose chosen by the dose escalation study, if greater than 200mg.&#xD;
      Baseline blood samples will be taken for routine bloods including full blood count, renal&#xD;
      function, liver function, random blood glucose, haemoglobin A1C, lipids, calcium and&#xD;
      phosphate. These blood tests will be repeated at 6, 9 and 12 months. Routine safety bloods&#xD;
      (including U+Es and LFTs) will be taken pre-dialysis at visits throughout the study. Subjects&#xD;
      will be followed at baseline, week 2, week 6, month 6, month 9 and month 12. Research bloods&#xD;
      and urate levels will be taken at baseline, week 6, months 6, 9 and 12. However, to ensure&#xD;
      blinding throughout urate results will not be made available to the investigators until the&#xD;
      end of the trial. BP is recorded as part of standard care and will be available for analysis.&#xD;
      Pre and post-dialysis readings will be recorded. Other variables such as weight and fluid&#xD;
      removed during dialysis are also noted as part of routine care and will be available for&#xD;
      analysis. 24-hour BP will be performed at the start and end of the study if participants&#xD;
      agree. Cardiac MRI scans will be performed at the start and at the end of the 12 month study&#xD;
      period. Patients will continue with all their usual medication, which will remain unchanged&#xD;
      throughout unless clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMRI Methods The MRIs will normally be done on a non dialysis day. If this is not possible&#xD;
      then we will rarely perform an MRI on a dialysis day. Baseline and repeat CMR examinations in&#xD;
      screening (between 0-6 weeks before randomisation) and after the final 12 month (+/- 6 weeks)&#xD;
      visit will be performed on similar 3T Magnetom scanners (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using&#xD;
      dedicated phase array cardiac and phosphorous spectroscopy coils. Serial contiguous&#xD;
      short-axis cines will be acquired from the vertical long axis and horizontal long axis of the&#xD;
      left ventricle (electrocardiogram gated, steady-state free precession imaging [true fast&#xD;
      imaging with steady-state precession], with the short axis imaging parameters being a&#xD;
      repetition time of 2.5ms, echo time of 1.1ms, flip angle of 60Â°, and slice thickness 6mm).&#xD;
      Analysis will be performed offline (Argus Software, Siemens) by a single blinded observer for&#xD;
      the assessment of ventricular volumes (EDV, ESV, stroke volume), EF, and left ventricular&#xD;
      mass. This single observer will analyse scans from both sites. The reproducibility of the&#xD;
      left ventricular mass assessment using MRI will be derived for this observer. A test-retest&#xD;
      intraobserver coefficient of variation of 2.0% is usual in our past MRI studies. We will also&#xD;
      assess reproducibility between each site, although the same observer will assess all scans at&#xD;
      both sites. We will take the opportunity to measure other MRI parameters of interest which&#xD;
      are easily obtained with little extra scan time: Phosphorous -31 MR spectroscopy, T1 mapping&#xD;
      and aortic compliance by methods already published by us.[29, 30] Both will give significant&#xD;
      added value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR spectroscopy will see whether allopurinol increases high energy phosphates in ESRD&#xD;
      (measured by PCr:ATP) which it is likely to do since it is known to increase ATP levels in&#xD;
      vitro and it is now known to improve cardiac energetics (MRI measured) in human heart&#xD;
      failure.[31, 32] We will measure high energy phosphates (HEP), comparing Phosphocreatine :&#xD;
      Beta adenosine triphosphate (PCr:ATP) ratio from the long axis views of the left&#xD;
      ventricle.[29] In addition we will use MRI to assess aortic vascular compliance and pulse&#xD;
      wave velocity [30] using cine transverse thoracic aortic gated steady state free precession&#xD;
      acquisitions which will complement well the other peripheral vascular measures of&#xD;
      endothelial/vascular function being assessed (see below). Should a scanner at any site become&#xD;
      unavailable for a prolonged period of time during the study an alternative scanner will be&#xD;
      used. Throughout the study MRI methods will be adapted as appropriate to ensure optimal study&#xD;
      results can be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FMD FMD will be offered to all participants in the main trial, but may be declined without&#xD;
      affecting their participation in the main trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FMD on the brachial artery will be performed in the non-fistula arm on three visits&#xD;
      (baseline, month 9 and month 12) using a Philips iE33 ultrasound machine (Phillips Medical&#xD;
      Systems, United Kingdom) according to the guide-lines set by the International Brachial&#xD;
      Artery Reactivity Task Force.[33] The brachial artery will be longitudinally imaged above the&#xD;
      elbow using an 11.3-MHz probe. The image will be recorded for 2 minutes, followed by&#xD;
      induction of forearm ischaemia by inflating a cuff below the elbow to 200 mmHg (or 50 mmHg&#xD;
      above SBP, whichever is higher) for 5 minutes and deflating rapidly. The resulting reactive&#xD;
      hyperaemia will be recorded for a further 2 minutes. After a rest period, the procedure will&#xD;
      be repeated, with 0.4mg of glyceryl trinitrate being administered sublingually to determine&#xD;
      endothelium-independent dilation. FMD will be expressed as per cent change in diameter&#xD;
      relative to the baseline diameter at rest. Analysis of all FMDs will be performed on Brachial&#xD;
      Analyser software (Medical Imaging Applications, LLC) by a single trained investigator (the&#xD;
      clinical research fellow) to avoid inter-observer variability. This investigator will be&#xD;
      blind to allocated treatments. Our intra-observer coefficient of variation for FMD is usually&#xD;
      5.2%. Two factors should ensure reliable results despite there being two sites : each patient&#xD;
      will always be studied on the same equipment and wherever possible the same individual (the&#xD;
      research fellow) will do all the tests and interpret them (blindly) at both sites. For&#xD;
      further reassurance, a selection of blinded ultrasound scans will be re-analysed to ensure&#xD;
      good reproducibility at each site and between sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applanation Tonometry PWA will be offered to all participants in the main trial, but may be&#xD;
      declined without affecting their participation in the main trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulse wave analysis (PWA) and PWV will be determined in the non-fistula arm by recording the&#xD;
      radial waveforms and radial-carotid waveforms, respectively, at three visits (baseline, month&#xD;
      9 and month 12) using the Sphygmocor system. The central AIx will be corrected to a heart&#xD;
      rate of 75 beats/min. Wherever possible, a single trained investigator (the clinical research&#xD;
      fellow) who is blind to the allocated treatment will perform the PWA and PWV at both sites.&#xD;
      We will also use bio-impedance at the same time to measure total body water in MRIs done at&#xD;
      Glasgow sites.[21] . This will complement the end diastolic volume data from the MRI at both&#xD;
      sites. In our index study, EDV fell but we did not know if this was due to afterload&#xD;
      reduction or to a global fall in body water.[21] Bio-impedance will help determine this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Blood tests Research bloods will be taken at baseline, week 6 and months 6, 9 and&#xD;
      12. Research bloods will include BNP, inflammatory markers and other markers of interest.&#xD;
      Additional markers may be tested on the samples at a later date. The total amount of research&#xD;
      blood taken at each visit will be no more than 30ml. We shall also seek consent for future&#xD;
      ethically approved genetic testing which can be declined without affecting participation in&#xD;
      the study. If agreement is given for this, 10mls of blood will be taken at the end of the&#xD;
      study and anonymously stored - any subsequent analysis of these samples will be subject to&#xD;
      approval of a Research Ethics Committee prior to analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events Adverse events will be sought by symptom enquiry at each visit and by&#xD;
      monitoring of routine blood samples.&#xD;
