    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial in which the effect is investigated of a radiation boost in&#xD;
      addition to standard chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer on&#xD;
      complete response rate defined as pathological complete response, in those who undergo&#xD;
      surgery, or 2-years local recurrence-free survival (2y-LRFS), in those who opted for a wait&#xD;
      and see approach. Secondary objectives are adverse events due to chemoradiation (acute,&#xD;
      perioperative and late toxicity), tumor response assessed with MRI, the impact of the boost&#xD;
      on local and distant recurrence and survival as well as patient-reported quality of life and&#xD;
      workability. The need for this comprehensive study is emphasized by the sub-optimal&#xD;
      (radiation-) methods, heterogeneity between and poor reporting in the few previous trials in&#xD;
      this field.&#xD;

      Rationale: The current treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer consists of pre-operative&#xD;
      chemoradiation treatment (CRT) (50 Gray (Gy) in 25 fractions) followed by surgical resection,&#xD;
      according to T-/N-stage, circumferential resection margin (CRM) and tumor localization (see&#xD;
      table 1). After this neo-adjuvant treatment approximately 15% of patients show pathological&#xD;
      complete response (pCR), i.e.no residual tumor in the resected specimen on pathologic&#xD;
      examination. Patients with pCR have a lower risk of local and distant recurrences and&#xD;
      significantly longer disease-free and overall survival. Furthermore, in these patients&#xD;
      surgery could possibly have been omitted. Selected patients with a clinical complete response&#xD;
      (cCR), defined prior to surgery by rectoscopy, rectal examination and magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI), may opt for an organ-preserving therapy, a so called wait and see approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response to chemoradiation occurs in a dose dependent fashion. Therefore, recent trials aimed&#xD;
      to improve prognosis by radiation dose-escalation that resulted in improved pCR rates.&#xD;
      Toxicity rates associated with radiation doses above 60 Gy are manageable and differ between&#xD;
      studies; from increased to comparable or even lower toxicity. Moreover, dose escalation may&#xD;
      increase the proportion of patients eligible for organ-preserving therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: We study whether addition of a radiation boost to standard chemoradiation in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced rectal cancer increases the complete response rate defined as&#xD;
      pathological complete response, in those who undergo surgery, or 2-years local&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival (2y-LRFS), in those who opted for a wait and see approach. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are adverse events due to chemoradiation (acute, perioperative and late toxicity),&#xD;
      tumor response assessed with MRI, the impact of the boost on local and distant recurrence and&#xD;
      survival as well as patient-reported quality of life and workability. The need for this&#xD;
      comprehensive study is emphasized by the sub-optimal (radiation-) methods, heterogeneity&#xD;
      between and poor reporting in the few previous trials in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Multicentre Randomized Controlled Trial, nested within a prospective cohort&#xD;
      according to the 'cohort multiple randomized controlled trial' (cmRCT) design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Rectal cancer patients participating in a prospective cohort (the PLCRC&#xD;
      project) and diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the rectum whom will undergo chemoradiation&#xD;
      based on clinical criteria (see table 1 section 1.2.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: An irradiation boost of 15 Gy delivered to the gross tumor volume (GTV) in 5&#xD;
      fractions in addition to the standard chemoradiation treatment of 50 Gy. Thereby increasing&#xD;
      the total GTV dose to 65 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is complete response either defined as&#xD;
      pathological complete response (pCR) in patients who undergo surgery, assessed by&#xD;
      standardized pathologic examination of the surgical specimen, or 2-years local&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival (LRFS) after chemoradiation in patients who opted for a wait and see&#xD;
      approach. Secondary outcomes are treatment acute, perioperative and late toxicity, tumor&#xD;
      response assessed with MRI, patient-reported quality of life and workability, local&#xD;
      recurrence and (disease-specific) survival.&#xD;
