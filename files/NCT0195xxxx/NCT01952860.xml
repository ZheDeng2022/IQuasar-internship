  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn the opinion of patients and their caregiving&#xD;
      about a couple-based Hatha Yoga program during treatment for cancer. Researchers also want to&#xD;
      learn the effect of this program on lung function, distress, and quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      If participant agrees to take part, participant's medical history and demographic information&#xD;
      (such as age, sex, and race) will be recorded. By signing this consent, participant also&#xD;
      agrees that participant's caregiving partner will be approached to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will complete about 10 questionnaires before participant's first radiation&#xD;
      treatment and again after participant completes participant's treatment schedule (usually 6&#xD;
      weeks later). The questionnaires ask about participant's health, any symptoms participant may&#xD;
      be having, participant's mood, participant's level of fatigue, participant's sleeping habits,&#xD;
      participant's relationship, and participant's quality of life. It should take about 45&#xD;
      minutes to complete these questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will complete about 5 questionnaires again halfway through participant's&#xD;
      radiation treatment schedule. These questionnaires ask about participant's quality of life.&#xD;
      These should take about 20 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each week of radiation therapy, participant will also complete a questionnaire asking&#xD;
      participant's feelings about the Hatha Yoga sessions. Participant will be asked to list what&#xD;
      participant liked or disliked, what participant found most and least useful, and how&#xD;
      participant would rate the instructor. Participant will also be asked about how often&#xD;
      participant practices outside of class and if participant thinks they are benefitting from&#xD;
      the Hatha Yoga program. It should take about 5 minutes to answer this questionnaire.&#xD;
      Participant's answers to the questions will not be shared with participant's caregiving&#xD;
      partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hatha Yoga Sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will take part in up to 18 sessions of Hatha yoga over the course of radiation&#xD;
      therapy. Each 45- to 60-minute session will be guided by an instructor. Participant should&#xD;
      attend each session together as a couple.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the yoga sessions, participant will be asked to do deep-breathing exercises and&#xD;
      perform different stretching and movement exercises. The movements are designed not to be&#xD;
      difficult, and participant will sit on the floor or in a chair while participant does them.&#xD;
      Participant can move through the exercises at participant's own pace. The instructor will be&#xD;
      available to answer any questions participant may have about the practice of Hatha yoga. Most&#xD;
      of the yoga sessions may be videotaped. This is so the researchers can keep track of the&#xD;
      quality of the sessions. Only the study staff will be able to view this videotape. The video&#xD;
      files are digital and will be deleted after all the data are studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At participant's first session, participant will be given a CD and instructions for&#xD;
      practicing Hatha yoga at home. While participant is receiving radiation therapy, participant&#xD;
      will be asked to practice at home 1 time a day either with participant's caregiving partner&#xD;
      or alone on the days participant does not have a session at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation on this study will be over when participant has completed the questionnaires&#xD;
      during participant's last week of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 15 patients and their caregiving partners, for a total of 30 participants, will take&#xD;
      part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
