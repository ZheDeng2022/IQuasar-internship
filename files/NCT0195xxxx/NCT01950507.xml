  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is commonly affected by acute graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
      (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) in patients who have undergone blood or marrow stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (BMT). Initially, patients are treated with systemic corticosteroids, which&#xD;
      produce complete response rates in 35 percent. Although short courses of steroids are&#xD;
      preferred to minimize adverse effects, many patients require systemic treatment chronically&#xD;
      since GI GVHD can negatively impact quality of life and nutrition status. One option to&#xD;
      minimize systemic steroid exposure is by nonabsorbable corticosteroids that act locally on&#xD;
      the GI tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Budesonide (Entocort EC, AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE) is an FDA-approved oral topical&#xD;
      corticosteroid for the treatment of mild to moderate active Crohn s disease involving the&#xD;
      ileum and/or the ascending colon, and for maintenance of clinical remission of mild to&#xD;
      moderate Crohn s disease involving the ileum and/or the ascending colon for up to 3 months.&#xD;
      It has a high ratio of topical-to-systemic activity with minimally active metabolites, and&#xD;
      undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Since both intestinal GVHD and Crohn s disease&#xD;
      seem to share a similar pathogenic background, budesonide has been used in the BMT setting&#xD;
      for GI GVHD, usually in combination with systemic corticosteroids (e.g. methylprednisolone)&#xD;
      to improve clinical response and allow for more rapid tapering of systemic corticosteroid&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First-pass metabolism is mediated mostly by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system. The&#xD;
      liver is the major site of CYP450-mediated metabolism but the enterocytes of the intestinal&#xD;
      epithelium are also an important site for drug metabolism. Budesonide undergoes significant&#xD;
      metabolism by CYP enzymes with substantial first-pass metabolism. The potential for greater&#xD;
      systemic availability of orally administered budesonide exists when it is given concurrently&#xD;
      with triazole antifungals, which are commonly prescribed for prophylaxis or treatment of&#xD;
      fungal infections after transplantation. Fluconazole and voriconazole are moderate and strong&#xD;
      inhibitors of CYP3A4, respectively, and budesonide is a CYP3A4 substrate. Inhibition of&#xD;
      CYP3A4 may impair the metabolism of budesonide, resulting in systemic concentrations of&#xD;
      budesonide and subsequently, adverse effects such as hyperglycemia. If the presence of&#xD;
      fluconazole or voriconazole does impair budesonide s metabolism, then dose adjustments to&#xD;
      budesonide may be warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no prospective studies evaluating the effects of fluconazole or voriconazole on&#xD;
      budesonide s pharmacokinetics in patients who have undergone BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the proposed study is to determine the effects of fluconazole and&#xD;
      voriconazole on the trough (Cmin) and peak (Cmax) of budesonide in patients who have&#xD;
      undergone BMT and who have GI GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints are the Cmin and Cmax of budesonide. Secondary endpoints include the&#xD;
      Cmin of voriconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study seeks to determine the effects of fluconazole and voriconazole on the&#xD;
      Cminand Cmax of budesonide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult and pediatric subjects (greater than or equal to 13 years of age and greater than or&#xD;
      equal to 49 kg) who are registered to an NCI or NHLBI protocol who have undergone a bone&#xD;
      marrow, cord, haplo-cord or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation who have GI GVHD as&#xD;
      determined by the medical team and who require treatment with budesonide and are candidates&#xD;
      for antifungal therapy are eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will serve as his or her own control to minimize the variation in absorption,&#xD;
      distribution, metabolism and elimination of oral budesonide that can occur from subject to&#xD;
      subject, due to genetic, anatomic or other unidentified differences. For example, genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms of CYP2C19, which is significantly involved in voriconazole s metabolism, could&#xD;
      otherwise affect the results of the study (i.e. CYP2C19 poor metabolizers may experience&#xD;
      higher voriconazole serum concentrations, which could results in greater CYP3A4 inhibition&#xD;
      and higher budesonide exposure). In addition, the longitudinal cohort design of this study&#xD;
      will be able to answer the research questions posed with fewer research subjects. Research&#xD;
      subjects will be accrued into one of three cohorts depending on the antifungal prophylaxis&#xD;
      (or lack thereof) the subject is receiving at study entry and the preference of the medical&#xD;
      team for continued antifungal coverage after the initiation of budesonide and systemic&#xD;
      corticosteroids. Subjects who are not currently receiving antifungal prophylaxis or who are&#xD;
      on fluconazole at baseline are eligible for enrollment in Cohort 1. Subjects in Cohorts 2 and&#xD;
      3 are receiving voriconazole and fluconazole at study entry, respectively. In Cohort 1, if&#xD;
      applicable, subjects will stop fluconazole on day -1...&#xD;

      3 are receiving voriconazole and fluconazole at study entry, respectively. In Cohort 1, if&#xD;
      applicable, subjects will stop fluconazole on day -1, and may start micafungin on day 0,&#xD;
      which will continue through the period off azole prophylaxis if the subject is on systemic&#xD;
      corticosteroids (and antifungal prophylaxis is deemed necessary). Voriconazole will be&#xD;
      initiated in the evening on day 7. In Cohorts 2 and 3, fluconazole and voriconazole will be&#xD;
      discontinued on day 7, and micafungin will be added during the period off azole prophylaxis&#xD;
      if the subject is on systemic corticosteroids (and antifungal prophylaxis is deemed&#xD;
      necessary). In all three cohorts, a budesonide Cmin and Cmax will be measured both in the&#xD;
      presence and absence of concurrent fluconazole or voriconazole therapy. At least a seven day&#xD;
      interval will be used between interventions to allow for steady state to occur prior to&#xD;
      measurement of budesonide serum concentrations. There is no literature on the interaction&#xD;
      between oral budesonide and micafungin, but pharmacokinetic data suggest that micafungin has&#xD;
      a low potential to cause drug-drug interactions through inhibition of CYP3A4, and thus it is&#xD;
      assumed that micafungin will not significantly affect the Cmin or Cmax of budesonide in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
