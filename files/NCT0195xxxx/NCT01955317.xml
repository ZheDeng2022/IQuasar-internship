      Background (brief):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Burden:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Neonatal death still unacceptably high in low income countries. The common causes of&#xD;
           neonatal death are pneumonia, sepsis and omphalitis. Many neonatal infections occur&#xD;
           because the mother's hands or the hands of the person who attended the birth are&#xD;
           unclean. Our previous study found that there was substantial concern about excessive&#xD;
           exposure of the mother or the neonate to water during handwashing because of the&#xD;
           perception that frequent contact with water could lead to respiratory illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Knowledge gap:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Chlorhexidine has been evaluated for use in hand hygiene applications in high-income&#xD;
           countries, particularly in healthcare, but it has not been evaluated or promoted for&#xD;
           hand cleansing at the household level in low- and middle-income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A waterless hand cleanser employing chlorhexidine would overcome important barriers to&#xD;
      handwashing with soap, perceptions of cold resulting from exposure to water, and the time&#xD;
      limitations perceived by mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Mothers who are exposed to a chlorhexidine-based hand cleansing intervention will&#xD;
      clean their hands (with chlorhexidine or soap and water) more frequently than mothers who are&#xD;
      not exposed to the chlorhexidine-based hand cleansing program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To demonstrate the behavioural impact of chlorhexidine-based hand hygiene intervention&#xD;
           on hand cleansing of mothers during the neonatal period The secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To demonstrate the impact of chlorhexidine-based hand hygiene intervention on hand&#xD;
           cleansing of other family members, visitors to the neonate, and birth attendants during&#xD;
           the neonatal period&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the acceptability of chlorhexidine for hand cleansing in the neonatal period&#xD;
           among mothers, other family members, and birth attendants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a randomized controlled trial in a rural area of Bangladesh, with an active&#xD;
      control. Randomization will be at the level of the participating pregnant woman. Each arm&#xD;
      will include 150 participants. All intervention visits will follow baseline data collection.&#xD;
      A trained health and hygiene promoter will carry out two visits in the antenatal period and&#xD;
      one postnatal visit to deliver intervention messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Observed hand cleansing behavior of mother with chlorhexidine or soap and water at&#xD;
           critical times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Observed hand cleansing behavior of other household members and visitors to home with&#xD;
           chlorhexidine or soap and water at critical times.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neonates (babies &lt; 28 days old) die at unacceptably high rates (26deaths per 1000 live&#xD;
      births) in many resource-limited countries, accounting for about 40% of deaths among all&#xD;
      children under 5 years old. Infections such as pneumonia, sepsis, and omphalitis are common&#xD;
      causes of neonatal death. Many neonatal infections occur because the mother's hands or the&#xD;
      hands of the person who attended the birth are unclean. In Nepal, newborns who survived were&#xD;
      significantly more likely than newborns who died to have mothers reporting handwashing, and&#xD;
      birth attendants who were reported to wash hands before the delivery. But, mothers and birth&#xD;
      attendants often do not wash their hands, despite the vulnerability of the neonatal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional approach to improving handwashing among caregivers of young children is to&#xD;
      teach about critical times to wash hands and how to wash hands. This narrow, prescriptive&#xD;
      approach ignores the barriers to hand hygiene unique to the Perinatal and neonatal periods.&#xD;
      Moreover, our qualitative findings suggest that frequent handwashing with water may not be&#xD;
      acceptable. That is, both mothers and birth attendants reported that, when mothers come into&#xD;
      contact with water frequently (e.g. by washing hands often), the newborn child is at risk of&#xD;
      developing upper and lower respiratory infection. A novel technological solution - one that&#xD;
      provides efficiency and portability and obviates the need for washing with water - may&#xD;
      overcome important obstacles to improving hand cleansing behavior in the neonatal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the discrete time frame of the neonatal period, chlorhexidine for hand cleansing&#xD;
      represents a focused intervention with substantial potential for scalability. The shelf-life&#xD;
      of chlorhexidine is long (2-3 years), facilitating its scaling up and efficient distribution,&#xD;
      for example, in clean delivery kits that are provided to low-income mothers throughout&#xD;
      resource-limited countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the potential for this low-technology solution to break through critical barriers to&#xD;
      handwashing with water and soap, and markedly reduce neonatal mortality, we propose to&#xD;
      conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a chlorhexidine-based hand&#xD;
      cleansing intervention on maternal, familial, and birth attendant hand cleansing behavior in&#xD;
      the peripartum and neonatal periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a randomized controlled trial in a rural area of Bangladesh, with an active&#xD;
      control. The two treatment arms are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active control arm Maternal and neonatal health counseling (described in &quot;Intervention&quot;&#xD;
           section)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention arm&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Maternal and neonatal health counseling&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hand hygiene promotion (described in &quot;Intervention&quot; section) Randomization will be&#xD;
                at the level of the participating pregnant woman (i.e. individual-level&#xD;
                randomization). We will use a block randomization strategy to randomize&#xD;
                participants to either the intervention or active control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All intervention visits will follow baseline data collection. A trained health and hygiene&#xD;
      promoter will carry out two visits in the antenatal period (at 34-35 weeks and at 36-38&#xD;
      weeks) and one postnatal visit (1-3 days after delivery) to deliver intervention messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal and neonatal health counseling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants in both intervention and control arms will receive maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      health counseling. The objectives of the maternal and neonatal health counseling are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Highlight the vulnerability of the neonatal period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inform participant and her family of the schedule recommended by the Government of&#xD;
           Bangladesh for prenatal care and strongly encourage participants to seek appropriate&#xD;
           prenatal care, including Tetanus Toxoid vaccination. Tetanus toxoid is provided free of&#xD;
           cost as part of antenatal care at all Government of Bangladesh health facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discuss birth plans and encourage participants to develop a birth plan, including&#xD;
           location of the birth, materials, persons needed and an emergency plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Introduce and discuss the use of a clean delivery kit for hygienic delivery to reduce&#xD;
           infections. This will include instructions on cutting the umbilical cord. Provide a&#xD;
           clean delivery kit to the participant, which will include a clean blade, clean string&#xD;
           for tying the cord, clean mat for the mother to lie on, among other items.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Encourage close family members to motivate or demand hand washing with soap by birth&#xD;
           attendants before and during labor and delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discuss maternal danger signs with participant and her family and encourage care seeking&#xD;
           when recognized&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discuss neonatal danger signs with participant and her family and encourage care seeking&#xD;
           when recognized&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discuss neonatal hypothermia prevention with participant and her family and work with&#xD;
           the family to build acceptance of the message&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discuss the benefit of immediate and exclusive breastfeeding with participant and her&#xD;
           family and work with the family to build acceptance of the message&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide chlorhexidine and gauze, and explain chlorhexidine cord care to the participant&#xD;
           and work with her and her family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials: Each participant will be given a clean delivery kit and a culturally appropriate&#xD;
      pictorial card depicting each of the danger signs for the mother pre-, during, and&#xD;
      post-labor, and for the neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of behavioral communication approach: Interactions with the health and hygiene&#xD;
      promoter will be in the form of a discussion where the health/hygiene promoter will&#xD;
      facilitate discussions and provide explanation and guidance as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand hygiene counseling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of hand hygiene counseling:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Present hand cleansing as an opportunity for the mother to protect the health of her&#xD;
           child, and to improve perception of herself as a good mother&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remind of the vulnerability of the newborn period, and suggest that the use of&#xD;
           chlorhexidine for hand cleansing makes loving hands to be protective hands&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Encourage maternal self-efficacy for protecting the health of the baby&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify motivators and barriers to hand cleansing among mothers and other people that&#xD;
           care for the baby&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify critical times for hand cleansing with chlorhexidine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase individual and social (family/compound) expectations for hand cleansing among&#xD;
           mothers and other caregivers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Guide family to create solution for barriers to hand cleansing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Introduce chlorhexidine as a product to help protect the baby's health, demonstrate use&#xD;
           and discuss who, when and how to use it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discuss demanding or motivating use of chlorhexidine by other family members, visitors&#xD;
           and the birth attendant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Set up a visual cue card, and a calendar with visual reminders in the home as references&#xD;
           and cues for hand cleansing at specific critical times&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discuss creating a habit of hand cleansing, what that concretely means and how to do so&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critical times for hand cleansing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For mothers and secondary caregivers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before umbilical cord care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After contact with respiratory secretions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At three fixed times of day: morning, after lunch, and evening: given the residual&#xD;
           antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine, hand cleansing at these fixed times will result&#xD;
           in hands being protected from contamination for much of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For visitors to the household and for children:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before touching the neonate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After contact with respiratory secretions or contact with nasal or oral mucosa&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing of intervention visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respondents randomized to the intervention arm will receive one hand hygiene promotion during&#xD;
      the second visit (at 36-38 weeks of gestation) prior to the review of the maternal and&#xD;
      neonatal health counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine for hand cleansing: We are positioning chlorhexidine as a product that is of&#xD;
      unique importance in the neonatal period, and may have substantive bactericidal and&#xD;
      bacteriostatic effects, making it superior to soap for hand cleansing, particularly in the&#xD;
      vulnerable newborn period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Identification of pregnant women and selection criteria: The proposed study&#xD;
      will be conducted in 4 unions in Mirzapur that are already under demographic surveillance.&#xD;
      Pregnant women are routinely identified as part of the demographic surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining informed consent and baseline data collection: A data collector will describe the&#xD;
      study to the pregnant woman at 32-34 weeks gestation and seek informed consent from her for&#xD;
      participation. The data collector will also request informed consent from the head of&#xD;
      household for interview of secondary caregivers regarding practices during the labor and&#xD;
      delivery process, and two structured observations of hand cleansing behavior among all&#xD;
      household members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and initiation of intervention: We will use a block randomization strategy,&#xD;
      using blocks of 4, to randomize participants to either the intervention or active control&#xD;
      arm. Block randomization is also referred to as &quot;restricted randomization&quot; and allows for the&#xD;
      numbers in the intervention arm to be roughly similar to those in the control arm throughout&#xD;
      the enrolment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives 1 and 2: Hand cleansing behavior measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare treatment arms with respect to mothers' hand cleansing behavior in the neonatal&#xD;
      period (Objective 1), we will do the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Observe hand cleansing, either by use of chlorhexidine or by handwashing with water +&#xD;
           soap, during 3-hour structured observations&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measure residual sanitizer weight and volume as markers of chlorhexidine consumption&#xD;
           Structured observations involve the placement of a study staff member in the&#xD;
           participant's home / household compound for an extended period of time in order to&#xD;
           observe typical behaviors. In this study the observations will be conducted in both&#xD;
           intervention and treatment arms by female field staff who will sit in a suitable place&#xD;
           to observe the mothers without getting in the way of their normal care giving activities&#xD;
           of the neonates. We are interested in observing the following behaviors during&#xD;
           structured observations (Appendix 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand cleansing at critical times (either by chlorhexidine use or by washing hands with soap&#xD;
      and water; handwashing with soap will be considered the corollary to chlorhexidine use since&#xD;
      the control arm does not have access to chlorhexidine) Objective 3: Acceptability of&#xD;
      chlorhexidine In both groups, we will record participant- or household member-initiated&#xD;
      reporting of any skin reactions, other possible adverse events, and acceptability of the&#xD;
      chlorhexidine with respect to ease of use, scent, skin comfort and the occurrence of skin&#xD;
      reactions (Objective 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At approximately day 28 of the neonate's life, we will conduct an end line survey (Appendix&#xD;
      7) with the mother, during which we will assess the following in a quantitative manner in the&#xD;
      intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptability of chlorhexidine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reported use of chlorhexidine versus handwashing hardware&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Behavioral determinants of hand hygiene We will collect qualitative data from a subset&#xD;
           of mothers in the intervention arm to understand in-depth about barriers and motivators&#xD;
           to chlorhexidine use for hand cleansing at the conclusion of all quantitative data&#xD;
           collection.&#xD;
