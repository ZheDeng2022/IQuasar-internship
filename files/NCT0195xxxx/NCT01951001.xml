      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the fixed-dose (prasugrel 10 mg/d vs. 5&#xD;
      mg/d) vs. phenotype (platlet function test by VerifyNow P2Y12 assay)-based prasugrel dose&#xD;
      adjustment can match therapeutic zone of platelet reactivity in PCI-treated Asians with acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin has been the mainstay treatment strategy to&#xD;
      prevent ischemic events in a wide spectrum of patients with high-risk coronary artery&#xD;
      disease. Multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that patients who are poor responders&#xD;
      or who have high on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity (HPR) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) are&#xD;
      at increased risk of post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) ischemic event occurrence.&#xD;
      A consensus paper suggested the cutoffs of HPR determined by various platelet function tests&#xD;
      to be used for personalized antiplatelet therapy. In addition, several clinical studies have&#xD;
      reported that patients with low on-treatment platelet reactivity (LPR) can be related with&#xD;
      increased risk of serious bleeding following PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although multiple coronary risk factors can influence the response to clopidogrel, the&#xD;
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 loss-of-function allele is a major component in determining the&#xD;
      level of platelet reactivity and the prevalence of HPR during clopidogrel treatment. There&#xD;
      are multiple CYP2C19 alleles associated with loss-of-function (*2-*8), and interethnic&#xD;
      differences in loss-of-function allele carriage exist (Table 1).4 Approximately 30% of&#xD;
      Caucasians are the CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele carriers with vast majority carry the *2&#xD;
      allele. However, ~ 65% of East Asians carry the CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele; ~50% carry&#xD;
      the *2 allele and the rest carry the *3 allele. Furthermore, the influence of the CYP2C19*3&#xD;
      allele on the antiplatelet response to clopidogrel seems greater compared with the CYP2C19*2&#xD;
      allele.6 It has been suggested that the high prevalence of CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele&#xD;
      carriage in East Asians may explain the higher prevalence of HPR during clopidogrel treatment&#xD;
      (at least 40% during standard-dose administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite the higher prevalence of HPR, numerous prospective clinical studies and&#xD;
      registry data have shown that East Asians have similar or even lower rates of post-PCI&#xD;
      ischemic event occurrence during clopidogrel therapy compared with Caucasians- the &quot;East&#xD;
      Asian paradox&quot;. Intriguingly, studies in PCI-treated East Asians have reported higher HPR&#xD;
      cutoffs compared with HPR cutoffs obtained from the Western population (252.5-288 vs. 208-235&#xD;
      P2Y12 reaction units [PRU] by the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay). The level and relative contribution&#xD;
      of HPR to post-stenting ischemic event occurrence in East Asians may differ from the Western&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though East Asians have shown the low level of platelet inhibition during clopidogrel&#xD;
      treatment, accompanying risk of post-PCI serious bleeding in East Asians was highest compared&#xD;
      with other races in the CHSRISMA (Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic&#xD;
      Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance) study.16 Moreover, the suggested cutoff of LPR in&#xD;
      PCI-treated Koreans appeared higher compared with that in Caucasians (e.g. VASP-P index 30%&#xD;
      vs. 17%). Taken together, East Asians may have an intrinsically reduced risk of arterial&#xD;
      thrombosis leading to an increased therapeutic zone of platelet reactivity to ADP compared&#xD;
      with Caucasians (the increased cutoffs of LPR and HPR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      # Are there ethnic differences in thrombogenecity? Arterial thrombosis is platelet rich and&#xD;
      superimposed on ruptured and inflamed atherosclerotic lesions.18 However, experimental&#xD;
      studies suggest that arterial and venous thrombosis are finely regulated processes involving&#xD;
      a highly complex interplay between platelets and other blood cells, soluble plasma proteins,&#xD;
      and the vessel wall.18,19 The convincing associations of arterial thrombosis to coagulation&#xD;
      system and inflammation have been repeatedly demonstrated in multiple clinical trials:&#xD;
      fibrinogen, factor V Leiden (G1691A) and prothrombin G20210A gene mutations, high-sensitivity&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is no definite evidence to suggest that differences in intrinsic platelet&#xD;
      function exist between races. However, there are numerous data suggesting inter-ethnic&#xD;
      differences in coagulation, fibrinolytic activity, and inflammation. Several population-based&#xD;
      clinical trials have reported different incidences of venous thromboembolism (VTE) across&#xD;
      races.23,24 In most studies, patients of Asian descent appear to have a lower rate of VTE&#xD;
      than other races. Prevalence of arterial thrombosis also has been shown to increase in black&#xD;
      race compared with non-black race. This disparity between the races has been partially&#xD;
      explained by genetic risk factors.24 In the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)&#xD;
      study evaluating multiple hemostatic factors and plasma endothelial activation markers in&#xD;
      individuals living in the USA, African Americans generally had the most thrombogenic and&#xD;
      dysfunctional endothelial profile, followed by Hispanics and Caucasians with similar levels,&#xD;
      and finally East Asians. A growing body of evidence has demonstrated different levels of&#xD;
      inflammation between the races, in which East Asians appear to have the lowest level of&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, East Asians appear to have a less prothrombotic state compared with African&#xD;
      Americans and Caucasians. The latter observation may explain why the East Asian population&#xD;
      has a lower risk of ischemic event occurrence and a higher propensity for bleeding during&#xD;
      clopidogrel treatment after PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      # Future direction of &quot;ethnicity/phenotype-based antiplatelet therapy&quot; Two large-scale,&#xD;
      prospective clinical trials (Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by&#xD;
      Optimizing Platelet Inhibition With Prasugrel-TIMI 38 [TRITON-TIMI 38] and PLATelet&#xD;
      Inhibition and Patient Outcomes [PLATO])30,31 evaluating the clinical efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitors (prasugrel and ticagrelor) in ACS patients demonstrated the&#xD;
      superiority of strong platelet inhibition to prevent the occurrence of ischemic events&#xD;
      compared with clopidogrel treatment. However, the recent &quot;real world&quot; clinical data from&#xD;
      Western population have shown that ACS patients with LPR (about 30% of total cohort) have the&#xD;
      increased risk of serious bleeding (e.g. 15.5% of TIMI minor plus major bleeding during&#xD;
      1-year prasugrel treatment). In the era of potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, the concept of&#xD;
      LPR and overcoming the risk of bleeding may be the emerging target in the field of platelet&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because PLATO and TRITON TIMI-38 enrolled a limited number of Asians (~3% of total cohort),&#xD;
      it is difficult to draw reliable conclusions regarding whether these potent P2Y12 receptor&#xD;
      inhibitors will provide similar benefits in East Asians compared with other races.&#xD;
      Aforementioned, East Asians may have an intrinsically reduced risk of arterial thrombosis&#xD;
      leading to an increased therapeutic zone of platelet reactivity compared with Caucasians.&#xD;
      Like most cardiovascular drugs, marked interethnic differences in pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of prasugrel exist. Exposure of the active metabolite and platelet&#xD;
      inhibition during prasugrel treatment was higher in East Asians including Chinese, Japanese,&#xD;
      and Korean populations compared with Caucasians even after adjustment for body weight. In a&#xD;
      recent pharmacodynamic study including stented Koreans, a 10 mg/d of prasugrel achieved the&#xD;
      lowest level of PRU compared with 5 mg/d of prasugrel and 75 mg/d of clopidogrel (80.1 ± 45.9&#xD;
      vs.163.1 ± 61.2 vs. 214.0 ± 69.1, p &lt; 0.001). About two thirds of 10 mg/d prasugrel group met&#xD;
      the criteria of LPR (≤ 94 PRU), which can support that 10 mg/d of prasugrel is so strong to&#xD;
      increase the risk of serious bleeding in most of East Asians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, the optimal dosage of antiplatelet regimens and the inhibitory level of the&#xD;
      target pathway may differ between the races. In East Asians with less thrombogenicity,&#xD;
      excessive inhibition of platelet function by potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitors may markedly&#xD;
      increase the risk of serious bleeding without protection against post-PCI ischemic event&#xD;
      occurrence. Therefore, dedicated investigations in East Asians are required before we can&#xD;
      apply Western recommendations for novel antiplatelet therapy in the former population. It is&#xD;
      a time to consider the paradigm shift from &quot;one size fits all&quot; to &quot;ethnicity/phenotype-based&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy&quot;. We designed the A-MATCH study to cover this unmet need to guarantee&#xD;
      clinical efficacy and safety in East Asians with less thrombogenicity.&#xD;
