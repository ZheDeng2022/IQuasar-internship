  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis is defined as a genetic disorder affecting approximately 100,000 individuals&#xD;
      worldwide. CF is caused by mutations in the CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR)&#xD;
      gene. CF patients are highly prone to environmental opportunistic bacterial infections&#xD;
      leading to prolonged and chronic lung infections. This results in reduction in the life&#xD;
      expectancy of CF patients due to excessive lung tissue destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitric Oxide (NO) is a naturally produced antimicrobial agent which is part of the innate&#xD;
      immune defense system of the lung. Both in vitro and in vivo studies had shown clearly that&#xD;
      NO acts against a wide variety of microbes including drug resistant bacteria as well as&#xD;
      viruses and fungi. Building on a successful phase I safety trial, the team aims to develop a&#xD;
      combined drug-device strategy to combat lung infections caused by biofilm-forming bacteria.&#xD;
      Unlike other inhaled drugs, NO is also a smooth muscle relaxant and avoids the concomitant&#xD;
      bronchial constriction often associated with inhaled antibiotics. An added benefit of NO&#xD;
      therapy is its mucolytic activity. We suggest that the combine broad spectrum antimicrobial&#xD;
      activity, signaling and mucolytic properties of NO, delivered to the lungs of CF patients,&#xD;
      will be directed at reducing bacterial resistance, microbial burden and biofilms as well as&#xD;
      resulting in improved airway clearance of viscid sputum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives: Assess the safety and the tolerability of NO intermittent inhalation&#xD;
      treatment in ≥10 years old CF subjects. Secondary Objective: Assess the improvement in forced&#xD;
      expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) before and after NO intermittent inhalation. Up to 10&#xD;
      subjects with Cystic Fibrosis will be enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment administration: The subjects will receive intermittent inhalation of NO in addition&#xD;
      to standard treatment for 10 working days (no NO treatment will be given to the subjects&#xD;
      during weekend days). The subjects will be asked to attend the CF clinic once a week for a&#xD;
      period of two weeks in order to evaluate the parameters related to the study. Oxygen (O2),&#xD;
      NO, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) delivered to the patient&#xD;
      will be continuously monitored.&#xD;
