      The protocol, approved by the Medical Research Council, was issued to assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the non-surgical device for applying it to the national scale up of adult male&#xD;
      circumcision in Zimbabwe&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Models show that to have the highest impact on the HIV epidemic, circumcision of up to 80% of&#xD;
      men in high prevalence countries, where MC rates are low, needs to be achieved (UNAIDS 2009;&#xD;
      Manicaland HIV/STD Prevention Project, 2008; Bollinger, et al, 2009). Hallett and colleagues&#xD;
      in 2008 showed that for Zimbabwe specifically, HIV incidence could be reduced between 25% to&#xD;
      35% if about 50% of men are circumcised. All modelings conducted show that MC programs must&#xD;
      be part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package as MC alone will not tip the HIV epidemic&#xD;
      into a terminal decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PrePex Device offers hope for rapid scale up of adult male circumcision in resource&#xD;
      limited settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the safety and efficacy have been established, it is important to conduct operations&#xD;
      research to determine how best to implement both device and surgical circumcisions in the&#xD;
      national program. Thus, the Zimbabwe MOHCW is planning a three phase trial in order to&#xD;
      determine the safety of the PrePexTM device, its performance and the ease of use in an&#xD;
      implementation roll out.&#xD;
