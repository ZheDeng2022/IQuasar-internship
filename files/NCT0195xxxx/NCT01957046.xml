  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess how effective and tolerable the country specific&#xD;
      clinical practice guidelines of SLTs are for UK, France and Sweden are.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main rationale behind this study is that well controlled comparisons of the various&#xD;
      laxatives for the treatment of OIC are lacking. There is lack of evidence suggesting which&#xD;
      laxative or combination of laxatives is optimal for managing OIC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study comprises of nine study visits and the total duration of the study is up to 42-52&#xD;
      days Potential subjects, aged 18 years and over, with OIC will be screened for entry into the&#xD;
      study at Visit 1 Eligible subjects will attend a 7-day Screening Period (Visit 1). This will&#xD;
      be followed by a 28-day Treatment Period (visits 2 to 8:), made up of four clinic visits&#xD;
      scheduled 7 days apart (visits 5(day 7), 6(day 14), 7(day 21), 8(day 28): days 7 to 28) and&#xD;
      two telephone visits (visits 3 and 4) which will take place during the first week of the&#xD;
      Treatment Period. There will be a 7-day Follow-up Period with a follow-up phone call to&#xD;
      conclude the study (Visit 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study assessment/ evaluation include vital sign measurements, ECG, safety labs, pregnancy&#xD;
      test and physical examination assessments, AEs, Investigator and subject questionnaires and&#xD;
      subjects daily diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will continue to take their prescribed pre-study opioid medication throughout the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

             sterilisation, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine&#xD;
             devices ((IUDs), hormonal), sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects meeting the following criteria for OIC:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subject and Investigator confirm that the Subject's constipation is induced, or&#xD;
                  worsened by the Subject's opioid medication (present at Screening)&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Subjects with &lt; 3 complete bowel movements (CBMs) in the week preceding the Visit&#xD;
                  1, based on Subject's retrospective memory in response to Investigator's&#xD;
                  question.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects taking at least one laxative on regular basis (i.e. ≥2 intakes per week&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing to take SLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects taking daily natural dietary fibre supplementation are eligible if they can&#xD;

             willing and able to maintain adequate hydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing and able (e.g. mental and physical condition) to participate&#xD;
             in all aspects of the study, including use of medication, completion of subjective&#xD;
             evaluations, attending scheduled clinic visits, completing telephone contacts, and&#xD;
             compliance with protocol requirements as evidenced by providing written, informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the Investigator's opinion the Subject's concomitant medication dose will remain&#xD;
             stable throughout the study Period (here concomitant medications mean all medications&#xD;
             besides opioids (standard and rescue opioid treatment)).&#xD;

&#xD;
        Additional Screening Exclusion Criteria for Subjects Suffering from Non-malignant Pain:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Subjects who participated in a clinical research study involving a new chemical entity or&#xD;
        an experimental drug within 30 days of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Screening Exclusion Criteria for Subjects Suffering from Malignant Pain:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received a new chemical entity or an experimental drug within 30&#xD;
             days of study entry (defined as Visit 1). Concurrent participation in another clinical&#xD;
             trial is not permitted except the epidemiological study performed to assess the&#xD;
             long-term survival data.&#xD;
