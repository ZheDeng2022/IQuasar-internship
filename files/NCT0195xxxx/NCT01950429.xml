      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Sickle cell disease changes the shape of red cells. This makes them more likely to break&#xD;
      down as they get stuck in small blood vessels. This leads to low red cell count and also&#xD;
      damage to small blood vessels that supply many organs. One of the affected organs is the&#xD;
      liver. Sickle cell disease and its treatment through blood transfusion can lead to&#xD;
      significant liver damage. This disease also can cause the liver to regrow abnormally after&#xD;
      damage. This can cause high blood pressure in the liver. Researchers want to know if curing&#xD;
      sickle cell disease with a stem cell transplant improves liver damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To explore specific factors that improve or worsen sickle cell liver disease after a stem&#xD;
      cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults ages 18 and older with sickle cell liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation will take approximately 7 days over 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: participants will be screened with medical history and review of current&#xD;
           treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: participants will return to the clinic for explanation of the study and&#xD;
           physical exam. They will also have blood and urine tests, and scans of the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have a 2-night stay at the clinic. They will have a liver biopsy&#xD;
           and a test of liver pressure. They will be sedated and a tube will be inserted in a vein&#xD;
           in their neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have a stem cell transplant will have a second biopsy about 24 months&#xD;
           later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Over the 2-year study period, participants will have blood drawn 2-4 times and stool&#xD;
           samples collected 2 times.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) causes multi-organ dysfunction and early death in affected&#xD;
      individuals. Many succumb to complications of chronic organ dysfunction and eventual organ&#xD;
      failure one of which is the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spectrum of sickle cell liver disease ranges from hepatic sequestration crisis, intrahepatic&#xD;
      cholestasis, gallstones, non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, chronic sickle hepatopathy and&#xD;
      cirrhosis to complications of the treatment of the disease including secondary iron overload&#xD;
      and viral hepatitis. Though liver transplantation has been performed for SC-induced liver&#xD;
      failure, a crude mortality rate of 60% makes it a poor choice. It is therefore imperative to&#xD;
      identify patients with liver dysfunction and damage for possible early intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cell transplant is currently the only cure for SCD and at the NIH SCD hepatopathy is one&#xD;
      of the indications for transplant. It is currently not known if stem cell transplant reverses&#xD;
      SCD liver disease hence we intend to study and compare the nature of SCD liver disease pre&#xD;
      and post stem cell transplant and in transplant ineligible patients. All SCD patients will be&#xD;
      screened for liver disease prior to enrollment including fibroscan evaluation. Primary end&#xD;
      point is histological evidence of regression of liver disease. Hence all patients in the&#xD;
      transplant eligible arm will undergo liver biopsy pre and 12-24 months post transplant.&#xD;
      Transplant ineligible patients will be offered liver biopsy when clinically indicated.&#xD;
      Patients that have already undergone transplant will be included and their data evaluated&#xD;
      retrospectively. Serum and plasma, liver tissue and stool samples will be evaluated&#xD;
      extensively for parameters such as liver function tests, iron metabolism, clotting factors,&#xD;
      and inflammatory markers including microbial products. The intention of the study is to use&#xD;
      sickle cell disease as a model of predicting markers of progression and regression of liver&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
