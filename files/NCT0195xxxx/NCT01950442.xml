    <textblock>
      Despite improvement in treatment-related morbidity and mortality, esophageal cancer is still&#xD;
      one of the most lethal malignancies. Accurate staging is essential to establish prognosis and&#xD;
      for patient management. Staging helps to determine if surgery, chemotherapy, radiation&#xD;
      therapy, a combination of these, or a palliative approach is the most appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic ultrasound techniques are becoming more and more popular. At Notre Dame Hospital,&#xD;
      Centre Hospitalier de L'Universite de Montreal, all patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer&#xD;
      undergo complete EUS staging. In selected patients, EUS is followed by EBUS during the same&#xD;
      procedure, in order to examine all the lymph nodes near or far from the primary tumor&#xD;
      amenable to EBUS guided trans-bronchial biopsy. In patients with a malignant esophageal&#xD;
      stricture, we have preformed very gentle balloon dilation up to 14 mm. It is important to&#xD;
      realize that this is not to achieve symptom resolution, but rather to allow the passage of&#xD;
      the scope. We hypothesize that earlier reports of higher perforation rates were related to&#xD;
      unnecessary aggressive dilation. Thus far, we have successfully dilated over 60 patients&#xD;
      during the last four years (2009-2013) and were able to pass the scope and complete the&#xD;
      examination in the vast majority of patients with no morbidity.&#xD;

      The gold standard for evaluating the local extension of esophageal cancer is endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound (EUS). The tumor extension into the esophageal wall (T stage) is best assessed&#xD;
      using EUS. Suspicious lymph nodes in the mediastinum and in lymph node basins drained by the&#xD;
      tumor (N stage) can be biopsied through the esophagus with fine needle aspiration (FNA) to&#xD;
      obtain pathologic confirmation. Computed tomography (CT) and positron-emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET) are used for the assessment of metastatic disease(M stage). In selected patients with&#xD;
      liver lesions, EUS can be utilized to biopsy these and confirm metastatic disease. In the&#xD;
      absence of metastatic disease, the local extent of the disease is an important factor in&#xD;
      making the decision between surgery alone, neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy followed by&#xD;
      surgery, surgery followed by chemoradiation or inoperability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A difficult situation is encountered in patients with malignant strictures, where the EUS&#xD;
      scope cannot be passed across the tumor and into the distal esophagus and stomach. There are&#xD;
      several problems with this situation. The first is the inability to assess the complete T&#xD;
      stage of the tumor. This can be associated with under T-staging. Also, the mediastinal and&#xD;
      intra-abdominal lymph nodes distal to the tumor are not assessed, and this can also lead to&#xD;
      inaccurate staging (N and M understaging). Patients with high grade malignant strictures have&#xD;
      a worse prognosis, and therefore accurate staging and appropriate application of therapeutic&#xD;
      options becomes paramount in providing the optimal treatment plan for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To circumvent the problem of incomplete staging due to tight malignant strictures, one option&#xD;
      that has been recently employed is gentle dilation of the malignant stricture, enough to&#xD;
      allow passage of the scope. It is important to stress that the purpose is not to relieve any&#xD;
      symptoms of dysphagia, but rather to allow passage of the scope to evaluate the TNM stage.&#xD;
      There has been mixed results with regards to the safety of this technique. The following&#xD;
      table summarizes the results of the studies evaluating dilation during endoscopic staging of&#xD;
      esophageal cancer. The earliest reports quote a high complication rate of 24%, specifically&#xD;
      related to perforation10. In the current era and with more experience gained in endoscopic&#xD;
      diagnostic and therapeutic applications, there have been more reports of patients safely&#xD;
      undergoing dilatation to permit complete endosonographic evaluation. The most recent studies&#xD;
      report no perforations in their series. Except for the study performed by Pfau et al., the&#xD;
      numbers are quite small with less than 40 patients in 3 of the studies. Furthermore, only one&#xD;
      study by Wallace et al. reports any change in the staging offered by completing the EUS&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a phase I clinical trial. All patients currently undergoing esophageal&#xD;
      cancer staging in the Division of Thoracic Surgery at the CHUM will be approached for&#xD;
      potential enrolment into the study. This staging is currently going on within the staging&#xD;
      protocol for esophageal cancer and therefore is not a change in practise, however, patients&#xD;
      refusing enrolment will not have there data included in the study database and their outcomes&#xD;
      will not be used in any way for research protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a malignant stricture that precludes passage of the dedicated endosonographic&#xD;
      scope will comprise the study group. In this situation, an over-the-wire balloon dilation&#xD;
      will be performed up to 14 mm. Patients in whom a standard adult gastroscope does not&#xD;
      traverse the stricture, a pediatric gastrosocpe will be utilized in order to allow tumor&#xD;
      traversal and guidewire placement into the stomach under endoscopic visualization. This will&#xD;
      be performed in order to avoid dilating through the tumor and inadvertently causing a&#xD;
      perforation. Once the dilation is complete, a complete EUS examination will be undertaken.&#xD;
      EUS, followed by EBUS in selected patients with lymphadenopathy in the high mediastinal lymph&#xD;
      nodes will be performed for staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo upright chest x-rays following their procedure in order to assess&#xD;
      for pneumoperitoneum and pneumomediastinum. Patients will be discharged, as usual, following&#xD;
      their procedure. Results will be discussed with them in a follow-up clinic appointment with&#xD;
      their thoracic surgeon within 3 to 4 weeks of the procedure. Any procedure-related morbidity&#xD;
      will be documented in the post-procedural period as well as at follow-up in the clinic. In&#xD;
      patients sent from another hospital for EUS staging of esophageal cancer, which are not&#xD;
      treated and followed at the CHUM, a 30 day telephone interview will be performed to assess&#xD;
      for complications in the 30-day post-procedure period.&#xD;
