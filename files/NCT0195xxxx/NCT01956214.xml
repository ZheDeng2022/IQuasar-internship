      Both strength training and endurance exercise training are commonly prescribed to improve&#xD;
      strength and function in patients with physical limitations caused by chronic disease or&#xD;
      disability including chronic kidney disease (CKD). Individuals with CKD often have low&#xD;
      physical function due to progressive declines in the performance of their kidneys. The low&#xD;
      physical function leads to physical inactivity, which exacerbates these functional declines&#xD;
      and promotes cardiovascular disease and bone disorders. In addition, severe functional&#xD;
      limitations in some patients prevent them from exercising at a great enough intensity to&#xD;
      provide significant benefits. As a result, alternative strategies are needed to maximize the&#xD;
      benefits of exercise while decreasing injury risk.&#xD;

&#xD;
      A new form of exercise, functional electrical stimulation (FES)-enhanced cycling has been&#xD;
      shown to increase muscle size and strength in patients with severe disabilities, particularly&#xD;
      spinal cord injury (SCI). It is based on the application of electrical stimulation to the&#xD;
      nerves that innervate the paralyzed weak muscles in order to generate muscle contraction. FES&#xD;
      has been used to stimulate leg muscles to pedal a cycle or to enable partial weight-supported&#xD;
      walking as an activity based rehabilitation therapy. FES cycling involves exercising using a&#xD;
      motor-assisted cycle coupled with electrical stimulation to up to five muscles in the leg.&#xD;
      There are well-documented benefits of FES-induced exercise in SCI patients including&#xD;
      clinically significant increases in muscle mass, blood flow, bone density, and bowel and&#xD;
      bladder function. A few pilot studies have also demonstrated that FES therapy has the&#xD;
      potential to improve function in other disabled populations, including chronic heart failure&#xD;
      and stroke patients. However, its effects in other populations with significant physical&#xD;
      impairments, including CKD patients, have yet to be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the proposed research is to evaluate the effects of FES-cycling training on&#xD;
      measures related to physical function, quality of life (QOL), heart disease, and bone health&#xD;
      in patients with renal failure receiving dialysis therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 31-85 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Must receive hemodialysis treatment at least 3 days per week&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must be willing to be randomized to the control or FES-cycle groups&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Must receive medical clearance from a Nephrologist at their dialysis clinic to&#xD;
             participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Must have evidence of impaired mobility on the FES Screening Form, attached. The FES&#xD;
             Screening Form inclusion criterion consist of a questionnaire of five tasks with a&#xD;
             relative difficulty scale for the completion of each task. Participants will be&#xD;
             included in the study if they indicate &quot;some&quot; or more difficulty at any task on the&#xD;
             questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. On dialysis treatment for less than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Body weight of greater than 400 pounds. (weight limitations on the DXA table)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Unstable angina, recent (less than 3 months) myocardial infarction or stroke (these&#xD;
             conditions may not enable the patient to tolerate the proposed exercise training).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Implanted electronic pacing or defibrillation device, vagus nerve stimulator, or&#xD;
             unstable vital signs.(the safety of electrical stimulation under these conditions is&#xD;
             not known).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Metal implants underneath or near the muscle groups which are to be stimulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnancy (the safety of stimulation during pregnancy is not known) - a section on the&#xD;
             ICD has been created for women to initial to indicate they are NOT pregnant or&#xD;
             planning on becoming pregnant over the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Lower limb amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        On the PAR-Q form, if the participant answers YES to the question: &quot;Has your doctor ever&#xD;
        said that you have a heart condition and that you should only do physical activity&#xD;
        recommended by a doctor?&quot;, they will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will also use answers on the Medical History Form to help us evaluate the exclusion&#xD;
        criteria. Answers to the following questions will either be exclusionary, or require&#xD;
        further follow-up with a physician prior to being allowed to participate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Question 1: &quot;Do you ever get chest pains while at rest and/or during exertion?&quot;, and&#xD;
        Question 4: &quot;â€¦was your heart attack within the last year?&quot; An answer of YES to either&#xD;
        question will require that the individual obtain a comprehensive physical exam by their&#xD;
        physician prior to being allowed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Question 10: Has your physician ever specifically told you not to do &quot;heavy&quot; or &quot;hard&quot;&#xD;
        exercise? An answer of YES will require a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Under &quot;Medical History&quot; (top of page 2 of Medical History Form), or &quot;Present Symptoms&#xD;
        Review&quot; (top of page 3) a check by &quot;chest pain or pressure&quot; will require a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Under &quot;Present Symptoms Review (top of page 3), a check by any of the following will lead&#xD;
        to exclusion: Implanted electronic pacing or defibrillation device; vagus nerve stimulator;&#xD;
        metal implants in the legs; or unstable vital signs.&#xD;
