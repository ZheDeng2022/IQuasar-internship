  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates a treatment protocol which holds the potential to significantly&#xD;
      improve communication and quality of life for individuals affected by Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD). Disorders of emotional communication are widely reported in PD and can negatively&#xD;
      impact quality of life by increasing social isolation and decreasing independence.&#xD;
      Individuals with emotional prosodic communication disorders are often perceived as depressed&#xD;
      or unconcerned about others. This seeming negativity can cause difficulties in relationships,&#xD;
      and increased feelings of stress and burden in caregivers which may result in earlier&#xD;
      placement in an institutional care setting. This innovative treatment program could improve&#xD;
      care for individuals with PD, as well as other individuals who may be affected by disorders&#xD;
      of emotional prosodic communication (e.g., stroke or traumatic brain injury).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) present with a variety of motor symptoms including&#xD;
      resting tremor, difficulty initiating movement/slowed movements, and rigidity. While these&#xD;
      motor signs and symptoms are the hallmark features, individuals with PD also often&#xD;
      demonstrate changes in communication ability, with an estimated prevalence of 89 percent of&#xD;
      all individuals with PD being affected. These disorders of communication have been reported&#xD;
      by individuals with PD and their caregivers to be one of the most difficult aspects of living&#xD;
      with this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most commonly diagnosed communicative disorder in PD is hypokinetic dysarthria which can&#xD;
      result in changes in prosody, respiratory control, voice quality, and articulation. Of these,&#xD;
      the disorders in prosody have been judged to be the most prominent deficit. Prosody includes&#xD;
      the pitch, loudness, and rate with which speech utterances are produced and is used to&#xD;
      communicate emotional connotation (e.g. angry versus sad). Impairments in speech prosody&#xD;
      reduce the ability to communicate emotional feelings or intentions as well as reducing the&#xD;
      intelligibility of the spoken message. While pharmacological treatments have been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in improving motor function, these medications have not been shown to greatly&#xD;
      mitigate speech production disorders including prosody, suggesting that therapies other than&#xD;
      dopaminergic agents are needed to address prosody deficits in PD. Despite a negative impact&#xD;
      on quality of life and reduced independence of individuals affected by emotional prosodic&#xD;
      disorders, no published studies are available testing therapies to improve production of&#xD;
      emotional prosody in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this proposal is to compare a treatment protocol shown to be effective in&#xD;
      treating emotional prosodic deficit in stroke and TBI (Leon et al., 2005; Rosenbek et al.,&#xD;
      2006) to a standard clinical treatment for prosody deficit that does not target the emotional&#xD;
      aspect of the disorder in individuals with PD. The experimental treatment targets increased&#xD;
      pitch and loudness variability, and control of speech rate, the core characteristics of&#xD;
      prosodic insufficiency in PD, but with an emphasis on the emotional component of the&#xD;
      disorder. The primary aims of the study are to determine treatment effect size by measuring&#xD;
      the difference of the experimental protocol versus standard clinical care on prosodic deficit&#xD;
      in individuals with PD via changes in acoustic and perceptual measures, as well as provide&#xD;
      psychometric validation of test-retest reliability of the outcome measures.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Administered before initiation of treatment and after 8 treatment sessions over an expected average of 3 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome of 96 semantically neutral sentences is read aloud using one of four emotional tones of voice. The participant will be given a card with the sentence and a card denoting the emotional tone to be used when speaking the sentence aloud. Participants will be wearing a headset cardioid microphone with frequency response tailored to vocal use with a shock mount to reduce handling and cable noise. Participant's responses will be recorded using the VisiPitch IV software designed for analysis and feedback and stored for future analysis.</description>

    <description>The experimental treatment is consistent with the standard treatment in that it targets impairments in pitch/stress, loudness variability and control of speech rate, the core characteristics of prosodic insufficiency in PD (Darley, Aronson &amp; Brown, 1969). However, the experimental treatment provides an innovative and targeted emphasis on the emotional component of the disorder. The production of emotional intonation in an utterance requires varying combinations of pitch/stress, loudness, and rate.</description>
