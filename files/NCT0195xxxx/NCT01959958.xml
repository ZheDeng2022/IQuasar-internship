  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric patients with sickle cell disease are at greater risk for exhibiting nocturnal&#xD;
      enuresis (bedwetting) compared to the general population. This increased risk has been&#xD;
      attributed to a decreased ability to concentrate urine caused by sickling-induced&#xD;
      nephropathy. The sociodemographic, psychosocial, and medical factors associated with&#xD;
      nocturnal enuresis are not well defined. In addition, the impact of these behaviors on&#xD;
      emotional and behavioral functioning, along with health-related quality of life are not&#xD;
      clear. Despite the availability of evidence-based interventions for nocturnal enuresis, very&#xD;
      few families with a child with sickle cell disease have utilized these methods. The reasons&#xD;
      for this underutilization of interventions are not clear.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To examine differences between those who do and those who do not exhibit&#xD;
      nocturnal enuresis in regard to health-related quality of life, emotional and behavioral&#xD;
      functioning, family functioning, stressful life events, sociodemographic factors and medical&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: To identify barriers to intervention implementation for nocturnal&#xD;
      enuresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, children and adolescents with sickle cell disease ages 6-18 years and their&#xD;
      parents/guardians will each complete an interview with questionnaires assessing nocturnal&#xD;
      enuresis, health-related quality of life, emotional and behavioral functioning, family&#xD;
      functioning, and stressful life events. Participants who report nocturnal enuresis will&#xD;
      identify interventions they have used in the past, along with barriers to intervention&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The future goal will be to use this information to develop an effective intervention strategy&#xD;
      for nocturnal enuresis specific to the needs of children and adolescents with sickle cell&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

    <description>Health-related quality of life, emotional and behavioral functioning, family functioning, stressful life events, sociodemographic factors and medical factors will be examined from questionnaire responses. Classification will be based on the criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR). Data will be stratified by age (6-11 years and 12-18 years) and genotype (HbSS/ HbSβ0 thalassemia and HbSC/ HbSβ+ thalassemia). The sample will be dichotomized using the binary response (by nocturnal enuresis/no nocturnal enuresis). Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's Exact test for categorical data and the two-sample t-test for continuous data will be performed to examine the group differences. Logistic regression will be performed using the binary response to examine the effect of these factors with covariates selected by Bayesian information criterion (BIC) with age group indicator and genotype included in the regression.</description>
