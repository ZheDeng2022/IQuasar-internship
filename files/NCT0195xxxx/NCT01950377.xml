      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Previous research has shown that dopamine, a brain chemical, is involved in decision&#xD;
      making. Different genes influence how much dopamine people have in their brains and how that&#xD;
      affects their behavior. Researchers will study if genes associated with dopamine affect&#xD;
      decision making and impulsiveness. All participants will take tests; some will have brain&#xD;
      images taken. Researchers will study the test responses and images; they will look for how&#xD;
      differences in these genes affect different types of decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if genes involved in a brain chemical, dopamine, are related to impulsiveness on&#xD;
      behavioral tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy adults ages 18 to 55.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants in this study will have at least 1 outpatient visit to the NIH Clinical&#xD;
           Center. Each visit will last 2 4 hours. At the first visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A blood sample will be taken only from participants that have not been previously&#xD;
           enrolled in 95-M-0150&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be given tests of their memory, attention, concentration, and&#xD;
           thinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants will have a second visit. It will be scheduled as soon as possible&#xD;
           after the first. At the second visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). They will have to lie in a&#xD;
           scanner for up to 2 hours. The MRI uses magnets, radio waves, and computers to produce&#xD;
           detailed pictures of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will repeat the tests from the first visit. Some will be done during the&#xD;
           MRI.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine the effects of genetic variability in the dopamine&#xD;
      signaling pathway on metric measures of impulsivity. Our hypothesis is that increased&#xD;
      dopamine levels or conversion of dopamine to intracellular signals, brought about by specific&#xD;
      variants of genes in this pathway, will increase impulsivity in our behavioral tasks. We will&#xD;
      examine variability by recruiting up to 400 ethnically and racially diverse healthy adult&#xD;
      male and female volunteers aged 18 to 55. We will carry out genotyping, behavioral testing&#xD;
      and functional magnetic resonance imaging on this group. We will initially recruit a large&#xD;
      pool of subjects for behavioral testing and genotyping. Behavioral tests will include various&#xD;
      laboratory tasks related to impulsivity. We have recently developed a series of tasks that we&#xD;
      have used in a group of Parkinson s patients with impulsive/compulsive behaviors (PD+ICBs).&#xD;
      Several tasks have shown large group effects between Parkinson s patients with and without&#xD;
      ICBs (PD +/- ICBs). We will focus on those tasks in the present study. Specific examples&#xD;
      include information sampling tasks and measures of novelty preference. If genetic effects on&#xD;
      behavior in the large sample are found, we will ask a subset of the original sample to return&#xD;
      for fMRI testing. The subset will be selected to allow us to examine the neural circuits that&#xD;
      operate differently as a function of genotype. In other words, they will be selected on the&#xD;
      basis of their genotype. The outcome measure in this case will be differences in brain&#xD;
      activity as a function of genotype, during performance of our behavioral task.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Subjects will not be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have a major medical (e.g. heart disease), neurological (e.g. stroke) or psychiatric&#xD;
             (e.g. bipolar disorder) illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have a vision and/or hearing problem that interferes with testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  currently use any psychotropic medication, antidepressants, steroids or opiates&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  currently use alcohol in excess of 14 drinks/week for males or 7 drinks/week for&#xD;
             females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have a lifetime history of or currently have alcohol or substance use or dependence&#xD;
             (excluding nicotine) that requires independent, concurrent treatment intervention&#xD;
             (such as, antabuse or opiate treatment). This does not include self-help group&#xD;
             treatment/intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  cannot understand the consent and procedures or cannot consent themselves to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smoke more than a half pack of cigarettes a day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NIMH employees and staff and their immediate family members will be excluded from the&#xD;
             study per NIMH policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition to the above, additional exclusion criteria apply for all MRI studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or have a positive pregnancy test 24 hours prior to&#xD;
             an experiment will be excluded from neuroimaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects will be questioned prior to MRI scanning for possible occupational&#xD;
             exposure to metal slivers or shavings, which may have become accidentally lodged in&#xD;
             the tissues of the head or neck. Subjects with surgical clips or shrapnel in or near&#xD;
             the brain or blood vessels, subjects with cochlear implants, subjects with any&#xD;
             metallic body in the eye or CNS, and subjects with any form of implant wire or metal&#xD;
             device which may concentrate radiofrequency fields will be excluded from MRI scanning&#xD;
             experiments because of possible risks during MRI scanning. Those whose history is&#xD;
             suggestive of such a problem will also be excluded from the MRI portion of the&#xD;
             experiments. They may still participate in the behavioral experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects unable to lie flat on their back for up to 2 hours or who are uncomfortable&#xD;
             in small close spaces (have claustrophobia) will not be eligible to participate in MRI&#xD;
             scans.&#xD;
