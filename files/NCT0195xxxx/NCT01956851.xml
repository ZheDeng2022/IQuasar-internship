      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the discovery of kisspeptin as a &quot;gate-keeper&quot; of hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis,&#xD;
      there has been tremendous interest in the molecule. Kisspeptins are a group of peptides&#xD;
      derived from the kiss gene, which share a common C-terminal decapeptide with an&#xD;
      arginine-phenylalanine residue at the amino terminal.(1, 2) These peptides and their target&#xD;
      receptor GPR54 are highly expressed in hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, islets of&#xD;
      langerhans, and gonads. (2-5) The relevance of kisspeptin as regulatory molecule for the&#xD;
      reproductive system has been well documented in significant number of trials. (6, 7) This&#xD;
      leads to the possibility that kisspeptin could be involved in an equally pivotal role in the&#xD;
      other sites, where it is located, namely pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have demonstrated that kisspeptin plays a role in regulating beta cell&#xD;
      activity.(8) Despite previous conflicting results suggesting glucose mediated insulin&#xD;
      secretion and insulin inhibition in different studies,(9, 10) current evidence favours role&#xD;
      of kisspeptin in glucose mediated insulin secretion.(11) One of earliest evidence of relation&#xD;
      of insulin resistance with falling kisspeptin levels was demonstrated by Panidis et al in&#xD;
      2006.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While various animal experiments have suggested that kisspeptins regulate insulin secretion,&#xD;
      we do not know if this is also true in humans. The investigators hypothesize that kisspeptin&#xD;
      levels are significantly low in individuals who have low endogenous insulin secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus investigators plan this study to understand the link between endogenous insulin&#xD;
      secretion and kisspeptin levels among individuals with various levels of insulin secretory&#xD;
      defect as seen in diabetics. We believe that this will help understand the physiologic&#xD;
      mechanisms, and kisspeptin based insulin regulation among individuals with diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have also noted that the mechanism of stimulating glucose induced insulin&#xD;
      release, is similar to the GLP1(Glucagon like peptide) action.(10) It would be interesting to&#xD;
      ascertain a correlation between the two peptides with potentially similar action in insulin&#xD;
      physiology. Leptin has been shown to alter kiss-1 expression in animal models. Establishing a&#xD;
      link between leptin levels with kisspeptin in humans would help us identify further potential&#xD;
      therapeutic targets involved in the multisystem manifestations of diabetes.(12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1: To explore the association between levels of fasting insulin and kisspeptin levels, in&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. To explore association between Obesity and Kisspeptin levels. 3. To explore the&#xD;
      association between kisspeptin and GLP-1 levels. 4. To explore the association of leptin and&#xD;
      kisspeptin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a population of adults attending the outpatient diabetes and medicine clinic of a tertiary&#xD;
      care hospital, Do those with diabetes mellitus as compared to those without diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, have progressively lower kisspeptin levels, and is this gradient in Kisspeptin&#xD;
      levels related to fasting endogenous insulin secretion. Investigators hypothesize low&#xD;
      Kisspeptin levels to be associated with low insulin secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY TYPE- STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study Ethical approval for the trial protocol&#xD;
      obtained from the institute's ethics committee of Care Hospital, Nagpur, India&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Methods The study will be conducted in CARE Hospital, Nagpur from 1 September&#xD;
      2013- 31 November 2013. Patients will be selected to enter the study, in such a way that&#xD;
      every patient presenting to the diabetes and medicine clinic will be screened in the study&#xD;
      and patients fulfilling inclusion criteria will be recruited in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total of 60 patients will be included in the study. Investigators plan to include Diabetics&#xD;
      without exogenous insulin supplementation, Diabetics with exogenous insulin supplementation&#xD;
      and normal healthy cohorts, 20 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will screen all patients who are referred to them after fulfilling the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria in the study. Written informed consent will be obtained from&#xD;
      all participants. The patients included in the study will be administered a standardized&#xD;
      questionnaire to record socio-demographic characteristics, details of diabetes management,&#xD;
      history of PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease), history of hypogonadism or any obvious sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction drug history. A general examination for BMI (Body mass index), waist hip ratio&#xD;
      and Blood pressure would be performed. Blood samples will then be withdrawn (8 ml : 2ml&#xD;
      fluoride tube, 2ml EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ), 4 ml plain tube) after overnight&#xD;
      fasting for creatinine, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, C-peptide levels, HbA1C&#xD;
      (glycosylated haemoglobin), LH (luteinizing hormone), FSH (Follicle stimulating hormone), and&#xD;
      kisspeptin levels. In female patients samples will be collected between day 3 to day 6 of a&#xD;
      normal menstrual cycle. After a usual meal as regularly taken by the patient, samples (8ml:&#xD;
      2ml fluoride, 4ml EDTA and 2 ml plain tube) for post-prandial blood glucose level, insulin&#xD;
      level, leptin level, GLP-1 level and kisspeptin levels will be collected. The blood samples&#xD;
      for creatinine, glucose (pre and post), insulin levels, HbA1C, LH and FSH will be analysed&#xD;
      immediately in the laboratory. The blood samples for kisspeptin levels, GLP-1, leptin levels&#xD;
      will be collected in a separate EDTA tube, centrifuged for 15 min at 4 degree and plasma will&#xD;
      be stored separately in a deep freezer at -70 degree. The concentration of kisspeptin will be&#xD;
      measured using KissÂ¬peptin-10 (Metastin [45-54]-Amide) and competitive enzyme immunoassay&#xD;
      (Kit# EK-048-56, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA). Leptin (Human) ELISA&#xD;
      Kit Protocol (Cat. No.: EK-003-12, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals) will be used for serum leptin&#xD;
      levels. GLP-1 (7-36)-Amide (Human,Rat, Mouse) EIA (enzymeimmunoassay) Kit (Catalog #&#xD;
      EK-028-11, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals) will be used for testing GLP 1 levels. The method given&#xD;
      in the product insert will be used for the assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analyses There is no similar study done to help us predict the power of study. As the&#xD;
      investigators did not have previous estimates no formal power calculation was undertaken. The&#xD;
      investigators randomly decided to take 60 patients in the study, 20 in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis All data will be entered using MS excel. Researchers will perform a descriptive&#xD;
      statistical analysis of the baseline data. The analyst, who will be blinded to the laboratory&#xD;
      results, will compare the outcome measure using Pearsons coefficient of correlation. All&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be done using SPSS software (v.16.0 SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL)&#xD;
      Dissemination The results of this trial are expected to provide evidence and clinically&#xD;
      relevant information the relation between kisspeptin and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks of participation The investigators believe there is no additional risk for the&#xD;
      participants included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.&#xD;
