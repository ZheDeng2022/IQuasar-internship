  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first clinical trial of the VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01) monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
      VRC01 is a broadly neutralizing antibody directed against HIV. This is a dose-escalation&#xD;
      study to examine safety, tolerability, dose and pharmacokinetics of VRC01. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that VRC01 will be safe for administration to HIV-1 infected adults by the intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      and subcutaneous (SC) routes and will not elicit hypersensitivity reactions. Samples will be&#xD;
      collected to learn if VRC01 is detectable in mucosal secretions and blood of participants and&#xD;
      how long VRC01 can be detected in the blood after it is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 15 and 25 HIV-1 infected adults, ages 18-70 years will be enrolled. There are 4 dose&#xD;
      escalation groups for IV administration; the doses are 1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40&#xD;
      mg/kg. There is 1 group for SC administration at 5 mg/kg. Each group is expected to include&#xD;
      at least 3 participants. Each participant will receive two infusions of VRC01 with about 1&#xD;
      month between doses. Infusions are administered in an inpatient unit and an overnight stay at&#xD;
      the NIH Clinical Center is required. No more than one subject per day per group will receive&#xD;
      a first infusion of the VRC01 product by the IV route and no more than one subject per week&#xD;
      will receive a first infusion of the product by the SC route. Study participation lasts for&#xD;
      24 weeks. Participant health and effect on CD4 count and HIV viral load will be monitored.&#xD;
      Samples will be collected and stored for research purposes.&#xD;

      This is the first clinical trial of the VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01) monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
      VRC01 is a broadly neutralizing antibody directed against HIV. This is a dose-escalation&#xD;
      study to examine safety, tolerability, dose and pharmacokinetics of VRC01. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that VRC 01 will be safe for administration to HIV-1- infected adults by the intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      and subcutaneous (SC) routes and will not elicit hypersensitivity reactions. Samples will be&#xD;
      collected to learn if VRC01 is detectable in mucosal secretions and blood of participants and&#xD;
      how long VRC01 can be detected in the blood after it is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 HIV-1 infected adults will be enrolled. Adult 18-60 years old will participate in&#xD;
      the dose escalation part of the study. There are 4 dose escalation groups for IV&#xD;
      administration; the doses are 1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg. There is 1 group for&#xD;
      SC administration at 5 mg/kg. Each dose escalation group is expected to include at least 3&#xD;
      participants. Each participant during the dose escalation part of the study will receive two&#xD;
      infusions of VRC01 with about 1 month between doses, with infusions administered in an&#xD;
      inpatient unit and an overnight stay at the NIH Clinical Center required. No more than one&#xD;
      subject per day per group will receive a first infusion of the VRC01 product by the IV route&#xD;
      and no more than one subject per week will receive a first infusion of the product by the SC&#xD;
      route. Study participation lasts for 24 weeks for participants who receive two doses. After&#xD;
      the dose escalation is completed, about 10 HIV-infected adults, ages 18-70 years old, with&#xD;
      detectable viral load will be enrolled to receive one dose of VRC01 at 40 mg/kg IV with&#xD;
      follow-up for 12 weeks. Participant health and effect on CD4 count and HIV viral load will be&#xD;
      monitored. Samples will be collected and stored for research purposes.&#xD;
