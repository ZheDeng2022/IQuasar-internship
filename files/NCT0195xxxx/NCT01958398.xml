      Objectives: This study evaluates the efficacy of two mobile phone applications, Promillekoll&#xD;
      and PartyPlanner among university government members at two universities in Stockholm,&#xD;
      Sweden. The design is a three-armed randomized controlled design, and outcomes are measured&#xD;
      in terms of changes in problematic alcohol use at follow up 7 weeks after study initiation&#xD;
      and baseline data gathering. Both the Promillekoll and PartyPlanner apps feature real time&#xD;
      registration of alcohol consumption and giving feedback of estimated blood alcohol&#xD;
      concentration levels. Both apps inform and warn the user when the estimated alcohol level is&#xD;
      above 0.6%, a level set that is below risky consumption levels. PartyPlanner additionally&#xD;
      provides the possibility of simulating and planning an alcohol consumption event in advance&#xD;
      and later on comparing it with the real time registration at the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Participants with problematic alcohol use (AUDIT &gt;7 for men and &gt;5 for women) are&#xD;
      randomized into one of three groups: 1. Access to Promillekoll, 2. Access to PartyPlanner and&#xD;
      3. Control group. Outcomes on alcohol use as well as information on the users' satisfaction&#xD;
      with the app assigned to them gathered after 7 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses are: 1. The groups receiving the Promillekoll and PartyPlanner interventions&#xD;
      will reduce their alcohol use to a larger extent than the control group at follow-up compared&#xD;
      to the baseline level. 2. The addition of the possibility to plan events beforehand&#xD;
      (PartyPlanner) will lead to an increased decrease in alcohol consumption to only real-time&#xD;
      use (Promillekoll).&#xD;

      Background Brief interventions via the internet have been shown to reduce university&#xD;
      students' alcohol intake. This study tested two smartphone applications (apps) targeting&#xD;
      drinking choices on party occasions, with the goal of reducing problematic alcohol intake&#xD;
      among Swedish university students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Students were recruited via e-mails sent to student union members at two&#xD;
      universities. Those who gave informed consent, had a smartphone, and showed risky alcohol&#xD;
      consumption according to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) were&#xD;
      randomized into three groups. Group 1 had access to the Swedish government alcohol monopoly's&#xD;
      app, Promillekoll, offering real-time estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC)&#xD;
      calculation; Group 2 had access to a web-based app, PartyPlanner, developed by the research&#xD;
      group, offering real-time eBAC calculation with planning and follow-up functions; and Group 3&#xD;
      participants were controls. Follow-up was conducted at 7 weeks.&#xD;
