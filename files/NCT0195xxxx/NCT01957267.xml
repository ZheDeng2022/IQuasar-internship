      The specific aims of the clinical studies are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop a directional high-resolution OCT and OCT angiography prototype to improve&#xD;
           imaging of structure and perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validate wide-field OCT and OCT angiography parameters to improve early glaucoma&#xD;
           detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simulate visual field results by combining structural and angiography OCT data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess abilities of above technologies and OCT-derived parameters on predicting glaucoma&#xD;
           detection, conversion, and progression.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the US. The diagnosis and monitoring of&#xD;
      glaucoma are important problems, not only because of its prevalence, but also because of its&#xD;
      silent and irreversible nature. However all of the current diagnostic tests have serious&#xD;
      limitations. Although elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a risk factor, most glaucoma&#xD;
      patients actually have IOP within normal range. Visual field (VF) tests are poorly&#xD;
      reproducible, and a series of 3 tests are needed to establish diagnosis or confirm&#xD;
      progression. Although ophthalmoscopic examination can detect optic nerve head (ONH) and nerve&#xD;
      fiber layer (NFL) defects, reliability in diagnosis and tracking is hampered by its&#xD;
      subjective and semi-quantitative nature. Although quantitative imaging with optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT), scanning laser polarimetry (SLP), and confocal scanning laser&#xD;
      ophthalmoscopy (cSLO) can more objectively detect ONH and NFL defects, their diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracies are still not sufficient to be relied on alone for diagnostic screening. It has&#xD;
      been estimated that about half of glaucoma patients in the US do not know that they have the&#xD;
      disease. Thus, there is a need for improvements in glaucoma diagnostic technologies. One&#xD;
      approach that deserves further exploration is blood flow imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is much circumstantial evidence that vascular factors play important roles in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of glaucoma:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Systemic vasculopathy increases the risk of developing glaucoma. Hypertension, diabetes,&#xD;
           and vasospastic conditions are all known risk factors. Normal tension glaucoma has also&#xD;
           been linked to peripheral endothelial dysfunction and erectile dysfunction. This&#xD;
           suggests that poor circulation may be a causative factor or a facilitative factor that&#xD;
           predisposes the ONH to damage by elevated IOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Decrease or fluctuation in ocular perfusion pressure was identified as an independent&#xD;
           risk factor for progression in the Collaborative Normal-Tension Glaucoma Study and other&#xD;
           studies. Nocturnal hypotension is also a risk factor for glaucoma progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Medications that improve ocular perfusion appear to have protective effects that are not&#xD;
           explained by the lowering of IOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Optic disc hemorrhage and peripapillary atrophy are both associated with accelerated&#xD;
           glaucoma progression. These finding may support a role for focal ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Animal experiments show that increased IOP causes decreased ONH blood flow in the&#xD;
           presence of low systemic blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the evidence, the management of glaucoma remains focused on the lowering of IOP, the&#xD;
      one causative factor that responds to treatment and can be easily measured. Blood flow&#xD;
      measurement is a research topic, but currently has no clinical role in the diagnosis,&#xD;
      prognostic evaluation, or treatment of glaucoma. Therapies aimed at improving ocular&#xD;
      circulation cannot be effectively developed without a practical method for quantitative and&#xD;
      reproducible evaluation of ONH and retinal perfusion. Thus there is a great need to develop&#xD;
      better technology for the evaluation of ocular circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed new methods to image and measure optic nerve&#xD;
      head (ONH) and retinal blood flow. Preliminary results showed that VF loss was more highly&#xD;
      correlated with retinal blood flow as measured by OCT than any neural structure measured by&#xD;
      OCT or other imaging modality. Accordingly, the goal of the proposed project is to improve&#xD;
      the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of glaucoma by further developing novel functional&#xD;
      OCT measurements using ultrahigh-speed (70-100 kHz) OCT technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinal blood flow, ONH circulation, optic disc rim volume, peripapillary nerve fiber layer&#xD;
      volume, and macular ganglion cell complex volume are all pieces of the same glaucoma puzzle.&#xD;
      This project will develop novel imaging methods that allow us to look at the whole picture&#xD;
      using one tool - ultrahigh-speed OCT.&#xD;

        The study will enroll both males and females and include all ethnic and racial groups&#xD;
        through clinical practices in the centers. The study will enroll subjects in the older&#xD;
        adult age range commonly affected by glaucoma - 40 years or older. The study will exclude&#xD;
        people with life-threatening or debilitating illness that would make 5-year participation&#xD;
        unlikely or cooperation with tests difficult. For similar reasons those older than 85 years&#xD;
        are excluded. The study also excludes those with any disease that might confound the&#xD;
        diagnosis of glaucoma. Otherwise people with any health status are eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
        Two groups of participants are recruited in the study: healthy controls or participants&#xD;
        with confirmed glaucoma.&#xD;
