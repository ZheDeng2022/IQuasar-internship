    <textblock>
      This research trial studies gene expression in patients with prostate cancer that has spread&#xD;
      to other places in the body receiving cytochrome P450 17 alpha hydroxylase/17,20 lyase&#xD;
      (CYP-17) inhibition therapy. Studying samples of tissue, blood, and urine in the laboratory&#xD;
      from patients receiving CYP-17 inhibition therapy may help doctors learn more about changes&#xD;
      that occur in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may&#xD;
      also help doctors understand how well patients respond to treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether somatic tumor genome alterations identified in tumor tissue before or&#xD;
      after the initiation of CYP-17 inhibition with abiraterone acetate therapy are associated&#xD;
      with a 12-week composite progression free survival (PFS) endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To use tumor tissue obtained prior to the initiation of therapy and from the 12 week&#xD;
      biopsy to develop tumor xenografts for mechanistic and functional studies which will&#xD;
      determine whether mutations identified in the tumor genome are associated with response to&#xD;
      drugs that target the observed mutated genes and/or associated pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether somatic tumor genome alterations identified before or after&#xD;
      initiating CYP-17 inhibition with abiraterone acetate therapy are associated with overall&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether somatic tumor genome alterations identified in tumor tissue before&#xD;
      or after the initiation of CYP-17 inhibition with abiraterone acetate therapy are associated&#xD;
      with progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate circulatory markers in blood and urine specimens for response and/or&#xD;
      resistance to treatment. (Exploratory and correlative objectives)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue, blood, and urine samples are collected at baseline and after 12-14 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      and assessed for circulating tumor cells, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),&#xD;
      and exome sequencing.&#xD;
