      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malignant mesothelioma is a malignancy arising from the mesothelial cells of the pleura,&#xD;
           peritoneum, pericardium, or tunica vaginalis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mesothelioma accounts for 0.10% of deaths annually in the United States. Malignant&#xD;
           pleural mesothelioma is the most common of these, comprising of 80% of the cases with an&#xD;
           annual incidence of about 2,500 in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The median survival from diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma is approximately 12 months.&#xD;
           The majority of patients present with stage III or IV disease with 85-90% of patients&#xD;
           considered unresectable at diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peritoneal mesothelioma has a better prognosis than pleural mesothelioma; nevertheless,&#xD;
           patients undergoing therapy for peritoneal mesothelioma have few well-studied treatment&#xD;
           options due in large part to the rarity of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To allow sample acquisition for use in the study of mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients age greater than or equal to 2 years with malignant mesothelioma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must be able and willing to provide informed consent if 18 or over; parent or guardian&#xD;
           must be able and willing to provide consent for patients under the age of 18&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 1000 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be followed to determine the course of disease and to record any treatment&#xD;
           received for mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo sampling of blood, urine, tumor and abnormal body fluids for&#xD;
           tissue banking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studies which may be performed on banked material include genetic and genomic studies,&#xD;
           establishment of cell cultures and immunologic studies.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malignant mesothelioma is a malignancy arising from the mesothelial cells of the pleura,&#xD;
           peritoneum, pericardium, or tunica vaginalis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mesothelioma accounts for 0.10% of deaths annually in the United States. Malignant&#xD;
           pleural mesothelioma is the most common of these, comprising of 80% of the cases with an&#xD;
           annual incidence of about 2,500 in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The median survival from diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma is approximately 12 months.&#xD;
           The majority of patients present with stage III or IV disease with 85-90% of patients&#xD;
           considered unresectable at diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peritoneal mesothelioma has a better prognosis than pleural mesothelioma; nevertheless,&#xD;
           patients undergoing therapy for peritoneal mesothelioma have few well-studied treatment&#xD;
           options due in large part to the rarity of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition to mesothelioma, mesothelin is highly expressed in several cancers,&#xD;
           including pancreatic, biliary adenocarcinomas, gastric and ovarian cancers; mesothelin&#xD;
           is also expressed in a significantly larger proportion of thymic carcinoma than thymoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mesothelin expression level has been correlated with improved overall survival in thymic&#xD;
           cancer and with reduced overall survival in patients with lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To allow sample acquisition for use in the study of mesothelioma and other mesothelin&#xD;
      expressing cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients age greater than or equal to 2 years with malignant mesothelioma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients age greater than or equal to 18 years with thymic carcinoma, pancreatic or&#xD;
           biliary adenocarcinoma or lung, gastric or ovarian cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must be able and willing to provide informed consent if 18 or over; parent or guardian&#xD;
           must be able and willing to provide consent for patients under the age of 18&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 1000 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be followed to determine the course of disease and to record any treatment&#xD;
           received for the eligible mesothelin expressing cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo sampling of blood, urine, tumor and abnormal body fluids for&#xD;
           tissue banking.&#xD;
