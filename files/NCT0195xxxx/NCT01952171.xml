      Recent advances in genomic techniques are making possible a new wave of genetic discovery in&#xD;
      congenital heart disease (CHD). Existing data suggests that CHD occur in Sub-Saharan Africa&#xD;
      at frequencies similar to the rest of the world. In this application, we propose to utilize&#xD;
      the unique advantages of Sub-Saharan Africa - a combination of the most genetically diverse&#xD;
      populations in the world and of diminished environmental background effects (i.e. low&#xD;
      prevalence of smoking, alcohol abuse, obesity in comparison to western countries) - to better&#xD;
      understand the genetic basis for congenital heart disease. We will couple next generation&#xD;
      genomic techniques with more traditional gene discovery methods to investigate CHD in two&#xD;
      African countries: Uganda and Nigeria. The inclusion of syndromic and non-syndromic CHD&#xD;
      observed in these populations as well as careful phenotyping (including echocardiography)&#xD;
      will greatly enhance our potential to provide insight into the genetic architecture of CHD in&#xD;
      African populations. To accomplish this, we plan to enroll families, in whom members have&#xD;
      congenital heart malformations consistent with an error of early human development in our&#xD;
      research protocol. Patients will be enrolled at the Uganda Heart Institute in Kampala,&#xD;
      Uganda, and at the Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Lagos,&#xD;
      Nigeria, with the potential to include other African sites. High throughput genomic studies&#xD;
      will be done at the NIH.&#xD;

        The study will include affected individuals and their affected/or unaffected family&#xD;
        members. Family members will include parents and siblings. The goal will to be obtaining a&#xD;
        minimum of a trio (affected and both parents) to increase probability of finding gene&#xD;
        mutations. Clinical criteria for inclusion is defined as presence of a congenital cardiac&#xD;
        malformation related to errors in early human development. The diagnosis of congenital&#xD;
        heart disease (presence of a congenital cardiac malformation thought to be related to&#xD;
        errors in early human development) will be made by a cardiologist on our team based on&#xD;
        echocardiogram, physical examination, medical history, and review of medical record.&#xD;
