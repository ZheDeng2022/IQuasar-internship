      The aim of the project &quot;High Altitude Medical Research Expedition Himlung 2013&quot; (HiReach2013)&#xD;
      is to comprehensively investigate the cerebral, cardiovascular and pulmonary adaptation and&#xD;
      the reactions of the human immune system during an ascent to extreme altitudes of over 7000&#xD;
      m. A total of 44 healthy and trained volunteers will be included in the study after written&#xD;
      informed consent has been obtained.Baseline sea level clinical examination will be performed&#xD;
      in Bern, Switzerland (BE1) at 550 m 8 to 4 weeks before departure. High altitude research&#xD;
      facilities will be available at the altitudes of 5000m, 6100m and 6900m. Post-expedition&#xD;
      examination will be performed within 2 to 6 weeks after the end of the expedition in Bern. In&#xD;
      the context of 3 sub-projects specific measurements and examinations are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These include: cMRI before and after the climb and neurovascular doppler examination during&#xD;
      the climb; blood sampling for coagulation studies, cardiac and thoracic ultrasound, stress&#xD;
      tests for assessment of cardiovascular performance.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altitude related medical problems are gaining more importance and attention as an ever&#xD;
      increasing number of people travel to higher altitudes for work or pleasure. Resort towns in&#xD;
      Europe and the Western United States at elevations in the 2000 m to 3000 m range attract&#xD;
      millions of visitors annually. Many more visit cities in South America and Asia situated&#xD;
      above 3000 m. In addition, tens of thousands of travelers, trekkers, and skiers worldwide&#xD;
      ascend to elevations in the range of 3000 to 5500 m. An ever-increasing number of&#xD;
      recreational climbers attempt ascents of summits of very high (3500 m to 5500 m) or extreme&#xD;
      (&gt;5500 m) altitudes. The Nepalese Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation and the Nepal&#xD;
      Mountaineering Association reported having issued permits to 6032 climbers for peaks higher&#xD;
      than 6000 m in the year 2010 alone. When considering that the number of people residing at&#xD;
      high altitude is bound to increase, it is of importance to further deepen our understanding&#xD;
      of the physiologic changes and dangers associated with exposure to high altitude. Oxygen&#xD;
      homeostasis is essential for survival of healthy humans at high altitudes. Various&#xD;
      physiological changes involving different organ systems occur during exposition and&#xD;
      acclimatization to hypobaric hypoxia in the context of a high altitude sojourn. These include&#xD;
      marked adaptations of pulmonary and systemic vascular function, changes in cerebral perfusion&#xD;
      and metabolism, physiologic and metabolic adaptations of the immune system and innate defense&#xD;
      mechanisms against infection. These changes are a consequence of tissue hypoxia per se or can&#xD;
      be mediated by hypoxia induced activation of sympathoadrenal pathways. An example of&#xD;
      important research activities in recent years is the discovery of hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#xD;
      alpha (HIF1Î±) and its role in oxygen homoeostasis by regulation of multiple gene loci.&#xD;
      Additionally, as a result of hypoxia induced increase in oxidative/reductive stress, enhanced&#xD;
      generation of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS), altered activity of&#xD;
      antioxidant systems, and related oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA can occur as&#xD;
      well as injury at the cellular, sub-cellular and molecular levels. These short-lived&#xD;
      intermediates include among others superoxide anion (O2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and&#xD;
      hypochloride (HOCI. In addition, hydroxyl radicals (OH), hydroxide ions (OH) and superoxide&#xD;
      radicals (O2-) are highly reactive members of the ROS family that accumulate under certain&#xD;
      physiological and pathophysiological conditions. As a consequence, prolonged hypobaric&#xD;
      hypoxia leads to systemic oxidative stress similar to severe inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue hypoxia and increased oxidative stress as well as adaptive or reactive changes in&#xD;
      sympathoadrenal and neuroendocrine processes also occur in various disease states. Hypoxia&#xD;
      per se plays an important role in the pathogenesis of major causes of mortality, including&#xD;
      cancer, cerebral and myocardial ischemia, and chronic heart and lung disease. Global&#xD;
      hypoxemia is a common problem in critically ill patients: In patients with pulmonary failure&#xD;
      profound hypoxia can occur due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch or impaired diffusion&#xD;
      capacity across the alveolo-capillary membrane despite best medical support including&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. Oxygen delivery to tissues might also be impaired due to low cardiac&#xD;
      output or reduced oxygen carrying capacity in anemia. Microcirculatory dysfunction -&#xD;
      occurring in the context of severe sepsis - can lead to local hypoxia on a cellular level&#xD;
      even in patients with normal or increased arterial oxygen content and oxygen delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In critically ill patients cellular hypoxia induces oxidative stress which can deplete&#xD;
      cellular antioxidative capacities and lead to impaired ability to use available oxygen.&#xD;
      Depleted levels of reduced glutathione, an important intra-mitochondrial antioxidant, in&#xD;
      combination with increased generation of ROS and RNS seem to inhibit oxidative&#xD;
      phosphorylation and ATP generation. There is increasing interest in ROS-intermediates and&#xD;
      their role in the progression and modulation of vascular dysfunction and remodelling seen in&#xD;
      different chronic disease entities, such as diabetes mellitus, chronic heart failure or&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and development of pulmonary hypertension (PHT).&#xD;
      The mechanisms of ROS-generation are not fully understood. ROS are produced in leukocytes,&#xD;
      but the generation of ROS might also occur through disruption of the electron transport chain&#xD;
      in mitochondria. The resulting mitochondrial dysfunction has been described as an additional&#xD;
      factor causing pulmonary vasoconstriction and remodelling in PHT. In hypoxic patients with&#xD;
      respiratory failure an increase of pulmonary vascular pressure frequently occurs (WHO Class&#xD;
      III - pulmonary hypertension) which may worsen hypoxemia by impairing lung perfusion. If this&#xD;
      increase is caused by a direct vasoconstrictive effect of hypoxia on the pulmonary&#xD;
      endothelial cells or by an increase in ROS is still not fully understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, the mechanisms leading to adaptation to prolonged hypoxic conditions in healthy&#xD;
      humans and in critically ill patients are not well understood. In the context of critical&#xD;
      illness these mechanisms are difficult to explore due to the heterogeneity of patients and&#xD;
      precipitating illnesses. Furthermore, effects of hypoxia and concurring disease related&#xD;
      processes are difficult or impossible to distinguish. Animal models of critical illness might&#xD;
      have substantial limitations and often do not represent the human patient. It has been&#xD;
      suggested that the physiological and pathophysiological responses to hypobaric hypoxia may be&#xD;
      similar to responses seen in critical illness. In the context of a high altitude expedition&#xD;
      human subjects can safely be submitted to prolonged hypoxia and oxidative stress and the&#xD;
      resulting cerebral, cardiovascular and pulmonary adaptation and changes in mitochondrial&#xD;
      function, inflammatory cascade, and coagulatory activity can be explored in a controlled&#xD;
      fashion. The study of human responses to hypoxia occurring in a hypobaric environment in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers ascending to high altitudes may therefore serve as a model of isolated&#xD;
      hypoxia and might help to improve our understanding of the effects in critically ill&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project &quot;High Altitude Medical Research Expedition Himlung 2013&quot; (HiReach2013)&#xD;
      is to comprehensively investigate the cerebral, cardiovascular and pulmonary adaptation and&#xD;
      the reactions of the human coagulation system during an ascent to extreme altitudes of over&#xD;
      7000 m.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testing will be done using a testing system on a bicycle using a&#xD;
      roller trainer for standardization and regulation of the work load. Static and dynamic lung&#xD;
      volumes will be assessed at each study site. The measurements will include the assessment&#xD;
      DLCO using a commercially available spirometer. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography will&#xD;
      be performed for assessment of systolic/diastolic cardiac function and pulmonary artery&#xD;
      pressures. Lung ultrasound will be applied in each subject at each study site to quantify&#xD;
      extravascular lung water by ultrasound lung comets. Microparticle measurements will be&#xD;
      performed using an Annexin V based ELISA. Cerebral blood flow velocity will be measured from&#xD;
      a middle cerebral artery using transcranial Doppler. Structural cerebral changes and cerebral&#xD;
      volume will be assessed with MRI of the brain. At each study site extensive coagulation&#xD;
      studies will be performed.&#xD;
