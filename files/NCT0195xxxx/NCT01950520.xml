      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Changes in how a person s body burns energy or calories can affect their weight over time.&#xD;
      The lowest level of energy the body needs to function is called basal metabolic rate. In the&#xD;
      cold, we burn extra energy, even before we start to shiver. This is called non-shivering&#xD;
      thermogenesis and it occurs in different types of tissue such as muscle and fat. Researchers&#xD;
      want to learn more about this type of energy burning and how it is regulated. They hope this&#xD;
      will help treat obesity in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-study 1: to better understand how non-shivering thermogenesis works.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-study 2: to measure the effects of anti-obesity drugs on basal metabolic rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-study 3: to better understand the effects of mirabegron, a beta-3 adrenergic&#xD;
           receptor agonist, on brown fat activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy, lean adult males ages 18 to 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, blood test, and EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For sub-studies 1 and 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will receive one X-ray scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Each day, all participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Have height and weight measured, and have urine collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spend 4 hours in a temperature-controlled room with furniture, toilet area, phone, and&#xD;
           computer. They will wear small non-invasive devices to monitor activity, heart rate,&#xD;
           temperature, and shivering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Walk for 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -For sub-study 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive one DXA scan and up to 4 PET/CT scans and 4 MRIs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each stay, all participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Have height and weight measured, and have urine collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spend 6 hours in a temperature-controlled room with furniture, toilet area, phone, and&#xD;
           computer. They will wear small non-invasive devices to monitor activity, heart rate,&#xD;
           temperature, and shivering.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be compensated for their time and participation at the end of the&#xD;
           study&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The balance between energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake ultimately determines body&#xD;
      weight. Resting EE is the major component (60-75%) of total EE in an adult human being.&#xD;
      Resting EE dynamically adapts to environmental changes such as ambient temperature. In our&#xD;
      on-going study of environmental temperature changes within and around the thermoneutral zone,&#xD;
      we observed that healthy young men can increase EE by 17 % of the basal metabolic rate&#xD;
      through the process of non-shivering thermogenesis (NST). This capacity for NST is&#xD;
      unexpectedly large as compared to prior reports of mild cold-induced thermogenesis (3 to 11%)&#xD;
      and suggests that increasing NST could be explored as an intervention to combat obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to better understand the physiology of NST and to develop improved&#xD;
      assays for evaluating the effect of drugs that alter EE. For example, only recently has it&#xD;
      been realized that brown adipose tissue is functional in adult humans and that white adipose&#xD;
      tissue can be converted to brown-adipose-like tissue to increase heat production during cold&#xD;
      exposures. Moreover, skeletal muscle likely also plays a role in cold-induced thermogenesis&#xD;
      even before overt shivering occurs. It is plausible that the mechanisms governing heat&#xD;
      production for NST contribute to regulation of body weight and thus may be contributing to&#xD;
      the current obesity epidemic: even small changes in EE, if not compensated by changes in food&#xD;
      intake, can have long-term effects on body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol has two phases. The first uses a pharmacologic approach to investigate the&#xD;
      mechanism of NST in young healthy lean males. Since the principal physiologic stimulus to BAT&#xD;
      (and possibly muscle for NST) is via the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), beta-adrenergic&#xD;
      receptors may hold key roles in regulating human EE. We hypothesize that, by careful&#xD;
      measurements of NST (at an individually-titrated cool environmental temperature, between 18&#xD;
      21 degrees C vs. at thermoneutrality of 27 degrees C) and using beta-adrenergic drugs that&#xD;
      differ in receptor specificity and agonist/antagonist properties, we will gain better&#xD;
      understanding of the regulation of human NST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase of the study focuses on measuring of FDA-approved drugs (such as&#xD;
      anti-obesity drugs) potential effect on basal metabolic rate (BMR) under thermoneutral&#xD;
      conditions. The rationale is that previous studies of drug effect on EE in humans have not&#xD;
      always rigorously enforced the use of thermoneutral conditions, thus may have increased&#xD;
      variability and underestimated the effect, contributing to inconclusive findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is envisioned that this study will further our knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate&#xD;
      the acute adaptive changes in resting energy expenditure and the effects of drug therapy&#xD;
      targeting obesity in humans.&#xD;
