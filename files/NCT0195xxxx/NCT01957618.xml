  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem, especially in the endemic area&#xD;
      like Taiwan, where there are more than 3 million chronic hepatitis B carriers. Patients with&#xD;
      chronic HBV infection are at increased risk of developing cirrhosis, which may have&#xD;
      disastrous complications, including hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC). The liver cirrhosis related complications accounts for the 8th leading cause of deaths&#xD;
      in Taiwan; whereas, the HCC is the 2nd leading cause of deaths among all cancers. Therefore,&#xD;
      it is prudent to develop strategies to prevent or halt the progression of liver cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For HBV patients who have already had cirrhosis, the main treatment objective is to reduce&#xD;
      their risk of complications. A large-scale multicenter clinical trial showed that viral&#xD;
      suppression using lamivudine in patients with advanced fibrosis effectively decreases the&#xD;
      risk of HCC and liver-related complications. This study highlights the importance to treat&#xD;
      HBV-related cirrhosis patients; however, several issues remain to be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first issue is that this clinical trial only enrolled patients with positive HBeAg or&#xD;
      HBV-DNA level &gt;1.4 x105 IU/mL. However, the current recommended threshold for cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients to start anti-viral treatment is 2000 IU/mL. Whether anti-HBV therapy benefits&#xD;
      cirrhotic patients in this level is still unclear. Second, lamivudine was used in this&#xD;
      clinical trial; however, the high resistant rate of lamivudine during treatment probably&#xD;
      lowers its protective effect against HCC. Whether a more potent anti-HBV agent with extremely&#xD;
      low resistance profile, entecavir, is more beneficial to HBV-related cirrhotic patients is&#xD;
      also unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bureau of National Health Institute launched the reimbursement program for anti-HBV&#xD;
      therapy since 2003 and extended this program to cirrhotic patients with HBV DNA level &gt; 2000&#xD;
      IU/mL for long-term use since Aug, 2010. Taking this advantage, we may explore the&#xD;
      above-mentioned clinical questions more easily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these issues, we will first retrospectively collect a cohort of HBV-related&#xD;
      cirrhosis patients. All the patients will be enrolled from the time before oral anti-HBV&#xD;
      therapy is widely used. We will determine their baseline serum HBV-DNA levels using the&#xD;
      stored sera and enrolled those with baseline HBV-DNA levels higher than 2000 IU/mL as our&#xD;
      historical controls. Second, we will enroll a retrospective cohort of HBV-related cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients from 2008 who had HBV-DNA levels higher than 2000 IU/mL and received indefinite&#xD;
      therapy of entecavir. By comparing these two cohorts, we will be able to clarify whether&#xD;
      indefinite viral suppression by entecavir is beneficial for the cirrhotic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With comprehensive analysis, we wish to document that re-setting the risk level of HBV DNA&#xD;
      from 140,000 IU/mL to 2,000 IU/mL is more beneficial for HBV-related cirrhotic patients and&#xD;
      long-term entecavir does lower the risk of HCC further. These lines of evidence will assist&#xD;
      in delivering appropriate and more aggressive treatment for these high-risk patients.&#xD;
