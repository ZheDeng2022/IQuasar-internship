  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The biology of prostate cancer is associated with changes in genes and metabolites within&#xD;
      prostate tissue. There is robust evidence to suggest that a diet rich in broccoli can prevent&#xD;
      or retard the development of prostate cancer by influencing these changes. This is likely to&#xD;
      be due to a natural chemical that is obtained in these vegetables known as sulforaphane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we are seeking to provide further evidence that a diet rich in broccoli may&#xD;
      prevent prostate cancer from developing, and to understand how this may happen. We propose to&#xD;
      undertake a human intervention study to test the hypothesis that a broccoli-rich diet can&#xD;
      alter the metabolism and gene expression within prostate tissue of men under active&#xD;
      surveillance in a manner that would reduce the probability of the emergence and progression&#xD;
      of aggressive cancerous clones. Participants recruited onto this study will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to one of three dietary groups in which they will be required to consume one&#xD;
      portion per week of a broccoli soup delivering a different concentration of sulforaphane.&#xD;
      This will be part of their normal diet for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine and prostate biopsy tissue will be obtained before and after a 12 month&#xD;
      intervention period. Prostate biopsies will be obtained either though transperineal template&#xD;
      biopsies, a technique accepted as best clinical practice because it provides better sampling&#xD;
      of the prostate, or transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy which is currently the standard of&#xD;
      care for obtaining biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been funded by Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)&#xD;
      and Prostate Cancer foundation (PCF).&#xD;

      The study is a randomised double-blinded dietary intervention study. The study population&#xD;
      will consist of smoking and non-smoking men aged between 18 and 80 years old. Participants&#xD;
      recruited into this study will be randomly placed into one of three dietary groups in which&#xD;
      they will be required to consume one portion of broccoli soup per week, delivering a&#xD;
      different level of glucoraphanin (sulforaphane precursor), as part of their normal diet for&#xD;
      one year. The three types of soup will contain (i)standard broccoli,&#xD;
      (ii)glucoraphanin-enriched broccoli (Beneforte®), or (iii)Beneforte extra. Beneforte and&#xD;
      Beneforte extra broccoli are especially cultivated to deliver high sulforaphane levels after&#xD;
      consumption. All the three broccoli varieties have the same appearance and flavour thus&#xD;
      enabling a blinded human intervention study to be undertaken. Broccoli soups will be&#xD;
      manufactured by a food company that supplies soups to the leading supermarket retailers in&#xD;
      the United Kingdom. In order to assess the habitual diet of the participants, they will be&#xD;
      asked to keep three 7-day diet diaries, one pre-intervention, after 6-months and another one&#xD;
      week before the end of their intervention. Considering the effect of exercise on whole body&#xD;
      metabolism we will also obtain information on the physical activity of study participants.&#xD;
      They will be asked to complete a validated physical activity questionnaire together with the&#xD;
      diet diary (i.e before starting the study diet then at 6 and 12 months). Twenty six&#xD;
      participants will be recruited to each of the broccoli groups. The participants will be&#xD;
      characterised as having a low or intermediate risk of developing prostate cancer and will be&#xD;
      undergoing active surveillance. A number of physiological tests will be performed on the&#xD;
      participants before they start the dietary intervention (baseline) and after their 12 months&#xD;
      on the intervention. The study will involve collection of prostate biopsies, blood and urine&#xD;
      samples at baseline and after a 12 month dietary intervention. Prostate biopsies will be&#xD;
      obtained through transperineal template biopsy (TPB) where possible or standard transrectal&#xD;
      ultrasound scan guided biopsy (TRUS biopsy). TPB is a clinical procedure carried out under a&#xD;
      general or regional anaesthetic which gives more detailed information about the position,&#xD;
      amount and aggressiveness of the cancer within the prostate than other standard techniques.&#xD;
      However, patients who do not wish to undergo TPB can alternatively choose the standard TRUS&#xD;
      biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the trial participants will be asked to give written consent if they wish to&#xD;
      continue the diet for a further 12 months. Consenting patients will thereafter be required to&#xD;
      eat one portion of broccoli soup per week for 12-months. We will not ask participants to&#xD;
      attend extra hospital visits for the purpose of the study or give additional biological&#xD;
      samples; instead we will capture clinical data related to their follow up of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the dropout rate for this study will be approximately 25% due to the&#xD;
      clinical progression of prostate cancer within the 12-month study period. In the event of&#xD;
      clinical progression the volunteer will discontinue the intervention, receive advice from the&#xD;
      urologist in charge and in case of prostatectomy will be asked to donate part of their&#xD;
      prostate gland for research purposes.&#xD;
