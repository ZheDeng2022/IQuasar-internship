    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2 study of paclitaxel plus demcizumab in subjects with platinum resistant&#xD;
      ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1b portion was completed; Phase 2 portion was not initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must not have received prior weekly paclitaxel or more than 3 prior chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimens in the Phase 1b portion of the study and more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens in&#xD;
      the Phase 2 portion of the study. Prior to enrollment, subjects will undergo screening to&#xD;
      determine study eligibility. In the Phase 1b portion of study, 3 subjects will be treated at&#xD;
      each dose level if no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed. If 1 of 3 subjects&#xD;
      experiences a DLT, that dose level will be expanded to 6 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 2 or more subjects experience a DLT, no further subjects will be dosed at that level and 3&#xD;
      additional subjects will be added to the preceding dose cohort unless 6 subjects have already&#xD;
      been treated at that dose level. Subjects will be assessed for DLTs from Days 0-28. Dose&#xD;
      escalation for newly enrolled subjects, if appropriate, will occur after all subjects in a&#xD;
      cohort have completed their Day 28 DLT assessment. After the final patient in the Phase 1b&#xD;
      portion of the trial has completed their Day 28 DLT assessment, 50 subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the Phase 2 portion of the study and treated with demcizumab at the highest dose level&#xD;
      that had &lt; 2 DLTs in the 6 subjects.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must have cytologically or histologically confirmed ovarian, primary&#xD;
             peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.. In addition, subjects must have a tumor that is&#xD;
             at least 1 cm in a single dimension and is radiographically apparent on CT, PET-CT or&#xD;
             MRI (i.e., RECIST version 1.1 measurable disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must have platinum resistant disease (i.e., which is defined as disease&#xD;
             progression in less than 6 months after receiving a minimum of 4 cycles of a platinum&#xD;
             containing regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: Serous&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated&#xD;
             carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, transitional cell&#xD;
             carcinoma, malignant Brenner's Tumor, or adenocarcinoma N.O.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age &gt;21 years&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects receiving any other investigational medicinal product or anti-cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior therapy with weekly paclitaxel for recurrent disease (administration of weekly&#xD;
             paclitaxel as part of an upfront treatment strategy is acceptable as long as the&#xD;
             patient had not progressed while receiving weekly paclitaxel or recurred within 4&#xD;
             months of receiving weekly paclitaxel)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Non-epithelial ovarian carcinoma, including malignant mixed Mullerian tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For the Phase 1b portion of the study, more than 3 prior chemotherapy regimens and for&#xD;
             the Phase 2 portion of the study more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. Maintenance&#xD;
             therapy following induction chemotherapy does not count as a separate regimen. In&#xD;
             addition, hormonal therapy (e.g., tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor) does not count&#xD;
             as a separate regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Prior radiotherapy to the pelvis or abdomen&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects receiving heparin, warfarin, or other similar anticoagulants. Note: Subjects&#xD;
