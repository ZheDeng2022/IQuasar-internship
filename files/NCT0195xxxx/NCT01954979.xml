  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The participant is invited to take part in this study because they have chronic Graft versus&#xD;
      Host Disease (cGVHD) that is not responding to standard treatment with steroids. This&#xD;
      research study is a way of gaining new knowledge about the treatment of patients with cGVHD.&#xD;
      This research study is evaluating a drug called abatacept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abatacept is a drug that alters and suppresses the immune system. Abatacept is approved by&#xD;
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of moderate to severe active&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis in adults and of severe juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in patients&#xD;
      who have failed prior therapy with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These are&#xD;
      autoimmune conditions, ie caused by an overactive immune system that attacks normal tissues&#xD;
      and organs. It is currently being tested in a variety of other autoimmune conditions. In this&#xD;
      case it is considered experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      cGVHD is caused by the donor cells attacking various organs of the recipient. The&#xD;
      investigators try to minimize this immune attack by using corticosteroids such as prednisone.&#xD;
      In severe cases prednisone is not sufficient and other immunosuppressive medications are used&#xD;
      in addition in order to more efficiently control cGVHD and to limit the dose and consequently&#xD;
      the multiple side-effects of corticosteroids. This study is being done to determine if the&#xD;
      use of abatacept is safe in patients with cGVHD and if it can facilitate a better control of&#xD;
      cGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study the participants will be evaluated for side effects from the treatment with&#xD;
      abatacept, and for response of the cGVHD to the treatment. There will be two groups of&#xD;
      participants in the study. The first group will be treated at a relatively low dose of&#xD;
      abatacept. If this is found to be safe then the second group will be treated at a higher&#xD;
      dose. Three to four tablespoons of blood will be drawn at every 2 week visit in order to&#xD;
      determine your blood counts, kidney and liver function. Some of the blood will be used in a&#xD;
      research lab in order to study measures of your immune system and how they might be affected&#xD;
      by the treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Before the research starts (screening): After signing the consent form, the participant will&#xD;
      be asked to undergo some screening tests or procedures to find out if they can be in the&#xD;
      research study. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cGVHD&#xD;
      care and may be done even if it turns out that the participant does not take part in the&#xD;
      research study. If the participant has had some of these tests or procedures recently, they&#xD;
      may or may not have to be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete Medical History and Physical Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Collection: 3-4 tablespoons of blood will be drawn to measure the participants&#xD;
           complete blood counts, kidney, liver and thyroid function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease Assessment: Depending on what organs are affected by their cGVHD the participant&#xD;
           may undergo blood tests or a skin exam or an eye exam or a dental exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG): a noninvasive test that measures the electrical activity of the&#xD;
           participant's heart&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A tuberculin skin test and a quantiferon blood test to rule out tuberculosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy testing if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV and Hepatitis blood test: 2-3 teaspoons of blood will be collected to perform an HIV&#xD;
           test. The participant will be asked to sign a separate consent form for this test. The&#xD;
           participant's doctor will discuss the results of this test with the participant and the&#xD;
           results will become a part of their permanent medical record. The participant may seek&#xD;
           private HIV testing prior to consenting, and based on the results may choose whether or&#xD;
           not to participate in this study or have the HIV test become part of their medical&#xD;
           records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If these tests show that the participant is eligible to participate in the research study,&#xD;
      the participant will begin the study treatment. If the participant does not meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, the participant will not be able to participate in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional research procedures to be performed at the time of screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Research blood testing: to study measures of the participant's immune system&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening procedures confirm that the participant is eligible to participate in the&#xD;
      research study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Since the investigators are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be&#xD;
           administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that&#xD;
           have abatacept, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the&#xD;
           same dose of the study drug. The dose the participant gets will depend on the number of&#xD;
           participants who have been enrolled in the study before the participant and how well&#xD;
           they have tolerated their doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The total duration of treatment on this study is approximately 113 days or 6 treatments.&#xD;
           Doses 1-3 will be administered every two weeks. One month following Dose 3, abatacept&#xD;
           will be administered every four weeks for the remaining three doses (Doses 4-6.) The&#xD;
           treatment will be given intravenously on these days. One month following your last dose&#xD;
           of treatment, the participant will be seen in clinic. The participant will be seen in&#xD;
           the clinic weekly through dose 4, then every 2 weeks for follow up even if the&#xD;
           participant doesn't have treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first group of participants will be treated with a lower dose of abatacept. If this&#xD;
           dose is determined to be safe then the second group will be treated at a higher dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment the participant will be seen in the clinic every two weeks. At every visit&#xD;
      the following will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete Medical History and Physical Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Collection: 3-4 tablespoons of blood will be drawn to measure their complete blood&#xD;
           counts, kidney, liver and thyroid function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research blood testing: to study measures of the participant's immune system&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the days of treatment the participant will undergo an assessment of cGVHD depending&#xD;
           on what organs are affected&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the final dose of the study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the participant has completed taking the drug on the study, the following procedures&#xD;
      and tests will take place:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety assessment 28 days after the last dose of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete Medical History and Physical Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Collection: 3-4 tablespoons of blood will be drawn to measure the participant's&#xD;
           complete blood counts, kidney, liver and thyroid function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease Assessment: by physical exam and blood tests if the participant has leukemia or&#xD;
           multiple myeloma, or physical exam and PET/CT or CT scan if the participant has&#xD;
           lymphoma. These will be done at the safety assessment visit and at the 3 and 6 month&#xD;
           follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research blood testing: to study measures of your immune system&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the participant has completed treatment on study they will be followed monthly for&#xD;
           6 months&#xD;
