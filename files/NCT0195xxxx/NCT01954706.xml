      Hormone receptor-positive tumors are the most common breast cancers in postmenopausal women,&#xD;
      and drug therapies, which block the production or effects of estrogen, are the mainstay of&#xD;
      treatment in these patients. Due to their effectiveness in postmenopausal women, aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors (AIs) are the standard of care for long-term estrogen suppression in these&#xD;
      patients. Estrogen deficiency, however, results in multiple side effects. Some of the most&#xD;
      common side effects in women taking AIs are joint and muscle aches, which promote physical&#xD;
      deconditioning. Because of the long term use of AIs in postmenopausal breast cancer patients&#xD;
      and the improvements in cancer-related outcomes that are observed with their use, identifying&#xD;
      methods to reduce these side effects to maintain adherence to treatment is important.&#xD;
      Exercise interventions in breast cancer patients also improve quality of life and reduce&#xD;
      fatigue. Understanding the role of exercise in AI side effect prevention will allow us to&#xD;
      translate these findings into therapy guidelines.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women in the United States and is the second&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer deaths. In 2013, an estimated 230,000 women in the United States will&#xD;
      be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and approximately 40,000 with die.1 Women with&#xD;
      breast cancer frequently experience significant functional and metabolic declines during and&#xD;
      after treatment due to cancer-related fatigue (CRF), stress and depression.2,3 Cancer-related&#xD;
      fatigue is associated with side effects from treatment, pain, functional disability, sleep&#xD;
      disturbances, mood disturbances and co-morbid conditions.4 Patients with CRF have declines in&#xD;
      physical activity and function, which significantly impacts quality of life (QOL).5 The&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying functional declines and fatigue in breast cancer patients are likely&#xD;
      multifactorial, but deconditioning, sarcopenia, increases in inflammatory cytokines, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, and changes in muscle and fat metabolism seem to play important roles.4,6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormone receptor-positive tumors are the most common breast cancers in postmenopausal women,&#xD;
      and endocrine therapies, which block the production or effects of estrogen, are the mainstay&#xD;
      of treatment in these patients. Due to their superior efficacy in postmenopausal women,&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the standard of care for long-term estrogen suppression in&#xD;
      these patients.7 Estrogen deprivation, however, results in multiple side effects which may&#xD;
      worsen fatigue and the functional and metabolic declines associated with cancer treatment.8&#xD;
      Some of the most common side effects in women taking AIs are musculoskeletal symptoms,&#xD;
      including arthralgias and myalgias, which promote deconditioning and sarcopenia and their&#xD;
      associated side effects.9 Because of the prolonged use of AIs in postmenopausal breast cancer&#xD;
      patients and the improvements in cancer-related outcomes that are observed with their use,&#xD;
      great efforts are taken to reduce AI induced musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS) to maintain&#xD;
      adherence to treatment. While multiple strategies are used to manage AIMSS, current therapies&#xD;
      mainly focus on interventions in patients who develop symptoms (tertiary prevention) rather&#xD;
      than primary prevention.9 Exercise interventions in breast cancer patients also improve QOL,&#xD;
      decrease fatigue, and increase physical function and strength.10,11 Understanding the role of&#xD;
      exercise in AI side effect prevention will allow us to translate these findings into therapy&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
