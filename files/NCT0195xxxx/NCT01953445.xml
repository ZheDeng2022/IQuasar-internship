  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of paclitaxel combined with phosphoinositide 3-kinase&#xD;
      (PI3K) inhibitor BKM120 in patients with stage II or III breast cancer that is described as&#xD;
      estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative and endocrine&#xD;
      therapy resistant. Drugs such as paclitaxel stop the growth of tumors by blocking cancer cell&#xD;
      division. PI3K inhibitor BKM120 inhibits some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and may&#xD;
      improve the response of endocrine resistant tumors to treatment. Giving paclitaxel and PI3K&#xD;
      inhibitor BKM120 before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal&#xD;
      tissue that needs to be removed.&#xD;
