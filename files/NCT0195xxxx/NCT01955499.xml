    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide and ibrutinib in&#xD;
      treating patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned or not responded to&#xD;
      treatment. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in&#xD;
      different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving lenalidomide with&#xD;
      ibrutinib may work better in treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma than giving either drug alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the&#xD;
      combination of lenalidomide and ibrutinib in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of the combination of lenalidomide&#xD;
      and ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the overall objective response rate to the combination of lenalidomide and&#xD;
      ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the response duration and two-year progression free survival (PFS) in&#xD;
      patients with B-cell NHL receiving lenalidomide and ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of the combination of lenalidomide and ibrutinib in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To identify associations of genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes,&#xD;
      transporters or target genes with pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To monitor the effects of combined therapy with ibrutinib and lenalidomide on B- T-, and&#xD;
      natural killer (NK)-cell subsets by flow cytometry and quantitative immunoglobulin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To explore the effects of the combination of ibrutinib and lenalidomide on&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic markers including T helper cell, type 1 (TH1) and T helper cell, type 2 (TH2)&#xD;
      cytokines, ex vivo NK cell cytotoxicity, serum micro ribonucleic acids (RNAs), plasma&#xD;
      metabolites, and levels of Bruton's tyrosine kinase occupancy and other selected kinases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To explore the relationship between pretreatment pathologic prognostic features and&#xD;
      overall objective response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 and ibrutinib PO on days 1-28 (days&#xD;
      2-28 of cycle 1). Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 6&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
