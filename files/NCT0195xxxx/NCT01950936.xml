      Title: Pro-to-COLD, Procalcitonin to Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease,&#xD;
&#xD;
      COLD: Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, Regarding: Patients hospitalized with suspected acute&#xD;
      exacerbation of COPD + / - pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Patients with COPD exacerbation often get antibiotics. There is considerable&#xD;
      criticism of this, many of these patients are not bacterially infected and the antibiotics&#xD;
      overconsumption can lead to resistance development and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose: To show that one can reduce the consumption of antibiotics among patients&#xD;
      hospitalized for worsening of COPD disease in a population of Danish COPD patients by giving&#xD;
      antibiotics depending on the value of the biomarker procalcitonin measured in the blood. A&#xD;
      sub-objective is a validation study of mini VIDAS ® / Biomérieux equipment to the current&#xD;
      gold standard in measuring procalcitonin, Kryptor/ BRAHMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: All patients with confirmed/suspected COPD admitted with COPD exacerbation to the&#xD;
      Acute Admissions Unit/ Pulmonary dept. in weekdays. Participants must be adults and be of age&#xD;
      and there must be a signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: 1) Controlled (Quasi-randomized): Even and uneven (concealed) digit of patient´s&#xD;
      danish personal identification number, not last digit (gender-fixed) (CPR-number). Even =&#xD;
      procalcitonin-guided, Uneven = Control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Collect and analyze procalcitonin (PCT)-samples of patients in the PCT group at admission&#xD;
      and then every 2 day. Samples analyzed throughout the week: Vital Status looked up 28 days&#xD;
      after inclusion. Create a biobank in the study consisting of blood à 8 ml up to a maximum of&#xD;
      4 times taken for PCT measurements, the subsequent validation study of MiniVIDAS ®. Biobank&#xD;
      destroyed 15 years after the completed project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample size / Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A total of 120 patients (please see the basis for this estimate of the Protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analyze:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Antibiotics stopped on day 5 B) Defined Daily Doses Reads aloud, 1) narrow spectrum, 2)&#xD;
      broad spectrum, and 3) a total of the two groups between the (Mann-Whitney U test) C)&#xD;
      Hospitalization within 28 days after the first hospitalization the year - the two groups&#xD;
      between (Mann-Whitney U test). Doctor Jens-Ulrik Jensen stands for analyzes. Statistics&#xD;
      program &quot;SAS v. 9.1.3&quot; is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economics: The study funded by the participating departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responsibility: The study was conceived and run by doctors in Pulmonary Medicine Department&#xD;
      and Department of Clinical Pharmacology, both Bispebjerg Hospital and Department of Clinical&#xD;
      Microbiology, Hvidovre Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Science Ethics: There has been a thorough research ethics discussion of the project in the&#xD;
      project with emphasis on an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages that might be for&#xD;
      the participating patients and society as a whole now and in the future. Conclusions A and B&#xD;
      of this discussion is summarized as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Advantages and Disadvantages: The treating physician has at any time the opportunity to&#xD;
      start / continue antibiotic behandlling for the overall assessment whether PCT value. In&#xD;
      addition, in the past, in large studies with a total of&gt; 2000 patients, demonstrated that&#xD;
      there are drawbacks to the use of antibiotics depending on a displayed value of PCT in&#xD;
      patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of COPD. Mortality and hospitalization will be&#xD;
      monitored in this study. However, there may occur side effects to blood sampling, usually&#xD;
      transient ecchymosis blood sampling site. If the strategy results in a reduced consumption of&#xD;
      antibiotics, it is expected that the incidence of antibiotic-associated adverse events&#xD;
      decreased - this for the benefit of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Usefulness for society: Based on the results from this study will be a high degree of&#xD;
      certainty to conclude whether this new treatment strategy can provide benefits for future&#xD;
      patients in the form of reduced antibiotic consumption, less antibiotic associated adverse&#xD;
      events, reduced resistance development / selection among bacteria and overall lower economic&#xD;
      costs. Based on these considerations, believes the project, the project can be carried out&#xD;
      with respect for the participating subjects to integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantity: It is expected to be included 120 patients in this scientific study. Database: data&#xD;
      (case report forms) stored in archive of Pulmonary Medicine Department for 15 years. Create a&#xD;
      database with the information. Personally identifiable data will only be present in the&#xD;
      clinical hospital. During the completion of the experiment can provide essential health&#xD;
      information about the subject's state of health. This will the subject be informed, unless&#xD;
      clearly opted out of this on the consent form. The project reported to the Data Protection&#xD;
      Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level: With blood sample (8 mL) on day 1 and then every 2 days in the intervention group (the&#xD;
      &quot;active group&quot;), this part of routine blood sampling. At discharge stops blood and the&#xD;
      patient should not attend the blood after discharge.&#xD;
