    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to study two types of physical activities as&#xD;
      add-on treatment, compared to treatment as usual for traumatised refugees. Hereby, the study&#xD;
      will examine the evidence of an often-used treatment modality in a field where very little&#xD;
      research yet has been conducted.&#xD;

      About the clinic: The study will be carried out at the Competence Centre for Transcultural&#xD;
      Psychiatry Denmark (CTP) (before January 2013 named Psychiatric Trauma Clinic for Refugees&#xD;
      (PTF)). The clinic was established in 2008 and since 2009 the clinic has been carrying out&#xD;
      randomised, controlled trials aiming to increase knowledge about the treatment effect of&#xD;
      different types of treatment for traumatised refugees. The target group of the centre is&#xD;
      traumatised refugees with PTSD, depression and anxiety. Patients are referred to CTP by&#xD;
      general practitioners or psychiatrists. CTP treats approximately 200 patients/year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is inter-disciplinary and consists of consultations with a medical doctor&#xD;
      whereby pharmacological treatment according to best practice in the field is given,&#xD;
      supplemented by cognitive behavioural therapy by a psychologist. Manuals are used for both&#xD;
      the treatment given by the medical doctor as well as the psychologist. The total duration of&#xD;
      treatment is 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: 310 patients will be included from September 2013 to approximately May&#xD;
      2015. At the referral interview it is clarified whether the patient meets the inclusion or&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. If the patient meets the inclusion criteria and gives her/his consent to&#xD;
      participate, the patient is randomised to one of the three intervention groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Control group: receives treatment as usual (TAU) consisting of: 6 months of consultations&#xD;
      and medical treatment according to best clinical practice by a medical doctor as well as&#xD;
      manual-based Cognitive Behaviour Therapy by a psychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Basic Body Awareness Therapy (BBAT): TAU + BBAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Mixed physical activity (MPA): TAU + MPA&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of B and C is 20 weeks each, 1 hour/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical activity will be on individual sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality assurance plan: Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is monitoring and auditing the&#xD;
           project from the project's start to its end. Moreover, The Competence Centre for&#xD;
           Transcultural Psychiatry (CTP) has a monitoring team monitoring the data being&#xD;
           registered as data are coming in.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data checks: GCP as well as the before mentioned monitoring team will be doing data&#xD;
           checks and auditing during the time the trial is running.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Source data verification: to assess the accuracy, completeness and representativity of&#xD;
           registry data, the monitoring team of CTP is during the trial comparing the data&#xD;
           registered manually by doctors, psychologists, physiotherapist and social workers with&#xD;
           e.g. the papers filled in by the patients themselves. Data registered from the patients&#xD;
           in the trial are also registered from the patients that are not participating in the&#xD;
           trial. By comparing those data, this will show the representativity of the data from&#xD;
           this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard Operating Procedures: All adverse events will be registered in the individual&#xD;
           patient records in the period from the first consultation at the centre to the last&#xD;
           consultation at the centre of each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be reported by sponsor or investigator to The National&#xD;
      Committee on Health Research Ethics (within 7 days after investigator has become aware of any&#xD;
      such), with comments enclosed on potential consequences for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sponsor will yearly submit a report to The National Committee on Health Research Ethics on&#xD;
      all SAEs, with an assessment attached on the security of the patients participating in the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The report will be submitted each year on the day when the trial was given approval from The&#xD;
      National Committee on Health Research Ethics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A list of all patients screened for participating in the trial and of all patients finally&#xD;
      included in the trial will be kept.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data dictionary: not relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomisation is carried out by the Department of Biostatistics at the University of&#xD;
           Copenhagen, with practical assistance from a group of secretaries not linked to the&#xD;
           daily work at CTP. The participants will be stratified by gender and severity of PTSD&#xD;
           symptoms on the basis of Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). Blinding of patients and&#xD;
           practitioners is not considered to be possible, but intervention-group blinded Hamilton&#xD;
           Depression and Anxiety ratings will be carried out at the beginning and at the end of&#xD;
           treatment. The Hamilton raters are medical students trained at the clinic and take part&#xD;
           in regular joint ratings to ensure high quality and inter-rater reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data processing/statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Size of material and power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 200 patients are divided into three groups of about 65 patients, power to detect a group&#xD;
      difference in the treatment effect of ½ standard deviation (SD) will be 81%, while power to&#xD;
      detect a difference of 1 SD will be close to 100%. Differences in quantitative outcomes less&#xD;
      than ½ SD between the two treatments are considered to be less relevant from a clinical point&#xD;
      of view. Cut-offs are available for several rating scales, and these can be used to define&#xD;
      categorical outcome variables. If for example the proportions below cut-off for clinical case&#xD;
      status are 50% and 25% in two groups, power will be close to 80% to detect a significant&#xD;
      group differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The primary outcome variables are differences during the treatment course&#xD;
      calculated as differences between start, middle and end ratings. The unadjusted differences&#xD;
      between the two intervention groups can be measured by a t-test, while adjustment of the&#xD;
      differences for baseline values and possible background factors (such as gender and age) can&#xD;
      be done by ANCOVA/linear regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, cut-off can be used on symptom scores and logistic regression analyses can be&#xD;
      carried out with over/under cut-off as binary outcome. In addition to completer analyses,&#xD;
      drop-out analysis and intention-to-treat analyses will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses concerning predictors of treatment effects can be analysed by including the&#xD;
      potential predictors in linear or logistic regression models including treatment group and&#xD;
      relevant covariates.&#xD;
