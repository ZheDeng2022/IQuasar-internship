  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome is one of the most common causes of female infertility. The cause&#xD;
      of infertility in PCOS is unknown. Factors other than anovulation, including inherited or&#xD;
      induced changes in the embryo quality have been suggested. Time-lapse analysis of embryo&#xD;
      development is a sensitive method of detecting reduced embryo viability. Yet, there are no&#xD;
      data regarding the embryo development in PCOS assessed by time-lapse analysis.&#xD;

      Method A consecutive cohort of 249 infertile women attending In vitro fertilization (IVF) or&#xD;
      Intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment at the Fertility Clinic, Arhus University&#xD;
      Hospital was requited from February 2011 to May 2013. During the period, couples undergoing&#xD;
      IVF/ICSI treatment were offered blastocyst culture to day 6 and time-lapse imaging (TLI) as&#xD;
      part of a study evaluating parameters for embryo selection (Kirkegaard et al. 2013). Women&#xD;
      aged &lt; 38 years without endometriosis and with more than &gt; 8 oocytes retrieved were eligible.&#xD;
      Patients were categorized in two groups. Women with regular menstrual cycles and no clinical&#xD;
      signs of PCOS (non-PCOS) and women fulfilling the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for PCOS&#xD;
      detected by the presence of anovulation and polycystic ovaries PCO, which was diagnosed by&#xD;
      luteal-phase progesterone testing and trans-vaginal ultrasound, respectively. Biochemical&#xD;
      parameters of androgen excess were included in the diagnosis when available, , whereas&#xD;
      subjective symptoms of androgen excess (acne, hirsutism, alopecia) were not included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before inclusion.&#xD;
      The Central Denmark Region Committees on Biomedical Research Ethics and the Danish Data&#xD;
      Protection Agency approved the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian stimulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were treated with individual doses of gonadotropin, based on serum AMH and/or antral&#xD;
      follicle count. Patients were stimulated by either a GnRH agonist- or antagonist protocol&#xD;
      using rec-FSH or HMG for stimulation according to clinical guidelines. A dose of 10,000 IU of&#xD;
      hCG was administered when at least 3 follicles measured ≥ 17 mm, and UL guided oocyte&#xD;
      retrieval was conducted 36 h later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oocyte retrieval and ICSI/IVF Ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval were performed&#xD;
      according to standard procedures. After fertilization, ICSI embryos were immediately placed&#xD;
      in the time-lapse incubator (EmbryoScope™). IVF embryos were cultured for approximately 18 h&#xD;
      in a conventional incubator. Before IVF embryos were transferred to the EmbryoScope, adhering&#xD;
      cumulus cells were removed to ensure optimal image acquisition. In the EmbryoScope, all&#xD;
      embryos were cultured until arrest or removal at day 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embryo assessment. All embryos with 2 pronuclei completing the first cleavage were annotated&#xD;
      manually.The following parameters were annotated with time-points: appearance and&#xD;
      disappearance of 1st nucleus and 2nd nucleus after 1st division, 1st - 7th divisions, final&#xD;
      divisions, compaction, morula, early and full expanded blastocyst, start of hatching and&#xD;
      fully hatched blastocyst. All time-points were normalized to first cleavage and treated as&#xD;
      durations for further analysis in order to overcome the limitation of inexact starting&#xD;
      points, and facilitate comparison between IVF and ICSI populations. For the same reason, no&#xD;
      parameters before first cleavage were investigated. Durations of cell cycles and cell stages&#xD;
      were subsequently calculated as the interval between two time-points. Two parameters&#xD;
      (multi-nucleation and direct cleavage to 3-cell stage) were assessed by binary values yes and&#xD;
      no. Embryos were selected for transfer according to conventional measures of morphological&#xD;
      quality on day 6 according to the Gardner criteria (Gardner et al. 2004) . No time-lapse&#xD;
      parameters were used in the selection process. The observer was blinded to the patient's&#xD;
      treatment data and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The influence of PCOS on embryo development was tested in regression models for&#xD;
      clustered data. A covariance regression model was used to account for potential confounding&#xD;
      variables: female age, BMI and fertility treatment. In total, 313 embryos from 43 PCOS women,&#xD;
      and 1080 embryos from 175 non-PCOS women were analyzed.&#xD;
