    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies radiation therapy and cisplatin with or without&#xD;
      surgery in treating patients with stage III-IV oropharyngeal cancer. Radiation therapy uses&#xD;
      high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work&#xD;
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy and cisplatin are more effective with or&#xD;
      without surgery in treating patients with oropharyngeal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if primary treatment with transoral endoscopic head and neck surgery will&#xD;
      improve progression free survival (PFS) for patients with human papilloma virus negative&#xD;
      (HPV-) oropharyngeal cancer (OPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare patterns of failure (local-regional relapse versus distant) and survival&#xD;
      (overall and progression-free).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the safety and efficacy (rate of positive surgical margins) of using&#xD;
      transoral robotic surgery for patients with T3 tumors of the tonsil, tongue-base, or&#xD;
      glossopharyngeal sulcus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare head and neck cancer-specific quality of life (QOL) short-term (&lt; 6 months)&#xD;
      and long-term (2 years) relating to swallowing function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare subjective (patient reported) and objective (physiologic) measures of&#xD;
      swallowing function short-term and long-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess effect of neck dissection on shoulder function using a validated QOL instrument&#xD;
      for patients undergoing neck dissection VI. To assess the correlation of physician derived&#xD;
      clinical target volumes (CTV's) with locoregional control or failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To determine whether specific molecular profiles are associated with overall or&#xD;
      progression-free survival or other clinical endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of pre-treatment computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      scans detecting the presence of lymph node extracapsular extension by examining the&#xD;
      surgically dissected lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo transoral endoscopic head and neck surgery (eHNS). Depending on&#xD;
      post-operative pathology findings, patients may undergo intensity modulated radiation therapy&#xD;
      (IMRT) once daily (QD) five days a week for 6 weeks. High-risk patients also receive&#xD;
      cisplatin intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 during radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo IMRT QD five days a week for 7 weeks. Patients also receive&#xD;
      cisplatin IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 during radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,&#xD;
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;

                  testing is not required for entry into this protocol; the need to exclude&#xD;
                  patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments&#xD;
                  involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive;&#xD;
                  protocol-specific requirements may also exclude immuno-compromised patients&#xD;
