      Study Title:Assessment of Adherence to Guidelines for Thromboprophylaxis in a Tertiary United&#xD;
      Arab Emirates (UAE) hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site: Al Qassimi Hospital, United Arab Emirates&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is assessment of appropriateness of VTE prophylaxis&#xD;
      administered to critically ill and surgical patients for whom pharmacologic treatment is&#xD;
      indicated according to the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) 2012 guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Identify some causes of inadequate VTE prophylaxis in different patient populations, such&#xD;
      as prescribing problems and errors at the level of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Cross sectional retrospective observational study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Approximately 400&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the following criteria will be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients aged 18 and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients admitted to any of the critical care units, or the general or orthopaedic&#xD;
           surgical wards.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients who have been in hospital more than 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Caprini score &gt; 1 (see procedure)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with any of the following criteria will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who have been admitted to a critical care unit and transferred out to a non&#xD;
           surgical unit within 24 hours of admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy for indications other than VTE prophylaxis&#xD;
           or treatment, such as atrial fibrillation and prosthetic heart valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcome Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measure of interest is to determine the proportion of patients who have&#xD;
      received inappropriate or inadequate VTE prophylaxis considering their calculated risk factor&#xD;
      compared to the recommended prophylactic measures for that risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures are to identify whether there is inadequate VTE prophylaxis&#xD;
      because of medication errors such as missed doses or wrong doses given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 4 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Data was entered into Microsoft Excel® and subsequently checked to&#xD;
      ensure accurate data entry and correct any errors. It was subsequently exported into SPSS&#xD;
      version 20 where it will be analysed.Quantitative data such as age was expressed mean (±&#xD;
      standard deviation). Categorical data such as gender, risk factors for bleeding, type of&#xD;
      mechanical and pharmacologic prophylaxis, missed doses and wrong doses were expressed as&#xD;
      number and percentage of population.The student's t-test was used to analyse parametric data.&#xD;
      The Pearson Chi-Square Test and Wilcoxon Rank sum test were used to analyse non parametric&#xD;
      data. Simple and multiple logistic regression analysis was done to identify factors that are&#xD;
      associated with inappropriate VTE prophylaxis. Factors that were included in the analysis&#xD;
      included: age, type of admission (medical or surgical), area of admission (critical care,&#xD;
      general surgery, orthopaedic surgery), Caprini score, and inappropriate VTE prophylaxis as&#xD;
      the outcome. A p-value of less than 0.05 was be considered statistically significant.&#xD;

        The targe sample is paients in critical care wards and orthopaedic surgery patients. All&#xD;
        patients will be screened at discharge. Those who fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
        will go on to have a thromboembolism risk assessment using the CapriniRisk Assessment&#xD;
        Model. Those who have a score &gt; 1 will be included for assessment of their VTE prophylaxis&#xD;
        (from medical records). Approximately 60 patients are admitted into critical care units and&#xD;
        40 general and orthopaedic surgical patients are admitted to the surgical wards per month,&#xD;
        giving a total sample of around 400 patients.&#xD;
