    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) is a highly prevalent condition, often affecting individuals at&#xD;
      the prime of life, causing severe reduction of quality of life and productivity, as well as&#xD;
      social isolation, anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FMS is a condition characterized by chronic widespread pain, considered to be a manifestation&#xD;
      of central nervous system sensitization, leading to increased processing and transmission of&#xD;
      pain. At the same time however, it has become gradually more evident, that FMS is not merely&#xD;
      a pain syndrome. Those patients who suffer from the full-blown clinical syndrome of FMS&#xD;
      inevitably describe many additional symptoms beside pain. While some of these symptoms, such&#xD;
      as heightened sensitivity to external stimulations (e.g. noise and light), can easily be&#xD;
      understood as representing aspects of the basic underlying propensity towards central&#xD;
      sensitization, other symptoms are not so easily explained in this context.&#xD;

      While cognitive impairment has long been recognized as a part of the fibromyalgia syndrome,&#xD;
      as extensively reviewed by Glass, early research on the pathophysiology and clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of this aspect were relatively limited, particularly in the field of imaging.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, physicians dealing with FMS patients are well aware of the fact, that in the&#xD;
      real-life situation, cognitive impairment can often be more devastating for the functional&#xD;
      status of a patient than pain. Not infrequently, a patient may relate that he or she has&#xD;
      grown accustomed to pain and knows how to manage it, but finds it impossible to continue&#xD;
      working or studying because of severe difficulties with memory and concentration. Research&#xD;
      has shown that so called &quot;fibro-fog&quot;, a popular term referring to FMS - related dyscognition,&#xD;
      is ranked by patients as one the most important complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memory impairment appears to constitute an important aspect of the dysfunction typical of&#xD;
      FMS. Characteristic disturbances have been demonstrated in FMS in various memory types,&#xD;
      including semantic memory - the ability to recollect facts and general information and&#xD;
      episodic memory - the ability to recall past events. Attention disturbances have been&#xD;
      demonstrated in FMS as well, such as in working memory - the ability to temporarily hold and&#xD;
      process information in mind, Distraction from target and Selective attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in FMS remains incompletely understood. Various&#xD;
      modulators have been suggested, including sleep disturbances, mood disorders, medications and&#xD;
      the salient symptom of FMS - chronic pain. While cognitive impairment remains after&#xD;
      controlling for anxiety and depression or sleep disturbances, the levels of pain are&#xD;
      consistently correlated with the severity of cognitive dysfunction in FMS. Notably, despite&#xD;
      the clinical significance of cognitive impairment in FMS, and despite the above - mentioned&#xD;
      evidence regarding the various aspects of memory impairment in this condition, the&#xD;
      neuroscience underpinnings of these deficits have not been clearly elucidated; Moreover,&#xD;
      neuroimaging studies demonstrating the interaction between pain and cognitive areas are&#xD;
      strikingly few; One such study has recently demonstrated altered activations in the&#xD;
      fronto-parietal network in FMS patients, while performing the N-back task - a frequently used&#xD;
      working memory task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the new American College of Rheumatology criteria for the diagnosis of FMS have&#xD;
      incorporated cognitive impairment into the diagnostic scheme, as well as establishing a scale&#xD;
      of symptom severity, the interplay between cognitive impairment and the other symptoms is not&#xD;
      clearly understood. Thus, there is no clear data regarding the degree to which cognitive&#xD;
      impairment is correlated with symptoms such as pain, fatigue, abdominal discomfort etc in&#xD;
      individual patients and to what extent a longitudinal relationship is maintained between&#xD;
      these parameters (i.e. to what extent an improvement or worsening of one symptom is&#xD;
      correlated with others). From a practical, clinical view point, assessing the degree of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment in FMS is extremely difficult and currently is usually left (at best) to&#xD;
      the subjective report of the patients. This difficulty is compounded both by the fact that&#xD;
      cognition is but one of a broad array of symptom realms in FMS and by the fact that&#xD;
      clinicians dealing with FMS patients, e.g. rheumatologists, are not regularly involved in the&#xD;
      implementation of cognitive assessment. Thus, there is a clear need for obtaining reliable&#xD;
      and reproducible tools for the assessment of cognitive impairment in FMS. Such tools could be&#xD;
      utilized as an objective biomarker for evaluation the clinical course and response to&#xD;
      treatment as well as a tool for evaluating the interplay between cognitive impairment and&#xD;
      other domains of the fibromyalgia syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed study is to utilize a validated fully computerized cognitive&#xD;
      assessment battery (Mindstreams; NeuroTrax Corp.) for assessing the correlation between&#xD;
      cognitive impairments and clinical, self-reported, severity parameters in fibromyalgia&#xD;
      syndrome. We aim to explore the relationship, if any, between reported subjective parameters,&#xD;
      such as levels of pain, stress, depression and extent of adopting the 'sick-role' of patients&#xD;
      with FMS, with indices of cognitive impairments. We hypothesize that the severity of&#xD;
      subjective stress, rather than medical/clinical parameters of the syndrome, will be&#xD;
      correlated positively with cognitive impairments.&#xD;
