  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the remarkable achievements in neonatal survival of preterm infants with very low&#xD;
      birth weight (VLBW, birth weight &lt; 1,500 g) over the past three decades, improvements have&#xD;
      produced little change in their prevalence of severe developmental disability and the rate of&#xD;
      low severity dysfunctions (e.g., learning disabilities, low IQ, attention-deficit&#xD;
      hyperactivity disorder, specific neuropsychological deficits, poor perceptual-motor skills&#xD;
      and internalizing behavioral problems) remains high as 50% to 70%. Few intervention programs&#xD;
      developed for preterm infants in Western societies were shown to have short- to long-term&#xD;
      benefits in certain cognitive functions, however, rare studies have investigated intervention&#xD;
      effect at school age and explored plausible neurological pathway for effective intervention.&#xD;
      This three-year study was therefore aimed to extend our previous research to longitudinally&#xD;
      examine the effectiveness of three intervention programs (clinic-based intervention program&#xD;
      [CBIP], home-based intervention program [HBIP] and usual care program [UCP]) for VLBW preterm&#xD;
      children in Taiwan at seven years of age.(The intervention had been delivered from birth to&#xD;
      one year of corrected age in the previous study. The intervention will not be given in this&#xD;
      study.)The CBIP and HBIP contained similar child- and parent-focused services as well as&#xD;
      interaction activities but were respectively delivered at the clinic for the CBIP and at home&#xD;
      for the HBIP. A total of 178 VLBW preterm infants had been randomly assigned to the CBIP,&#xD;
      HBIP or UCP. Sixty-two gender and maternal education level matched term children with normal&#xD;
      birth weight had also been included to serve as the reference group for comparison of&#xD;
      developmental outcomes. Effectiveness examined included child and parent outcomes. The&#xD;
      long-term effect of the early intervention for preterm children would provide important&#xD;
      information to help medical professionals and public policy makers to develop an effective&#xD;
      intervention for Taiwanese preterm children who are at risk of developmental disorders.&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was to extend our previous research to longitudinally examine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      three intervention programs (CBIP, HBIP and UCP) for VLBW preterm children in Taiwan at seven&#xD;
      years of age. Gender and maternal education level matched term children were also included to&#xD;
      serve as the reference group for comparison of developmental outcomes. The intervention had&#xD;
      been delivered from birth to one year of corrected age in the previous study. Effectiveness&#xD;
      examined including children's and parental outcomes. Primary outcome referred to measures of&#xD;
      child neurobehavioral functions. Neurobehavioral assessment included cognitive, motor and&#xD;
      behavioral measurement. Secondary outcomes referred to child growth and health,&#xD;
      neurophysiological functions, and the quality of parenting measures. Neurophysiological&#xD;
      assessment referred to electroencephalogram/event-related potential examinations that were&#xD;
      used to investigate the neurological pathways underlying the effective intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and seventy-eight VLBW preterm children and 62 term children who had participated&#xD;
      in our previous study were enrolled in this study. VLBW preterm children were born or&#xD;
      admitted at the National Taiwan University Hospital, the Mackay Memorial Hospital and Taipei&#xD;
      City Hospital, Branch for Women and Children in Taipei, Taiwan, during the time period of&#xD;
      2006 to 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While age seven is an important time period that children enter elementary school and begin&#xD;
      to participate in school activities, more comprehensive outcome measurements are required.&#xD;
      The World Health Organization emphasizes that health conditions should be considered from the&#xD;
      body, individuals and societal perspectives as depicted in the International Classification&#xD;
      of Functioning, Disability and Health model. Accordingly, the outcome measures in this study&#xD;
      consisted of the primary (i.e., child neurobehavioral functions) and secondary outcomes&#xD;
      (i.e., child growth and health, neurophysiological functions, and quality of parenting).&#xD;
      Child neurobehavioral assessment included measurements of cognitive, motor, and behavior&#xD;
      function. The domains of cognitive functions examined including the intelligence (IQ test),&#xD;
      the efficiency of attention control (sustained attention test), and the cognitive flexibility&#xD;
      and planning (executive function test). The motor function included motor skill acquisition&#xD;
      and coordination. Children's behavior was measured using the parental report of child&#xD;
      behavior and teacher's observation for child's adaptive behavior in the school context.&#xD;
      Children's educational resources (special education or resource class) or other&#xD;
      education-related support received from any institution would also be recorded in this study.&#xD;
      Child neurophysiological functions were measured by the electroencephalogram&#xD;
      (EEG)/event-related potential (ERP) technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All families were contacted via phone call and mail to be enrolled in this study. Children&#xD;
      and their parents would have been examined for the following outcomes when the children&#xD;
      approached at seven years of age. All measures except for the neurophysiological measures&#xD;
      were conducted at Infant Motor Development Laboratory, School of Physical Therapy, National&#xD;
      Taiwan University. Several examiners with the background knowledge of physical therapy or&#xD;
      psychology received training with the testing instruments and procedures. Before commencing&#xD;
      the study assessments, the interrater reliability (agreement with an experienced investigator&#xD;
      &gt; 0.80) would have been required for the assessors. All the examiners were kept blind to&#xD;
      children's group assignment. To decrease the fatigue in children due to the prolonged&#xD;
      examination, participants were asked to return twice for assessment.The first assessment&#xD;
      would have taken 180 minutes which consisted of the IQ test, sustained attention test, and&#xD;
      executive function test that the whole session.The second assessment was the&#xD;
      neurophysiological measurement with the EEG/ERP tasks which would have taken 90 minutes.&#xD;
