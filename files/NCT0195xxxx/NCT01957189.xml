      This will be an open-label, three-period, fixed-sequence study to evaluate the drug-drug&#xD;
      interaction, pharmacokinetics and safety of dutasteride and tamsulosin when administered&#xD;
      alone and in-combination in Chinese healthy male volunteers. The study will last&#xD;
      approximately eleven weeks. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be taken at&#xD;
      pre-specified times. Safety will be assessed by measurement of concurrent medication,changes&#xD;
      in clinical laboratory values, ECG, vital signs, and collection of adverse&#xD;
      events.Approximately 24 healthy adult males will be enrolled such that approximately 18&#xD;
      subjects complete dosing and critical assessments.This will be an open label, single&#xD;
      sequence, three-period study. Approximately 24 healthy male volunteers will be enrolled. At&#xD;
      the first study period, the subjects will receive 0.5mg of dutasteride (Dut) as a single dose&#xD;
      (SD) under fed conditions. Serum sampling will take place pre-dose and over the next 72 hours&#xD;
      post dose (Per. A). After a 28-30 days washout, the subjects will be brought in and be given&#xD;
      0.2mg tamsulosin as Harnal D tablet for 7 days with the morning meal. Serum sampling for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin will take place at day 1, day 2 and day 3 pre-dose and at days&#xD;
      4 for 24 hours (Per. B). On the next day (Day 5), the subjects will be given both 0.2mg&#xD;
      tamsulosin Harnal D tablet and 0.5mg of dutasteride. Serum sampling will take place at Day 5&#xD;
      pre-dose and followed for 72 hours (Per. C) for both dutasteride and tamsulosin. Subjects&#xD;
      will participate in a follow-up visit approximately 2 weeks after the last dose of study&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
