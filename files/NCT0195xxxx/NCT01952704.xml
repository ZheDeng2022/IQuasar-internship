  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aerobic exercise holds a multitude of health benefits. Studies in mice have shown that&#xD;
      aerobic exercise improves memory, and increases the volume of the hippocampus, the brain's&#xD;
      primary memory center. Only two studies have been conducted in humans, one in healthy elders,&#xD;
      and the other in a schizophrenia population. So far, there has never been an aerobic exercise&#xD;
      trial in traumatic brain injury (TBI) to look at hippocampal volume and memory as outcomes of&#xD;
      interest. The proposed project is a randomized controlled trial of aerobic exercise in&#xD;
      persons with TBI. We will conduct a 12-week (36 sessions) program of aerobic exercise&#xD;
      (stationary cycling), versus a control condition of non-aerobic exercise (stretching), in&#xD;
      memory-impaired TBI patients to a) increase hippocampal volume and b) improve memory.&#xD;
      Importantly, we also expect benefits of aerobic exercise on the level of brain function.&#xD;
      Specifically, we will look at 'functional connectivity,' which refers to how efficiently&#xD;
      remote regions of the brain 'talk' to each other. TBI is an ideal population to benefit from&#xD;
      aerobic exercise, given the young age at which many individuals sustain TBI, which allows for&#xD;
      benefits of aerobic exercise to be maximally realized in a population with sufficient&#xD;
      neurofunctional reserve. The expected benefits of aerobic exercise (increased hippocampal&#xD;
      volume, improved memory) from this intervention stand to have a meaningful impact on people&#xD;
      with TBI, including improved health, productivity, independence, and quality of life. And,&#xD;
      unlike current treatments for memory impairment (e.g., pharmacological agents, cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation), aerobic exercise is a cost-effective, all natural, readily-available&#xD;
      treatment for memory problems.&#xD;
