  <brief_title>A Study to Evaluate How Tamsulosin (at 1 Dose) and Solifenacin (at 2 Different Doses) Are Taken up From the Intestine, Distributed Through the Body and Eliminated From the Body When Administered in Combination as a Single Tablet (Called EC905)</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Open-label, Randomized, Two-way Crossover, Multiple Dose Study to Evaluate the Steady State Pharmacokinetics of the Two Final Combination Tablet Formulations (EC905; Tamsulosin HCl/ Solifenacin Succinate; 0.4 mg/6 mg and 0.4 mg/9 mg) in Healthy Male Volunteers Over 45 Years of Age</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tamsulosin (sold under the name Omnic OCAS) is used for treatment of voiding complaints&#xD;
      related to an enlarged prostate. Solifenacin (sold under the name Vesicare) is used for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients suffering from problems related to overactive bladder, such as needing&#xD;
      to go to the toilet frequently and often having a sudden urgent need to go to the toilet.&#xD;
      Certain patients with an enlarged prostate have complaints that may benefit from a&#xD;
      combination of tamsulosin and solifenacin. EC905 is a single tablet containing both&#xD;
      tamsulosin and solifenacin. The current study aims at investigating how tamsulosin and&#xD;
      solifenacin are taken up from the intestine, distributed through the body and eventually&#xD;
      eliminated from the body when taken as a single EC905 tablet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study there are two sequence groups with 27 subjects in total. In Period 1, subjects&#xD;
      are randomized to receive one of the two final combination tablet formulations of tamsulosin&#xD;
      HCl and solifenacin succinate. In Period 1, 13 subjects receive one combination and 14&#xD;
      subjects receive the other combination. In Period 2, the alternate treatment is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening takes place from Days -21 to -2 before the first admission day (Day -1). EC905 is&#xD;
      administered from Day 1 to Day 12 (treatment period 1), and from Day 13 to Day 24 (treatment&#xD;
      period 2). All treatments are administered with subjects in the fasted state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of tamsulosin HCl and solifenacin free base&#xD;
      are collected, and assessments of vital signs, safety electrocardiogram (ECG), safety&#xD;
      laboratory, adverse events and concomitant medications are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are discharged on day 25 and an End of Study Visit takes place at least 10 days&#xD;
      after the second treatment period, or after withdrawal.&#xD;
