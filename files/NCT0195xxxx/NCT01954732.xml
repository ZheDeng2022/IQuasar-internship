      This randomized clinical trial studies metformin hydrochloride in treating patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery. Metformin hydrochloride may stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of escalating doses of metformin (metformin hydrochloride) given&#xD;
      pre-operatively on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess toxicity of escalating doses of metformin given pre-operatively in patients with&#xD;
      resectable pancreatic carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure the effect of metformin on the expression of phosphorylated acetyl-CoA&#xD;
      carboxylase alpha (ACC), phosphorylated mechanistic target of rapamycin (serine/threonine&#xD;
      kinase) (mTOR), and pancreatic cancer stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients undergo observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for at least&#xD;
      7 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP III: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride as in Group II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 30 days.&#xD;
