  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the effects of a mind body medicine intervention called the&#xD;
      Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (3RP) on stress and stress related symptoms in&#xD;
      patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering&#xD;
      multiple myeloma (SMM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a supportive care trial. This means that the intervention program may&#xD;
      improve general well-being and comfort, but is not considered a treatment or &quot;cure&quot; for MGUS&#xD;
      or SMM. It is considered an investigational intervention because the investigators are&#xD;
      examining the effectiveness of a new program - the 3RP - on reducing stress and&#xD;
      stress-related symptoms in patients with MGUS and SMM. Standard management of MGUS and SMM&#xD;
      involves regular monitoring without chemotherapy. Mind-body medicine, as defined by the&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health, &quot;focuses on the interactions among the brain, mind, body, and&#xD;
      behavior, and on the powerful ways in which emotional, mental, social, spiritual, and&#xD;
      behavioral factors can directly affect health.&quot; The 3RP is a newly designed group therapy&#xD;
      program that through a variety of mind body principles and self-care interventions seeks to&#xD;
      buffer stress and promote psychological resiliency and physical well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the effectiveness of the 3RP in reducing stress and symptoms&#xD;
      associated with stress in patients diagnosed with MGUS or SMM. Data from this study will also&#xD;
      be used to assess changes in gene expression that result from 3RP intervention, particularly&#xD;
      genetic pathways that are known to be dysregulated in MM.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Before the research starts (screening): After signing this consent form, the participant will&#xD;
      be asked some questions to find out if the participant can be in the research study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A medical history, which includes questions about the participant's physical and mental&#xD;
      health, current medications, and any allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If these tests show that the participant are eligible to participate in the research study,&#xD;
      the participant will receive the study intervention. If the participant does not meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, the participant will not be able to participate in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the screening procedures confirm that the participant is eligible to participate&#xD;
           in the research study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collections Visit One: After the screening visit confirms that the participant is&#xD;
           eligible to participate, the participant will be scheduled for Collections Visit One. At&#xD;
           Collections Visit One, the participant will complete:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A demographic questionnaire: This will include questions about the participant's age,&#xD;
           gender and ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A series of questionnaires: These will ask the participant's about their overall&#xD;
           wellness and take about 30-45 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A small blood sample collection: Trained nursing staff will take about 1.5 tablespoons&#xD;
           of blood from a single prick to the participant's arm. This procedure will take about&#xD;
           10-15 minutes. This is to provide samples for research tests that may help the&#xD;
           investigator's learn more about how the study treatment affects how the participant's&#xD;
           genes are expressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OPTIONAL - Bone marrow, plasma and serum collection: This collection is optional and is&#xD;
           described in more detail in Section O. Trained nursing staff will take about 1&#xD;
           tablespoon of bone marrow through a standard bone marrow aspirate procedure. This&#xD;
           procedure takes about 20-30 minutes to complete, however most of the time is used to get&#xD;
           everything ready (such as preparing the skin) as well as 5-10 minutes reserved for&#xD;
           relaxing after the procedure is completed. This is to provide samples for research tests&#xD;
           that may help the investigator learn more about how the study treatment affects the&#xD;
           participant's disease. (This collection is optional and is described in more detail in&#xD;
           section O.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Since the effect of the study intervention with other medications may not be known, it&#xD;
           is important that the participant tell the research doctor about all prescription and&#xD;
           non-prescription drugs, herbal preparations and nutritional supplements that the&#xD;
           participant is taking or is planning to take.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization: In order to measure the effects of the intervention, the participant will&#xD;
           be &quot;randomized&quot; into one of the study groups after Collections&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit One: Immediate Group or Waitlist Control. The Immediate Group will receive the&#xD;
           study intervention within two weeks after the Screening and Collections Visit One&#xD;
           procedures. Randomization means that the participant is put into a group by chance. It&#xD;
           is like flipping a coin. The participant will have an equal chance of being placed in&#xD;
           either group. Both groups will receive the same intervention during the course of the&#xD;
           study, but at different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the participant is assigned to the Waitlist Control group, Collections Visit One will&#xD;
           be followed by 3 months of waiting for the intervention. The participant would then&#xD;
           attend Collections Visit Two, followed by the intervention (3 months) and then by&#xD;
           Collections Visit Three.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the participant is assigned to the Immediate Group, Collections Visit One will be&#xD;
           followed by the intervention (3 months). the participant would then attend Collections&#xD;
           Visit Two, followed by 3 months of continuing to practice what the participant learned&#xD;
           during the intervention, and then by Collections Visit Three.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After Collections Visit One, the participant will be given a group assignment and a&#xD;
           calendar of future study visits indicating the potential date, time and locations of the&#xD;
           participant's study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Intervention: The intervention will consist of one intake with a psychologist&#xD;
           (approximately 60 minutes), 8 3RP sessions once a week over the course of 8 weeks&#xD;
           (approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes each), and one exit visit (approximately 30&#xD;
           minutes) over the course of 3-months. All intervention visits will take place at the&#xD;
           Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the intervention (and follow up period for those in the Immediate Group), the&#xD;
           participant will be asked to practice what the participant has learned in the&#xD;
           intervention by listening to a 20-minute audio CD daily. Additionally, the participant&#xD;
           will be asked to keep track of their daily practice by filling out an online or paper&#xD;
           log. During the 3RP session, the clinician will address any barriers or problems the&#xD;
           participant may be having with the daily practice and help to problem solve them with&#xD;
           the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collections Visit Two: This visit will be the same as Collections Visit One.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collections Visit Three: During this visit, the participant will complete:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A series of questionnaires: These will ask about the participant's overall wellness, and&#xD;
           will take about 30-45 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A small blood sample collection: Trained nursing staff will take about 1.5 tablespoons&#xD;
           of blood from a single prick to your arm. This procedure takes about 10-15 minutes. This&#xD;
           is to provide samples for research tests that may help the investigators learn more&#xD;
           about how the study treatment affects how the participant's genes are expressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will also collect information regarding any changes in the&#xD;
           participants medical history since their last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;

        -  Planned Follow-up (Immediate Group Only): The investigator would like to keep track of&#xD;
           the participant's home practice and medical condition for 12 weeks after completion of&#xD;
           the 3RP intervention. The investigator would like to do this by contacting the&#xD;
           participant by e-mail or phone once a month to see how the participant is doing. By&#xD;
           Keeping in touch with the participant and checking on their practice and condition every&#xD;
           month helps the investigator look at the long-term effects of the research study. At the&#xD;
           end of the 12 weeks, the participant will come in for their last study visit - the&#xD;
           follow up visit, which is described above.&#xD;
