  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to compare the costs, ability to effectively screen and&#xD;
      distribute relevant safety information, and assess products purchased and behavior changed by&#xD;
      families after meeting with an injury prevention specialist compared to using a computerized&#xD;
      emergency department kiosk. There will be a significantly greater reported practice of safety&#xD;
      behaviors by families who visit a pediatric emergency department after using a computerized&#xD;
      kiosk for injury screening and providing tailored recommendations than when the prevention&#xD;
      information is provided by an injury prevention specialist.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past few years, physicians have been proposing that an emergency department visit may&#xD;
      act as a &quot;teachable moment&quot; and emergency medicine physicians should educate families about&#xD;
      injury prevention. With an epidemic number of injuries occurring, every health care provider&#xD;
      should play some role in combating the problem. However, emergency departments can be busy&#xD;
      and overcrowded, making it difficult for staff, in a cost efficient manner, to be able to&#xD;
      provide families with the appropriate injury prevention information. Kiosks have been shown&#xD;
      to be effective in a pediatric emergency department setting to determine the needs of&#xD;
      families and to educate them about safety practices. Thus, computerized kiosks may offer a&#xD;
      more cost effective alternative to educating families, compared to a staff member, about&#xD;
      injury prevention in the emergency medicine setting and they would have the ability to reach&#xD;
      more individuals during the non-high peak emergency department hours which are difficult to&#xD;
      staff. Also, a computerized kiosk may be more effective in eliciting a behavior change than a&#xD;
      staff person as families may be inclined to answer more freely when asked questions&#xD;
      anonymously, allowing them to receive more detailed safety information. In addition, the&#xD;
      kiosk provides direct recommendations about behavior changes based on parental responses in a&#xD;
      very short time period. Typically, families only hear about a few behavior change&#xD;
      recommendations when discussing with an injury prevention staff person in an emergency&#xD;
      department setting due to time constraints and family interest. With more directed injury&#xD;
      prevention information and detailed recommendations on behavior changes in a cost efficient&#xD;
      manner, kiosks may prove to be more effective in having families practice safer behaviors&#xD;
      after leaving the pediatric emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a comparative study performed in the emergency department of a level 1 pediatric&#xD;
      trauma center during the normal business hours of the Safety Resource Center. Families&#xD;
      entering the pediatric emergency department for care will be randomized on specific days of&#xD;
      the week to receive IP information from an IP specialist or from a computerized kiosk in the&#xD;
      waiting room. A twenty day block random numbers table will be used to determine which days&#xD;
      families entering the ED will utilize the computerized kiosk and which days they will be&#xD;
      screened by clinical research assistants (CRCs) and provided with safety instructions by an&#xD;
      IP specialist.&#xD;
