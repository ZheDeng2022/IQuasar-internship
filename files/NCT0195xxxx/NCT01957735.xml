    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1a/b multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study to&#xD;
      examine the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of BPM31510 administered as a 144-hour continuous&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) infusion as monotherapy(treatment Arm 1)and in combination with chemotherapy&#xD;
      (treatment Arm 2) in patients with solid tumors.In the Phase 1a portion of the trial,&#xD;
      patients who meet eligibility parameters will receive 2 consecutive 72-hour infusions of&#xD;
      BPM31510 twice weekly on Tuesday and Friday (i.e., Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 18, 22 and 25),&#xD;
      essentially receiving BPM31510 treatment for 144 hours per week of each 28-day cycle. At each&#xD;
      dose level of Arm 1 and Arm 2, patients will be treated for either 8 hours at minimum of&#xD;
      outpatient monitoring or inpatient monitoring for the first 24-hrs of the first infusion of&#xD;
      Cycle 1.All other treatments will be administered in an outpatient setting.Dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicities will be assessed during Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design with the dose escalated in successive&#xD;
      cohorts of 3 to 6 patients each.Toxicity at each dose level will be graded according to&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.02).&#xD;
      Safety oversight will be provided by the Cohort Review Committee (CRC).The CRC will review&#xD;
      and confirm all DLTs and will continue to monitor safety throughout the study (including Arm&#xD;
      2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of the antitumor activity of BPM31510 will be performed at the end of Cycle 2 and&#xD;
      every 2 cycles thereafter using standard techniques such as computerized tomography (CT) or&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for patients with measurable disease.Response will be&#xD;
      evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 .Patients who&#xD;
      experience no unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, may receive additional 28-day&#xD;
      cycles for up to 1 year on Arm 1 or 2. Patients on Arm 1 who progress may elect to continue&#xD;
      BPM31510 treatment in combination with gemcitabine, 5-FU, or docetaxel at the treating&#xD;
      physician's discretion. Once a dose level of BPM31510 monotherapy is evaluated and the CRC&#xD;
      determines it safe to escalate to the next dose level, Cohort 1 of Treatment Arm 2 of&#xD;
      BPM31510 in combination with chemotherapy will open to accrual. Cohort 1 of Arm 2 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled onto one of 3 chemotherapies, gemcitabine, 5-FU, or docetaxel. Cycle 1 of&#xD;
      combination therapy (Arm 2) is 6 weeks in duration for patients with BPM31510 administered&#xD;
      twice weekly on Tuesday and Friday for 6 weeks and chemotherapy administered on Mondays, Days&#xD;
      21, 28 and 35. Cycles 2-12 are 4 weeks in duration with BPM31510 administered twice weekly on&#xD;
      Tuesday and Friday for 4 weeks and chemotherapy administered on Mondays, Days 7, 14 and 21.&#xD;
      Dose limiting toxicities will be assessed during Cycle 1. Response will be assessed after&#xD;
      Cycle 2 (10 weeks) and responders who continue onto Cycles 2-12 will be assessed every 2&#xD;
      cycles (8 weeks). Patients who progress and crossover to Arm 2 will be reconsented and must&#xD;
      meet eligibility before restarting BPM31510. Crossover patients are not evaluated for DLTs on&#xD;
      Arm 2 and all cycles of combination therapy are 4 weeks in duration (Cycles 1-12). BPM31510&#xD;
      is administered twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays for 4 weeks and chemotherapy&#xD;
      administered on Mondays, Days 7, 14 and 21 for all crossover patients on Arm 2. Patients will&#xD;
      continue BPM31510 in combination with chemotherapy for a maximum of 12 cycles in the absence&#xD;
      of intolerable toxicity and progression. Patients on Arm 2 who progress on one type of&#xD;
      chemotherapy may not switch to one of the other chemotherapy agents in combination with&#xD;
      BPM31510.However, if the chemotherapy component (ie, 5-FU, gemcitabine, or docetaxel) of&#xD;
      combination therapy is discontinued due to chemotherapy-related toxicity, patients may&#xD;
      continue to receive BPM31510 as monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BPM31510 as monotherapy and in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy are established, an expansion cohort will be enrolled (a total of 12-15 patients&#xD;
      for monotherapy and a total of 10 patients for each combination therapy).&#xD;

    <description>standard 3+3 design will be used for Arm 2 of the study. BPM31510 will be started at one dose level below the dose that has been studied and determined to be safe in the monotherapy portion of the trial. Arm 2 patients will be enrolled onto one of 3 chemotherapies, gemcitabine, 5-FU, or docetaxel according to the dose levels below:&#xD;
Gemcitabine IV once weekly at a starting dose of 600 mg/m2 ;&#xD;
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) IV once weekly at a starting dose of 350 mg/m2 with leucovorin (LV) 100 mg/m2; OR&#xD;
Docetaxel IV once weekly at a starting dose of 20 mg/m2.&#xD;
Note:Both BPM31510 and the chemotherapy agent can escalate simultaneously in Cohorts 3 and 4 only if there are no DLTs observed in the previous cohorts. If one or more DLTs are observed, then intermediate dose levels will be added where one agent is escalated.</description>
