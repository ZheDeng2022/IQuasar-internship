  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of&#xD;
      4mg fruquintinib in normal healthy subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, randomized, two-period, crossover PK food effect study of&#xD;
      fruquintinib administered orally at 4mg. Subjects will be screened for eligibility up to 14&#xD;
      days prior to entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each of 2 study periods, subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) on&#xD;
      the day before dosing and fast overnight (approximately 10 hours). On the morning of dosing&#xD;
      for each of the 2 study periods, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 4 mg&#xD;
      fruquintinib in either the fasted or fed state. Subjects will remain at the CRU for at least&#xD;
      120 hours after administration of study drug for collection of serial blood samples for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and safety monitoring. Subjects will return to the CRU for&#xD;
      safety assessment for up to 336 hours postdose.&#xD;
