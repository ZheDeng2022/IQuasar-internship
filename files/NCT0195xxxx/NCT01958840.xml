      Following a small, open-label pilot study that yielded very promising results of BATD, the&#xD;
      current study will consist of a larger, randomized control trial (n=60) that will compare&#xD;
      BATD to Supportive Counseling in outcomes of depression, contact with positive reinforcement&#xD;
      in the environment, treatment satisfaction, therapeutic alliance, and perceived stigma. In&#xD;
      addition, participants' adherence rates to each of the therapies and their maintenance of&#xD;
      clinical gains at a 1-month follow-up, will be examined.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and widely-impairing across racial and&#xD;
      ethnic groups. Higher rates of MDD have been observed among Latinos with limited&#xD;
      English-language proficiency relative to the general population. Although MDD is a highly&#xD;
      treatable condition, barriers to treatment access and delivery have been implicated in&#xD;
      precluding this group from utilizing and receiving mental health services. Fortunately,&#xD;
      Latinos tend to endorse positive attitudes toward psychosocial treatments for depression by&#xD;
      applying the valued belief of &quot;poner de su parte&quot; or being able to do their part in one's&#xD;
      recovery, a concept that is highly consistent with the framework of behavioral treatments for&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD), based on reinforcement theory, may&#xD;
      be well-equipped to address disparities associated with higher depression prevalence rates&#xD;
      and receipt of care among Latinos with limited English-language proficiency. Following a&#xD;
      small, open-label pilot study that yielded very promising results of BATD, the current study&#xD;
      will consist of a larger, randomized control trial (N = 60) that will compare BATD to&#xD;
      Supportive Counseling in outcomes of depression, activity level, and contact with positive&#xD;
      reinforcement in the environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial eligibility will be determined via a telephone screener, which will include questions&#xD;
      from the Mood Disorders, Substance Use and Dependence, and Psychotic Disorders modules of the&#xD;
      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID-IV; First, Spitzer, Gibbon &amp; Williams,&#xD;
      2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria consist of the following: 1) be a minimum of 18 years of age, 2) be of&#xD;
      Latino descent, 3) report limited English language proficiency, 4) meet current MDD criteria,&#xD;
      5) have completed the 4th grade or higher either in their country of origin or in the US, 6)&#xD;
      not have current substance abuse or dependence, 7) have no Bipolar or Psychotic Disorders,&#xD;
      and 9) not be currently receiving psychotherapy, and 10) if currently taking antidepressants,&#xD;
      demonstrate pharmacological stability as indicated by 3 or more consecutive months of use.&#xD;
      Excluded individuals will be referred to mental health resources within the community.&#xD;
