  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyze how the body handles and responds to progesterone&#xD;
      treatment in parous and nulliparous women at risk of pre-term birth.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC) has recently been shown to reduce the rate of&#xD;
      recurrent preterm birth while intravaginal progesterone has been shown to reduce the rate of&#xD;
      preterm birth in women with short cervix. While these interventions have reduced the rate of&#xD;
      preterm birth, the mechanisms of action of these medications are unknown. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to collect and analyze blood and cervicovaginal fluids from pregnant women&#xD;
      receiving these medications or other interventions such as cerclage, pessary, NSAIDs, and&#xD;
      combinations thereof. The goal of the analyses is to assess the impact of these interventions&#xD;
      on the cervical proteome, cervical cytokines and cervical structure and to identify potential&#xD;
      biomarkers of response and non-response thus providing insights into the mechanisms of action&#xD;
      of these drugs.&#xD;

        This study consists of 4 groups of women who are between 16 0/7 - 23 6/7 weeks gestation.&#xD;
        The allocation of a subject to a group is based on two objective assessments (history of&#xD;
        preterm birth and cervical length) and the joint clinical decision of the woman and her&#xD;
        physician regarding treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study participants who have no prior preterm births and a normal cervical length will be&#xD;
        assigned to Group 1. If the participant has no prior preterm births and a short cervical&#xD;
        length, she will be assigned to Group 2 regardless of treatment or no treatment. Group&#xD;
        assignment for women with a prior preterm birth and normal cervical length is based on&#xD;
        17-OHPC use. Participants who elect to use 17-OHPC will be assigned to Group 3 and those&#xD;
        who choose not to receive any treatment will be assigned to Group 4.&#xD;
