  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease which results in irreversible attachment loss,&#xD;
      bone destruction and tooth loss, is a major oral health problem affecting 90.2% of Malaysian&#xD;
      population. It was initially demonstrated that Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) was a risk factor for&#xD;
      periodontitis and subsequently a two-way relationship between diabetes and periodontitis was&#xD;
      proposed. Diabetes has been shown to cause defects in neutrophil function by overproduction&#xD;
      of pro-inflammatory mediators such as Tumour necrosis factor-α, Interleukin-1β and&#xD;
      Prostaglandin E2 by macrophages. The inflammatory mediators released in response to plaque&#xD;
      have been reported to be insulin antagonists that disturb binding of insulin to its receptors&#xD;
      and further complicate hyperglycaemia in T2D. The hyperglycaemia in diabetics promotes more&#xD;
      pathogenic bacteria into the subgingival microenvironment making them more susceptible to&#xD;
      chronic periodontitis. Studies however differ in the types of periodontal pathogens present&#xD;
      in these pockets. At the same time, very few studies have quantified them. This study&#xD;
      proposes to investigate the effect that non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) has on the&#xD;
      periodontal parameters, HbA1c levels, microbiological profile and CRP levels of T2D patients&#xD;
      with chronic periodontitis as compared to oral hygiene education (OHE)alone.&#xD;

      Ethical approval was obtained from both the Medical Ethics Boards of University Malaya&#xD;
      Medical Centre (MEC Ref No: 696.9) and University Malaya Dental Centre [DF PE1002/0045(P)].&#xD;
      One hundred and twelve type 2 diabetic patients (diagnosed at least 1 year prior to the&#xD;
      study) between ages of 30 to 70 were screened from the outpatient Diabetes Clinic of the&#xD;
      University Malaya Medical Centre and a total of 40 patients who fulfilled the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria were recruited for the study. The recruited patients were then registered&#xD;
      at the Periodontology Clinic at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya. Patient&#xD;
      information sheets regarding the study and verbal explanations were given to all patients.&#xD;
      Informed consent was obtained from all recruited patients with the understanding that they&#xD;
      could withdraw from the study at any time. Screening and treatment of patients commenced from&#xD;
      January 2010 till December 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation determined that 15 subjects per treatment arm would provide 80%&#xD;
      power to detect a minimum difference of 1% (11.0 mmol/mol) change in HbA1c between test and&#xD;
      control. Accordingly, a sample of 20 subjects per arm (40 in total) was recruited to&#xD;
      compensate for possible drop-outs during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were randomly assigned via a coin toss to age matched NSPT and OHE groups.&#xD;
      Investigator 1 screened and enrolled participants and assigned them to age-matched groups.&#xD;
      Investigator 2 performed the random allocation sequence using coin toss method to assign&#xD;
      participants to the different interventions while Investigator 1 performed all intervention.&#xD;
      There was no blinding of participants or examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As only one examiner was involved in the study, intra-examiner reliability assessment was&#xD;
      executed to validate the ability of the examiner to constantly reproduce the quantitative&#xD;
      outcome measurements of the clinical parameters used. The Plaque Index (PI), Gingival&#xD;
      Bleeding Index (GBI), Probing Pocket Depth (PPD) and Probing Attachment Loss (PAL) were&#xD;
      measured in the time interval of about 3 hours. Utilizing Kappa statistics, good agreements&#xD;
      (&gt;0.8) were obtained for reproducibility of all recorded clinical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All recruited patients underwent full periodontal assessment at baseline, 2 months after&#xD;
      assigned treatment and 3 months after assigned treatment. The clinical examination included&#xD;
      Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI), Probing Pocket Depth (PPD) and Probing&#xD;
      Attachment Loss (PAL) measured with an electronic constant- force probe (Florida Probe®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were instructed in oral hygiene methods using a soft bristled toothbrush, a&#xD;
      compact-tuft toothbrush, inter-dental brushes and dental floss utilizing the modified Bass&#xD;
      technique. Full mouth debridement, which consisted of scaling and root planing, was done in a&#xD;
      single visit for all subjects in the NSPT group using an ultrasonic scaler and Gracey&#xD;
      curettes. Additionally, all patients in the NSPT group were given a 0.12% Chlorhexidine&#xD;
      mouthrinse (Hexipro®). They were instructed to rinse three times a day using 15ml each time&#xD;
      for a period of 14 days commencing immediately after completion of full mouth debridement.&#xD;
      Thereafter at each recall visit, all participants were re-motivated and professional&#xD;
      prophylaxis was performed on those in the test group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      15 ml of venous blood was collected from each patient at baseline, prior to treatment and at&#xD;
      3 months after assigned treatments. Levels of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and systemic&#xD;
      hs-C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) were assessed. Hs-CRP levels were assessed using tests for&#xD;
      high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP). All blood investigations were done at a private laboratory&#xD;
      (Gnosis Laboratories Sdn. Bhd) with no affiliation to the Department of Periodontology. The&#xD;
      HbA1c testing is DCCT aligned and the Quality Assurance of the laboratory is certified under&#xD;
      Bio-Rad Laboratories (USA), EQAS (External Quality Assurance Services).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deepest pockets were identified (minimum 5 pockets with PPD ≥ 5 mm) and isolated with cotton&#xD;
      rolls. This was followed by careful removal of supragingival plaque using cotton pellets and&#xD;
      curettes. Subgingival plaque samples were subsequently collected using sterile curettes and&#xD;
      pooled into sterile DNAse-free and RNase-free polyethylene tube containing 1ml Phosphate&#xD;
      Buffer Solution (PBS) and frozen at -800C until commencement of q-PCR analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Automated DNA extraction was performed in the lab using the QIAcube machine (Qiagen®). 100 µl&#xD;
      of plaque sample was placed in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube and was centrifuged at a speed of&#xD;
      5,000 × g for 10 minutes on a tabletop centrifuge machine to obtain a pellet. The pellets&#xD;
      were then placed on the QIAcube-shaker for automated DNA extraction by QIAcube machine using&#xD;
      DNeasy® Blood &amp; Tissue Mini Kit and QIAmp® DNA accessory set. All reagents provided in the&#xD;
      kit were manually placed into the reagent bottle rack in the machine prior to the start of&#xD;
      the process. Finally, the &quot;Bacterial DNA&quot; protocol was selected from the machine's protocol&#xD;
      list. Briefly, the Qiacube machine underwent five consecutive steps which included lysis,&#xD;
      incubate, bind, wash and elution processes. At the end of the process, 100µl of eluted DNA&#xD;
      was available. The extracted DNA were then tested for concentration and purity using Nanodrop&#xD;
      machine. The DNA was then stored in -80⁰C before bacterial identification using q-PCR&#xD;
      machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentration and purity of extracted DNA was determined using the spectrophotometer&#xD;
      machine (Thermo Scientific NanoDrop™ 2000 Spectrophotometers) which was connected with a PC&#xD;
      based software. 0.1 µl of eluted DNA was pipetted onto the lower pedestal arm. A fiber optic&#xD;
      cable (the receiving fiber) is embedded within this pedestal. A second fiber optic cable (the&#xD;
      source fiber) located in the upper pedestal arm is then brought into contact with the liquid&#xD;
      sample causing the liquid to bridge the gap between the ends of the two fibers. A pulsed&#xD;
      xenon flash lamp provides the light source and a spectrometer utilizing a linear CCD array&#xD;
      analyzes the light passing through the sample. The DNA concentration from both plaque samples&#xD;
      and reference strain were measured and recorded accordingly. The extracted DNAs were&#xD;
      eventually stored in -20⁰C until the commencement of q-PCR procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detection and quantification of P. gingivalis, A.actinomycetemcomitans, P.intermedia and&#xD;
      T.forsythia from plaque samples were done using Applied Biosystems® 7500 Real-Time PCR&#xD;
      Systems which was connected to PC based software. The quantification was done by projecting&#xD;
      the cycle threshold (Ct) value of the samples on the standard curve of the known amount&#xD;
      (concentration) of bacteria reference strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, a known amount of extracted DNA of the bacteria was serially diluted (10&#xD;
      fold dilution) and was subjected to RT-PCR amplification. This was done to provide a standard&#xD;
      curve prior to amplification of DNA from plaque samples using q-PCR. Optimization was carried&#xD;
      out in order to get the optimum standard curve for quantification. A final 10 fold dilution&#xD;
      standard curve of reference strains (range from 10ng/µl- 0.0001 ng/µl) with R2 value of 0.956&#xD;
      was used as a base for quantification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the sensitivity of the q-PCR technique, serial samples containing known&#xD;
      concentrations of individual microorganisms were processed for q-PCR analysis. The lowest&#xD;
      concentration that resulted in a positive PCR product was regarded as the sensitivity of the&#xD;
      assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      q-PCR amplification was done in a total reaction mixture volume of 20µl. This mixture&#xD;
      contained 2µl of purified DNA from plaque sample/ reference strain to act as PCR template, 10&#xD;
      µl of 2x TaqMan® Fast Advanced Master Mix (PCR buffer, dNTP's, Amplitaq Gold, reference&#xD;
      signal, uracil N-glycosylase, MgCl2; Applied Bio systems, Foster City, CA, USA), 1µl Custom&#xD;
      Taqman® Gene Expression Assay (20x) and 7µl nuclease-free water. The procedures were&#xD;
      conducted using 96-well reaction plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the components of the reaction mixture (except DNA sample) were added onto a 1.5mL micro&#xD;
      centrifuge tube. The tube was capped and vortexed briefly. The tubes were then centrifuged to&#xD;
      spin down the contents and eliminate air bubbles. The mixture was then transferred to a 96&#xD;
      well reaction plate and followed by addition of 2µl DNA sample. The reaction plate was then&#xD;
      covered with optical adhesive cover after the entire well had been occupied. This reaction&#xD;
      plate was again briefly centrifuged to spin down the content and to ensure all bubbles were&#xD;
      eliminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This mixture was then subjected to an initial amplification cycle of 50ºC for 2 minutes and&#xD;
      95ºC for 10 minutes, followed by 45 cycles at 95ºC for 15s and 60ºC for 1 minute. The q-PCR&#xD;
      amplification plot for each sample was analyzed to determine the Ct value. The Ct value was&#xD;
      then projected to the standard curve of reference strain for the quantification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons of changes in PI, GBI, PPD(%) and PAL (%) both within and between the groups were&#xD;
      performed using the chi-square test. Intragroup comparison for mean PPD, mean PAL, mean&#xD;
      HbA1c, mean CRP and frequency of detection of P. gingivalis, A.actinomycetemcomitans,&#xD;
      P.intermedia and T.forsythia were assessed with the paired sample t-test whereas intergroup&#xD;
      comparisons for the same variables was accomplished using an independent sample t-test.&#xD;
