  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Few studies have addressed the situation of procedural pain and the use of&#xD;
      preemptive analgesia for turning in patients under mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Evaluation effect of preemptive fentanyl on the incidence of pain during turning&#xD;
      maneuvers in critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Single-center clinical trial, national, randomized, double-blind, with a parallel&#xD;
      group, and two arms of treatment: saline placebo and fentanyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Incidence of pain during the turning procedures that are carried out by&#xD;
      nurses measured by means of the Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Critically ill patients, age &gt; 18 years, admitted to ICU and expected to&#xD;
      require mechanical ventilation for at least 24 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 80 patients divided into the two groups (40 patients each). Statistical&#xD;
      Analysis: A preliminary descriptive analysis will be carried. Later, results of primary end&#xD;
      point will be comparing after the eventual corrections of corresponding variables using a&#xD;
      multivariable approach. The AUC variable will be analyzed by a t-test for unpaired data. A&#xD;
      second analysis using a multivariate approach will be carried out for those factors&#xD;
      considered as clinically relevant in relation to pain and therefore a logistic regression&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations: The study will be strictly conducted following the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki and the protocol and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure compliance with&#xD;
      the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards. It is the responsibility of the researcher to&#xD;
      obtain the valid informed consent from the guardian / legal representative, as the patient's&#xD;
      condition will not allow to consent. Before obtaining the consent the investigator will&#xD;
      explain to each guardian / legal representative the nature of the study, its purpose, the&#xD;
      procedures, the estimated duration, the potential risks and benefits associated with the&#xD;
      participation, as well as any inconvenience that this may involve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Treatment: The treatment has a maximum duration of 60 min for each patient. The&#xD;
      follow-up includes visits and has duration of 6 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessment: Potential side effects of treatments will be recorded. Frequent adverse&#xD;
      effects of fentanyl administration include respiratory depression, apnea, muscle rigidity,&#xD;
      bradycardia and transient hypotension.&#xD;

    <description>For this study Fentanest doses were adjusted based on published guidelines from the values recommended media to a whole number and differentiating two groups of patients (multiple trauma / surgical or medical) The maximum dose is 100 mcg Fentanest. The multiple trauma patients / surgical 1.5 mcg / kg and in medical patients 1.0 mcg / kg were given a single bolus Fentanest / Placebo by type of patient (surgical / multiple trauma or physician) 5 'before turning mobilization with personal hygiene.&#xD;
The bolus is given slowly (30'') intravenously, to be preferred by a peripheral without vasoactive drugs (only with fluid therapy).&#xD;
Pharmaceutical form:&#xD;
Sterile solution for injection. Each mL of injectable solution contains the equivalent of 0.05 mg of Fentanest; Excipients: sodium chloride and water for injection.</description>
