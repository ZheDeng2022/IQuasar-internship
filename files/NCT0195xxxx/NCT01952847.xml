  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if glutamine can help control and&#xD;
      prevent sores, blisters, or inflammation in your mouth or esophagus due to your current&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, glutamine will be compared to a placebo. A placebo is not a drug. It looks&#xD;
      like the drug but is not designed to treat any disease or illness. It is designed to be&#xD;
      compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. You will have an equal chance of being&#xD;
      assigned to either group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive glutamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither you nor the study staff will know if you are receiving the study drug or the placebo.&#xD;
      However, if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out what you are&#xD;
      receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glutamine or the placebo will be taken as a sugary drink by mouth. You will take the drink&#xD;
      twice daily starting the day you first receive your anti-cancer therapy or radiation&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will mix one scoop of powder with 25-100 milliliters (about 2-6 tablespoons) of water. If&#xD;
      you are in the chemotherapy group, you will swish the drink for 10 seconds and swallow. If&#xD;
      you are in the radiation group, you will swallow the drink in small amounts several times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every visit, you will be asked about any side effects you may be having and about any&#xD;
      other drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 8, and 22 of Cycle 1:&#xD;

           about 5-10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a photograph of your mouth taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 months of chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will continue taking the glutamine or placebo for 4 weeks after the completion of your&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapy or radiation treatment. If you stop chemotherapy or radiation before&#xD;
      completion of the intended study period, you will continue to take the study drug for 4&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you develop severe sores, blisters, or inflammation in your mouth or esophagus, you will&#xD;
      be removed from the study, and the doctor will give you another medication for your sores and&#xD;
      blisters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over 6 months after completion of your therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you are off study, you will have an end-of-study visit. For the radiation group, this&#xD;
      will be 6 months after radiation therapy. For the chemotherapy group, this is 4 weeks after&#xD;
      the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your weight will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in the chemotherapy group, you will have a mouth exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Glutamine is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of short bowel syndrome. Its use to treat mouth sores and inflammation of the&#xD;
      esophagus is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 180 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
