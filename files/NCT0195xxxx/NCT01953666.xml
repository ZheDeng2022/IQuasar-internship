  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computers now play an important role in the lives of most individuals.Access to computers is&#xD;
      crucial for people with disabilities and may improve their quality of life. The use of&#xD;
      computers can facilitate mainstreaming at school, for example, and the Internet may provide a&#xD;
      valuable means of communication. However, the use of computers requires a certain degree of&#xD;
      motor ability. People with motor disabilities frequently experience difficulties using a&#xD;
      standard keyboard and standard pointing input systems such as a mouse. Many solutions exist&#xD;
      to facilitate computer access, depending on the person's specific impairments and the purpose&#xD;
      for which the computer is used. The most common solution relies on the use of a virtual&#xD;
      keyboard which is directly displayed on the computer screen. The selection of the desired key&#xD;
      on the virtual keyboard can be handled by a large variety of input devices, from a&#xD;
      microgravity mouse to single switch devices supplemented by a process of dynamic scanning of&#xD;
      the keyboard.Although such assistive devices render computers accessible to people with&#xD;
      disabilities, the actual inputting of text can be very slow. A method to increase text input&#xD;
      speed is to display words which are predicted from the letters previously typed. Word&#xD;
      prediction reduces the number of necessary key strokes by avoiding having to type the whole&#xD;
      word. The effect on text input speed is, however uncertain and results in the literature are&#xD;
      inconclusive. Indeed, word prediction software provide a enhancement of cognitive load which&#xD;
      decrease text input speed.The reduction of cognitive load could therefore be based in part on&#xD;
      the optimization settings of the software and / or achievement of a rehabilitation&#xD;
      program.Our hypothesis are for people with spinal cord injury : i) optimization settings word&#xD;
      prediction software and ii) a rehabilitation program could improve the text input speed.The&#xD;
      investigators propose to study the influence of settings word prediction software on text&#xD;
      input speed and the influence of a rehabilitation program provided by a therapist, focused on&#xD;
      word prediction software to help integrate them. The aim is to increase the performance of&#xD;
      people with spinal cord injury and their satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of this research is to select the word prediction software and configuration&#xD;
      that provides the best user support.The second phase corresponds to the objective of&#xD;
      evaluating the efficiency of a rehabilitation program .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PHASE 1 : The first phase studied the repeated measurement of the efficiency of typing text&#xD;
      topics in various situations. Each subject will copy a text different in each test and in a&#xD;
      random order. Similarly, if the word prediction software has a capacity for self-improvement&#xD;
      the internal dictionary, it will be disabled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators will study one setting of the configuration word prediction software. Are&#xD;
      available the length of the list of proposals for which three options are selected: 1, 3 or 5&#xD;
      words, according to the literature and to the results of a questionnaire.This questionnaire&#xD;
      was sent to identify the use of people with spinal cord injury and professionals about word&#xD;
      prediction software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The list of words is in the upper position of the screen based on the results of the&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four combinations will be tested on each subject. Twelve Tetraplegics will be required in&#xD;
      each group (one group using a virtual keyboard and one group using the physical keyboard)&#xD;
      Each combination will be tried for 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE 2 :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase will evaluate the effeciency of a rehabilitation program reduced cognitive&#xD;
      load generated by the software predictions words.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose an evaluation of the effects of 12 training sessions in a&#xD;
      controlled, randomized, three parallel groups (experimental group : rehabilitation program, a&#xD;
      group : a self-learning and a group : no learning).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Text input tests will be performed before and after the training sessions for people who have&#xD;
      rehabilitation program. For the other two groups, those will be reviewed one month after the&#xD;
      first test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this evaluation, a different text but with the same difficulty will be used. The order of&#xD;
      execution will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the month the three groups will be evaluated according to the same procedures&#xD;
      for the firts test.&#xD;
