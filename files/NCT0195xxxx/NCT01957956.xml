    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies vaccine therapy and temozolomide in treating patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with&#xD;
      tumor proteins may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.&#xD;
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving vaccine&#xD;
      therapy and temozolomide may be an effective treatment for glioblastoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of adjuvant temozolomide plus combined allogeneic&#xD;
      tumor primary tumor culture lysate / autologous dendritic cell (DC) vaccination (malignant&#xD;
      glioma tumor lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma&#xD;
      patients following surgical debulking and external beam radiation therapy with concurrent&#xD;
      temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To document survival and progression-free survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma&#xD;
      patients receiving adjuvant temozolomide plus allogeneic tumor primary tumor culture lysate /&#xD;
      autologous DC vaccination to historical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the ability of allogeneic tumor primary tumor culture lysate / autologous DC&#xD;
      vaccine to generate multiple tumor-associated antigens (TAA)-specific immune responses in&#xD;
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the relationship between ability tumor induce TAA-specific immune responses and&#xD;
      evidence of immunosuppression (peripheral blood immunophenotyping by flow cytometry)&#xD;
      following allogeneic tumor primary tumor culture lysate / autologous DC vaccine in newly&#xD;
      diagnosed GBM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the relationship between efficacy endpoints (survival, progression-free survival,&#xD;
      tumor response) and tumor-associated antigen immune response following combined autologous or&#xD;
      allogeneic tumor lysate / DC vaccination and adjuvant temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess the relationship between efficacy endpoints (survival, progression-free survival,&#xD;
      tumor response) and evidence of immunosuppression at baseline and over time with combined&#xD;
      autologous or allogeneic tumor lysate / DC vaccination and adjuvant temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COURSE 1: Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COURSES 2-3: Patients receive temozolomide PO daily on days 1-5 and malignant glioma tumor&#xD;
      lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine intradermally (ID) on days 1, 3, and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COURSES 4-6: Patients receive temozolomide PO daily on days 1-5 and malignant glioma tumor&#xD;
      lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine ID on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COURSES 7-12: Patients receive malignant glioma tumor lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell&#xD;
      vaccine ID on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
