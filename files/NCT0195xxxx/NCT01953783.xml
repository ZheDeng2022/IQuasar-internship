    <description>Part A: Participants will receive a single dose of 4.1-milligram (mg) [14C]-IXAZOMIB oral solution containing approximately 500-nCurie (nCi) of total radioactivity on Day 1 and remain at the clinic for 8 days. On Days 14 and 21, participants may be administered a single 4.0-mg capsule of IXAZOMIB. Participants will return to the clinic in the evening before Days 14, 21, 28, and 35 for a 24-hour overnight clinic visit.&#xD;
Part B: Eligible participants from Part A may continue into Part B once they have completed their Day 35 assessments in Part A. Participants may receive IXAZOMIB capsules administered orally at a dose of 4.0-mg once weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-day cycles. Participants will continue in this study until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
