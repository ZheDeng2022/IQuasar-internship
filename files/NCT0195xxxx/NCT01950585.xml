    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a serious and eventually fatal disease damaging the&#xD;
      lungs and the heart. It results from narrowing and eventual blockage of small blood vessels&#xD;
      in the lung, due to abnormal proliferation of cells in the blood vessel (arterial). Patients&#xD;
      with PAH suffer from fatigue, shortness of breath, low oxygen levels, blood clots and heart&#xD;
      failure. No therapies reverse the disease process in the lung arteries, however there are&#xD;
      three approved drugs that can temporarily dilate the vessels and improve symptoms. However,&#xD;
      all three drugs have significant side effects and toxicities, they do not work effectively in&#xD;
      many patients, survival remains on average only 2 to 3 years once symptoms begin, and none of&#xD;
      these drugs prevent the underlying disease process in the small arteries of the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAH is known to develop in patients with a pre-existing class of bone marrow diseases called&#xD;
      myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs). We and others have recently shown that patients with PAH&#xD;
      have bone marrow changes similar to those seen in patients with MPDs, even without other&#xD;
      signs and symptoms of those bone marrow diseases such as anemia or high platelet and white&#xD;
      blood cell counts. Compared to healthy volunteers, patients with PAH have a higher frequency&#xD;
      of immature stem and progenitor cells able to produce blood cells and vascular wall cells in&#xD;
      their bone marrow. They also have higher circulating numbers of these cells in the blood, and&#xD;
      increased localization of these cells in the lung blood vessels. When immature bone marrow&#xD;
      cells from PAH patients and normal volunteers were infused into mice, the mice receiving PAH&#xD;
      marrow cells developed similar lung and heart problems to PAH patients, suggesting that the&#xD;
      bone marrow problem is a primary cause of the lung problems, and that the increased numbers&#xD;
      of immature bone marrow cells in the bone marrow and blood of PAH patients causes the lung&#xD;
      blood vessel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug hydroxyurea is used to inhibit the abnormally high level of bone marrow cell&#xD;
      proliferation in patients with MPDs. It has been shown to reduce the numbers of circulating&#xD;
      immature bone marrow cells in patients with MPDs. Hydroxyurea has been available for almost&#xD;
      fifty years, and has been used to treat patients with MPDs, sickle cell anemia, and&#xD;
      congenital heart disease for very prolonged periods of time, up to twenty or more years in&#xD;
      individual patients. It has an excellent long-term safety profile and few side effects and is&#xD;
      generally well tolerated. It does not appear to result in an increased rate of leukemia even&#xD;
      with many years of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current protocol, we hypothesize that treating patients with PAH with hydroxyurea will&#xD;
      decrease the level of circulating immature bone marrow cells and interrupt the abnormal&#xD;
      narrowing and occlusion of lung arteries. We will treat patients with moderately severe&#xD;
      primary (no known underlying cause) PAH with 6 months of hydroxyurea, carefully monitoring&#xD;
      side effects and adjusting dosage as necessary, and measure the effect on circulating&#xD;
      immature cells, lung blood vessel pressures, other blood markers of active PAH, and exercise&#xD;
      tolerance.&#xD;
