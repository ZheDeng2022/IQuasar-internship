      The general objective of the study is to answer to the question: &quot;Is the current dose of AL&#xD;
      less efficacious in the severely malnourished compared to the non-severely malnourished&#xD;
      children, and is PK in cause?&quot; We aim to assess whether the current treatment dose is&#xD;
      adequate for children with severe acute malnutrition, and we hope results will guide further&#xD;
      recommendations for malaria treatment in this specific population.&#xD;

      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that AL efficacy might be impaired in severely malnourished children, due to&#xD;
      impaired bio-availability of antimalarial drugs in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective of the study is to answer to the question: &quot;Is the current dose of&#xD;
      Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL) less efficacious in the severely malnourished compared to the&#xD;
      non-severely malnourished children, because of impaired bio-availability?&quot; We aim to assess&#xD;
      whether the current treatment dose should be adjusted for this specific population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to compare the rates of treatment failure (after PCR&#xD;
      correction) between severely malnourished and non-severely malnourished children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the bio-availability of lumefantrine between severely malnourished and&#xD;
           non-severely malnourished children (AUC, concentration at day 7…)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare other efficacy parameters (such as the rates of early parasitological&#xD;
           failure, early clinical failure, late therapeutic failure, reinfection and&#xD;
           recrudescence) and safety parameters between severely malnourished and non-severely&#xD;
           malnourished children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additionally, If the rate of early parasitological failure appears high in severely&#xD;
           malnourished children, we will measure the bio-availability of the artemisinin&#xD;
           derivative and will compare it between severely malnourished and non-severely&#xD;
           malnourished children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in two sites in Mali and Niger, two country most affected by&#xD;
      malaria and malnutrition, with a high malaria transmission roughly from July to December,&#xD;
      corresponding to the malnutrition peak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enrol children with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria aged between 6 and 59&#xD;
      months, according to the WHO standardized protocol for the surveillance of antimalarial drug&#xD;
      efficacy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of severe acute malnutrition will be weight-for-height &lt;-3 z-scores to the&#xD;
      reference WHO 2006 growth standards or middle upper arm circumference (MUAC) &lt;115 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of non-severe acute malnutrition will be a weight-for-height z-score ≥-3 and&#xD;
      MUAC ≥115 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severely stunted children (height-for-age z -score &lt;-3) will be excluded from this study,&#xD;
      which is primarily focused on wasted children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following modifications of the inclusion criteria will be applied, compared to the&#xD;
      standardised WHO protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decreased lower level of parasite density (PD) from 2000 to 1000 parasites per micro&#xD;
           litre, as previous studies showed frequent low parasitemias in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the malnourished children arms, malnutrition &lt;-3 z-score will be an inclusion&#xD;
           criterion rather than an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children with complications of acute malnutrition needing intensive treatment will be&#xD;
           excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be screened at the renutrition center and pediatric ward of each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two non-malnourished children will be enrolled soon after the enrolment of each malnourished&#xD;
      child (ideally, during the same week), to allow carrying out inclusions in parallel for the&#xD;
      two study groups, with benefit in terms of representativeness of the study population&#xD;
      throughout the malaria season. The ratio of 2 non-severely malnourished children for 1&#xD;
      severely malnourished has been chosen to lower the total number of severely malnourished&#xD;
      children to be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment intake will be supervised and children will be followed-up for 42 days, according&#xD;
      to the WHO standardized protocol4. PCR will be used to distinguish recrudescence and&#xD;
      re-infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In malnourished children, the standardized nutritional rehabilitation program will also be&#xD;
      conducted in parallel, and weekly follow-up will include the assessment of nutritional&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment adverse events will be monitored and a Data Safety Monitory Board (DSMB) will be&#xD;
      instituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the bio-availability of the study drugs, a population pharmacokinetics approach&#xD;
      will be used to reduce the number of blood sampling. Capillary blood will be collected on&#xD;
      filter paper for measurement of lumefantrine concentrations, 5 times between Day 0 and day 7.&#xD;
      Assays will use a liquid chromatography technique with tandem mass spectrometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will compare the efficacy of AL in malnourished children versus&#xD;
      non-malnourished children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be designed to detect a minimum crude difference of 8% in Adequate Clinical and&#xD;
      Parasitological Response (ACPR) rate in the population of malnourished children (87% versus&#xD;
      95% in non-malnourished children for both treatment combinations), with a statistical power&#xD;
      of 80% and a 2-sided significance level of 5%. 160 severely malnourished children and 320&#xD;
      non-severely malnourished children will be enrolled. An additional 10% will be added to&#xD;
      account for losses to follow-up and exclusions, yielding to 180 malnourished children and 360&#xD;
      non-malnourished children for each treatment evaluated. To summarize, a total of 540 children&#xD;
      will be recruited as a whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer to the primary objective of the study, we will use multivariate models in which&#xD;
      ACPR will be explained by malnutrition status after adjustment for baseline parasitemia, age,&#xD;
      and other baseline characteristics that differ between the two populations of children. Cox&#xD;
      proportional hazards models and logistic regression models will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A population pharmacokinetics approach will be used, according to the WHO guidelines&#xD;
      recommending 5 sampling windows for lumefantrine. Ideally, each sampling window should&#xD;
      contain an equal number of samples randomly distributed over the duration of the window.&#xD;
      Alternatively, we will use fixed, pre-determined sampling times within the suggested windows,&#xD;
      which will fit other samplings required by the protocol. The 5 blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected in the 180 severely malnourished children enrolled, and in 180 non-severely&#xD;
      malnourished children (randomly chosen), which will allow us to obtain data representative of&#xD;
      the studied populations5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To limit blood sampling in severely malnourished children, we choose to initially restrict&#xD;
      the PK assessment to lumefantrine, which exposure is the most correlated to overall treatment&#xD;
      response5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will have the possibility to add the dosage of artemisinin derivatives in a second phase,&#xD;
      in case of &quot;relatively high&quot; observed rate of early parasitological failures or impaired&#xD;
      parasite clearance. Indeed, the main pharmacodynamics effect initially (during the first 3&#xD;
      days of treatment) is that of the artemisinin component5. If parasites are still present at&#xD;
      day 3, it could be due to under-exposure to the artemisinin component. Otherwise, there is no&#xD;
      reason to suspect such under-exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DSMB will have the responsibility to monitor closely all cases of early parasitological&#xD;
      failure, and to recommend adding artemether PK assessment if they reckon that the rate is&#xD;
      &quot;unexpectedly high&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK data will be analysed using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling (with external partnership).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits and risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefit for the participants will be to receive free of charge treatment for a confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of malaria. Participants will also benefit from regular visits that will ensure&#xD;
      that the treatment cleared the malaria infection and any recurrent malaria episode or&#xD;
      emergence of new diseases will be treated quickly. Malnourished patients will benefit from&#xD;
      the standardized nutritional rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The child will be asked to come to the study site for regular check and will be exposed to a&#xD;
      series of blood sampling that would not happen if he was not enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical and regulatory considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been funded by the MSF innovative fund. The protocol is submitted to the&#xD;
      approval of MSF Ethics Review Board and the Malian Institutional Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A DSMB will closely monitor early parasitological failures, and follow serious adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An external monitoring will be performed during the study.&#xD;
