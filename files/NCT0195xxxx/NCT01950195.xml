  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to look at the safety of using stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)&#xD;
      and Ipilimumab together to treat melanoma that has spread to the brain or spine. Both&#xD;
      Ipilimumab and SRS are used alone for the treatment of melanoma that has spread. Standard of&#xD;
      care uses both of these treatments but not together. By using them together, we expect better&#xD;
      treatment of melanoma, but there might be an increase in side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Ipilimumab&quot; is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of&#xD;
      melanoma that has spread throughout the body. It works by activating your immune system to&#xD;
      fight off cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Stereotactic radiosurgery&quot; (SRS) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for&#xD;
      the treatment of melanoma in the brain or spine. It uses radiation to treat tumors without&#xD;
      needing to cut or use stitches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of combining SRS and Ipilimumab in this research study is investigational. The word&#xD;
      &quot;investigational&quot; means that this combination is not approved for marketing by the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration but is allowed for use in this research study.&#xD;

    <description>A cohort of six (6) patients will be treated at Dosing Schedule 1. If the observed dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rate is less ≤33%, the dose cohort will be expended to a total of 15 patients. Brain and spine metastases will be evaluated as two separate cohorts.&#xD;
If the first schedule produces DLTs in &gt;33% of patients, the Second Dosing schedule will be implemented. If the second dosing schedule produces DLTs in &gt;33% of patients, the Third Dosing schedule will be implemented.&#xD;
After 6 patients were enrolled in a cohort, their safety and toxicity will be continuously monitored till 12 weeks (3 months) after the initial dose of Ipilimumab is given for evaluating dose-limiting toxicities.</description>
