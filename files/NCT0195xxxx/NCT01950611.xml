  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical outcome of relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is poor with current&#xD;
      standard of care approaches. Additionally, standard of care warrants an autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplant to be done once molecular remission is achieved. Unfortunately, the majority of&#xD;
      our patients cannot afford this procedure. We have previously reported the clinical outcome&#xD;
      of relapsed patients who were managed without a stem cell transplants and showed that the&#xD;
      event free survival at 5 years is less than 35%. Pre-clinical data reported from our&#xD;
      laboratory demonstrates that there is significant synergy between arsenic trioxide (ATO;&#xD;
      which is the accepted standard of care agent for relapsed APL) and Bortezomib (a proteasome&#xD;
      inhibitor). We have evaluated this combination extensively in-vitro and this data was&#xD;
      accepted as an oral presentation at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting in 2011.&#xD;
      More recently we have also reported the potential mechanism for this synergy (Poster at ASH&#xD;
      2012). We also have mouse model data which supports these findings. We plan to move this&#xD;
      combination of ATO based therapy combined with Bortezomib to a Phase II clinical trial to&#xD;
      validate these observations. The anticipated potential is that we will have a combination&#xD;
      therapy that is less expensive, cost effective and safe with comparable clinical outcomes to&#xD;
      those treated with the more expensive standard of care which includes an autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplant and which the majority of our patients cannot afford.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        i. Diagnosis of relapsed t(15;17)(PML-RARα) positive APL confirmed by reverse transcriptase&#xD;
        polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii. Normal cardiac function with normal electrocardiogram (QTc less than 500 msec) within&#xD;
        48 hours of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        iii. Patient or guardian willing to give informed consent / assent. Must not have a&#xD;
        psychiatric disorder(s) that would interfere with consent, study participation, or&#xD;
        follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        iv. Patients may have received hydroxyurea, 48 hours or less of all trans retnoic acid&#xD;
        (ATRA), and 1 dose of an anthracycline and still be eligible for participation in this&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        v. Life expectancy of at least 2 weeks after entry on study. vi. No age limit for entry&#xD;
        into study. vii. ECOG performance score 0, 1, or 2. viii. Fertile patients must agree to&#xD;
        use an effective barrier method of contraception (e.g., latex condom, diaphragm, or&#xD;
        cervical cap) to avoid pregnancy while on therapy and for 3 years following the&#xD;
        discontinuation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ix. Have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test prior to the first dose of therapeutic&#xD;
        drugs (if patient is a female of childbearing potential). If breast feeding they should be&#xD;
        willing to stop breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        i. Intracranial bleed at diagnosis. ii. ECOG performance score 3 and above. iii. Severe&#xD;
        uncontrolled infection, fulminant sepsis at diagnosis or documented pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        iv. History of cardiac arrhythmia; symptomatic coronary heart disease; uncontrollable&#xD;
        arterial hypertension (diastolic blood pressure &gt; 115 mm Hg); severe psychiatric disease or&#xD;
        other concomitant diseases which do not comply with the criteria for the participation in&#xD;
        the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        v. Acute hepatitis (Bilirubin ≥ 5mg% or liver enzymes ≥ 4 times above laboratory normal&#xD;
        value) vi. Acute renal failure or serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg% not reversed by hydration. vii.&#xD;
        Patients suffering from an additional malignant tumor. No past history of receiving therapy&#xD;
        for another malignancy, apart from squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
        skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        viii. Pregnancy or lactation. ix. Patients with proven intolerance to the study drugs x.&#xD;
        Inability, missing willingness or anticipated lack of compliance by the PI to participate&#xD;
        in the study. Must not have any other severe concurrent disease and/or uncontrolled medical&#xD;
        conditions, which, in the judgment of the investigator, could predispose patients to&#xD;
        unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
