  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this trial is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the&#xD;
      recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of LDE225 given in combination with standard doses of&#xD;
      paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors. In addition, the preliminary anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity of this combination will be assessed, in particular in ovarian cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open label phase I dose-escalation trial of LDE225 administered once&#xD;
      daily (OD) with Paclitaxel administered weekly for three weeks (days 1, 8, 15) in 28-day&#xD;
      cycles in adult patients with advanced solid tumors that have progressed despite standard&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will consist of three parts. In Part A (dose escalation following a standard 3+3&#xD;
      design), patients with previously treated advanced solid tumors will receive escalating doses&#xD;
      of LDE225 in combination with standard Paclitaxel doses, to define the MTD and the RP2D of&#xD;
      LED225 OD that can be given in combination with standard doses of Paclitaxel. Once the MTD&#xD;
      and RP2D is established in 6 patients, then part B will start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B and C are expansion cohorts in patients with advanced platinum-resistant ovarian&#xD;
      cancer (6 patients each) to further evaluate the safety of the combination and to assess for&#xD;
      any preliminary antitumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B, any prior taxane therapy must have been administered on a 3-week schedule. In Part&#xD;
      C, prior taxane therapy must have been administered on weekly schedule and has to be followed&#xD;
      by a wash-out period of at least 6 months.&#xD;
