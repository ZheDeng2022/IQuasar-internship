  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy is on the rise within the pediatric population. Having food allergy can cause&#xD;
      medical, nutritional and psychological issues in those who suffer with it. Although making&#xD;
      the appropriate diagnosis of food allergy is very important, properly diagnosing food allergy&#xD;
      has been a challenge. Skin prick testing and food-specific IgE testing of the blood can give&#xD;
      positive results that are false. Currently, Oral Food Challenges are the best way to diagnose&#xD;
      a food allergy. Unfortunately, Oral Food Challenges are time consuming and may not be readily&#xD;
      available to suspected food allergy sufferers. This study is designed to examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an allergy-detecting blood test called IMMULITE 2000 manufactured by the&#xD;
      study sponsor, Siemens.&#xD;

             prick test to milk, egg, and/or peanut (diameter of wheal &gt; 3 mm or greater than&#xD;
             negative control) OR a detectable serum food-specific IgE level within the previous 4&#xD;
             months to milk, egg, and/or peanut&#xD;
