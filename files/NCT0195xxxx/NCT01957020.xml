  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic directional vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (ST DVAB) is a standard biopsy&#xD;
      procedure for suspicious findings on mammograms in Western countries for more than 10 years&#xD;
      [1-3], it has replaced the needle localization (NLOC) excisional biopsy for the lesions alike&#xD;
      and was reported to feature a high sensitivity, very low delayed false-negative rate (less&#xD;
      than 2%)[4,5]. Moreover, it causes less scarring, less psychologic stress to patients and&#xD;
      less morbidity compared with needle localization excisional biopsy [6,7]. However, its&#xD;
      sensitivity, accuracy has seldom been reported in Asian countries [8] , since most Asian&#xD;
      women have different breast parenchyma pattern, different breast cancer prevalence.&#xD;
      Therefore, we retrospectively reviewed outcomes of the two groups of patients receiving&#xD;
      either ST DVAB or NLOC excisional biopsy, trying to investigate if ST DVAB can be an&#xD;
      effective alternative to NLOC excisional biopsy in our country.&#xD;

    <measure>The sensitivity of stereotactic vacuum assisted breast biopsy for breast cancer diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years ( July 2008 to June 2013)</time_frame>
    <description>the aforementioned outcome measure-&quot;sensitivity&quot;- is the probability of the stereotactic vaccum assisted breast biopsy can correctly diagnose the breast cancer. And according to statistical definition, it is defined as- for those breast cancer cases, how many of them can be correctly diagnosed by stereotactic breast biopsy.</description>

          -  The indication for ST DVAB was lesions with suspicious nature for malignancy seen on&#xD;
             mammograms which biopsy is necessitated for tissue proof, or probably benign or benign&#xD;
