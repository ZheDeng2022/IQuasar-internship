      The study hypothesis is that nutritional supplementation together with bisphosphonates have a&#xD;
      better preserving effect on bone mineral density (BMD) after hip fracture than&#xD;
      bisphosphonates alone and that nutritional supplementation given postoperatively for 6 months&#xD;
      preserve lean body mass in elderly hip fracture patients.&#xD;

      Inclusion criteria: Men and women, ≥ 60 years of age with a recent fracture of the femoral&#xD;
      neck or trochanter, admitted to any of the four University hospitals in Stockholm, Sweden.&#xD;
      Patients are randomized into three groups by sealed enveloped technique in blocks by 12, thus&#xD;
      assuring that each center had an equal distribution of patients in the three treatment&#xD;
      groups. Patients randomly assigned and followed for 12 months. Each center with a doctor in&#xD;
      charge and a trial nurse. The trial nurse in collaboration with the doctor are responsible of&#xD;
      the randomization procedure and that blood samples are taken in the morning of the first&#xD;
      weekday after inclusion at the ward and further that the dual-energy X-ray (DXA) and all&#xD;
      estimates are done during hospital stay.The pharmacological treatment and nutritional&#xD;
      supplementation starts as soon as the patients are circulatory stable, able to take food by&#xD;
      mouth and are able to sit in an upright position one hour after taking the tablets.Patients&#xD;
      are examined at baseline with a follow up at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>Total hip bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The DXA image is two dimensional and BMD was expressed as areal density, grams per square centimeter (g/cm^2). The change in BMD between baseline, 6 and 12 months was registered.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Total body composition, including lean mass composed of muscle, visceral organs and water (LM), fat mass (FM) and bone mineral content (BMC) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and at 6 and 12 months follow up. The sum of lean mass (LM) and BMC represents fat-free mass (FFM). To normalize for body size, FFM was divided by height squared to calculate fat-free mass index (FFMI, kg/m^2).</description>

        <description>Total body composition, including lean mass composed of muscle, visceral organs and water (LM), fat mass (FM) and bone mineral content (BMC) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and at 6 and 12 months follow up. The sum of lean mass (LM) and BMC represents fat-free mass (FFM). To normalize for body size, FFM was divided by height squared to calculate fat-free mass index (FFMI, kg/m^2).</description>

        <population>Seventy-nine patients were initially included in the study, of whom 67 were available at final follow-up. Calculations revealed that a sample size of 40 patients per group was required to detect a difference in lean mass between groups (power = 80 %, a = 0.05). However, the study was closed after 4 years due to difficulties in recruiting patients and the study was switched to an exploratory design.</population>

        <description>Total body composition, including lean mass composed of muscle, visceral organs and water (LM), fat mass (FM) and bone mineral content (BMC) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and at 6 and 12 months follow up.To normalize for body size, FM was divided by height squared to calculate fat mass index (FMI, kg/m^2).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
        <population>Seventy-nine patients were initially included in the study, of whom 67 were available at final follow-up. Calculations revealed that a sample size of 40 patients per group was required to detect a difference in lean mass between groups (power = 80 %, a = 0.05). However, the study was closed after 4 years due to difficulties in recruiting patients and the study was switched to an exploratory design.</population>
