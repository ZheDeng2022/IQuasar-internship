    <textblock>
      Diffuse pontine gliomas are incurable with currently used treatments. based on data stating&#xD;
      that progressive tumors inhibit immune system, would try to enhance immune system activity&#xD;
      and tumor cell killing. anti PD1 prevents one of the important mechanisms allowing the tumor&#xD;
      to supress the immune system thus we hope it will allow for prolonged control of the tumors&#xD;

      1. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is the most&#xD;
           lethal pediatric malignant disease. Children are usually diagnosed at the age of 6-8&#xD;
           years following a short history of neurological deterioration with often a combination&#xD;
           of cranial nerve dysfunction, ataxia and long tract deficits. Diagnosis is MRI based and&#xD;
           a biopsy is required only when tumor features on imaging are non-classic . As of today&#xD;
           there is no curative treatment regardless of multiple clinical trials done in the past.&#xD;
           Following diagnosis children undergo radiation therapy aiming at symptoms alleviation,&#xD;
           with almost inevitable disease progression taking place several months later. Overall&#xD;
           survival ranges between 9-12 months and death due to disease progression is the rule (1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Relapsed high grade glioma- closed to accrual&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Immunotherapy in brain tumors Data regarding possible role of the immune system in&#xD;
           cancer was first presented in 2001 when Schreiber and Old demonstrated that lymphocytes,&#xD;
           activated by interferon-Î³, inhibit the development of spontaneous and carcinogen-induced&#xD;
           tumors in immunodeficient mice (Shankaran et al, 2001). Later studies demonstrated&#xD;
           progressively decreasing immunogenicity in tumor cells of advanced cancer patients.&#xD;
           Based on these and other data trials incorporating immunotherapy into treatment of&#xD;
           relapsed high grade glioma were constructed. Past trials centered upon active cell based&#xD;
           immunization trying to present the patients' immune system with specific antigens&#xD;
           derived from their tumor while using different techniques to enhance immune response.&#xD;
           These studies has shown positive results but the need to prepare patient specific&#xD;
           vaccination limited their use to highly specialized centers and results were hard to&#xD;
           reproduce.(3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The role of PD-1 in cancer immunotherapy One of the mechanisms through which tumor cells&#xD;
           escape immune detection is activation of the inhibitory lymphocyte receptor PD-1&#xD;
           (programmed death 1). Low grade activation of the T cell receptor-secondary to prolonged&#xD;
           antigen exposure (as found in chronic disease or protracted exposure to malignant cells)&#xD;
           - strongly activates- PD-1. Upon activation, PD-1 drives the lymphocyte towards&#xD;
           apoptosis and reduces cytokine production. PD-1/PD-1 ligand interaction promotes&#xD;
           tolerance of the immune system to a specific antigen (4). Lately, studies reported high&#xD;
           levels of PD-1 expression in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ,and strong expression of&#xD;
           PD-ligand within multiple tumor types including high grade glioma .Both these findings&#xD;
           support the data regarding the role of PD1 in cancer immune escape (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Anti PD-1:Safety and efficacy in human studies Over the last two years data has been&#xD;
           accumulating regarding efficacy and toxicity profile of anti PD-1.Topalian et.al&#xD;
           reported at 2012 outcome of a large phase I study evaluating antiPD-1 in advanced&#xD;
           cancers. Out of 296 participating patients 14% had Grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse&#xD;
           events with most being treated on an outpatient setup . Several patients were diagnosed&#xD;
           with pneumonitis. Most were observed or treated successfully with steroids but three&#xD;
           patients died. Among 236 patients in whom response could be evaluated, objective&#xD;
           responses (complete or partial responses) were observed in those with non-small-cell&#xD;
           lung cancer-a cancer not known to be immunoresponsive (18%), melanoma (28% ), or&#xD;
           renal-cell cancer (27%). Responses were durable; 20 of 31 responses lasted 1 year or&#xD;
           more (6). Further studies report a better toxicity profile with similar efficacy. Hamid&#xD;
           et.al reported outcome of 135 patients with advanced melanoma. Side effects were mostly&#xD;
           grade 1-2 with no treatment related mortality. Response rate among these patients was&#xD;
           38% and most responses lasted at least 7 months (7). A study evaluating anti PD-1 in&#xD;
           chronic HCV patient revealed similar safe profile. One patient out of 66 (10 mg/kg)&#xD;
           experienced an asymptomatic grade 4 ALT elevation coincident with the onset of a 4-log&#xD;
           viral load reduction. Six patients exhibited immune-related adverse events of&#xD;
           mild-to-moderate intensity, including two cases of hyperthyroidism consistent with&#xD;
           autoimmune thyroiditis (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Anti CTLA-4 and anti PD-1 activity in brain tumors Unlike chemotherapy or targeted&#xD;
           therapies, both antiCTLA-4 and anti PD-1 affect T lymphocytes rather than the tumor&#xD;
           itself. Binding to the lymphocyte receptor may take place outside of the central nervous&#xD;
           system. Following binding to their receptor the reactivated lymphocytes penetrate the&#xD;
           brain and arrive to the tumor thus the antibodies are not required to cross the blood&#xD;
           brain barrier. Data regarding activity of antiCTLA-4 within the brain may be retrieved&#xD;
           from retrospective summary of melanoma patients with brain metastasis. These patients&#xD;
           are usually ineligible for clinical trials due to their grim prognosis. Margolin e al&#xD;
           reported partial response in 5 patients and stable disease for 12 weeks in another 4 out&#xD;
           of 51 patients with asymptomatic brain melanoma metastasis. Patients with symptomatic&#xD;
           lesions requiring steroid therapy did not respond. Di Giacomo reported disease&#xD;
           stabilization in 5 and near total response in another 5 patients out of 20 patients with&#xD;
           asymptomatic metastatic melanoma lesions. These data provide proof of principle to the&#xD;
           assumption that this regimen is active within the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Zeng et al reported improved survival of glioblastoma implanted mice following radiation&#xD;
           and anti PD-1. Median survival was 25 days in the control arm, 27 days in the anti-PD-1&#xD;
           antibody arm, 28 days in the radiation arm, and 53 days in the radiation plus anti-PD-1&#xD;
           therapy arm, these data along with tolerability of treatment calls for a clinical trial&#xD;
           assessing this treatment in this population with extremely poor prognosis (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. MDV9300 mechanism of action and early efficacy data&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDV9300 is one of several humanized anti PD1 antibodies currently under investigation in&#xD;
      multiple tumors. A single dose of MDV9300 given to mice with metastatic melanoma,&#xD;
      fibrosarcoma, lung carcinoma or colorectal adenocarcinoma led to significant reduction in&#xD;
      lung and/or liver metastases along with prolonged survival. Combination of MDV9300 with&#xD;
      rituximab, chemotherapy and different types of vaccines has proven to be synergistic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a phase I study enrolling 17 patients with advanced stage hematological malignancies&#xD;
      (AML,CLL, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and multiple myeloma) 5 patients had&#xD;
      prolonged stable disease (averaging 60 weeks) and one patient with follicular lymphoma had a&#xD;
      complete response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase II study was conducted in 72 adult patients with DLBCL following autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation; in this study, MDV9300 was given at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per patient at 3&#xD;
      cycles per patient every 42 days (treatment Days 1, 43, and 85). The PFS and OS 18 months&#xD;
      after transplant were 72% and 85%, respectively. These values compare favorably with results&#xD;
      obtained in previous similar cohorts. In addition, the ORR within the 40 patients who&#xD;
      enrolled in the study with measurable disease was 45% (30%CR, 15%PR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase II study was conducted in 30 adult patients with rituximab-sensitive, grade 1-2&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma who relapsed after 1-4 prior therapies with measurable disease. MDV9300&#xD;
      was administered at 3 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks for 12 infusions and rituximab was dosed at 375&#xD;
      mg/m2 IV weekly for 4 weeks starting 2 weeks after the first infusion of MDV9300. Of the 29&#xD;
      patients eligible for efficacy analysis, 19 had an objective response for an ORR of 66%. CR&#xD;
      was observed in 15 (52%) and PR in 4 (14%). Altogether, 25 (86%) patients had measurable&#xD;
      tumor regression. The ORR of 66% and CR rate of 52% compare favorably with the previously&#xD;
      reported ORR of 40% and CR rate of 11% with single agent rituximab retreatment in relapsed&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma. Median time to response was 88 days. Of note, 17% of the patients&#xD;
      achieved initial response &gt;3 months from first treatment. Median PFS was 19.6 months, and was&#xD;
      not reached for the 19 responders or the 25 patients with measurable tumor regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. in the first part of this study eight patients were enrolled . A total of 73 cycles of&#xD;
      MDV9300 (range 2- 16) were applied. Treatment was well tolerated, with a mild to moderate&#xD;
      fatigue experienced by 10% of the patients following treatment (7 cycles). Nine cycles were&#xD;
      followed by neutropenia (CTCEA grade 1-3). No patient was diagnosed with neutropenia of less&#xD;
      than 500 cells /mm3. The only other grade 3 adverse event was a single event of transient&#xD;
      blood pressure during MDV9300 infusion. Median overall survival was 13 months (6-19 months)&#xD;
      with 50% survival at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCLUSION: Anti PD1 treatment is a well-tolerated therapy with possible activity in DIPG.&#xD;
