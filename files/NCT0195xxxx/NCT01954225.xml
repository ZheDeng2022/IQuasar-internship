      defined as a tear, ulcer or boil at Bhaga (Perianal region) within 2 finger circumference of&#xD;
      it, causing painful abscess when opened is called Bhagandara. The Sanskrit word 'Bhagandara'&#xD;
      has got two components-Bhaga and Darana. Bhaga means perianal region and Darana means to&#xD;
      tear. The ancient Surgeon Sushruta has advocated various types of operations in Sushruta&#xD;
      Samhita. He has advocated Kshara Sutra treatment due to probability of recurrence after&#xD;
      surgery. Sushruta describes many kind of kshara like Palasa, Kadali. The most remarkable is&#xD;
      Udumbara( Ficus Glomerata) among them. The present treatment modality Udumbara Kshara Sutra&#xD;
      has been found effective due to its action of proper drainage of pus from the fistula that&#xD;
      leads to a proper healing and as adjuvant therapy by avoid recurrence in Fistula in ano.&#xD;

    <textblock>

      perianal region and pain with surgical history of incision and drainage for gluteal abscess&#xD;
      done before six month. On local examination Patient had discharging sinus at 8 o' clock&#xD;
      position on right side of Perianal region. Before planning the treatment other aetiologies&#xD;
      were ruled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under short general anaesthesia diagnosis was confirmed by probing as Fistula in ano.&#xD;
      Internal opening of Fistula was confirmed by injecting Methylene Blue dye through external&#xD;
      opening. The track was directed upward in the anal canal without any tributary. Length of the&#xD;
      tract was 3cm, suggestive of low anal fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then Udumbara Sutra was tied covering the entire underlying track for cutting and healing&#xD;
      under all aseptic precaution. The patient was discharged on the next day of procedure. The&#xD;
      Udumbara Sutra was changed skilfully by weekly. To promote healing and to reduce pain and&#xD;
      inflammation oral antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicine were also prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total period of Udumbara Sutra treatment was 1,1/2 month. The track cut through and&#xD;
      simultaneously healed. The patient was observed for a period of 6 month to check for&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sutra or Medicated seton was a standard medicated thread smeared with latex of Udumbara&#xD;
      (Ficus Glomerata), which has quality of cutting and healing.&#xD;
