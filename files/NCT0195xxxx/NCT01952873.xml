  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is universally accepted that high-pressure balloon inflation is required to most&#xD;
      effectively deploy a coronary balloon-expandable stent. However, there is not consensus nor&#xD;
      are there any guidelines regarding the method of balloon inflation, particularly the duration&#xD;
      of inflation. Underexpansion and strut malapposition after stent deployment are among the&#xD;
      most powerful predictors for adverse vessel outcomes. High-pressure inflation for stent&#xD;
      deployment is effective to optimally expand the stent, but unlike in vitro testing in air,&#xD;
      there are poorly distensible plaque elements that may not instantaneously yield to the&#xD;
      balloon pressure. However, these elements may ultimately yield to prolonged inflation. Most&#xD;
      clinical interventional cardiologists inflate for a relatively short period (15-30 sec). The&#xD;
      investigators have noted that when balloon pressure is maintained at a certain pressure level&#xD;
      it tends to decrease over time, and may require 60-180 or more seconds to maintain pressure&#xD;
      stability. This finding implies that plaque elements are yielding slowly over time to the&#xD;
      increased pressure, thus increasing expansion, and suggests that a prolonged inflation until&#xD;
      balloon pressure stabilizes is more effective than a rapid inflation/deflation sequence to&#xD;
      fully expand and appose the stent to the vessel wall. At present there is no consensus on&#xD;
      stent deployment strategy. It is our hypothesis that prolonged inflation is superior to the&#xD;
      more commonly used strategy of rapid inflation/deflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal coherence tomography (OCT), a novel technology that measures near-infrared light&#xD;
      reflections and translates them into a 2D image, has an axial resolution nearly 10-times that&#xD;
      of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Thus it is possible to examine the extent of stent&#xD;
      apposition and stent expansion using this modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current randomized trial tests the hypothesis that prolonged balloon inflation until a&#xD;
      stable balloon pressure is maintained is more effective than a rapid inflation/deflation&#xD;
      sequence when performed to the same balloon inflation pressure.&#xD;
