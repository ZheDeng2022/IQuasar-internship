  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year millions of Americans suffer concussions as a result of accidents in sports, at&#xD;
      work or through military service. Adolescents take the longest to recover from the effects of&#xD;
      concussion yet no therapy exists to help speed their recovery. This project aims to see if a&#xD;
      program of early guided aerobic exercise can safely speed recovery from concussion in&#xD;
      adolescents and investigates some reasons for why this type of therapy could be effective.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most children with concussion recover spontaneously within 2-4 weeks of injury but&#xD;
      approximately 30% experience prolonged post-concussive symptoms (PPCS), impacting quality of&#xD;
      life. There are no evidence-based therapies for acute pediatric concussion. Instead, current&#xD;
      consensus-based-recommendations include physical and cognitive rest as the mainstays of&#xD;
      treatment despite evidence to the contrary that excessive rest prolongs recovery and that&#xD;
      early (first week) activity reduces PPCS incidence. The investigators were the first to&#xD;
      demonstrate that a systematic evaluation of exercise tolerance using the Buffalo Concussion&#xD;
      Treadmill Test (BCTT) to prescribe a guided exercise prescription in those with PPCS safely&#xD;
      sped recovery. The investigators have preliminary data that exercise may speed recovery if&#xD;
      administered within the first week after sport-related concussion (SRC). Concussion is&#xD;
      associated with adverse effects on the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and control of cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow (CBF). The investigators have shown that sub-threshold aerobic exercise reduces&#xD;
      symptoms in PPCS in association with normalization of ANS function and CBF control, providing&#xD;
      a potential mechanism of action as well as target engagement for this non-pharmacological&#xD;
      therapy. An important translational aspect is that the BCTT would be for clinicians a&#xD;
      clinical proxy of concussion physiology that would help make the difficult&#xD;
      return-to-activity/play decision more objective and physiologically-based. The investigators'&#xD;
      long-term goals are to develop therapies that safely speed recovery from concussion, return&#xD;
      youth back to their typical activities, actively prevent PPCS, and develop practical&#xD;
      physiological tools for clinicians. The overall objective of this application is to determine&#xD;
      if early guided aerobic exercise speeds recovery from SRC. The investigators specifically&#xD;
      test underlying mechanisms of action for faster recovery by measuring ANS function (the cold&#xD;
      pressor test, CPT) and CBF (by Arterial Spin Labeling, ASL). Age- and sex-matched healthy&#xD;
      controls will be recruited to quantify physiological CBF differences and serve as a normative&#xD;
      control group. The investigators will examine these questions in a randomized, multisite&#xD;
      controlled trial in adolescents aged 13-18y with acute SRC by pursuing the following two&#xD;
      specific aims: (1) determine if guided aerobic exercise/education speeds recovery after acute&#xD;
      concussion in adolescents compared with (a) rest/education with a gradual return to&#xD;
      activities, (i.e., current recommendation) and (b) a progressive stretching program/education&#xD;
      (attention placebo); and (2) as secondary aims the investigators will quantify the effects of&#xD;
      each intervention in Aim 1 on CBF and on autonomic function (CPT), which serve as relevant&#xD;
      and objective physiological measures of autonomic regulation of CBF following concussion.&#xD;
      This project will provide critical evidence to support the role of guided aerobic exercise&#xD;
      for the active treatment of acute concussion and for a physiological mechanism(s) for its&#xD;
      effect, which would lead to a paradigm shift from the current passive approach to treatment.&#xD;
      The translational aspect of the project is unique and would have immediate impact to help&#xD;
      clinicians determine recovery based on physiology rather than symptoms. A controlled active&#xD;
      approach to concussion treatment may also substantially reduce the incidence of PPCS in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
