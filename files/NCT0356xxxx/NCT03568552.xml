    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to test the effectiveness of the Patient Decision Aid for Opioid Use&#xD;
      Disorder (PtDA-MAT) by conducting a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial in CA H&amp;SS&#xD;
      (stratified by rural vs. non-rural areas) for adults with OUD. Patient outcomes will be&#xD;
      tracked by (1) personal assessments (baseline, 3 months, and 6 months): drug use, overdose,&#xD;
      healthcare utilization, and (2) clinical and administrative records (over approximately 24&#xD;
      months): drug treatment status and retention, physical and mental health diagnoses, arrest,&#xD;
      incarceration, controlled substance use, and mortality. Multilevel models will be applied to&#xD;
      test the intervention effects, controlling for possible temporal trends.&#xD;

      In response to RFA-DA-18-005 (Expanding Medication Assisted Treatment for Opioid Use&#xD;
      Disorders in the Context of the SAMHSA Opioid STR Grants, R21/R33), this project will develop&#xD;
      and test a patient decision support tool called Patient Decision Aid for Medication-Assisted&#xD;
      Treatment (PtDA-MAT) for use in the CA H&amp;SS. The PtDA-MAT is designed to (1) improve patient&#xD;
      knowledge and involvement and to subsequently improve treatment adherence and outcomes and&#xD;
      (2) to support clinicians in informing and communicating with their patients with OUD along a&#xD;
      continuum of care. The 3 year project will assess the effectiveness of the PtDA-MAT in a&#xD;
      stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial in CA H&amp;SS (stratified by rural vs. non-rural areas)&#xD;
      for adults with OUD. Patient outcomes will be tracked by (1) personal assessments (baseline,&#xD;
      3 months, and 6 months): drug use, overdose, healthcare utilization, and (2) clinical and&#xD;
      administrative records (over an average of 24 months): drug treatment status and retention,&#xD;
      physical and mental health diagnoses, arrest, incarceration, controlled substance use, and&#xD;
      mortality. Multilevel models will be applied to test the intervention effects, controlling&#xD;
      for possible temporal trends.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The Patient Decision Aid for Medication Assisted Therapy (PtDA-MAT) will be tested by patients and clinicians during actual visits with OUD patients to assess its acceptability and effectiveness. We will track patients receiving PtDAT-MAT using their clinical and administration data over a 24-month period to assess outcomes associated with PtDAT-MAT. Participating clinics will be randomly selected in sequence to implement the intervention.</intervention_model_description>
