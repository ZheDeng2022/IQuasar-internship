      To Study the Effects of Lipid Emulsion on Hemodynamics in Organophosphate Compound Poisoning&#xD;
      Objectives: To study the effect of administration of intravenous lipid emulsion on&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters, incidence of adverse effects in patients with organophosphate&#xD;
      poisoning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Lipid emulsion has been used to revert toxicities of lipophilic drugs, toxins&#xD;
      (especially lignocaine) and in critically ill patients. Though the safety has been&#xD;
      established, the effect on hemodynamics in Organophosphate (OP) poisoned patients has never&#xD;
      been studied. Hence this study is underway to fill those lacunae and evaluate the safety&#xD;
      profile of lipid emulsion in organophosphate poisoned patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The study is a prospective open label pilot study, which is underway at a&#xD;
      tertiary care hospital in North India. Patients with history and clinical features of OP&#xD;
      poisoning meeting the inclusion and exclusion parameters are being treated according to&#xD;
      institutional protocols. Along with routine treatment a single dose of 20% lipid emulsion is&#xD;
      being administered on admission to patients after obtaining consent. Patients are being&#xD;
      followed up till discharge or death. Hemodynamic parameters and adverse effects following&#xD;
      lipid emulsion administration are being studied over various intervals of time.&#xD;

      Methods A prospective open label pilot study was conducted with an aim to study the safety&#xD;
      and effects of 20% lipid emulsion in OP compound poisoning. The objectives were to study the&#xD;
      effects on hemodynamic parameters, the effect on morbidity, mortality and the occurrence of&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients, â‰¥ 13 years, with history of consumption of OP compound and clinical features of&#xD;
      mild, moderate or severe OP compound poisoning as per the Peradeniya score (Table 1),&#xD;
      admitted to the emergency department during the study period from September 2015 - December&#xD;
      2016 were included after written informed consent. Consent was obtained from the nearest kin&#xD;
      if the presentation was with altered mental state. The recruitment began after approval from&#xD;
      the institute's ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic liver or kidney disease, history of acute or chronic pancreatitis in&#xD;
      the past, those with combined poisoning with non OP compounds and asymptomatic patients were&#xD;
      not included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At presentation, detailed history was sought and subjects were examined for signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of OP poisoning. Vital parameters (pulse rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate)&#xD;
      were noted. Blood samples were drawn for assessing baseline electrolytes, renal functions,&#xD;
      haematological parameters and serum amylase. All patients received a single dose of 100mL of&#xD;
      20% lipid emulsion as an intra-venous infusion over 1 hour along with routine treatment as&#xD;
      per institution protocols. Atropine was administered to patients by doubling dose method,&#xD;
      which comprised of administering atropine starting from 2mg and to double the dose and&#xD;
      administer till complete atropinization. Following this an infusion of 10-20 percent of the&#xD;
      atropinizing dose was given every hour. In view of the controversial role of pralidoxime, it&#xD;
      was not included in the study. The cases were followed up until recovery/death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were under observation for their vital signs, pupil size, fasciculation,&#xD;
      respiratory crackles, amount of oral secretions and, if intubated, tracheal secretion. In&#xD;
      addition they underwent monitoring of vital parameters every ten minutes during the course of&#xD;
      lipid administration for the first thirty minutes followed by every fifteen minutes during&#xD;
      the next 2 hours and every 2nd hourly thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic parameters, haematological, biochemical parameters, adverse effects and outcomes&#xD;
      were compared at various intervals of time following administration of lipid emulsion, up to&#xD;
      72 hours, with those at the baseline; hemodynamic parameters were also compared with historic&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was to study the change in hemodynamic parameters (pulse rate, systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure, mean arterial pressure and respiratory rate) after delivery of lipid emulsion&#xD;
      in OP poisoned individuals up to 72 hours and compare any changes in the hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters with that of historic controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes were to study the effects on case fatality (in-hospital until discharge or&#xD;
      death), morbidity (duration of hospitalization, duration of mechanical ventilation, dose of&#xD;
      atropine given) and the occurrence of complications including those related to lipid emulsion&#xD;
      and hospital acquired infections.&#xD;
