  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RGX-121 is a gene therapy which is intended to deliver a functional copy of the&#xD;
      iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) gene to the central nervous system. This study is a safety and&#xD;
      dose ranging study to determine whether RGX-121 is safe and tolerated by patients with MPS&#xD;
      II.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MPS II is a rare X-linked recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in the&#xD;
      iduronate-2-sulfatase gene (IDS). Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant&#xD;
      idursulfase (ELAPRASE®) is the only approved product for the treatment of Hunter syndrome,&#xD;
      however, ERT as currently administered does not cross the Blood Brain Barrier and is&#xD;
      therefore unable to address the unmet need in MPS II patients with CNS (neurocognition and&#xD;
      behavior) involvement. RGX-121 is designed to deliver a healthy gene to cells in the CNS and&#xD;
      iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S) where it may be secreted by transduced cells which may&#xD;
      cross-correct non-transduced cells by taking up the functional enzyme. This is a Phase I/II,&#xD;
      first-in-human, multicenter, open-label, single arm dose escalation study of RGX-121. Three,&#xD;
      one time doses of RGX-121 will be studied in approximately 18 pediatric subjects who have&#xD;
      severe MPS II. Safety will be the primary focus for the initial 24 weeks after treatment&#xD;
      (primary study period) whereupon, subjects will continue to be assessed (safety and efficacy)&#xD;
      for up to a total of 104 weeks following treatment with RGX-121.-121.&#xD;
