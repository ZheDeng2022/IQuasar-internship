  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Taxane-induced arthralgia and myalgia syndrome (TAMS) is one of the most common side effects&#xD;
      of taxane chemotherapy. This prospective randomized controlled trial will evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of gabapentin administered prophylactically on days -2 to +5 during the&#xD;
      taxane-portion of chemotherapy for adjuvant breast cancer patients on reducing TAMS. This&#xD;
      will be compared to observation alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The taxanes are a class of anticancer agents that interfere with microtubule disassembly.&#xD;
      They have been an integral part of adjuvant breast cancer treatment since the early 2000s.&#xD;
      Taxane-induced arthralgia and myalgia syndrome (TAMS) is one of the most common side effects&#xD;
      of taxane chemotherapy. It is characterized by muscle and joint pain that often starts 24-48&#xD;
      hours after taxane-based chemotherapy, and lasts for 5-7 days. TAMS can significantly impact&#xD;
      the level of functioning and quality of life of early-stage breast cancer patients and can&#xD;
      occur in up to 87% of women during their chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have been conducted looking at medications to prevent TAMS. Unfortunately, these&#xD;
      are primarily small retrospective or case series studies, and no standard of care has been&#xD;
      established. Results from studies looking at antihistamines, corticosteroids, opioids,&#xD;
      amifostine, glutamine, Shakuyaku-Kanzou-to (a Japanese herbal medicine), are conflicting&#xD;
      and/or inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gabapentin, a structural analog of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), is a second-line&#xD;
      antiepileptic and is also widely used to treat neuropathic pain syndromes. Many oncologists&#xD;
      already use prophylactic gabapentin in an attempt to prevent TAMS, however this is supported&#xD;
      primarily by small case series and retrospective data, and is not considered standard of&#xD;
      care. Unfortunately, a systemic review found no randomized controlled trial evidence&#xD;
      supporting these findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      gabapentin administered prophylactically on days -2 to +5 during the taxane-portion of&#xD;
      chemotherapy for adjuvant breast cancer patients on reducing TAMS. The hypothesis for this&#xD;
      study is that prophylactic gabapentin is more effective than observation in reducing the&#xD;
      severity of taxane-induced arthralgias and myalgias syndrome in breast cancer patients&#xD;
      undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
