  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) is a rapid onset, high intensity and short duration pain&#xD;
      episode, which takes place within stable background pain control. It significantly affects&#xD;
      the quality of life of patients with cancer and their ability to function normally. Rapid&#xD;
      onset opioids and immediate-release oral opioids (e.g. morphine sulfate, hydromorphone, and&#xD;
      oxycodone) are the standard treatment for BTcP. Because of the limited availability, high&#xD;
      cost, complicated titration and the high risks of overdosing with rapid-onset opioids, most&#xD;
      often the preferred choice of treatment is immediate-release oral opioids. However, this&#xD;
      approach might not always offer optimal speed for onset of action and duration to match the&#xD;
      rapid nature of an episode of BTcP. In order to seek a potential alternative to&#xD;
      immediate-release oral opioids, we are proposing to test the onset of action of PPP001 to&#xD;
      rapidly alleviate breakthrough pain in patients with cancer. We will also examine the safety&#xD;
      and the efficacy on pain intensity of PPP001 within this population.&#xD;

      The study is a randomized, open-label crossover comparison study: This will be a 10-week&#xD;
      open-label randomized study to evaluate the effect of inhaled PPP001 as compared to morphine&#xD;
      sulfate or hydromorphone or oxycodone to improve for the treatment of BTcP. After proper&#xD;
      screening and verified inclusion/exclusion criteria, 20 consecutive subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
