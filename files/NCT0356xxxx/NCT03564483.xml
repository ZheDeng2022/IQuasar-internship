  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In addition to evaluating treatment outcomes, tissue samples and swabs will be collected as&#xD;
      part of this study to allow physicians to better understand Extramammary Paget's Disease&#xD;
      (EMPD). The researchers also want to learn more about the microorganisms (microbiome) that&#xD;
      live on or near the areas of skin affected by EMPD, in order to better understand this&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study. Patients with Extramammary Paget's Disease (EMPD),&#xD;
      specifically women with vulvar/perianal Paget's disease, will be identified during&#xD;
      presentation to either the Dermatology Department or Gynecologic Surgery department at Mayo&#xD;
      Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During physical exam, the patients will undergo skin/rectum/vagina cultures to evaluate the&#xD;
      microbiome in these patients. The patients will be entered into the established care pathway&#xD;
      for EMPD. They will be asked to complete sexual health questionnaires including: The Women's&#xD;
      Health Clinical Questionnaires include the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS)1, Perceived Stress&#xD;
      Scale2, Brief Resilience Scale (BRS)3, LASA Quality of Life Assessment4, Female Sexual&#xD;
      Function Index (FSFI)5, Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised6, Kansas Marital Satisfaction&#xD;
      Scale7, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be referred to Women's Health Clinic as part of the care pathway and will&#xD;
      undergo preoperative genital sensory testing (GST) which measures sensation of the clitoris,&#xD;
      vulva, and vagina. The patients will have a Dermatology consultation and Moh's micrographic&#xD;
      procedure as indicated. If choosing to proceed with surgical intervention, the patients will&#xD;
      then undergo an excisional procedure with the Department of Gynecologic surgery. Swabs, urine&#xD;
      and tissue will be collected prior to procedures or surgery for microbiome analysis.&#xD;
