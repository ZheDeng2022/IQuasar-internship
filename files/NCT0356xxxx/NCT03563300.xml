  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that the gluten-containing grains can be responsible for human diseases related&#xD;
      to gluten exposure. These forms of gluten intolerance represent a heterogeneous set of&#xD;
      conditions, including celiac disease (CD), wheat allergy (WA) and not celiac gluten&#xD;
      sensitivity (NCGS), that combined seems to affect about 5-10% of the general population. NCGS&#xD;
      is the most recent gluten-related disease, characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal&#xD;
      symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food, in subjects in whom either&#xD;
      celiac disease or wheat allergy previously has been excluded. However, as it is not known&#xD;
      what component of the cereals causes the symptoms in NCGS patients, the investigators prefer&#xD;
      the label of &quot;Not-celiac wheat sensitivity&quot; (NCWS). Typically, the NCWS diagnosis is made by&#xD;
      exclusion. Furthermore, similarly to CD, the investigators had demonstrated that NCWS may be&#xD;
      associated with other autoimmune disease (i.e. Hashimoto's thyroiditis). Among these&#xD;
      autoimmune conditions, in our daily out clinic work, the investigators have observed an&#xD;
      association between self-reported NCWS and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Our&#xD;
      preliminary observational data indicate that some FMF patients relate their symptoms&#xD;
      (especially gastrointestinal) to gluten assumption, then excluding it from diet and using&#xD;
      gluten-free products, with partial remission of gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore, FMF and&#xD;
      NCGS share some clinical features, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, arthralgia and&#xD;
      arthritis, and tend to be commonly associated with other inflammatory and autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases. This study has 2 major aims: 1.To evaluate the real relationship between the wheat&#xD;
      ingestion and the gastrointestinal manifestations presented by FMF patients, self-reporting a&#xD;
      NCWS. 2. To identify possible immunologic markers that may explain the mechanism underling&#xD;
      FMF abdominal attack and wheat ingestion.&#xD;

      It is known that the gluten-containing grains can be responsible for human diseases related&#xD;
      to gluten exposure. These forms of gluten intolerance represent a heterogeneous set of&#xD;
      conditions, including celiac disease (CD), wheat allergy (WA) and not celiac gluten&#xD;
      sensitivity (NCGS), that combined seems to affect about 5-10% of the general population. NCGS&#xD;
      is the most recent gluten-related disease. It is characterized by intestinal (i.e. irritable&#xD;
      bowel syndrome, bloating, dyspepsia) and extra-intestinal symptoms (i.e. fatigue, headache,&#xD;
      numbness, mental confusion) related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food, in subjects&#xD;
      in whom either celiac disease or wheat allergy previously has been excluded. However, as it&#xD;
      is not known what component of the cereals causes the symptoms in NCGS patients, the&#xD;
      investigators prefer the label of &quot;Not-celiac wheat sensitivity&quot; (NCWS). Typically, the NCWS&#xD;
      diagnosis is made by exclusion. In fact, in previous studies the investigators showed that&#xD;
      patients self-reporting gastrointestinal symptoms related to wheat ingestion, could suffer&#xD;
      not only from CD or WA, but from small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      diseases also. Furthermore, similarly to CD, the investigators had demonstrated that NCWS may&#xD;
      be associated with other autoimmune disease (i.e. Hashimoto's thyroiditis). Among these&#xD;
      autoimmune conditions, in our daily out clinic work, the investigators have observed an&#xD;
      association between self-reported NCWS and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Familial&#xD;
      Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most frequent hereditary autoinflammatory disease,&#xD;
      characterized by self-limited recurrent attacks of fever and serositis, resulting in pain in&#xD;
      the abdomen, chest, joints and muscles. FMF is caused by mutations in MEFV gene, which&#xD;
      encodes pyrin. Pyrin is implicated in a complex interplay with proteins involved in Toll-like&#xD;
      receptor (TLR) signalling, PYD superfamily and procaspase-1 activation, suggesting a&#xD;
      controlling role in inflammatory response. Abdominal pain is the most frequent symptom&#xD;
      encountered in FMF; 95% of patients report this as the main symptom during at least some of&#xD;
      their fever episodes, while 50% cite such an 'abdominal attack' as the first symptom of their&#xD;
      disease. Presentation of a typical abdominal attack will resemble that of 'acute abdomen'.&#xD;
      Onset is sudden and acute, leading to rapid development of symptoms within 1-2 hours. The&#xD;
      abdominal pain is usually diffuse throughout the entire abdomen, although in some cases it&#xD;
      may be localized; it may be very severe in intensity. This may be accompanied by any bowel&#xD;
      activity, ranging from constipation (most often) to diarrhoea. The intensity of symptoms and&#xD;
      signs of an inflammatory attack in FMF will decrease spontaneously after 12-24 hours, and&#xD;
      usually, the attack resolves over the following 48 hours. Thus, after about 3 days the&#xD;
      patient will be symptom-free again. Furthermore, so-called &quot;incomplete&quot; abdominal attacks may&#xD;
      occur in FMF patients. These differ from 'typical' abdominal attacks in 1 or 2 features,&#xD;
      which may include absence of fever, absence of 'true' peritonitis and/or localisation of the&#xD;
      abdominal pain to a single specific abdominal area, minimal change in acute phase parameters.&#xD;
      It may be difficult to differentiate an 'incomplete' abdominal attack from other causes of&#xD;
      abdominal pain, mainly because of its atypical presentation. Our preliminary observational&#xD;
      data indicate that some FMF patients relate their symptoms (especially gastrointestinal) to&#xD;
      gluten assumption, then excluding it from diet and using gluten-free products, with partial&#xD;
      remission of gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore, FMF and NCGS share some clinical features,&#xD;
      such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, arthralgia and arthritis, and tend to be commonly&#xD;
      associated with other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. However, to our knowledge, a&#xD;
      relationship between FMF and NCGS has not been previously investigated. This study has 2&#xD;
      major aims: 1.To evaluate the real relationship between the wheat ingestion and the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal manifestations presented by FMF patients, self-reporting a NCWS. The study&#xD;
      will be done after a period of gluten-free diet, administering wheat flour or placebo for 15&#xD;
      days. 2. To identify possible immunologic markers (histological features, expression of&#xD;
      cytokines and other constitutive mucosal proteins from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and&#xD;
      mucosal lymphocytes) that may explain the mechanism underling FMF abdominal attack and wheat&#xD;
      ingestion.&#xD;
