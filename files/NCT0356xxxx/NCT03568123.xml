  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee replacement is an established treatment for late stage osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee&#xD;
      (Charnley et al. 1961). Recently, Zimmer-Biomet have introduced Persona Total Knee system&#xD;
      with design changes that include asymmetric tibia plate, increased medial pivoting and more&#xD;
      extensive choices in respect to poly thickness, all with the purpose to improve balancing,&#xD;
      stability and longevity. One design change that is introduced is the medial congruent (MC)&#xD;
      polyethylene to be used instead of standard cruciate retaining (CR) design. The theoretic&#xD;
      proposed benefit of MC polyethylene bearing is improved kinematics mimicking native knee&#xD;
      motion. However, currently no studies exist evaluating outcome following use of MC&#xD;
      polyethylene bearing. Therefore such design changes and proposed benefits need to be&#xD;
      evaluated in a prospective clinical trail, with focus on patient safety, satisfaction and&#xD;
      implant durability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project the investigators wish to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate stability and fixation, intra-operative and postop complications, survivorship and&#xD;
      patient reported outcome measures following primary total knee replacement using MC&#xD;
      polyethylene bearing compared to CR polyethylene bearing with Persona Total Knee for&#xD;
      treatment of knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is carried out as a 2-arm randomized controlled single-blinded trial, in which&#xD;
      the clinical and radiological outcomes after treatment of knee osteoarthritis with insertion&#xD;
      of either 1) Persona Total Knee System with MC polyethylene bearing or 2) Persona Total Knee&#xD;
      System with CR polyethylene bearing are compared. Recruitment of participants to this project&#xD;
      is expected to begin in October 2016 or as soon as permission from the Regional Ethics&#xD;
      Committee and the Danish Data Protections Agency is obtained. A total of 60 participants are&#xD;
      to be included at Hvidovre University Hospital. Recruitment is expected completed after a&#xD;
      period of 1.5 year. The project is expected to be completed 2 years after recruitment of the&#xD;
      last participant (2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are seen on an outpatient basis at 3 months, 1 and 2 years postoperatively. RSA&#xD;
      is performed postoperatively and at all outpatient follow-ups. Dynamic RSA is performed at 1&#xD;
      year follow-up. The patients will be followed for survival through The Danish Knee&#xD;
      Arthroplasty Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is financed by Zimmer-Biomet®, Warsaw, Indiana, USA. The primary investigator of&#xD;
      this project has independently initiated the project.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Knee replacement is an established treatment for late stage osteoarthritis (OA) of&#xD;
      the knee (Charnley et al. 1961). There are different approaches to prosthetic replacement and&#xD;
      current practices and designs are often based on limited evidence (Plate et al. 2012). There&#xD;
      have been individual cohort studies, indirect comparisons and retrospective studies to test&#xD;
      the efficacy of a variety of different total knee replacement devices but there are very few&#xD;
      high quality investigations of new paradigms or significant design change. Those studies that&#xD;
      do exist have usually been undertaken to address a combination of design changes and many&#xD;
      involve only short-term assessments (Mäkelä et al. 2008). Ongoing research and development&#xD;
      programs for knee replacement are increasingly taking account of the needs of the changing&#xD;
      characteristics of the late stage OA knee population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an increasing demand for joint replacement in a younger population (Mäkelä et al.&#xD;
      2014). Due to the changing demographics of joint replacement, the population of younger&#xD;
      patients are seeking options that not only correct their disease or deformity, but do not&#xD;
      limit them in activity (Geerdink et al. 2009). Activities of daily living take higher&#xD;
      priority in this patient group, and patients needing total joint replacement do not have many&#xD;
      options that accommodate higher levels of activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that modern implant designs can potentially improve outcome. Therefore new&#xD;
      implants are introduced to the marked with the theoretical benefit of improved implant&#xD;
      survival and superior patient reported outcomes. Within Total knee arthroplasty, design&#xD;
      changes are introduced in attempt to improve knee kinematics, improve alignment and&#xD;
      functionality, but those potential improvements need to be evaluated Recently, Zimmer-Biomet&#xD;
      have introduced Persona Total Knee system with design changes that include asymmetric tibia&#xD;
      plate, increased medial pivoting and more extensive choices in respect to poly thickness, all&#xD;
      with the purpose to improve balancing, stability and longevity. One design change that is&#xD;
      introduced is the medial congruent (MC) polyethylene to be used instead of standard cruciate&#xD;
      retaining (CR) design. The theoretic proposed benefit of MC polyethylene bearing is improved&#xD;
      kinematics mimicking native knee motion. However, currently no studies exist evaluating&#xD;
      outcome following use of MC polyethylene bearing. Therefore such design changes and proposed&#xD;
      benefits need to be evaluated in a prospective clinical trail, with focus on patient safety,&#xD;
      satisfaction and implant durability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) is to evaluate the outcome and&#xD;
      safety of a newly designed polyethylene bearing by comparing it with a control group of&#xD;
      patients implanted with an established polyethylene bearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device description&#xD;
&#xD;
      The devices to be used in this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Zimmer-Biomet Persona Total Knee System&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Zimmer-Biomet Persona Total Knee System is a novel total knee system developed by&#xD;
      Zimmer-Biomet. Components are available in numerous designs for both systems, with cemented&#xD;
      as well as cementless fixations and with numerous polyethylene inserts to accommodate the&#xD;
      surgical demand based on patient characteristics. Both MC polyethylene bearing and CR&#xD;
      polyethylene bearing will be used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Femoral component:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only cemented femoral components will be used for this study. Both standard as well as narrow&#xD;
      femoral components will be used, depending on the patient anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tibial component:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only cemented tibial components will be used for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polyethylene materials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional polyethylene will be used for patients &gt;65 years old and Vitamine-E infused poly&#xD;
      insert for patients ≤ 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All devises are European Conformity (CE) marked and used as intended by the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project design Project type This project is carried out as a 2-arm randomized controlled&#xD;
      single-blinded trial, in which the clinical and radiological outcomes after treatment of hip&#xD;
      osteoarthritis with insertion of either 1) Persona Total Knee System with MC polyethylene&#xD;
      bearing or 2) Persona Total Knee System with CR polyethylene bearing. Allocation of the&#xD;
      participants to one of the two treatment groups is done intraoperatively. Non-transparent&#xD;
      envelopes are used for the randomization process. Participants are unaware of which&#xD;
      prosthesis they receive and the research coordinator handling the collected questionnaires&#xD;
      postoperatively is also unaware of which prosthesis the participant has received. The&#xD;
      research assistant handling both standard RSA as well as dynamic RSA analysis is also unaware&#xD;
      of which prosthesis the participant has received&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatment Patients who decline to participate in the study as well as patients who&#xD;
      are not included or excluded from the study will be treated with a standard Total Knee&#xD;
      Arthroplasty (TKA) implant and standard surgical care. Persona Total Knee System with a CR&#xD;
      polyethylene liner has been used as a standard implant of choice at Hvidovre Hospital since&#xD;
      January 2016 for patients suited for a CR implant. Patients with insufficient posterior&#xD;
      cruciate ligament (PCL) and other patients unsuited for a CR implant receive a posterior&#xD;
      stabilized (LPS) NexGen TKA. All knees are performed in a standardized fast-track setup with&#xD;
      the same surgical technique as described below, immediate mobilization after surgery and&#xD;
      clinical and radiological controls after 3 months, 1 and 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule Recruitment of participants to this project is expected to begin in October&#xD;
      2016 or as soon as permission from the Regional Ethics Committee and the Danish Data&#xD;
      Protections Agency is obtained. A total of 60 participants are to be included at Hvidovre&#xD;
      University Hospital. Recruitment is expected completed after a period of 1 year. The project&#xD;
      is expected to be completed 2 years after recruitment of the last participant (2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant termination It is recognized that the subject's participation in this study is&#xD;
      entirely voluntary, and that she/he may refuse to participate and may withdraw from&#xD;
      participation at any time without jeopardy to any future medical care. It is also recognized&#xD;
      that the investigator, at his/her discretion, may withdraw a subject from this study based&#xD;
      upon his/her professional judgment, e.g. in the event of deep infection leading to&#xD;
      replacement of the prosthesis or long-term immobilization because of comorbidity. If a&#xD;
      participant is withdrawn or rescinds their consent, a &quot;Lost to Follow-up&quot; case report form&#xD;
      will be completed detailing the reason for the participant's withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data recording Data relevant for this project will be registered in a data sheet. An&#xD;
      individual data sheet will be kept for each recruited participant. Data will also be&#xD;
      aggregated and stored electronically. The storage of data will be done according to the rules&#xD;
      posted by the Danish Data Protection Agency. This project will be notified to and approved by&#xD;
      the Danish Data Protection Agency before recruitment of participants is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant population in Denmark Study population will consist of 60 participants with knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis set to receive primary total knee arthroplasty. The participants will be&#xD;
      included at Hvidovre University Hospital, (see participating centers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants Patients at are randomized to receive either 1) Persona Total Knee&#xD;
      System with MC polyethylene bearing or 2) Persona Total Knee System with CR polyethylene&#xD;
      bearing. Participants may be excluded intraoperatively if the PCL is found insufficient and&#xD;
      LPS prosthesis is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this 2-arm randomized controlled study the primary endpoint is implant migration measured&#xD;
      by RSA. Secondary outcomes are: Oxford Knee Score (OKS), Oxford Knee Score -Activity &amp;&#xD;
      Participation Questionnaire (APQ), anchoring questions, EQ-5D, Forgotten Joint Score and knee&#xD;
      motion measured using dynamic RSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's primary outcome measure is implant migration measured by RSA. If the minimally&#xD;
      relevant total migration of the prosthesis measured by RSA is set to 0.2 mm then a total of&#xD;
      18 participants must be enrolled in each study group to show a statistically significant&#xD;
      difference (95 % confidence, 80 % power). In this study 2 x 30 participants are included.&#xD;
      This will insure sufficient statistical power despite intraoperative exclusion and dropout of&#xD;
      40% at last follow-up and .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power calculation is based on reaching sufficient power when a comparison of the two&#xD;
      study groups is carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant inclusion All participants will receive oral and written information about the&#xD;
      project before consent. It is the responsibility of the primary investigator that the&#xD;
      information to the participant is adequate. Participants are included when signed consent&#xD;
      from the participant is obtained. Project information is then given in an undisturbed&#xD;
      environment (in a closed examination room) by an authorized investigator of this project.&#xD;
      Project information is given at the first outpatient consultation, when treatment with&#xD;
      insertion of a TKA is decided. A nurse is present when the information is given. Participants&#xD;
      are informed about the right to having a dependent present when project information is given.&#xD;
      Participants are informed that a period of consideration of at least 2 weeks is an&#xD;
      opportunity along with the right to a second consultation. Signed consent, however, is to be&#xD;
      given latest at admittance before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oral information is in accordance with the written information and is adjusted to the&#xD;
      age, educational level and social conditions of the participant. It is ensured that the&#xD;
      participant has understood the content of both the oral and written information before signed&#xD;
      consent is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is recognized that the subject's participation in this study is entirely voluntary, and&#xD;
      that she/he may refuse to participate and may withdraw from participation at any time without&#xD;
      jeopardy to any future medical care. It is also recognized that the investigator, at his/her&#xD;
      discretion, may withdraw a subject from this study based upon his/her professional judgment,&#xD;
      e.g. in the event of deep infection leading to replacement of the prosthesis or long-term&#xD;
      immobilization because of comorbidity. If a participant is withdrawn or rescinds their&#xD;
      consent, a &quot;Lost to Follow-up&quot; case report form will be completed detailing the reason for&#xD;
      the participant's withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data recordings Participants in this project are identified with an assigned allocation&#xD;
      number. At the end of the project all patient related data are destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All sensitive personal data regarding participants will be stored in accordance with&#xD;
      guidelines presented by the Personal Data Act. Personal data regarding participants will be&#xD;
      treated anonymously. The project will be reported to the Danish Data Protection Agency. The&#xD;
      primary investigator will process all data. Participants will receive oral and written&#xD;
      information concerning the handling of sensitive personal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics A professional statistical software package will be used when processing data in&#xD;
      this project. Comparative statistics will be used based on the distribution of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publications The results of this project are expected published in an international medical&#xD;
      journal. The results of this project are also expected presented at national and&#xD;
      international orthopedic conventions. If publication is not achieved, the results of this&#xD;
      project (positive, negative or inconclusive) will be presented on the homepage of the&#xD;
      investigator's institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-authorship is awarded according to the Vancouver rules.&#xD;
