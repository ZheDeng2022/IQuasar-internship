  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective clinical, uncontrolled, open-label, explorative phase 2a trial on patients with&#xD;
      histologically-confirmed superficial and nodular basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The study&#xD;
      assesses tolerability and tumor clearance after laser-assisted topical delivery of topical&#xD;
      ingenol mebutate.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive ablative fractional laser (AFXl)-assisted ingenol mebutate (IM) as a&#xD;
      treatment for their cutaneous basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Treatment areas consisting of&#xD;
      tumors and a 5 mm margin will undergo AFXl exposure (CO2 laser) followed by IM 0.015% or&#xD;
      0.05% under occlusion for 2-3 days. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      local skin reactions are monitored at baseline (day1), day 3/4, day 8, day 15, day 29, day&#xD;
      90, and tumor response monitored at baseline, day 29, and day 90. An additional repeat&#xD;
      AFXl-IM treatment on day 29 will be offered if tumors persist, based on clinical evaluation&#xD;
      and imaging on day 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. severity and duration of clinical local skin reactions including erythema, scaling,&#xD;
           edema, blistering, erosion/ulceration and crusting using a 0-4-point scale at all visits&#xD;
           from baseline to day 90.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To monitor BCC tumor response on clinical assessments supported by non-invasive imaging&#xD;
           techniques including optical coherence tomography (OCT) and reflectance confocal&#xD;
           microscopy (RCM) at baseline, day 29 and day 90.&#xD;
