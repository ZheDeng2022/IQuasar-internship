      The goal of this research project is to evaluate if our well-researched behavior medicine&#xD;
      treatment model for chronic pain, based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, is safe and&#xD;
      effective in increasing quality of life and functioning also in Myalgic&#xD;
      Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). To date there are no effective&#xD;
      treatments for ME/CFS as the ethology and pathophysiology are unknown, while levels of&#xD;
      functioning and quality of life as well as secondary effects such as depressive and anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms indicate a highly affected patient population. As such, there is a need for behavior&#xD;
      medicine approaches that aim to alleviate suffering and promote increases in quality of life&#xD;
      for these patients. The aim of the present study is to do a preliminary evaluation of the&#xD;
      safety, acceptability and efficacy of an ACT-based treatment protocol for ME/CFS. An&#xD;
      additional aim is to explore potential mediators of change for the effect of treatment on&#xD;
      disability.&#xD;

      Background Medical strategies alone appear insufficient to increase functioning and quality&#xD;
      of life in ME/CFS. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the only treatment approach with&#xD;
      preliminary evidence of efficacy for improving functioning and quality of life. However,&#xD;
      effect sizes are generally modest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavior medicine treatment approaches based on Acceptance &amp; Commitment Therapy (ACT) have&#xD;
      gained increasing attention and research support within clinical trials for similar diagnoses&#xD;
      (e.g. chronic pain, Fibromyalgia). Results from these areas illustrate the utility of this&#xD;
      approach for individuals with somatic symptomatology. To date, the efficacy of ACT has not&#xD;
      been evaluated for ME/CFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The aims of this pilot study are to explore the utility of ACT and to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of the treatment model for patients with ME/CFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Treatment program: 13 weekly to bi-weekly individual ACT sessions with a psychologist&#xD;
      (10) and a physician (3) respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open trial design is used, with assessments at pre-, mid- and post-treatment as well as at&#xD;
      3 and 6 months follow-up. Further, yearly follow-ups until 5-year follow-up are planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: History data, illness factors, psychological factors, functioning and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Consecutively recruited via referrals to a specialist treatment centre (n=40). Once&#xD;
      patients have been found eligible and expressed interest in study participation they will be&#xD;
      assessed by a psychologist and by a physician, via semi-structured interviews to confirm&#xD;
      eligibility and to ensure that the patient meet the study criteria. Informed consent is&#xD;
      obtained from all participants prior to the assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Evaluations of treatment effects are primarily based on intent-to-treat&#xD;
      analyses. The statistical approach will primarily be based on linear multilevel modeling&#xD;
      (LMM), which takes into account dependencies between repeated measures and differences&#xD;
      between patients in pre-treatment status and treatment response (i.e. random effects&#xD;
      modeling) and also provide means of handling missing data.&#xD;

    <description>The main target in ACT for ME/CFS (as for Fibromyalgia and Chronic pain in previous studies by our group) is to promote a shift of perspective in life from symptom reduction (when it does not work) to a valued life. As such it entails acceptance and exposure to discomfort, in order to lessen the effects of negative experiences (symptoms, emotions, thoughts) on behaviours in everyday life.</description>
