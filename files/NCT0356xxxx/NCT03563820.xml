  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is common for Veterans with injuries, illnesses, or physical disabilities to experience&#xD;
      depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic pain, and other concerns. They may&#xD;
      also have goals like becoming happier or better able to cope with challenges that life&#xD;
      brings. The purpose of this research study is to learn whether Veterans like and benefit from&#xD;
      a 5-week, group-based positive psychology program aimed at improving mental health,&#xD;
      resilience, well-being, and quality of life. Participants will be asked to complete several&#xD;
      assessments (surveys/interviews) over the course of the study that are not considered part of&#xD;
      standard care. Additionally, participants will be asked to participate in a focus group at&#xD;
      the end of the study to provide feedback about their experiences in the group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To participate in this study, Veterans must first be enrolled in the Resilience and&#xD;
      Well-Being Program, a 5-week, group-based positive psychology program held at VA Puget Sound&#xD;
      as part of standard care. After enrollment, Veterans may choose to enroll in this research&#xD;
      study which evaluates the effectiveness of, and satisfaction with, the Resilience and&#xD;
      Well-Being Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study includes two study visits at VA Puget Sound and three assessments over&#xD;
      the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent Process&#xD;
&#xD;
      This process will take place at the VA Puget Sound. A research staff member will review the&#xD;
      details of the study with the participant and answer any questions s/he may have to see if&#xD;
      they are interested in participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline Assessment: A research staff member will ask the participant a number of&#xD;
           standard questions. The most straightforward of these questions will ask about age,&#xD;
           gender, race, ethnicity, education level, employment status, marital status, and&#xD;
           military service. Participants will also be asked questions about their medical and&#xD;
           mental health treatment use, and any other health problems they may experience.&#xD;
           Participants will also be asked questions about potentially stressful life experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Post-Group Satisfaction Survey: This survey will happen following the completion of the&#xD;
           5-week group as long as a participant has attended at least one session. Participants&#xD;
           will be asked to complete this survey in-person at the end of Session 5. In this survey,&#xD;
           participants will be asked questions about how satisfying, engaging, and helpful they&#xD;
           thought the program was; what they thought about the program, and whether they&#xD;
           experienced any negative effects from participating in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Telephone Assessments: Throughout participation in the study, participants will be asked&#xD;
           to complete three telephone assessments. Within each assessment, participants will be&#xD;
           asked questions relating to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  How the participant is feeling&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Satisfaction with life and well-being&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Positive and negative emotions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participation and satisfaction with social activities&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Problems related to very stressful experiences&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical pain and how it is affecting the participant's life&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Current and past mental health treatment use&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  How likely the participant is to seek mental health treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Changes in medications, psychological treatment, or new major life events&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  How illness/injury has impacted the participant's life&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Whether the participant noticed any changes in their life after the group (once the&#xD;
                group is over)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three telephone assessments will occur at the following stages of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-Group Assessment must be completed before the first group session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-Group Assessment will occur at the end of the 5-week group period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5-Week Follow-Up Assessment will occur about 5 weeks after the end of the 5-week group&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus Group (Optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to complete a focus group that will last about 60-90 minutes six&#xD;
      to eight weeks after the completion of the group to talk about their experiences and&#xD;
      satisfaction with the program. Completing the focus group is optional, but encouraged, as&#xD;
      researchers would like to receive participant feedback through open discussion to better&#xD;
      improve this program for other Veterans. The focus group leaders will use prepared questions&#xD;
      to help guide the flow of discussion.&#xD;

    <description>The Resilience and Well-Being Program is offered through VA Puget Sound Rehabilitation Care Services as part of standard clinical care offerings. The program includes five (5) positive psychology group sessions once a week for five weeks. Participants will use strengths-based strategies, narrative strategies, and prospective strategies to learn ways to deal with stressful life challenges and improve their mental health and well-being.&#xD;
Each participant will be given a brief rating sheet at the end of each session to fill out. The rating sheet will ask participants to rate different aspects of the session (e.g., how helpful or interesting the session was to the participant), if home practice activities were assigned, whether the participant completed the home practice assignment, as well as feedback to improve that session.</description>
