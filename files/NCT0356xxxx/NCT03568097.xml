    <textblock>
      PAVE(Phased Avelumab combined with chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with&#xD;
      advanced small-cell lung cancer) is a Greek, investigator- initiated, single arm open- label&#xD;
      phase II study of Avelumab in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin/ etoposide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include an initial safety run-in, open-label, singlearm part (Part 1), and the&#xD;
      actual phase II study (Part 2). The total number of patients will not change (the safety&#xD;
      run-in patients will be included in the final total number of participants). The safety&#xD;
      run-in period will not alter the total study timelines, as phase II accrual will follow&#xD;
      immediately after the safety run-in.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a disease with dismal prognosis and new&#xD;
      therapeutics are urgently needed. SCLC is notably chemosensitive and first-line chemotherapy&#xD;
      with platinum analogs and etoposide is associated with high rates of initial objective&#xD;
      responses that unfortunately do not last long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for study design is 1-year PFS rate, where according to RECIST v1.1 PFS&#xD;
      is determined as the time from the date of study entry to the date of progression, death from&#xD;
      any cause or date of last contact.Secondary End Point is the evaluation of efficacy of the&#xD;
      study treatment in terms of Overall Survival (OS), Best Overall Response (BOR), Objective&#xD;
      Response Rate (ORR) and Duration of Response (DOR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the safety of the study treatment by assessing Treatment-Emergent Adverse&#xD;
      Events (TEAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the Quality of Life of patients receiving the study the study treatment.&#xD;
      Evaluation of potential biomarkers on fresh or archival sample,of formalin-fixed paraffin&#xD;
      embedded tumor tissue block or a minimum of 10 unstained tumor tissue sections. Moreover 10&#xD;
      ml of EDTA-stored blood sample will be collected as well.&#xD;

CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of all lesions. Stable disease (SD)=Neither sufficient increase to qualify for PD nor sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR.

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L Health Outcome Questionnaire is a measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value. The EQ-5D-5L defines health in terms of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The 5 items are combined to generate health profiles. These profiles were converted to a continuous single index score using a one to one matching. The lowest possible score is -0.59 (unable to walk, unable to self-care, unable to do usual activities, extreme pain or discomfort, extreme anxiety or depression) and the highest is 1.00 (no problems in all 5 dimensions).</description>

    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life (QoL) in cancer subjects. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, financial impact. The EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL score ranges from 0 to 100; High score indicates better GHS/QoL. Score 0 represents: very poor physical condition and QoL. Score 100 represents: excellent overall physical condition and QoL.</description>

    <description>EORTC QLQ-LC13 consists of 13 questions relating to disease symptoms specific to lung cancer and treatment side effects typical of treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The 13 questions comprises 1 multi-item scale for dyspnea and 10 single-item symptoms and side effects (coughing, hemoptysis, sore mouth, dysphagia, neuropathy, alopecia, and medicine for pain). Score range: 0 (no burden of symptom domain or single symptom item) to 100 (highest burden of symptoms for symptom domains and single items).</description>
