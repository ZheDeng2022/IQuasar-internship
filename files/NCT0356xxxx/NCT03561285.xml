  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burden of stroke is increasing in many low- and middle income countries.(1) Around 10% of&#xD;
      all thrombotic cerebrovascular events (CVE) occur in young population defined as younger than&#xD;
      50 years old (2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the majority of these patients, the cause of the ischaemic stroke remains undetermined.(3)&#xD;
      Arterial thrombosis is a major clinical manifestation of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS),&#xD;
      an autoimmune condition characterised by thrombotic events and/or pregnancy morbidity with&#xD;
      persistently positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering all patients with cerebral ischaemia, the prevalence of aPL seems rather high in&#xD;
      young adults, who might constitute a subgroup at high risk for recurrence.(5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the support of the Antiphospholipid Syndrome Alliance for Clinical Trials and&#xD;
      International Networking (APS ACTION), a systematic review aiming to estimate the frequency&#xD;
      of clinically significant aPL profiles in the general population (no age limit) was&#xD;
      completed. (6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of ischemic stroke is complex, and several studies documented&#xD;
      hypercoagulable states as a significant mechanism underlying stroke. (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latter include protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III deficiencies, activated protein&#xD;
      C resistance and anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPLA), including anticardiolipin (aCL)&#xD;
      antibodies or lupus anticoagulant (LAC), which influence stroke susceptibility owing to their&#xD;
      capacity to disturb normal hemostatic mechanisms (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While aPLA are clinically associated with a state of hypercoagulation and prothrombotic&#xD;
      disorders, the exact mechanism underlying their prothrombotic effects remains unknown (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      aPLA are detected either functionally, owing to their ability to prolong coagulation time in&#xD;
      a phospholipid-dependent coagulation test (LAC), or by measuring specific [anticardiolipin&#xD;
      (aCL) and antiphosphatidylserine (aPS)] antibodies by specific immunoassays, using anionic&#xD;
      phospholipids as antigens (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contribution of LAC to the overall risk of both venous and arterial thrombosis, including&#xD;
      ischemic stroke, is now well recognized (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the contribution of aPLA (including LAC and aCL antibodies) to thrombosis is well&#xD;
      established, their role as independent risk factors in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke&#xD;
      yielded apparently conflicting results. (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These conflicting results could be explained by differences in ethnic origin , inherent&#xD;
      variation in aPLA levels and in the failure in some studies to account for the contribution&#xD;
      of covariates (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteopontin (OPN) was first identified as a protein involved in bone remodelling, but later&#xD;
      also shown to have important immunological roles. (15).&#xD;
