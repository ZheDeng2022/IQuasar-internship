    <textblock>
      This pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) will randomize adults with chronic pain to one,&#xD;
      20-minute session of either: Brief Mindfulness-Based Intervention (BMBI) mindfulness training&#xD;
      or nutrition education (Control). Following the session, participants will be encouraged to&#xD;
      practice a technique associated with their intervention (i.e., practicing mindfulness&#xD;
      technique in BMBI, preparing healthy meals in Control) 20 minutes/day for one week at home.&#xD;
      Quantitative sensory testing (with cold pressor and algometer) will be conducted before and&#xD;
      after the session, and self-reported outcome assessments will be conducted before and after&#xD;
      the session and at 1-week follow-up.&#xD;

      Participants. To gather pilot data on the effects of BMBI, the investigators will aim to&#xD;
      enroll up to 60 participants (up to 30 in each condition). Participants will be adults with&#xD;
      chronic non-cancer pain (daily pain for at least 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes. Outcome measures were selected based on existing recommendations, including IMMPACT&#xD;
      guidelines, for efficacy trials in chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim #1: Test the effects of BMBI, relative to control, on central pain processing using&#xD;
           quantitative sensory testing. Quantitative sensory testing (cold pressor test and&#xD;
           pressure algometer) will be used to characterize pain processing: pain threshold (i.e.,&#xD;
           when pain is first detected), pain tolerance (i.e., the duration of time that pain can&#xD;
           be tolerated), and pain severity (i.e., intensity of pain). In the cold pressor test, a&#xD;
           participant will be asked to place his or her hand in an ice bath until the pain is too&#xD;
           great to remain in the water. Consistent with past research, a 15 liter refrigerated&#xD;
           circulator (Polyscience MX15R-30-A11B) with water temperature set as low as 1°C will be&#xD;
           used. In the pressure algometer test, the algometer will be used to apply pressure to&#xD;
           the skin until the pain can no longer be tolerated. The investigators will utilize a&#xD;
           device widely used in alogmeter pain research (Wagnder Force One Alogmeter FIPX).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim #2: Test the immediate effects of BMBI, relative to control, on state self-report&#xD;
           measures of pain, negative affect, and decentering. State self-report outcomes include:&#xD;
           state decentering (7-item Decentering Subscale of the Toronto Mindfulness Scale), state&#xD;
           pain intensity (1 item from the Brief Pain Inventory), state pain unpleasantness (1-item&#xD;
           rated on 0-10 scale), state anxiety (1-item rated on 0-10 scale), state distress (1-item&#xD;
           rated on 0-10 scale), state relaxation (1-item rated on 0-10 scale), and outcome&#xD;
           expectancies (5-item Outcome Expectancies Questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim #3: Test longer-term effects of BMBI, relative to control, on trait self-report&#xD;
           measures of pain, negative affect, trait mindfulness, and well-being. Trait self-report&#xD;
           outcomes include: pain intensity and interference (9-item Brief Pain Inventory), anxiety&#xD;
           and depression (14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), trait mindfulness&#xD;
           (15-item Mindful Attention Awareness Scale), psychological well-being (10-item Schwartz&#xD;
           Outcome Scale), and home practice over the 4-week follow-up period (TLFB method).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure. Participants will be recruited primarily via flyers and postings in newspapers and&#xD;
      on the Internet. Prospective participants will be screened by phone (about 30 minutes).&#xD;
      Provisionally eligible participants will be asked to attend a 1-hour appointment, which will&#xD;
      begin with informed consent procedures (5-10 minutes) and a pre-intervention assessment&#xD;
      (about 20 minutes; includes demographics questionnaire, self-report outcome measures, and&#xD;
      quantitative sensory testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized to a condition, complete a 20-minute session of&#xD;
      either BMBI or Control, and undergo a postintervention assessment (about 10 minutes; includes&#xD;
      self-report outcome measures and quantitative sensory testing). Following the assessment,&#xD;
      participants will be encouraged to practice the technique associated with their intervention&#xD;
      (i.e., practicing mindfulness technique in BMBI, preparing healthy meals in Control) 20&#xD;
      minutes/day for 1 week at home and to track their practice and opioid use during the&#xD;
      follow-up period; the follow-up assessments will be conducted over the phone by a research&#xD;
      assistant and include the self-report outcome measures (no quantitative sensory testing). All&#xD;
      study procedures are anticipated to last 2 hours and 30 minutes (30 minutes for screening, 1&#xD;
      hour for in-person appointment, and 30 minutes for each follow-up assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: The BMBI is be based on a BMBI which demonstrated analgesic effects in a&#xD;
      previous study. Relative to full-length interventions, the investigators will employ a brief&#xD;
      intervention (i.e., one, 20-minute session) that could be delivered in routine clinical care,&#xD;
      e.g., in primary care, and that could overcome cost and time/effort barriers associated with&#xD;
      longer treatments. The 20-minute BMBI session will include education on the foundational&#xD;
      concepts of mindfulness and its relevance to chronic pain (5 minutes) and a guided&#xD;
      mindfulness practice involving focused attention on the breath and monitoring of thoughts,&#xD;
      feelings, and body sensations (15 minutes). BMBI participants will be encouraged to practice&#xD;
      the taught mindfulness technique at home at least 20 minutes/day for 1 week (a handout and&#xD;
      link to an online guided mindfulness practice will be provided).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Control intervention will involve nutrition education, adapted from an existing manual of&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy for opioid-treated chronic pain. Control intervention protocol&#xD;
      will match the BMBI in terms of time / structure to control for the non-specific,&#xD;
      non-mindfulness effects of BMBI. The 20-minute Control session will include education on the&#xD;
      relationship between diet and pain (10 minutes) and recommendations for a healthy diet (10&#xD;
      minutes). Control participants will be encouraged to prepare healthy meals at home at least&#xD;
      20 minutes/day for 1 week (a handout and link to online resources will be provided).&#xD;
