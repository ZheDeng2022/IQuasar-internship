  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study RAMES is a multicentre, double-blind, randomized Phase II study exploring the efficacy&#xD;
      and evaluating the safety of the addition of ramucirumab to gemcitabine as the second-line&#xD;
      treatment of patients with diffuse pleural mesothelioma. Patients will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      (1:1) to receive intravenous gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 21 days with&#xD;
      placebo or combined with intravenous ramucirumab 10 mg/Kg (ramucirumab group) on day 1 of a&#xD;
      21 day cycle until PD. Randomisation will be done via a centralized system and will&#xD;
      stratified by performance status (0-1 vs 2), age (≤70 vs &gt;70), histology (epithelioid vs&#xD;
      others), time to progression (TTP) after a previous treatment (first line therapy, adjuvant&#xD;
      or neoadjuvant therapy) (&lt; 6 months vs ≥6 months).&#xD;
