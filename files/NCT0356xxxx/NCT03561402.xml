    <textblock>
      The study is a two-year prospective observational study of patients treated with&#xD;
      teriflunomide. The investigators will recruit up to 75 patients at baseline, based on the&#xD;
      estimate that approximately 20% of these patients (~ 15 patients) will have evidence of&#xD;
      disease activity at the end of the first year of treatment with teriflunomide, as determined&#xD;
      by clinical evaluation (relapses) and MRI activity (new T2 hyperintense lesions). The&#xD;
      investigators will assess the expression of a putative biomarker signature consisting of toll&#xD;
      like receptor 2(TLR2), TLR4 and chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) on CD4 T-subsets at baseline and&#xD;
      at intervals on treatment with teriflunomide to determine whether expression of this&#xD;
      biomarker signature on one or more CD4 T-subsets correlates with disease activity.&#xD;

      TITLE: Association of possible biomarkers with disease activity in patients treated with&#xD;
      teriflunomide (Aubagio ®)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. BACKGROUND Teriflunomide (Aubagio) is a once-daily oral immunomodulatory DMT for patients&#xD;
      with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) (1). The objective of the present study is to determine&#xD;
      whether a putative biomarker signature predicts disease activity in patients treated with&#xD;
      teriflunomide. The investigators previously identified a 130-gene signature associated with&#xD;
      immune activation that identified patients with MS that had rapid transition to secondary&#xD;
      progressive MS (SPMS). From this signature, the investigators identified three genes (TLR2,&#xD;
      TLR4 and CCR1) which had increased protein expression on naïve CD4 T-cells in these patients.&#xD;
      The investigators also showed that mRNA for an anti-proliferation factor, termed TOB1, was&#xD;
      downregulated in these T-cells in patients with rapid MS progression. The findings suggest,&#xD;
      therefore, that naïve CD4 T-cell activation identifies patients with MS having a short RRMS&#xD;
      duration (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this proposal, the principal investigator suggests that various molecules involved in&#xD;
      T-cell activation may also serve as useful biomarkers to predict treatment responses to&#xD;
      teriflunomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      B1. Study objective and specific aims. The objective is to determine whether the T-cell&#xD;
      activation markers that were previously identified will predict disease activity in patients&#xD;
      treated with teriflunomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific study aims are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the proportion of patients pre-treatment (pre-Tx) that have altered expression of one or&#xD;
           more candidate markers in one or more T-subsets;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. whether expression levels of one or more of these markers in a T-subset change(s) on&#xD;
           treatment (On-Tx) with teriflunomide;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. whether differences in the mRNA or protein kinetics of a putative marker predicts&#xD;
           disease activity in patients treated with teriflunomide;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. whether expression levels of one or more target molecules, Pre-Tx or On-Tx, correlate&#xD;
           with evidence of disease activity after one year on treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. STUDY DESIGN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C1. Design summary. The study is a two-year prospective observational study of patients&#xD;
      treated with teriflunomide. The investigators will recruit up to 75 patients at baseline. The&#xD;
      investigators will study patients at baseline and at intervals On-Tx with teriflunomide in&#xD;
      order to identify patients with active vs. stable disease, based on clinical (relapse) and&#xD;
      radiological (new T2 hyperintense lesions) evidence. The investigators will study the&#xD;
      expression of biomarkers in each patient subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C2. Primary endpoints. The central question of the study is whether the expression levels of&#xD;
      one or more putative biomarker (TOB1, TLR2, TLR4, CCR1) differ(s) between patients from the&#xD;
      two informative subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C3. Outcome measures. The outcomes that will address the central question of the study&#xD;
      consist of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measures of protein expression levels of TLR2, TLR4 and CCR1 on CD4 T-subsets by flow&#xD;
           cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. TOB1 mRNA expression in CD4 T-subsets by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and the PrimeFlow&#xD;
           RNA Assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Differences in mRNA or protein expression of selected markers in short-term cultures&#xD;
           between patients from the two informative subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C4. Subject population. The study population includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. treatment-naive patients with RRMS from the Montreal Neurological Hospital (MNH) MS&#xD;
           clinics before treatment (pre-Tx) with teriflunomide; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. patients with RRMS that were previously treated with other disease modifiying therapies&#xD;
           (DMTs) but that are switching to teriflunomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C5. Ethics approval: The study was approved by the Neurosciences Research Ethics Board of the&#xD;
      MNH/MN. The data will be kept for 7 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C6. Consents. The Principal Investigator or his delegate will obtain informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. STUDY PROCEDURES. The study will investigate a biomarker signature in patients with MS who&#xD;
      are being treated with teriflunomide by their neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D1. Participants and clinic visits. Before beginning treatment with teriflunomide, each&#xD;
      patient will have a clinical evaluation, an MRI, as part of routine clinical practice, and a&#xD;
      blood draw (see below). At intervals, participants will have a clinical evaluation and a&#xD;
      second MRI evaluation to determine whether they have active vs. stable disease. In order to&#xD;
      permit a phased approach, the neurologists will endeavor to identify patients after six&#xD;
      months of treatment who show evidence of active vs. stable disease, approximately 3 in each&#xD;
      subgroup. Blood draws will be obtained from each of these patients for subsequent laboratory&#xD;
      studies (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D2. Sample collection. Up to 120 ml of peripheral venous blood will be drawn from each&#xD;
      subject at baseline and at intervals, to collect serum and plasma, to obtain total lymphocyte&#xD;
      counts, CD3, CD4 and CD8 counts and to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for&#xD;
      immediate analysis and also for cryopreservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D3. Laboratory analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D3.1. Naïve CD4 T-cell isolation and quantitative RT-PCR analysis of TOB1 expression. Reduced&#xD;
      expression of TOB1, an inhibitor of T-cell proliferation, correlated with rapid progression&#xD;
      from CIS to RRMS in one study (2), and also correlated in the investigators' previous study&#xD;
      with rapid progression from RRMS to SPMS (2). The investigators will isolate naïve CD4&#xD;
      T-cells using MACS beads (2) and determine TOB1 expression by quantitative RT-PCR in a small&#xD;
      cohort of patients (5-10 patients) and age-matched healthy controls (HCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D3.2. Analysis of cryopreserved PBMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy 1. Surface protein expression of TLR2, TLR4 and CCR1 in CD4 T-subsets. The&#xD;
      investigators will analyze baseline and On-Tx cryopreserved samples for expression (%&#xD;
      positivity and MFI) of TLR2, TLR4 and CCR1 on naïve, central memory, effector memory,&#xD;
      terminally differentiated effector memory and regulatory T-cells by flow cytometry on a BD&#xD;
      LSRFortessa with a 5-laser system. The investigators will use FlowJo software for analysis.&#xD;
      The investigators will identify the biomarker which is most informative, i.e. shows the&#xD;
      greatest difference in expression levels between patients in the two informative subgroups at&#xD;
      baseline or on treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy 2. Comparison of TOB1 mRNA expression by qRT-PCR and the PrimeFlow RNA Assay. The&#xD;
      investigators will develop the PrimeFlow™ RNA assay (affymetrix Ebioscience) for simultaneous&#xD;
      analysis of mRNA and protein expression. Initially, the investigators will compare TOB1 mRNA&#xD;
      expression with that obtained by qRT-PCR, as qRT-PCR is the gold standard for mRNA&#xD;
      quantification. The investigators will compare TOB1 mRNA expression in naïve CD4 T-cells by&#xD;
      the two methods. If the measurements are comparable, the investigators will then be able to&#xD;
      simultaneously assess TOB1 expression in naïve CD4 T-cells and the expression of the most&#xD;
      informative biomarker in CD4 T-subsets and compare expression levels in patients from the two&#xD;
      informative subgroups as outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy 3. mRNA and protein kinetics of TOB1 and a T-cell biomarker in stimulated T-cells.&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that T-cell stimulation will identify differences between&#xD;
      patients from the two informative subgroups in either mRNA or protein kinetics of TOB1 or one&#xD;
      of our surface protein biomarkers. In other words, these studies may show differences between&#xD;
      patients with active vs. stable MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This strategy involves a stimulation phase and an analytical phase as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Firstly, after selecting patients from the two patient subgroups (3-4 patients/subgroup)&#xD;
           and from age-matched HCs, the investigators will stimulate cryopreserved PBMC from&#xD;
           baseline and one-year treatment samples using PMA/ionomycin and BD GolgiStop™ Protein&#xD;
           Transport inhibitor for 4 hr at 37° C in 5% CO2. The investigators will determine the&#xD;
           optimal concentrations of each reagent through assay-specific titration for use with the&#xD;
           PrimeFlow RNA Assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second phase will use the PrimeFlow RNA Assay to assess mRNA and protein kinetics of&#xD;
           TOB1 and the most informative surface protein biomarker in patient subgroups and HCs.&#xD;
           This assay can reveal the dynamics of both RNA and protein expression in individual&#xD;
           cells and in T-subsets in response to T-cell stimulation. The utility of the PrimeFlow&#xD;
           RNA assay was validated in a landmark study of T-subsets (4); detailed methods are&#xD;
           available on the following website:&#xD;
           http://www.ebioscience.com/media/newpdf/PrimeFlowRNAAssayUM010915.pdf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D4. Statistical analysis. The investigators will use GraphPad Prism 7 for all statistical&#xD;
      analyses, and use appropriate parametric or non-parametric tests according to the data&#xD;
      distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. ANTICIPATED RESULTS. Firstly, the investigators anticipate that one or more T-subsets in&#xD;
      baseline PBMC samples (before teriflunomide treatment) will show increased surface protein&#xD;
      expression of one or more T-cell activation molecules in the patients that show disease&#xD;
      activity On-Tx vs. patients that do not show disease activity On-Tx. Such a finding may help&#xD;
      identify patients for whom teriflunomide is the optimal DMT. Secondly, treatment with&#xD;
      teriflunomide may alter the expression of one or more T-cell activation molecules in one or&#xD;
      more T-subsets and this alteration may correlate with reduced disease activity, thereby&#xD;
      suggesting that altered T-cell activation contributes to a positive response to&#xD;
      teriflunomide. Thirdly, short term cultures of baseline samples vs. one-year samples from&#xD;
      patients and from age-matched HCs may identify differences in mRNA and protein kinetics of a&#xD;
      T-cell activation marker in patients at baseline, which then revert to a normal pattern in&#xD;
      those with no disease activity at one year. Such findings would point towards important&#xD;
      functional alterations mediated by teriflunomide that correlate with a positive therapeutic&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
