    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the usefulness of a family-based program for African&#xD;
      American parents/primary caregivers with newly diagnosed solid tumor cancer and their&#xD;
      adolescent children. The program is designed to promote family communication reduce and&#xD;
      depressive symptoms for adolescence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will offer a 10-week prevention program to help African American parents&#xD;
      and caregivers (e.g., grandparents) diagnosed for the first time with Stages I, II, or III&#xD;
      solid tumor cancer in the last 12 months who are caring for a 12-18 year old child at home&#xD;
      who has been told about the parent's cancer diagnosis. Parents and their adolescent&#xD;
      child(ren) will first be asked to complete a set of questionnaires that takes about 60&#xD;
      minutes and then will be told within 2 to 4 weeks whether they have been assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      programs that will get chosen by chance, like flipping a coin. Neither the families nor the&#xD;
      researchers will choose what program is assigned. Both programs are designed to offer help&#xD;
      coping with cancer. Both short- and long-term effects of the program will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program A involves just parents attending five educational sessions every other week (1&#xD;
      hour/session) with a group of parents who are also coping with cancer with specially trained&#xD;
      group leaders. Adolescent children will not participate in these group sessions; this is the&#xD;
      treatment as usual comparison group as most cancer centers do not meet with adolescent&#xD;
      children who have parents diagnosed with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program B involves five group sessions (2 hours/session) every other week with other families&#xD;
      like them that include adolescents in some of the sessions and parents and adolescents&#xD;
      together in other sessions with specially trained group leaders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary, secondary, and exploratory aims of this research are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Compare the efficacy of Families Fighting Cancer Together (FFCT) to Treatment-as-Usual&#xD;
      (TAU) in reducing depressive symptoms (CDI) in AA adolescents at post-treatment using an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Compare the efficacy of Families Fighting Cancer Together (FFCT) to Treatment-as-Usual&#xD;
      (TAU) in reducing parental stress (PCQ) in AA parents at post-treatment using ITT analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3a. Determine trajectories of adolescent depressive symptoms (CDI), anxiety (RCMAS), and&#xD;
      parental stress (PCQ) from baseline to 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3b. Determine whether perceived levels of group support (HGE), adolescent gender and age,&#xD;
      parent's marital and socioeconomic status, and parent's cancer staging modify the effects of&#xD;
      treatment on adolescent depression (CDI) and anxiety (RCMAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3c. Determine whether pre-post changes in parent-adolescent attachment and communication&#xD;
      mediate the association between treatment and adolescent depressive symptoms (CDI) and&#xD;
      anxiety (RCMAS) at 6- and 12-month follow-ups.&#xD;
