      The purpose of this study will be to determine if personalized moderate intensity exercise&#xD;
      training combined with high intensity interval training is more effective at improving&#xD;
      training responsiveness than moderate intensity exercise training alone? This question will&#xD;
      be addressed holistically be creating a composite score to assess training responsiveness.&#xD;
      Additionally, individualized biological variability will be calculated in order to quantify&#xD;
      training responsiveness using a personalized criterion. It is hypothesized that personalized&#xD;
      moderate intensity exercise training combined with high intensity interval training will be&#xD;
      more effective at improving comprehensive training responsiveness when compared to moderate&#xD;
      intensity exercise training alone?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that regular physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)&#xD;
      training confers numerous health benefits and that a low level of CRF is a risk factor for&#xD;
      coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. It is generally accepted&#xD;
      that CRF can be improved with the implementation of a regular aerobic exercise training&#xD;
      program following standardized guidelines. However, it has also been shown that not all&#xD;
      individuals respond positively to such exercise, indeed there is considerable individual&#xD;
      variability in training adaptations including so-termed 'non-responders' and, in some&#xD;
      instances, 'adverse responders'. This variability in training responsiveness is not well&#xD;
      understood and may be attributable to various factors including absence of a set definition&#xD;
      in the literature for incidence of response and lack of an individualized approach to the&#xD;
      exercise prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been purported that a more individualized approach to the exercise prescription may&#xD;
      enhance training efficacy and limit training unresponsiveness. For instance, it has been&#xD;
      acknowledged as far back as the late 1970s that utilizing a relative percent method (i.e., %&#xD;
      heart rate reserve [HRR]) to establish exercise intensity fails to account for individual&#xD;
      metabolic responses to exercise. Nevertheless, the relative percent concept remains the gold&#xD;
      standard recommendation for exercise intensity. It is both plausible and practical to think&#xD;
      that an intensity set based on an individual's threshold measurement (i.e. ventilatory&#xD;
      threshold) will not only encourage more positive physiological adaptations, but may account&#xD;
      for some of the variability in training responsiveness by taking into consideration&#xD;
      individual metabolic differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, high intensity interval training (HIIT) has emerged as a potential time&#xD;
      efficient strategy for health promotion. Current recommended guidelines of 150 minutes of&#xD;
      moderate physical activity per week is reduced by half to 75 minutes if the week's activity&#xD;
      is done at a vigorous intensity. It has been demonstrated that HIIT, when compared to&#xD;
      moderate intensity continuous training (MICT), has resulted in equal or superior improvements&#xD;
      in VO2max, insulin action and sensitivity, endothelial function, systolic blood pressure, hip&#xD;
      and waist circumference and lipid oxidation. The American College of Sports Medicine suggests&#xD;
      considering incorporating interval training after a period of initial conditioning (typically&#xD;
      2-3 months) intermittently to avoid excessive orthopedic stress. Additionally, HIIT may&#xD;
      require initial supervision in untrained and high risk individuals, and may transiently&#xD;
      increase the risk of cardiac events in people with underlying undiagnosed CVD. Therefore, it&#xD;
      seems pragmatic and consistent with current recommendations to combine the two types of&#xD;
      training to achieve the greatest positive changes in cardiovascular and metabolic health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been common practice to quantify training responsiveness based on absolute changes,&#xD;
      but this method fails to take into consideration biological variability (normal day-to-day&#xD;
      biological fluctuations) and measurement error of the equipment. Consequently, currently&#xD;
      there is not a clear consensus on best practice to prescribe a customized exercise&#xD;
      intervention that takes into consideration individual characteristics and diagnostic&#xD;
      information. Furthermore, it may be that a personalized definition of biological variability&#xD;
      is warranted. This is congruent with the line of reasoning that a more individualized&#xD;
      approach to the exercise prescription may enhance training efficacy and limit training&#xD;
      unresponsiveness. Simply put - if we are looking at exercise prescription (i.e., the front&#xD;
      end) from an individualized perspective, it would also make sense to look at training&#xD;
      responsiveness (i.e., the back end) from an individualized perspective as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, classification and interpretation of training responsiveness may require a&#xD;
      holistic view that integrates all exercise training outcomes. For example, in a recent study&#xD;
      an adverse response in one single measure rarely resulted in higher overall risk of CVD. In&#xD;
      fact, 10-year CVD risk increased in only three individuals (out of 332 individuals) as&#xD;
      highlighted in this investigation. This finding has practical implications suggesting that&#xD;
      although some individuals may have adverse or nonresponse cardiometabolic responses to&#xD;
      exercise training, this may not always result in increased CVD risk and exercise may benefit&#xD;
      these participants in different ways, such as improved cardiorespiratory fitness. Indeed, in&#xD;
      the previously mentioned study, more than 40% (9/22) of 'adverse responders' concurrently&#xD;
      increased cardiorespiratory fitness levels by 10% or more. Higher levels of cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      fitness have been offered as an antidote toward other risk factors. Moreover, the literature&#xD;
      suggests a 15% reduction in mortality for a 10% improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness.&#xD;
      Taken together, it may be unintentionally misleading to categorize someone as an &quot;adverse&#xD;
      responder or non-responder to exercise&quot; based on a single cardiometabolic factor when it is&#xD;
      well known that regular exercise training confers a myriad of benefits. Clearly, the overall&#xD;
      topic of training responsiveness to exercise warrants much additional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      45 low-to-moderate risk, sedentary men and women will be recruited and randomized to one of&#xD;
      the following arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MICT + HIIT exercise program (N = 15)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MICT exercise program (N = 15)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  non-exercise control group (N = 15)&#xD;
