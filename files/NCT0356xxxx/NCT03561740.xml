  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in women. Recurrent or metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer is incurable. High risk patients usually have the following characteristics, such as,&#xD;
      non-pCR after neoadjuvant therapy, lymph nodes positive, &gt;2cm tumor size, HER2&#xD;
      overexpression, etc. Intensive targeted or chemo therapy could improve prognosis. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown the efficacy and feasibility of intensive treatment of capecitabine in&#xD;
      non-pCR breast cancer patients. Given the metronomic capecitabine therapy is well tolerated,&#xD;
      we designed this study to compare the efficacy and safety of adding metronomic capecitabine&#xD;
      to standard adjuvant therapy for high risk HER2+ breast cancer patients.&#xD;
