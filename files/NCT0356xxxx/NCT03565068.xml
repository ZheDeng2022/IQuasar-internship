        <title>Area Under the Plasma-concentration Curve at Zero to 24 Hours Post-dose (AUC0-24hr) of MK-8189</title>
        <description>AUC was a measure of MK-8189 exposure assessed as a product of drug concentration and time, using a linear mixed effects model. To estimate AUC0-24hr per protocol blood samples were collected pre-dose, 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24 hours post-dose for Panels A, B, C, D; no pre-dose samples collected on Day 18 (Panels A, B, C), Day 15 (Panel D). Samples were collected on Days 7, 10, 13, 16, 18 for Panels A, B; Days 9, 12, 15, 18 for Panel C; Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 15 for Panel D. Per protocol AUC0-24hr was analyzed by panel, dose, dosing regimen; due to differing dosing regimen some arms/doses weren't applicable to some timepoints, shown by 0 participants analyzed in the table. Per dosing regimen the 4 mg, 8 mg (Panels A, B), 4 mg (Panel C) study arms weren't applicable to the protocol-specified timepoints/days of AUC0-24hr analysis and these arms were excluded. Geometric coefficient of variation (GCV) was reported as a percent. Per protocol placebo arms were excluded from AUC0-24hr analysis.</description>

        <title>Maximum Observed Post-dose Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of MK-8189</title>
        <description>Cmax was the maximum concentration of MK-8189 observed in plasma, assessed using a linear mixed effects model. To estimate Cmax, per protocol blood samples were collected pre-dose, 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24 hours post-dose for Panels A, B, C, D; no pre-dose samples collected on Day 18 (Panels A, B, C), Day 15 (Panel D); additional post-dose samples collected at 36, 48 hours on Days 18 and 15. Samples were collected on Days 7, 10, 13, 16, 18 for Panels A, B; Days 9, 12, 15, 18 for Panel C; Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 15 for Panel D. Per protocol Cmax was analyzed by panel, dose, dosing regimen; due to differing dosing regimen some arms/doses weren't applicable to some timepoints, shown by 0 participants analyzed in the table. Per dosing regimen, the 4 mg, 8 mg (Panels A, B), 4 mg (Panel C) study arms weren't applicable to the protocol-specified timepoints/days of Cmax analysis and were excluded. GCV was reported as a percent. Per protocol placebo arms were excluded from Cmax analysis.</description>

        <title>Plasma Concentration at 24 Hours Post-dose (C24hr) of MK-8189</title>
        <description>C24hr was the concentration of MK-8189 observed in plasma at the 24-hour nominal sampling time after administration of MK-8189, assessed using a linear mixed effects model. To estimate C24hr, per protocol blood samples were collected 24 hours post-dose on Days 7, 10, 13, 16, 18 for Panels A, B; Days 9, 12, 15, 18 for Panel C; Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 15 for Panel D. Per protocol C24hr was analyzed by panel, dose, dosing regimen; due to differing dosing regimen some arms/doses weren't applicable to some timepoints, shown by 0 participants analyzed in the table. Per dosing regimen, the 4 mg, 8 mg (Panels A, B), 4 mg (Panel C) study arms weren't applicable to the protocol-specified timepoints/days of C24hr analysis and were excluded. GCV was reported as a percent. Per protocol placebo arms were excluded from C24hr analysis.</description>
        <time_frame>24 hours post-dose; Panel A, B: Days 7, 10, 13, 16, 18; Panel C: Days 9, 12, 15, 18; Panel D: Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 15</time_frame>
        <population>All participants who got ≥1 dose of MK-8189, had C24hr data for Days 7, 10, 13, 16 or 18 (Panels A, B); Days 9, 12, 15 or 18 (Panel C); Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 or 15 (Panel D). Per protocol C24hr was analyzed by panel, dose, dosing regimen; based on dosing, some arms weren't applicable to some timepoints shown by 0 participants analyzed. The 4 mg, 8 mg (Panels A, B), 4 mg (Panel C) arms weren't applicable to the C24hr timepoints; per protocol these arms and placebo arms were excluded.</population>

          <title>Plasma Concentration at 24 Hours Post-dose (C24hr) of MK-8189</title>
          <description>C24hr was the concentration of MK-8189 observed in plasma at the 24-hour nominal sampling time after administration of MK-8189, assessed using a linear mixed effects model. To estimate C24hr, per protocol blood samples were collected 24 hours post-dose on Days 7, 10, 13, 16, 18 for Panels A, B; Days 9, 12, 15, 18 for Panel C; Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 15 for Panel D. Per protocol C24hr was analyzed by panel, dose, dosing regimen; due to differing dosing regimen some arms/doses weren't applicable to some timepoints, shown by 0 participants analyzed in the table. Per dosing regimen, the 4 mg, 8 mg (Panels A, B), 4 mg (Panel C) study arms weren't applicable to the protocol-specified timepoints/days of C24hr analysis and were excluded. GCV was reported as a percent. Per protocol placebo arms were excluded from C24hr analysis.</description>
          <population>All participants who got ≥1 dose of MK-8189, had C24hr data for Days 7, 10, 13, 16 or 18 (Panels A, B); Days 9, 12, 15 or 18 (Panel C); Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 or 15 (Panel D). Per protocol C24hr was analyzed by panel, dose, dosing regimen; based on dosing, some arms weren't applicable to some timepoints shown by 0 participants analyzed. The 4 mg, 8 mg (Panels A, B), 4 mg (Panel C) arms weren't applicable to the C24hr timepoints; per protocol these arms and placebo arms were excluded.</population>

        <title>Time Post-dose to Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of MK-8189</title>
        <description>Tmax was the actual sampling time at which maximum post-dose plasma concentration of MK-8189 was observed. To estimate Tmax, per protocol blood samples were collected pre-dose, 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24 hours post-dose for Panels A, B, C, D; no pre-dose samples collected on Day 18 (Panels A, B, C), Day 15 (Panel D); additional post-dose samples collected at 36, 48 hours on Days 18 and 15. Samples were collected on Days 7, 10, 13, 16, 18 for Panels A, B; Days 9, 12, 15, 18 for Panel C; Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 15 for Panel D. Per protocol Tmax was analyzed by panel, dose, dosing regimen; due to differing dosing regimen, some arms/doses weren't applicable to some timepoints, shown by 0 participants analyzed in the table. Per dosing regimen, the 4 mg, 8 mg (Panels A, B), 4 mg (Panel C) study arms weren't applicable to the protocol-specified timepoints/days of Tmax analysis and were excluded. Per protocol placebo arms were excluded from Tmax analysis.</description>

        <title>Apparent Total Plasma Clearance of MK-8189 (CL/F) on Day 18 (Panels A, B, C) and Day 15 (Panel D)</title>
        <description>CL/F was the apparent total clearance of MK-8189 in plasma over time, assessed as the rate at which MK-8189 was removed from the plasma. To estimate CL/F, per protocol blood samples were collected 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48 hours post-dose on Day 18 for Panels A, B, C, and on Day 15 for Panel D. Per protocol CL/F was analyzed by panel, dose and dosing regimen. Due to differing dosing regimen, some arms/doses weren't applicable to some timepoints, shown by 0 participants analyzed in the table. Per dosing regimen, the 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, 16 mg, 20 mg (Panels A, B, C), 8 mg, 16 mg, 24 mg, 36 mg (Panel D) study arms weren't applicable to the protocol-specified timepoints/days of CL/F analysis and were excluded. GCV was reported as a percent. Per protocol placebo arms were excluded from CL/F analysis.</description>
        <time_frame>2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48 hours post-dose on Day 18 (Panel A, B, C) and Day 15 (Panel D)</time_frame>
        <population>All participants who got ≥1 dose of MK-8189, had CL/F data for Day 18 (Panels A, B, C) or Day 15 (Panel D). Per protocol CL/F was analyzed by panel, dose, dosing regimen; based on dosing, some arms weren't applicable to some timepoints, shown by 0 participants analyzed. The 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, 16 mg, 20 mg (Panels A, B, C), 8 mg, 16 mg, 24 mg, 36 mg (Panel D) arms weren't applicable to the CL/F timepoints; per protocol these arms and placebo arms were excluded.</population>

          <description>CL/F was the apparent total clearance of MK-8189 in plasma over time, assessed as the rate at which MK-8189 was removed from the plasma. To estimate CL/F, per protocol blood samples were collected 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48 hours post-dose on Day 18 for Panels A, B, C, and on Day 15 for Panel D. Per protocol CL/F was analyzed by panel, dose and dosing regimen. Due to differing dosing regimen, some arms/doses weren't applicable to some timepoints, shown by 0 participants analyzed in the table. Per dosing regimen, the 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, 16 mg, 20 mg (Panels A, B, C), 8 mg, 16 mg, 24 mg, 36 mg (Panel D) study arms weren't applicable to the protocol-specified timepoints/days of CL/F analysis and were excluded. GCV was reported as a percent. Per protocol placebo arms were excluded from CL/F analysis.</description>

        <description>Vd/F was the apparent volume of distribution of MK-8189 between the plasma and the rest of the body, after dose, assessed as the total volume of MK-8189 that would need to be uniformly distributed to achieve the desired plasma drug concentration. To estimate Vd/F, per protocol blood samples were collected 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48 hours post-dose on Day 18 for Panels A, B, C, and on Day 15 for Panel D. Per protocol Vd/F was analyzed by panel, dose and dosing regimen. Due to differing dosing regimen, some arms/doses weren't applicable to some timepoints, shown by 0 participants analyzed in the table. Per dosing regimen, the 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, 16 mg, 20 mg (Panels A, B, C), 8 mg, 16 mg, 24 mg, 36 mg (Panel D) study arms weren't applicable to the protocol-specified timepoints/days of Vd/F analysis and were excluded.

        <description>t1/2 was the time required to divide the plasma concentration of MK-8189 by half after reaching pseudo-equilibrium. At least three quantifiable terminal phase concentrations collected were used to calculate t1/2. To estimate t1/2, per protocol blood samples were collected 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48 hours post-dose on Day 18 for Panels A, B, C, and on Day 15 for Panel D. Per protocol t1/2 was analyzed by panel, dose and dosing regimen. Due to differing dosing regimen, some arms/doses weren't applicable to some timepoints, shown by 0 participants analyzed in the table. Per dosing regimen, the 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, 16 mg, 20 mg (Panels A, B, C), 8 mg, 16 mg, 24 mg, 36 mg (Panel D) study arms weren't applicable to the protocol-specified timepoints/days of t1/2 analysis and were excluded. GCV was reported as a percent. Per protocol placebo arms were excluded from t1/2 analysis.</description>

          <title>Time Required for Plasma Concentration of MK-8189 to Decrease by Half (Apparent Terminal Half-life [t1/2]) on Day 18 (Panels A, B, C) and Day 15 (Panel D)</title>
          <description>t1/2 was the time required to divide the plasma concentration of MK-8189 by half after reaching pseudo-equilibrium. At least three quantifiable terminal phase concentrations collected were used to calculate t1/2. To estimate t1/2, per protocol blood samples were collected 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48 hours post-dose on Day 18 for Panels A, B, C, and on Day 15 for Panel D. Per protocol t1/2 was analyzed by panel, dose and dosing regimen. Due to differing dosing regimen, some arms/doses weren't applicable to some timepoints, shown by 0 participants analyzed in the table. Per dosing regimen, the 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, 16 mg, 20 mg (Panels A, B, C), 8 mg, 16 mg, 24 mg, 36 mg (Panel D) study arms weren't applicable to the protocol-specified timepoints/days of t1/2 analysis and were excluded. GCV was reported as a percent. Per protocol placebo arms were excluded from t1/2 analysis.</description>
          <population>All participants who got ≥1 dose of MK-8189, had t1/2 data for Day 18 (Panels A, B, C) or Day 15 (Panel D). Per protocol t1/2 was analyzed by panel, dose, dosing regimen; based on dosing, some arms weren't applicable to some timepoints, shown by 0 participants analyzed. The 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, 16 mg, 20 mg (Panels A, B, C), 8 mg, 16 mg, 24 mg, 36 mg (Panel D) arms weren't applicable to the t1/2 timepoints; per protocol these arms and placebo arms were excluded.</population>
