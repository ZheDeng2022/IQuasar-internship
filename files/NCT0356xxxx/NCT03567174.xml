  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are several biomedical interventions that can help people who inject drugs&#xD;
      (particularly those with or at risk for HIV), but these services often do not get to the&#xD;
      people most in need. In this project investigators propose to determine if delivery of these&#xD;
      services to PWID by an integrated care van that is linked to a mobile syringe service program&#xD;
      improves clinical outcomes, is feasible and sustainable, and is cost-effective.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biomedical interventions that have direct applicability to people who inject drugs (PWID)&#xD;
      have flourished over the past 15 years (HIV treatment as prevention, pre-exposure&#xD;
      prophylaxis, office-based medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with buprenorphine, and&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment with direct acting agents). However, penetration of these&#xD;
      interventions among PWID is low relative to the potential benefits. Syringe service programs&#xD;
      (SSP) are an essential risk reduction service for PWID, and represent the outermost reach of&#xD;
      public health services for this population. The Baltimore City Health Department (BCHD) and&#xD;
      investigators at Johns Hopkins University are developing a dedicated integrated care van&#xD;
      (ICV) to complement the city's mobile SSP, with the goals of optimizing the HIV care cascade&#xD;
      in HIV-positive clients and extending needed biomedical interventions to PWID. A nurse&#xD;
      practitioner, case worker, and peer navigators will engage HIV-positive clients (known and&#xD;
      newly diagnosed) and collaborate closely with local HIV clinics to promote progress toward&#xD;
      durable viral suppression. To support the ICV's role in HIV care facilitation, investigators&#xD;
      propose an innovative application of the Center for Disease Control (CDC)-sponsored &quot;Data to&#xD;
      Care&quot; initiative - a multi-source health service database designed to assist health&#xD;
      departments track the HIV care cascade in real time. Additionally, the ICV will provide rapid&#xD;
      HIV testing, PrEP screening and initiation, buprenorphine-based MAT, HCV testing and&#xD;
      referrals to treatment, and wound care. Using a cluster-randomized trial design,&#xD;
      investigators propose to determine whether the ICV intervention advances the HIV care cascade&#xD;
      among HIV-positive PWID, improves the Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) continuum, and&#xD;
      increases uptake of MAT and HCV treatment (Aim 1). Additionally, investigators will examine&#xD;
      the implementation of the ICV intervention using a mixed methods approach among PWID,&#xD;
      local/state public health stakeholders, and medical providers to examine the intervention's&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, coverage, fidelity, and sustainability (Aim 2). Finally,&#xD;
      investigators will determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of the ICV intervention (Aim&#xD;
      3). Investigators have assembled a multi-disciplinary team with methodological expertise in&#xD;
      PWID interventions and cost-effectiveness evaluations, and longstanding collaboration with&#xD;
      investigators' partners at the BCHD.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Prior 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To capture the multifaceted nature of the ICV intervention and the array of health issues relevant to PWID, we developed a scoring rubric based on World Health Organization guidelines for evidence-based PWID services, a predictive risk model for HIV seroconversion among PWID developed by the Baltimore-based ALIVE study, the HCV care continuum, and the overdose epidemic. In the scoring rubric, points are allocated on the basis of failure to access evidence-based services, riskier behaviors, and adverse outcomes.&#xD;
This outcome will be assessed in all participants at all time points. The score is based on self-report, biomarker testing, and medical record review, and ranges from 0 to 15, with higher scores indicating worse overall status.</description>

    <description>To provide context to our study and identify facilitators and barriers to the intervention, we will conduct qualitative assessments. First, we will conduct in-depth interviews (IDIs) with ~ 30 PWID participants. The interview will explore accessibility, coverage, and barriers accessing the services in question. Second, we will conduct IDIs with Baltimore City Health Department (BCHD) staff who work on either the existing SSP van or the newly created ICV (N~12). The interview will explore feasibility, perceived benefits and challenges of offering services in the field, and changes in perceptions after intervention roll-out on the ICV. Third, we will conduct IDIs with BCHD and Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) officials and managers who are involved in PWID services (N~10). The interview will explore feasibility, and perceived benefits and challenges of offering services in the field on the ICV. We will digitally record the interviews.</description>
