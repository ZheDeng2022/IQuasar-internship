  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Existing real-world studies have provided evidence that novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in&#xD;
      general and rivaroxaban in particular are more effective and at least as safe as warfarin in&#xD;
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients with renal impairment. Nevertheless, it is&#xD;
      known that clinicians often hesitate to prescribe NOACs to patients with even moderate renal&#xD;
      impairment. Therefore, it is important to investigate effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban&#xD;
      and other NOACs compared to vitamin-K antagonists in NVAF patients with renal dysfunction in&#xD;
      real life setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to describe the risk of ischemic stroke (IS)/&#xD;
      systemic embolism (SE) and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in patients with non-valvular atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (NVAF) and renal impairment initiating treatment with individual NOACs&#xD;
      (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) compared to phenprocoumon.&#xD;
