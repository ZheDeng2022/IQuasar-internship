  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alarming rates of unhealthy alcohol, non-prescription drug, and tobacco use highlight the&#xD;
      preventable health risks of substance abuse and the urgent need to advance behavioral health&#xD;
      systems. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an efficacious&#xD;
      and effective strategy for the delivery of early intervention and treatment services for&#xD;
      people with substance use disorders as well as for those who are at-risk for developing these&#xD;
      disorders. A mixed methods phased cluster randomized approach is used to evaluate SBIRT&#xD;
      implementation in one medical surgical unit from each of 14 hospitals to inform SBIRT&#xD;
      implementation methods for rural, community and urban settings in Indiana. The long-term&#xD;
      objective is to develop an SBIRT toolkit to disseminate and sustain SBIRT use to increase the&#xD;
      screening of substance use, delivery of brief interventions, and referral to treatment&#xD;
      services. A broader dissemination will follow based on results of this study.&#xD;

      Aim 1: Test if implementation of SBIRT improves processes of care for hospital inpatients&#xD;
      currently using tobacco, alcohol or non-prescription drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Estimate the cost of SBIRT implementation and delivery for the health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phased cluster randomized mixed methods design using a wait-list usual care control on one&#xD;
      medical surgical unit in 14 hospitals will be conducted. The intervention is an SBIRT&#xD;
      toolkit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each hospital within the healthcare system is eligible to participate, and has agreed to&#xD;
      participate (N=14). A computer generated allocation based on a stratified random sampling&#xD;
      approach using SPSS was used to randomize hospitals into an intervention (Group 1, n=7) or&#xD;
      wait-list usual care control (Group 2, n=7) group. Prior to randomization, hospitals were&#xD;
      stratified by type (academic health center, community hospital, or critical access hospital).&#xD;
      Allocation to the intervention or wait-list usual care control groups is based on cluster,&#xD;
      and participants will be aware of their cluster allocation. One medical surgical unit within&#xD;
      each hospital will be selected by the nurse executive to participate. All hospitals will&#xD;
      receive the intervention. Group 1 (n=7) hospitals will participate in the implementation and&#xD;
      intervention first, with Group 2 (n=7) following six months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking cessation practices will be collected from nurses (N=560) at baseline. SBIRT use will&#xD;
      be collected from nurses on randomly selected days via survey. Observations of SBIRT use and&#xD;
      interviews with study coordinators will also be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBIRT process delivery for patients will be assessed through review of de-identified&#xD;
      electronic medical records (EMRs) abstracted at three time points: baseline, six-months post&#xD;
      and 12 months using a random sample of 61 patient EMRs from the participating hospital units&#xD;
      at each time point (N=2,562). Data abstracted is retrospective, and consists of SBIRT process&#xD;
      elements only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study protocol incorporates standardized education on using SBIRT through a&#xD;
      train-the-trainer approach. Site coordinators will receive information about the nurse survey&#xD;
      and secondary data abstraction procedures. Each group will receive training on the SBIRT&#xD;
      intervention (Group 1 first, then Group 2 six months later). Training for site coordinators&#xD;
      will include skills in how to teach SBIRT to others and systems strategies for promoting&#xD;
      SBIRT uptake. After the site coordinator training is completed, each hospital (via the site&#xD;
      coordinator) will train additional nurses, validate skills in SBIRT and develop a referral&#xD;
      process specific to its needs.&#xD;
