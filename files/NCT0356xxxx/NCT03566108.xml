  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare two incision designs to allow for coronal gingival/mucosal flap&#xD;
      advancement and tissue augmentation with acellular dermal matrix (ADM) graft around teeth&#xD;
      with gingival recession and a lack of adequate keratinized gingiva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators knowledge, these two techniques have not been compared for differences&#xD;
      in clinical (amount of root coverage, tissue thickness, and esthetics) and patient-centered&#xD;
      outcomes (pain, swelling, change in daily activities) in a controlled study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research data and daily clinical observations reveal that teeth with gingival recession and a&#xD;
      lack of adequate keratinized tissue (KT) are more prone to persistent gingival inflammation,&#xD;
      dentinal sensitivity, radicular (root) caries (tooth decay), faster periodontal attachment&#xD;
      loss, and compromised plaque control. Soft tissue grating (by various techniques) aims at&#xD;
      changing the quality, quantity and placement of the soft tissue around teeth by covering&#xD;
      exposed root surfaces and creating or increasing the zone of keratinized mucosa (KM)&#xD;
      surrounding the affected teeth. Both techniques tested have shown good clinical outcomes with&#xD;
      regard to root coverage, but clinical reports of the VISTA technique and other similar&#xD;
      techniques suggest that patients experience a decrease in site morbidity and discomfort&#xD;
      post-operatively. This study will compare two surgical incision designs used in conjunction&#xD;
      with coronally advanced flap (CAF) and acellular dermal matrix (ADM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims for this project include the evaluation of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of root coverage at 6 and 12 months following grafting with VISTA and&#xD;
           sulcular tunnel access with ADM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KT width at 6 and 12 month following grafting with VISTA and sulcular tunnel access with&#xD;
           ADM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in tissue thickness of the grafted sites at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Practitioner-assessed esthetic outcomes using a standardized pink esthetic scale (PES)&#xD;
           at 6 and 12 months postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient-assessed esthetic outcomes at 6 and 12 months post-operatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient centered outcomes including pain, bleeding, swelling, change in daily activities&#xD;
           at 1 week and 1 month postoperatively&#xD;
