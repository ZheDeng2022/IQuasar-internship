      PROMPT: a study of photopheresis for the treatment of erythrodermic mycosis fungoides and&#xD;
      Sézary syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the investigators invite patients suffering from erythrodermic mycosis&#xD;
      fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) whose skin symptoms have not responded to other types&#xD;
      of treatment prescribed by their doctors (symptoms came back or got worse) as well as&#xD;
      patients that never received any treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with photopheresis every two weeks for the first three months,&#xD;
      thereafter once monthly. One treatment cycle consists of 2 day treatment in a row. After 6&#xD;
      months of treatment, treatment can be given every 5 to 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the photopheresis procedure, the patient's blood is collected into a specialized&#xD;
      machine (THERAKOS CELLEX) that separates the white blood cells from the other blood&#xD;
      components. The other blood components are returned to the patient and white blood cells are&#xD;
      then treated with the drug methoxsalen, which makes them sensitive to ultraviolet light. The&#xD;
      treated white blood cells are exposed to ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation inside the machine,&#xD;
      and then returned to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As photopheresis has been used worldwide for more than 30 years, each hospital has developed&#xD;
      their own guidelines (e.g. which patients, frequency, etc). Recently, experts in the field&#xD;
      have developed a guidance which will now be tested in this study.&#xD;
