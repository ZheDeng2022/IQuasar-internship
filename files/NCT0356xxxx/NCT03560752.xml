    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well multi-peptide CMV-modified vaccinia Ankara (CMV-MVA&#xD;
      Triplex) vaccination of stem cell donors works in preventing cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia in&#xD;
      participants with blood cancer undergoing donor stem cell transplant. Giving a vaccine to the&#xD;
      donors may boost the recipient's immunity to this virus and reduce the chance of CMV disease&#xD;
      after transplant.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Establish the feasibility and safety of priming CMV immunity in donors by Triplex&#xD;
      vaccination prior to peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Examine if Triplex vaccination of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) donors has an&#xD;
      impact on CMV events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors receive multi-peptide CMV-modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine injection between days -60&#xD;
      and -10 prior to granulocyte colony stimulating factor mobilization. Participants undergo&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplantation on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 1 year.&#xD;

             has no known therapeutic efficacy against CMV and is allowable as standard of care to&#xD;
             prevent Herpes simplex virus (HSV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  RECIPIENT: Prophylactic therapy with CMV immunoglobulin or prophylactic antiviral CMV&#xD;
             treatment (Letermovir is permitted). EXCEPT for low risk patients [8/8 high resolution&#xD;

          -  RECIPIENT: Pregnant women and women who are lactating. The risks of CMV-MVA-Triplex to&#xD;

             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother. Breastfeeding should&#xD;
             be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  RECIPIENT: Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment,&#xD;
             contraindicate the patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety&#xD;
             concerns or compliance with clinical study procedures, e.g., social/ psychological&#xD;
             issues, etc&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  RECIPIENT: Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not&#xD;
