    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted into two parts 1) Screening of 400 cases of cirrhosis (Child&#xD;
      A,child B and child c) for the prevalence and risk factors of erectile dysfunction in&#xD;
      cirrhosis.2) The part 2 is RCT as follows where 70 cases in each arm will be taken wuth child&#xD;
      A and child B cirrhosis for the effect of treatment on erectile dysfunction (Tadalafil vs&#xD;
      Placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After getting informed consent. Clinical, anthropometric and biochemical assessment will be&#xD;
      done by candidate, co-supervisors and supervisor. Screening and selection criteria by using&#xD;
      various questionnaire like Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) , IIEF Questionnaire , ADAMS&#xD;
      Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) questionnaire, Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PHQ-9 for depression ; and SF-36 questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informed consent will be obtained from the participants in the study. Patients-ED IIEF&lt;25&#xD;
      will be included as per inclusion and exclusion criteria. Tadalfil regimen: 10 mg daily at&#xD;
      any time before anticipated sexual activity on days with anticipated sexual activity On days&#xD;
      with no anticipated sexual activity: 10 mg daily at night after meals. Follow-up1 week,&#xD;
      2weeks, 4weeks, 12 weeks with history, clinical examination and laboratory test.&#xD;
