  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare disorder of autonomic and&#xD;
      respiratory regulation that frequently alters oxygen delivery to the brain. In CCHS,&#xD;
      neurocognitive function has been of great concern because of the potential for repeated&#xD;
      hypoxemia and hypercarbia in activities of daily living in addition to hypoventilation with&#xD;
      related hypoxemia and hypercarbia during sleep. As the world's leading referral center for&#xD;
      CCHS, the Center for Autonomic Medicine in Pediatrics (CAMP) is engaged in ongoing research&#xD;
      to identify factors that impact neurocognitive performance in patients with CCHS in order to&#xD;
      optimize clinical management and improve long term neurocognitive outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this IRB-approved research study is to implement the NIH Toolbox as a standard&#xD;
      measurement of cognitive health in patients with CCHS. Further, the study aims to determine&#xD;
      how intrinsic and extrinsic disease factors such as age at diagnosis, PHOX2B mutation type&#xD;
      and genotype, and nature of past and present artificial respiratory intervention affect the&#xD;
      NIH Toolbox Cognitive scores of individuals with CCHS. Eligible participants will complete a&#xD;
      45-minute NIH Toolbox assessment and parents (or adult participants) will complete an&#xD;
      associated, 15-minute Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CCHS is a genetic autonomic nervous system disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the&#xD;
      PHOX2B gene. 90-92% are caused by polyalanine repeat expansion mutations (PARMs) with 4 to 13&#xD;
      additional alanines on the affected allele in the 20 alanine repeat region of exon 3&#xD;
      (resulting genotype is 20/24-20/33). The remaining 8-10% of PHOX2B mutations are non-PARMs&#xD;
      including missense, nonsense, frameshift or stop codon mutations. And less than 1% of CCHS&#xD;
      patients are heterozygous for a large deletion eliminating the entire PHOX2B gene and&#xD;
      potentially other neighboring genes. Different causative mutations vary in the level of&#xD;
      associated protein dysfunction, leading to variability in the severity of the CCHS phenotype,&#xD;
      and potentially in the severity and frequency of resulting neurocognitive insult. Severe&#xD;
      cyanotic breath-holding spells and prolonged sinus pauses are two phenotypic features of CCHS&#xD;
      known to alter regional blood flow/oxygen saturation to the brain (near-infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy; personal communication 2018). The fact that both of these phenotypic&#xD;
      presentations are associated with particular PHOX2B genotypes suggests that genetic factors,&#xD;
      intrinsic to CCHS pathology, might influence neurocognitive outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent report suggests that a number of extrinsic factors might also affect neurocognitive&#xD;
      performance in patients with CCHS with later identification and less than conservative&#xD;
      management in terms of artificial ventilation. While all cases of CCHS require assisted&#xD;
      ventilation during sleep, some more severe cases require 24-hour/day artificial ventilation.&#xD;
      Methods of assisted ventilation differ case-by-case and are chosen based on several factors,&#xD;
      including the patient's level of alveolar hypoventilation, physician recommendation, and a&#xD;
      family's ability to provide the recommended support. While these mechanisms are all meant to&#xD;
      ensure optimal ventilation, the level of physiological oxygen stability and the stability of&#xD;
      carbon dioxide levels provided with each varies. Thus, methods of respiratory assistance are&#xD;
      likely to influence neurocognitive outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no standard mechanism for examining the neurocognitive impact that&#xD;
      intrinsic pathology (PHOX2B genotype) and extrinsic factors (age of diagnosis and method of&#xD;
      respiratory assistance) have on CCHS patients across age groups and between sites. In order&#xD;
      to establish such a standard, this study aims to use a brief and reliable cognitive battery&#xD;
      called the NIH Toolbox at multiple sites. The NIH Toolbox was developed to standardize&#xD;
      evaluations in specific clinical populations for investigations of neurological development&#xD;
      and change, disease recovery, and therapeutic interventions. The Toolbox consists of a series&#xD;
      of cognitive assessments of executive function, attention, memory, and language designed for&#xD;
      broad use across age groups from childhood to adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will initially be recruited during clinical visits at the Ann &amp;&#xD;
      Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Seattle Children's Hospital, and Children's&#xD;
      Hospital Los Angeles as well as at meetings of the CCHS Family Network. All participants will&#xD;
      complete a 45-minute NIH Toolbox cognitive assessment that is administered on an iPad by&#xD;
      trained study staff. Additionally, parents (or adult participants) will complete a simple,&#xD;
      15-minute, electronic REDCap questionnaire designed to obtain basic information including&#xD;
      PHOX2B genotype, age of CCHS diagnosis, past and present artificial ventilation interface&#xD;
      (example mask, tracheostomy, etc.), past and present mode of artificial ventilation (positive&#xD;
      pressure ventilator, negative pressure ventilator, phrenic nerve-diaphragm pacers),&#xD;
      phenotype, and disease history. After initial participation, study subjects will complete the&#xD;
      Toolbox and questionnaire at annual clinic visits or potentially at CCHS Family Network&#xD;
      meetings to allow for longitudinal data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will validate the NIH Toolbox as an assessment of cognitive performance and&#xD;
      longitudinal cognitive outcomes in CCHS patients. Additionally, the study will characterize&#xD;
      the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic disease factors on the neurocognitive outcomes of&#xD;
      affected individuals in order optimize care for CCHS patients.&#xD;
