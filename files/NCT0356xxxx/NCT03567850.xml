  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this 2-year study will assess the acceptability and feasibility of offering&#xD;
      Problem Solving Skills Therapy (PSST) to cancer survivors and their caregivers focusing on&#xD;
      the highest risk patients with distress.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, in collaboration with the University at Buffalo&#xD;
      School of Public Health and Health Professions and the University of Rochester, we are&#xD;
      looking for adult cancer patients to participate in our new project designed to facilitate&#xD;
      recovery from cancer and help cancer survivors lead better, more productive lives. The ideal&#xD;
      subjects are individuals who have completed treatment for stage I-III cancer and speak&#xD;
      English. Participants will be randomized into two groups: 8 weekly 1-hour long sessions of&#xD;
      problem solving skills therapy delivered by a trained therapist vs. care as usual. Bright&#xD;
      IDEAS Adult Cancer (Bright IDEAS-AC) therapy will be delivered in the most patient-friendly&#xD;
      way. Sessions will be face-to-face at the location of patient choice (hospital, clinic, or&#xD;
      participant's home) or over the phone. A supportive other or caregiver is also invited to&#xD;
      participate in this study. This project does not involve any experimental drugs and does not&#xD;
      affect the regular care or patient relationship with doctor(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of enrollment, after 3 months and after 6 months, all participants in the&#xD;
      intervention and control arms, as well as any participating supportive others/caregivers will&#xD;
      be asked about their healthcare utilization since the last assessment including primary care,&#xD;
      specialist and emergency department visits and any hospital stays. During the same three time&#xD;
      points, both patients and supportive others/caregivers will be asked to fill in 4 short&#xD;
      questionnaires assessing their problem solving skills, health status, mood and function&#xD;

    <description>Care As Usual Group (CAU): Participants randomized to the CAU group will be observed under naturalistic conditions. Both PSST and CAU participants and their clinicians (PCP and oncology providers) will be allowed to use any clinically appropriate medical and behavioral care without restriction (e.g., care management, rehabilitation, behavioral therapy, palliative care) or refer patients to social and community services (e.g., peer support, county cancer services program or aging services). The CAU participants will undergo the same evaluation protocol as the PSST group</description>

    <description>Participants will be encouraged to identify specific problems particularly relevant to them and to their family's situation (instead of providing them with standardized examples) to be discussed and &quot;solved&quot; during the PSST sessions. The eight sessions of PSST will be organized in a systematized, therapeutic manner. Session 1 will be face-to-face and devoted to rapport building and understanding relevant social and medical information. The therapist (RA) will introduce PSST and the Bright IDEAS paradigm, present worksheets to guide PSST homework assignments, and give an overview of subsequent sessions. Starting at session 2, participants will continue training over the phone, with the same general structure and format. In sessions 2-7, the therapist and patient, with a supportive other (SO) if available, will review the patient's identified problems and work on application of problem-solving strategies and skills learned earlier.</description>
