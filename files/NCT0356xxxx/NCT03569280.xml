  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study of KPG-121 administered orally once daily&#xD;
      (QD) in 28-day treatment cycles (21 days on and 7 days off) to adult subjects. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) and assess dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of KPG-121 in combination with Enzalutamide or&#xD;
      Abiraterone or Apalutamide when administered orally to adult subjects with non-metastatic or&#xD;
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study will comprise two parts: Part 1 will be a 3+3 dose escalation design to&#xD;
      characterize the MTD and a RP2D, Part 2 will be an expansion cohort at RP2D. In Part 1,&#xD;
      multiple escalating dose levels of KPG-121 (six cohorts: 1.5, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20, and 30&#xD;
      mg/day) in combination with Enzalutamide or Abiraterone or Apalutamide will be evaluated to&#xD;
      determine the MTD and RP2D of KPG-121. A RP2D will be selected based on the MTD as well as&#xD;
      the information including safety, efficacy, and PSA data. The Part 2 will follow the same&#xD;
      schedule of procedures as Part 1 once the RP2D has been decided. For the expansion cohort of&#xD;
      part 2, subjects will be given the RP2D once daily for 21 consecutive days along with&#xD;
      Enzalutamide or Abiraterone or Apalutamide followed by 7 days without KPG-121 for each 28-day&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
