  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A. Anemia is a common problem affecting pregnancy and can result in profound consequences to&#xD;
      both the mother and the growing fetus. Current treatment usually includes administration of&#xD;
      oral or IV iron, or blood transfusions. Vitamin C is known to affect iron metabolism and has&#xD;
      been shown to improve outcomes when used in addition to iron, however, few studies have been&#xD;
      performed in pregnancy. The primary aim of this study is to identify the effects of vitamin C&#xD;
      on anemia in pregnancy. The Investigators propose a double-blind, randomized placebo&#xD;
      controlled trial of 1000mg vitamin C supplementation in 200 low risk pregnancies with&#xD;
      iron-deficiency anemia. All newly enrolled patients, who meet inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, will receive the standard of care evaluation and treatment for anemia in pregnancy.&#xD;
      Additionally, patients will be randomized to receive either placebo or vitamin C and&#xD;
      compliance monitored with a pill diary. Data will be analyzed by T tests and Mann-Whitney U&#xD;
      test. If the data shows a positive statistical significance, vitamin C may be a useful&#xD;
      supplement to iron in treating anemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A. Anemia is the most common hematological abnormality during pregnancy and was found to&#xD;
      affect 24.1% of pregnant women in a WHO study.2 The most common types of anemia affecting&#xD;
      pregnancy are iron-deficiency and acute blood loss. Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid,&#xD;
      has been well documented to play an active role in the absorption and metabolism of iron from&#xD;
      the gut.6 Vitamin C has been used in studies to treat anemic non-pregnant women resulting in&#xD;
      significant increases in hemoglobin levels. Similar effects have been found in multiple&#xD;
      studies using vitamin C as adjunct treatment for hemodialysis patients with non-responsive&#xD;
      anemia.10,12 Vitamin C has already been extensively studied in pregnant women for its effects&#xD;
      on preeclampsia, preterm birth, neonatal morbidity and other outcomes, and found to have no&#xD;
      adverse effects in doses as high as 1000mg daily or in combination with other medications.8&#xD;
      After an extensive literature search, very few studies have been performed assessing the&#xD;
      effect on hemoglobin levels after vitamin C supplementation. One study by Sharma et al.&#xD;
      supplemented pregnant women with 500mg vitamin C and found a 18.04% increase in hemoglobin&#xD;
      compared to 5.49% in the control.11 A Cochran Review of 29 studies did not discuss or&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of vitamin C on anemia.8 Due to the minimal side-effect profile and&#xD;
      potential benefits of successfully treating anemia, further research in the area is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. SPECIFIC AIMS OR OBJECTIVES A. To perform a double-blinded, randomized placebo controlled&#xD;
      trial of 1000mg vitamin c supplementation on iron-deficiency anemia in low-risk pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. SIGNIFICANCE TO PATIENT, INSTITUTION, PROFESSION, OR ALL A. Anemia has been associated&#xD;
      with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, to include, but not limited to low birth weight,&#xD;
      preterm delivery, perinatal mortality and postpartum depression.1 Per ACOG guidelines, all&#xD;
      pregnant women should be screened for anemia, evaluated for causes and provided supplemental&#xD;
      iron. A study by Sharma et al has already demonstrated a significant increase in hemoglobin&#xD;
      levels in pregnancy with 500mg vitamin C supplementation.11 Due to the paucity of research of&#xD;
      vitamin C in pregnancy, further studies are needed to determine reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. METHODS A. The investigators plan to enroll 200 patients total, 100 per arm. Potential&#xD;
      subjects will be screened by study personal from the new intakes for prenatal care in the&#xD;
      Five Rivers Center for Women's Health. A complete blood count (CBC) is obtained as standard&#xD;
      of care at the first prenatal visit. The CBC includes hemoglobin level, hematocrit, and red&#xD;
      blood cell indices (i.e. MCV and MCH). Pregnant women in the first half of their pregnancy&#xD;
      who are found to have a hematocrit level less than 33% (Caucasian and other races), and less&#xD;
      than 31% (African American women), will be potentially eligible for enrollment. Women who are&#xD;
      noted to be anemic per these thresholds will have iron studies (iron, transferrin, ferritin)&#xD;
      and hemoglobin electrophoresis (if not already performed), as part of the standard of care&#xD;
      for the evaluation of anemia during pregnancy.1 Inclusion criteria consists of gestational&#xD;
      age at enrollment less than 20 0/7 weeks, singleton gestation, iron deficiency anemia defined&#xD;
      as maternal serum ferritin levels less than 15 micrograms/dL, and planned delivery at Miami&#xD;
      Valley Hospital. Exclusion criteria consist of vitamin C use &gt;150mg/day (typical prenatal&#xD;
      vitamin contains 60mg Vitamin C), diabetes (gestational, types 1,2); chronic medical disease;&#xD;
      known or discovered hemoglobinopathy (including heterozygous states); known metabolic disease&#xD;
      that may contribute to impaired iron absorption (including a history of bariatric surgery,&#xD;
      renal disease and an inability to tolerate oral iron); known fetal abnormalities;&#xD;
      participation in another interventional trial; illicit drug or alcohol use. All&#xD;
      risks/benefits will be reviewed and all questions answered prior to the patient being&#xD;
      enrolled. Written informed consent will be obtained by a study investigator or qualified&#xD;
      personnel. Gestational dating will be based upon the best obstetrical estimate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. A compounding pharmacy will make 30,000 placebo capsules containing an inert substance&#xD;
      (i.e. silica based cellulose), identical appearing to 30,000 capsules of 500mg vitamin C. The&#xD;
      pharmacy will package 300 pills of either placebo or vitamin C into 200 boxes, labeled only&#xD;
      with the project name and a number. A key containing the known substance of each box and&#xD;
      number will be kept by the pharmacy until the end of the study. The boxes will be stored in a&#xD;
      secured area of the principal investigators office. The boxes will be taken to Five Rivers&#xD;
      Women's Health Clinic to be distributed to enrolled patients. Once enrolled, patients will be&#xD;
      given a random box and instructed to take 1 pill twice daily. Patients will be instructed to&#xD;
      record pill usage daily for compliance. The patient's name and assigned box number will be&#xD;
      kept in a locked cabinet. At the end of the study, the two keys will be compared to determine&#xD;
      who received placebo or vitamin C. Both groups will receive prescriptions for ferrous&#xD;
      sulfate, 65mg taken once daily; docusate sodium to be taken as needed for constipation; and&#xD;
      prenatal vitamins once daily. Patients will receive follow up labs as part of the standard of&#xD;
      care for anemia, to include at 28 week, and at delivery. All data will be collected in an&#xD;
      Excel spreadsheet, with patient identifiers removed. Data will be analyzed by applying basic&#xD;
      T tests and the Mann-Whitney-U test to determine the changes in lab values of hemoglobin,&#xD;
      hematocrit, iron, transferrin, ferritin between experimental and control before and after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
