  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      2X-121 is a small molecule targeted inhibitor of Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), a key&#xD;
      enzyme involved in DNA damage repair in cancer cells. The PARP inhibitor demonstrated&#xD;
      clinical activity in a prior Phase 1 study in a number of solid tumors. 2X-121 has a novel&#xD;
      dual-inhibitory action against both PARP 1/2 and Tankyrase 1/2. The molecule is also active&#xD;
      in P-glycoprotein expressing cells, suggesting it may overcome some of the PARP inhibitor&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 2 study is using 2x-121 DRPÂ® biomarker in metastatic breast cancer patients to&#xD;
      identify patients likely to respond to and benefit from treatment with 2X-121.&#xD;
