  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was carried out to determine the prevalence,incidence and factors associated with&#xD;
      intra-abdominal hypertension among patients admitted in three intensive care units in Kampala&#xD;
      Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was a multi-center prospective cohort study carried out in three intensive care units&#xD;
      where 126 patients that met the eligibility criteria were included in the&#xD;
      study,demographics,of these were recorded and intra-abdominal pressure measured using the&#xD;
      intra-vesical technique at 0,24,and 72 hours.data entry was done using epi-data version&#xD;
      3.1.Data analysis is on going.&#xD;

      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the prevalence, incidence and associated factors of intra-abdominal hypertension&#xD;
      among patients admitted in intensive care units in Uganda?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is defined as intra-abdominal pressure greater than or&#xD;
      equal to 12mmHg. In the developed world, it has been found to be common among critically ill&#xD;
      patients and associated with high morbidity and mortality. The world society of Abdominal&#xD;
      Compartment Syndrome recommends routine screening for IAH of all critically ill patients upon&#xD;
      ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several factors have been arguably associated with intra-abdominal hypertension some of which&#xD;
      are common among the critically ill patients in our setting. However Intra-abdominal&#xD;
      hypertension has not been given due attention in Ugandan critical care units as evidenced by&#xD;
      paucity of data concerning its prevalence, low levels of awareness among critical care&#xD;
      medical staff, low levels of screening for IAH and limited routine measurement of&#xD;
      intra-abdominal pressure among patients admitted in these units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-abdominal hypertension if undetected results in multi-organ dysfunction, increased&#xD;
      length of ICU stay, morbidity, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study therefore seeks to determine the prevalence, incidence and risk factors of&#xD;
      intra-abdominal hypertension among the critically ill in Ugandan ICUs so as to create a basis&#xD;
      from which protocols to identify, prevent and manage it may be derived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the incidence, prevalence and factors associated with intra-abdominal&#xD;
      hypertension among patients admitted in intensive care units in Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the baseline 24 hour and 72 hour prevalence of intra-abdominal hypertension&#xD;
      among patients admitted in intensive care units in Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the 24 hour and 72 hour incidence of intra-abdominal hypertension among patients&#xD;
      admitted in intensive care units in Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine factors associated with intra-abdominal hypertension among patients admitted in&#xD;
      the intensive care units in Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design: Multi-center prospective cohort study. This design was chosen in order to&#xD;
      achieve better representation of patients in intensive care units in Uganda. It s a&#xD;
      prospective study because currently there is paucity of data concerning the subject hence a&#xD;
      retrospective analysis could not be done. Also follow up of patients is required to assess&#xD;
      factors associated with intra-abdominal hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients admitted to the intensive care units will be recruited in the study. Patients'&#xD;
      demographics will be recorded at admission. A urinary catheter shall be inserted and intra&#xD;
      abdominal pressure measured at admission, 24 hours, and 72 hours. The patients will then be&#xD;
      followed up for 28 day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: 111 Subjects' state of physical health: seriously ill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source of participating subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mulago National Referral intensive care unit Nakasero hospital limited intensive care unit&#xD;
      International Hospital Kampala intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients admitted in the intensive care units of the study sites during the study&#xD;
           period shall be recruited in the study. A waiver of consent shall be obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All recruited patients shall be reviewed at T0, T24, and T72 hours T0 defined as 0-3&#xD;
           hours post ICU admission, T24 defined as 24 hours post ICU admission, and T72 as 72&#xD;
           hours post ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. During the study period, the principle investigator and /or research assistants using&#xD;
           the data collection tool attached will collect data on day of admission, T72 hours and&#xD;
           follow up patients for 28 day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data collected will include: patients 'demographics, referral source, indication for ICU&#xD;
           admission, admission vital parameters, mode of ventilation, ventilation period, length&#xD;
           of ICU stay, date of death/discharge from the ICU, 24 hour and cumulative fluid balance&#xD;
           and intra-abdominal pressure measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The patients shall be catherized using a three way Foleys catheter, the urinary bladder&#xD;
           drained and 25mls of normal saline instilled in the bladder. The tubing of the&#xD;
           collecting bag will be clamped and the catheter connected to a saline manometer. The&#xD;
           pressure will then be measured in centimeters of water at the end of expiration. This&#xD;
           will be done at T0, T24 and T72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The patients will then be followed up for 28 day ICU mortality, length of stay in the&#xD;
           ICU, and duration of ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks/benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-abdominal pressure measurement using the intra-vesical (bladder) technique is a safe&#xD;
      and acceptable procedure worldwide and no complications have been noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensivists in charge of the units will be notified about patients found to have&#xD;
      intra-abdominal hypertension and they will decide the management fit for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality assurances:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patients' identification will be by IP numbers and not individual names&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The data collected will be saved in multiple storage devices and stored in secure places&#xD;
           such as drop box.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All saved data copies will be updated on a weekly basis and resaved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conflict of interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principle investigator has no conflict of interest.&#xD;
