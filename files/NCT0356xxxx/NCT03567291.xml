    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) for Parts A &amp; B Combined</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 55</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events were analyzed for all participants in Parts A &amp; B combined as one group for this outcome measure. An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Incudes clinically significant changes such as changes in vital signs or lab values. Relationship of AE to treatment was determined by the Investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized the participant and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) Total Tic Score (TTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 8, 15, 28, 41, 54, and 55</time_frame>
    <description>YGTSS rating scale is a semi-structured clinician rating instrument that provides an evaluation of the number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference of motor and phonic tics. YGTSS is composed of 11 items: 5 items for motor tic severity, 5 items for vocal tic severity, and 1 item for impairment. Each item for motor tic severity and vocal is rated on a 6-point scale (0 for none to 5 to severe). MTSS is the sum of the 5 items for motor tic severity and VTSS is the sum of the 5 items for vocal tic severity. TTS is the sum of MTSS and VTSS, ranges from 0 (none/absent) to 50 (severe). Higher scores indicate greater severity/worse outcome. Baseline is defined as the last measurement on or prior to the first dose of the open-label study medication.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 8, 15, 28, 41, 54, and 55</time_frame>
    <description>The TS-CGI scale is a 7-point Likert scale that allows the clinician to use all available information to assess the impact of tics on the participant's quality of life. The TS-CGI is rated as follows: 1 (normal or no tics at all), 2 (borderline), 3 (mild), 4 (moderate), 5 (marked), 6 (severe), and 7 (extreme, incapacitating tics). Lower scores indicate better quality of life. Baseline is defined as the last measurement on or prior to the first dose of the open-label study medication.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 8, 15, 28, 41, 54, and 55</time_frame>
    <description>The TS-PGII is a single-item questionnaire that asks the participant to assess the degree of impact due to current tics (How much do your current tics disrupt things in your life?). The TS-PGII uses a 5-point scale, ranging from not at all (1) to very much (5), to assess overall response to therapy. Baseline is defined as the last measurement on or prior to the first dose of the open-label study medication.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome - Quality of Life (C&amp;A-GTS-QOL) Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Subscale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 6, 28, 34, 54</time_frame>
    <description>C&amp;A-GTS-QOL is a 27-item questionnaire that asks participant to assess the extent to which their quality of life is impacted by their symptoms. C&amp;A-GTS-QOL contains 6 subscales (cognitive, coprophenomena, psychological, physical, obsessive-compulsive, and ADL) and uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from no problem to extreme problem. Following 3 questions from 27-item questionnaire were assessed in ADL C&amp;A-GTS-QOL subscale: Question 2 (Had difficulty with school or sport activities?), 24 (Felt you needed more help or support from other people?), and 26 (Had difficulty going out with other people?). Total score of ADL subscale ranged from 0 (no problem) to 12 (extreme problem). Lower score indicated better quality of life. Baseline is defined as the last measurement on or prior to the first dose of the open-label study medication.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>228 participants with Tourette Syndrome were enrolled after completing one of two eligible parent studies.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Period I (Part A) included a 28-week open-label period with a 7-week titration period followed by a maintenance period. Period II (Part B) included a two-week randomized drug withdrawal period (Weeks 28-30) in which participants were administered their current TEV50717 dose or placebo. Participants were re-titrated to TEV-50717 from Weeks 31-34. In Period III (Part A resumed), participants continued their open-label maintenance dose of TEV50717.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) Total Tic Score (TTS)</title>
        <description>YGTSS rating scale is a semi-structured clinician rating instrument that provides an evaluation of the number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference of motor and phonic tics. YGTSS is composed of 11 items: 5 items for motor tic severity, 5 items for vocal tic severity, and 1 item for impairment. Each item for motor tic severity and vocal is rated on a 6-point scale (0 for none to 5 to severe). MTSS is the sum of the 5 items for motor tic severity and VTSS is the sum of the 5 items for vocal tic severity. TTS is the sum of MTSS and VTSS, ranges from 0 (none/absent) to 50 (severe). Higher scores indicate greater severity/worse outcome. Baseline is defined as the last measurement on or prior to the first dose of the open-label study medication.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Tourette Syndrome-Clinical Global Impression (TS-CGI) Score</title>
        <description>The TS-CGI scale is a 7-point Likert scale that allows the clinician to use all available information to assess the impact of tics on the participant's quality of life. The TS-CGI is rated as follows: 1 (normal or no tics at all), 2 (borderline), 3 (mild), 4 (moderate), 5 (marked), 6 (severe), and 7 (extreme, incapacitating tics). Lower scores indicate better quality of life. Baseline is defined as the last measurement on or prior to the first dose of the open-label study medication.</description>

        <description>The TS-PGII is a single-item questionnaire that asks the participant to assess the degree of impact due to current tics (How much do your current tics disrupt things in your life?). The TS-PGII uses a 5-point scale, ranging from not at all (1) to very much (5), to assess overall response to therapy. Baseline is defined as the last measurement on or prior to the first dose of the open-label study medication.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome - Quality of Life (C&amp;A-GTS-QOL) Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Subscale Score</title>
        <description>C&amp;A-GTS-QOL is a 27-item questionnaire that asks participant to assess the extent to which their quality of life is impacted by their symptoms. C&amp;A-GTS-QOL contains 6 subscales (cognitive, coprophenomena, psychological, physical, obsessive-compulsive, and ADL) and uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from no problem to extreme problem. Following 3 questions from 27-item questionnaire were assessed in ADL C&amp;A-GTS-QOL subscale: Question 2 (Had difficulty with school or sport activities?), 24 (Felt you needed more help or support from other people?), and 26 (Had difficulty going out with other people?). Total score of ADL subscale ranged from 0 (no problem) to 12 (extreme problem). Lower score indicated better quality of life. Baseline is defined as the last measurement on or prior to the first dose of the open-label study medication.</description>

C&amp;A-GTS-QOL contains 6 subscales (cognitive, coprophenomena, psychological, physical, obsessive-compulsive, and ADL) and uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from no problem to extreme problem. Following 3 questions from 27-item questionnaire were assessed in ADL C&amp;A-GTS-QOL subscale: Question 2 (Had difficulty with school or sport activities?), 24 (Felt you needed more help or support from other people?), and 26 (Had difficulty going out with other people?). Total score of ADL subscale ranged from 0 (no problem) to 12 (extreme problem). Lower score indicated better quality of life. Baseline is defined as the last measurement on or prior to the first dose of the open-label study medication.</description>
          <population>Data were not collected during Part B (Period II). ITT analysis set includes all participants enrolled in part I. Here, 'number analyzed' signifies participants evaluable at specified time points.</population>

        <title>Change From Randomized Withdrawal Baseline (Week 28) in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) Total Tic Score (TTS) to Week 30</title>
        <description>YGTSS rating scale is a semi-structured clinician rating instrument that provides an evaluation of the number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference of motor and phonic tics. YGTSS is composed of 11 items: 5 items for motor tic severity, 5 items for vocal tic severity, and 1 item for impairment. Each item for motor tic severity and vocal is rated on a 6-point scale (0 for none to 5 to severe). MTSS is the sum of the 5 items for motor tic severity and VTSS is the sum of the 5 items for vocal tic severity. TTS is the sum of MTSS and VTSS, ranges from 0 (none/absent) to 50 (severe). Higher scores indicate greater severity/worse outcome. The model is an ANCOVA model that includes fixed effects for treatment group. The randomized withdrawal baseline TTS and age group at baseline (2 levels: 6-11 years, 12-18 years) are included as covariates.</description>

        <population>All participants that completed Part 1, were randomized to Part 2, received at least one dose of study drug in the randomized withdrawal period and have an YGTSS TTS at both week 28 visit (randomized withdrawal baseline) and week 30 visit, and have a ≥25% reduction in the TTS from baseline in the parent study to week 28.</population>
