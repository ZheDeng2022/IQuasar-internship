  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being performed to assess the feasibility of adapting radiotherapy plans based&#xD;
      on functional lung information and increasing the dose to the primary tumour. This is a&#xD;
      single arm interventional pilot study involving 20 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims Primary: to assess the feasibility of using ventilation and perfusion positron emission&#xD;
      computed tomography (V/Q PET/CT) scans to adapt radiotherapy plans using Volumetric Modulated&#xD;
      Arc Therapy (VMAT) to avoid regions of functional lung and deliver a higher dose to the&#xD;
      primary tumour Secondary: to assess the incidence of acute and late radiotherapy toxicities,&#xD;
      to quantify regional ventilation loss and regional perfusion loss on post treatment V/Q&#xD;
      PET/CT, to assess associations of V/Q PET/CT with other functional lung imaging techniques,&#xD;
      to assess overall survival, progression free survival and quality of life outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 20 patients stage IIIa-c non-small cell lung cancer for curative intent&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: All patients will receive functional lung adapted 60 Gray (Gy) in 30 fractions to&#xD;
      the primary and nodal planning target volume with a simultaneous integrated boost to the&#xD;
      primary tumour to a total dose 69Gy in 30 fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes: That functionally adapted lung radiotherapy using V/Q PET/CT imaging and&#xD;
      VMAT planning is technically feasible.&#xD;
