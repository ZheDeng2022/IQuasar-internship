  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People are living longer and are more likely to survive a heart attack if they have one.&#xD;
      Longer life expectancy is good but it also means more people get chronic heart failure over&#xD;
      time. This is a condition in which the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should.&#xD;
      Treatment of chronic heart failure has not improved much in a few decades. Researchers want&#xD;
      to see if giving a dietary supplement to people with heart failure can help their heart&#xD;
      function. The supplement is nicotinamide riboside (NR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how NR affects skeletal muscle function in people with heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18-70 with clinically stable systolic heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will answer&#xD;
      demographic questions and review their current medical treatments. They will have blood and&#xD;
      urine tests. They will have an echocardiogram. This uses sound waves to test heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 8 study visits over 16 weeks. At these visits, they will have some of&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat of screening tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin sample taken&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skeletal muscle exercise Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Muscles will be&#xD;
      measured while participants do foot exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Participants may ride a stationary bike or walk on a&#xD;
      treadmill. A facemask will analyze their breath. Heart and blood pressure measurements will&#xD;
      be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take the supplement in pill form each day for 12 weeks. Pill bottles will&#xD;
      be checked at study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants should not significantly change their activity levels during the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As life expectancy increases and acute cardiac mortality decreases, the incidence of chronic&#xD;
      heart failure (HF) continues to rise, and despite this, conceptual advances in the treatment&#xD;
      of chronic heart failure have not increased substantially over last few decades. One&#xD;
      intracellular component of heart failure progression is mitochondrial bioenergetic&#xD;
      dysfunction. Although the mechanism underpinning this is not completely understood, recent&#xD;
      metabolomics data demonstrated an incomplete flux of metabolites through oxidative&#xD;
      phosphorylation (OX PHOS) in HF. In parallel, data has shown that hyperacetylation of&#xD;
      mitochondrial bioenergetic enzymes, with the concomitant blunting of enzymatic activity is&#xD;
      evident in HF. Putting these together, an emerging hypothesis implicates excessive&#xD;
      acetylation of mitochondrial proteins with the subsequent blunting of bioenergetic enzyme&#xD;
      function, as a mechanism underpinning incomplete flux through OX PHOS resulting in HF&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel with cardiac bioenergetic deficiency chronic HF subjects display disrupted&#xD;
      skeletal muscle OX PHOS, which is thought to contribute towards overall fatigue and reduced&#xD;
      exercise tolerance. Interestingly exercise training in HF subjects improves skeletal muscle&#xD;
      mitochondrial OX PHOS capacity and subject activity levels. Exercise training additionally&#xD;
      increases activity of the mitochondrial regulatory deacetylase sirtuin enzymes SIRT1 and&#xD;
      SIRT3, in parallel with improved skeletal muscle OX PHOS capacity. At the same time&#xD;
      HF-associated disruption in skeletal muscle metabolic function activates skeletal muscle&#xD;
      cytokine production. These inflammatory programs, in turn, are proposed to contribute towards&#xD;
      impaired functional capacity in HF. Interestingly, and mirroring improved OX PHOS following&#xD;
      exercise programs in HF studies, exercise training similarly reduces skeletal muscle&#xD;
      inflammatory effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical and bioenergetic consequences of impaired mitochondrial OX PHOS leads to&#xD;
      decreased NAD+ levels, which exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction by inactivating the NAD+&#xD;
      dependent sirtuin enzymes. Experimental studies using NAD+ precursors to increase NAD+&#xD;
      production have been shown to normalize NADH/NAD+ ratios and activate Sirtuin enzymes,&#xD;
      resulting in enhanced OX PHOS with beneficial effects in numerous systems including skeletal&#xD;
      muscle and in the blunting of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study we will directly assess the effect of the NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide&#xD;
      riboside (NR) on skeletal muscle mitochondrial OX PHOS in HF subjects using: skeletal muscle&#xD;
      Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy assessment of the rate of high energy phosphate&#xD;
      recovery in response to submaximal exercise; assessment of the effect of NR on functional&#xD;
      capacity using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to determine VO(2max) and anaerobic&#xD;
      threshold; evaluation of the NR effect on serum metabolomics at rest and in response to CPET;&#xD;
      and by measuring circulating cytokine levels pre- and post- NR administration. These studies&#xD;
      would enable a more comprehensive assessment of the role for NR supplementation on skeletal&#xD;
      muscle mitochondrial function in subjects with systolic HF&#xD;
