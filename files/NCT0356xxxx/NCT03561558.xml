    <textblock>
      To demonstrate bioequivalence of single dose test formulation of Ibuprofen,oral suspension&#xD;
      200 mg/5 ml (containing ibuprofen 200 mg) of Pharmtechnology LLC, Republic of Belarus with&#xD;
      reference Nurofen® for Children, oral suspension 100 mg / 5 ml (containing ibuprofen 100 mg)&#xD;
      of &quot;Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare International Ltd, .&quot;, UK in normal, healthy, adult, human&#xD;
      subjects under fasting conditions.To monitor adverse events and ensure the safety&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total 30 normal healthy adult subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      administered either the Test (5 ml of oral suspension containing 200 mg of ibuprofen) or the&#xD;
      Reference Product (10ml of oral suspension containing 200 mg of ibuprofen) with 200 mL of&#xD;
      water in each period as per the randomization schedule. Subjects will fast for at least 10&#xD;
      hours prior to administration of the study drugs and for four (4) hours after administration&#xD;
      of the study drugs during each study period. Standardized meals will be provided in each&#xD;
      study period. Water will not be accessible to the subjects 1 hour to administration of the&#xD;
      study drugs and 2 hours after administration of the study drugs in each period. A total of 20&#xD;
      blood samples will be withdrawn for pharmacokinetic profiling during each study period. The&#xD;
      plasma concentrations of R- and S-enantiomers of ibuprofen will be measured by a validated&#xD;
      LC-MS/MS analytical method. ANOVA will be performed on log transformed pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and 90% confidence interval will be constructed for the ratio of&#xD;
      geometric least square mean of the Test and Reference products, obtained from the&#xD;
      log-transformed data. Bioequivalence will be concluded if the ratio estimate as well as its&#xD;
      90% confidence interval of S-enantiomers of ibuprofen, both falls within the acceptable range&#xD;
      of 80.00% to 125.00% for Cmax, AUC0-t.&#xD;
