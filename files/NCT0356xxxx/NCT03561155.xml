  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The upper limb (UL) plays an important role in the daily functioning of patients with&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and negatively influences their quality of life. Effective arm-hand&#xD;
      training programs are needed. Various robotic systems have been developed for UL&#xD;
      rehabilitation, mainly used in patients with stroke. Preliminary work in MS has focused on&#xD;
      proximal sections of the arm. No study has evaluated the use of robotics for improving manual&#xD;
      dexterity and their effects on cortical activity. The results of this research project could&#xD;
      be relevant for the advancement of knowledge about UL functional recovery in individuals with&#xD;
      MS and to determine the pattern of muscle activation underlying functional recovery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies regarding the effectiveness of conventional and robot-based upper limb (UL)&#xD;
      rehabilitation in individuals with MS is very limited.In the last 15 years, conventional&#xD;
      rehabilitation of the UL in patients with neurological disorders has been enriched by the&#xD;
      development of robots as they can provide high-intensity, repetitive, interactive and&#xD;
      task-specific exercises.They are increasingly used in rehabilitation after stroke, therefore&#xD;
      may also be good candidates for neuromotor rehabilitation of patients with MS. Furthermore,&#xD;
      these devices can provide various feedbacks that can guide patients during the sensorimotor&#xD;
      training and allow quantitative measurement of motor performance during training.One of these&#xD;
      devices is the Amadeo®, a modern, mechatronic end-effector robotic device designed to improve&#xD;
      sensorimotor functions in patients with restricted movement in individual fingers or in the&#xD;
      entire hand.Another important issue concerns cortical plasticity, which plays a fundamental&#xD;
      role in motor learning and neurorehabilitation.To date, the specific mechanisms leading to UL&#xD;
      recovery after neurological rehabilitation are still unclear.The development of new EEG&#xD;
      instruments allows brain activity to be tested under specific rehabilitation tasks&#xD;
      contributes to give new insight in the dynamics of cortical networks reorganization promoted&#xD;
      by rehabilitation.The main aim of the study is to perform a single blind RCT on 60&#xD;
      outpatients with MS (age:18-65 years;EDSS&lt;8) in order to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      high-intensity robot-assisted training with conventional treatment on sensorimotor hand&#xD;
      recovery, disability in ADLs and QoL.The secondary aim is to explore the underlying neuronal&#xD;
      mechanisms of UL recovery by using EEG investigations and innovative robotic equipment. 10&#xD;
      controls (age 18-65 yrs) will undergo one session of the same Video-EEG acquisition to&#xD;
      collect normative data to compare with data collected on patients.Each participant will&#xD;
      receive 40-minute sessions over an 8 week period (3 days/week). Each session will consist of&#xD;
      30 minutes of hand training and 10 minutes of passive upper limbs mobilization.The&#xD;
      experimental group will receive robot-assisted therapy by Amadeo.The control group will&#xD;
      receive conventional rehabilitation.Before treatment, immediately after treatment, 1 month&#xD;
      after treatment patients will be evaluated with a comprehensive protocol of all ICF domains&#xD;
      as well as acquisition by Video-EEG acquisition combined with Amadeo® robotic training&#xD;
      device.Primary outcome measures:Fugl-Meyer Assessment Motor Scale.Secondary measures: UL&#xD;
      electromyographic analysis,Tremor Severity Scale, Nine Hole Peg Test, Amadeo® hand muscle&#xD;
      strength (Newton), Motricity Index, Visual anolgue Scale for tiredness and fatigue; TEMPA,&#xD;
      Motor Activity Log, Action Research Arm test, Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 and the&#xD;
      assessment of Life Habits. Parametric tests and nonparametric tests will be performed&#xD;
      according to variable distribution (p&lt;.05)&#xD;
