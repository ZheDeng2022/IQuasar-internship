  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to compare the glycemic and quality of life benefits of diabetes management using&#xD;
      Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) or self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) made by&#xD;
      study participants and their primary care physicians. Decisions will be based on insights&#xD;
      from real-time use and retrospective insights, determined during remote visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have type 2 diabetes and be using basal insulin (with or without oral&#xD;
      medications and/or Glucagon-Like-Peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue) and have an elevated Hemoglobin&#xD;
      A1C (HbA1c).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is referred to as the &quot;Continuous Glucose MOnitoring in T2D Basal InsuLin UsErs,&#xD;
      also known as The MOBILE Study&quot; and will assess potential benefits of using Continuous&#xD;
      Glucose Monitoring (CGM) versus traditional Blood Glucose Monitoring (BGM) in people with&#xD;
      Type 2 Diabetes using basal insulin with or without oral medications and who have an elevated&#xD;
      HbA1c between 7.8 -11.5%. In this study, the investigator's role is largely advisory,&#xD;
      providing insights and interpretations of the glucose data obtained from BGM or CGM devices&#xD;
      and formally communicating medication recommendations to the participant and their treating&#xD;
      community clinician. Participants will be recruited from outside of the investigator team's&#xD;
      diabetes and endocrine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol comprises of 2 studies: the 1st study (also called Phase 1) will evaluate the&#xD;
      values of CGM after eight months of use. The 2nd study (also called Phase 2) will evaluate if&#xD;
      any glycemic benefits attained in study one are sustainable for an additional six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of enrollment, participants will undergo a run-in period of blinded CGM for a&#xD;
      duration of 10 days. Baseline Patient Report Outcome (PRO) tools and surveys will be&#xD;
      administered at time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design includes two phases. During Phase 1, participants with T2D taking basal&#xD;
      insulin will be randomized into two groups - CGM Group or SMBG Group. Phase 1 is of 8 months&#xD;
      duration. The CGM group will comprise of 4 scheduled clinic visits: at week 2, month 1, month&#xD;
      3, and month 8. The SMBG group will comprise of 5 scheduled clinic visits: at week 2, month&#xD;
      1, month 3, pre-month 8 and month 8. Both groups will have structured phone/remote visits at&#xD;
      months 2, 4 and 6 during which glucose data will be reviewed and summarized. HbA1c will be&#xD;
      measured at baseline, 3 months and 8 months. Participants will complete PRO tools and surveys&#xD;
      at 8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will consist of 3 groups: participants continuing use of SMBG since the beginning of&#xD;
      Phase 1; participants re-randomized from the Phase 1 CGM Group and assigned to SMBG;&#xD;
      participants re-randomized from Phase 1 CGM Group and assigned to CGM. Phase 2 duration is 6&#xD;
      months. This phase involves 1 phone contact and either 2 visits at Month 14 for SMBG&#xD;
      participants to wear blinded CGM or one visit for CGM participants. HbA1c will be measured at&#xD;
      14 months. Participants will complete PRO tools and surveys at month 14. For all&#xD;
      participants, study participation will end upon completion of month 14 visit .&#xD;
