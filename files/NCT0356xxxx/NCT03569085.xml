  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Speckle tracking imaging measuring software will be used for offline analysis of&#xD;
      transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) -acquired images of the left ventricle(LV) in four&#xD;
      chambers(4C), two chambers (2C) and long axis (LAX) views to calculate global longitudinal&#xD;
      strain (GLS) of LV for comparisons between sevoflurane and isoflurane at the same minimum&#xD;
      alveolar concentration ( MAC) levels.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary research activity will be: baseline transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) views&#xD;
      taken upon the patient entering the operating room by one of the cardiothoracic&#xD;
      anesthesiology fellows or attendings, TEE views taken by the echocardiography fellow or&#xD;
      attending in the mid-esophageal 4C, 2C and LAX views once the patient has reached sevoflurane&#xD;
      end-tidal minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5. Following this,&#xD;
      sevoflurane will be changed to isoflurane and wait till complete washout of sevoflurane (i.e.&#xD;
      end-tidal sevoflurane concentration reaches zero). Isoflurane concentration will be adjusted&#xD;
      according to bispectral index and hemodynamics to maintain anesthesia during this period.&#xD;
      Once complete sevoflurane wash-out has been achieved, isoflurane concentration will be&#xD;
      adjusted and repeat images taken at the 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 MAC values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will establish stability at each MAC level (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5) for 5 minutes&#xD;
      before obtaining TEE images. The whole study is done during pre- cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB)&#xD;
      period while surgeon spending time dissecting internal mammary artery or other parts of&#xD;
      surgical dissection before heparinization. The entire study duration will be a maximum of&#xD;
      35-40 minutes and this will not prolong the operating time. The adjustment of the anesthetic&#xD;
      will be performed by the cardiac anesthesiology fellow or senior resident involved in this&#xD;
      research along with the faculty officially performing the case. All images will be acquired&#xD;
      prior to the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass by the echocardiography rotating resident&#xD;
      or research resident, cardiac anesthesiology fellow or cardiac anesthesiology attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologist (all received extensive training in TEE to obtain those required images).&#xD;
      Following the completion of the case and the uploading of images to a central&#xD;
      echocardiography server, one of the study personnel will perform analysis of the images in&#xD;
      the anesthesiology offices on a computer with post-processing software to determine strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAC up to 1.5 is very well tolerated in cardiac surgical patients and is routinely used to&#xD;
      achieve hemodynamic conditions during surgery. Use of vasopressor and inotrope to allow&#xD;
      maintain depth of anesthesia with inhalation anesthesia agents is also routine in cardiac&#xD;
      surgical patients and not in any way different from routine clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic information (heart rate, blood pressure, central venous pressure, cardiac index&#xD;
      or pulmonary artery pressure) will be obtained after stabilization with each MAC and will be&#xD;
      recorded immediately or extracted from the electronic medical records.&#xD;
