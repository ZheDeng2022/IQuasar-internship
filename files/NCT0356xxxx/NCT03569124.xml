      Interpretation of endoscopic characteristics of colorectal polyps with Blue Light Imaging A&#xD;
      study of BLI images and videos of colorectal polyps will be presented initially as a training&#xD;
      set followed by with explanation and teaching in a didactic session to two separate groups. A&#xD;
      post-test will be conducted to look at the quality of the learning experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the teaching tool regarding the criteria for BLI images of colorectal polyps by&#xD;
      the following measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inter-observer agreement between same and different groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accuracy in describing the morphology of colorectal polyps • This new teaching tool will&#xD;
           improve&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inter-observer agreement by at least 5%- 10% (depending on the group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accuracy by at least 5%- 10% (depending on the group)• To determine the improvement of&#xD;
           inter-observer agreement in identifying/ describing colorectal polyps after the didactic&#xD;
           session in both the groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive predictive value and negative&#xD;
           predictive value pre-and post-test in both the groups&#xD;

        Study participants are contacted while they are at the VA medical centre. All&#xD;
        gastroenterology attending physicians, gastroenterology fellows, residents and medical&#xD;
        students will be notified about the study and asked about the willingness to participate if&#xD;
        they fit the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Practicing gastroenterologists and trainees will&#xD;
        be contacted and inquired about their intent of participating in the assessment of&#xD;
        images/videos. This is a voluntary project and not a part of any mandatory training. There&#xD;
        is no coercion of participants who do not want to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This study includes only the images and videos from standard pre-existing database. This&#xD;
        database was developed by European investigators for educational purposes. This information&#xD;
        has no patient identifiable parameters. This information is stored in a secure server with&#xD;
