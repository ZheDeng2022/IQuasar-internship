    <textblock>
      Experts note that in order to continue reducing the US cancer burden, it is critical that&#xD;
      investigators &quot;more completely apply discoveries in cancer prevention we have already made.&quot;&#xD;
      Thus, it is important to research strategies that aim to improve application of effective&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention and screening tests among underserved populations like&#xD;
      American Indians (AI).CRC is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death among AI; yet, one of the&#xD;
      most preventable and treatable cancers when detected early. Increased use of recommended CRC&#xD;
      screening tests among men and women ages 50-75 have contributed to nearly 50% declines in US&#xD;
      CRC mortality since 1990. However, recent evidence indicates AI have not observed equitable&#xD;
      improvements. The investigators propose to build upon our experience addressing CRC screening&#xD;
      in underserved populations and strong partnerships with North Carolina tribal partners to&#xD;
      gain new insight about a patient-centered, culturally appropriate strategy to increase AI CRC&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;

      Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Screening Options. CRC is a unique cancer due to the multiple&#xD;
      screening options including stool-based (fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and fecal&#xD;
      immunochemical testing (FIT)), and direct visualization (colonoscopy) options. Healthcare&#xD;
      providers tend to recommend colonoscopy, although evidence indicates that many patients,&#xD;
      especially low-income and racial and ethnic minorities, prefer stool-based testing for a&#xD;
      variety of reasons. In our formative work with North Carolina tribes, the investigators found&#xD;
      evidence of low awareness of stool-based tests among American Indians (AI) and healthcare&#xD;
      provider preferences to recommend colonoscopy. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)&#xD;
      guidelines indicate that evidence does not support favoring one CRC screening test above the&#xD;
      others, and that recommendations should be based on patient preferences among the screening&#xD;
      options. However, patient's general lack of knowledge of CRC screening modalities, literacy&#xD;
      barriers to understanding differences between options, and other communication barriers in&#xD;
      the healthcare setting (e.g., limited physician time) make this recommendation difficult to&#xD;
      implement in practice without appropriate tools and support. Multimedia decision aids provide&#xD;
      a practical solution to overcome communication challenges by providing patients information&#xD;
      using easy-to-understand graphics and narratives designed to help them understand options,&#xD;
      think through what is important to them, and engage with healthcare providers and family in&#xD;
      the decision-making process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRC Screening Decision Aids. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found evidence that&#xD;
      average risk patients (aged 50 and over) exposed to CRC screening decisions aids showed&#xD;
      greater increases in knowledge, were more likely to be interested in getting screened, and&#xD;
      more likely to be screened. Most research on decision aids has been conduct with majority&#xD;
      White populations; a few studies have focused on patients with low socioeconomic status. To&#xD;
      our knowledge, no CRC screening decision aid studies have focused on AI populations.Our team&#xD;
      has expertise in adapting CRC screening decision aids for underserved populations. The&#xD;
      investigators have used a rigorous, community- and patient-engaged process to adapt a&#xD;
      decision aid previously shown to be effective among majority White populations. The process&#xD;
      retains effective elements of the existing version and refines content using messages and&#xD;
      messengers that are culturally-sensitive (beyond peripheral packaging of graphics and visual&#xD;
      content). A version the investigators adapted for low-income Hispanics significantly improved&#xD;
      Hispanic patient's CRC screening knowledge, patient-provider communication, self-efficacy,&#xD;
      and intent, and when combined with navigation, significantly improved completion of&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AI Barriers to CRC Screening. AI may benefit from decision aids; yet, CRC screening decision&#xD;
      aids have not been developed or tested with AI populations. Several studies have found that&#xD;
      AI have lower awareness and knowledge about CRC screening options and low perceived&#xD;
      susceptibility of CRC than White populations. Many qualitative studies also indicate social&#xD;
      and cultural barriers to CRC screening. For example, AIs indicate taboos related to speaking&#xD;
      of illness or of certain body parts and fatalistic cultural beliefs influence their attitudes&#xD;
      and intentions to obtain preventive medical services. In addition, a history of unethical&#xD;
      healthcare practices and mistreatment of AI by the US government has led to issues of&#xD;
      mistrust. Recent studies have found that AI report negative perceptions of medical providers&#xD;
      and mistrust in healthcare institutions as barriers to obtaining CRC screening. Decision aids&#xD;
      can address low awareness of options and improve attitudes and intentions for screening,&#xD;
      especially if the content and the messengers of the information are adapted for sensitivity&#xD;
      to relevant socio-cultural barriers (e.g., spiritual advisors who are credible to AI endorse&#xD;
      screening). For this proposal, the investigators propose to test a novel culturally-adapted&#xD;
      decision aid that aims to improve knowledge, attitudes and intentions to obtain CRC screening&#xD;
      and uses messaging developed with our tribal community partners to overcome health literacy&#xD;
      and socio-cultural barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conceptual Framework. Our decision aid is informed by the Theory of Planned Behavior and&#xD;
      Cultural Identity Theory. The Theory of Planned Behavior posits that individual's attitudes&#xD;
      (i.e., how one feels about a behavior and the potential outcomes of the behavior), norms&#xD;
      (i.e., the amount of social pressure one feels to perform a behavior), and agency (i.e., the&#xD;
      extent that one feels in control and able to perform a behavior) impacts their intentions to&#xD;
      and subsequent performance of a behavior. The investigators also draw upon Cultural Identity&#xD;
      Theory and posit that one's cultural identity and corresponding values underlie how one&#xD;
      receives and interprets communicated messages and how one communicates with others about&#xD;
      these messages. Our culturally-adapted decision aid uses messages that address AI-specific&#xD;
      attitudes, norms, agency and communication concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Studies. With developmental funding from UNC's Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer&#xD;
      Center, the investigators followed a rigorous process to adapt a general population version&#xD;
      of a CRC screening decision aid for AI. From January to May of 2016, the investigators&#xD;
      conducted six focus groups (n=74) with AI (ages 50-75) and interviews with healthcare&#xD;
      providers (n=8) from three North Carolina tribal communities. The investigators explored&#xD;
      perspectives about cultural, communication, and literacy barriers to CRC screening, and&#xD;
      identified critical themes regarding AI cultural identity and socio-cultural values that&#xD;
      influence CRC screening. The investigators and our tribal partners have operationalized the&#xD;
      themes into adaptations of the existing general population decision aid. The decision aid&#xD;
      provides information on stool-based and colonoscopy tests, the two types readily available in&#xD;
      the community. The investigators are filming and making edits to the decision aid, which will&#xD;
      be completed and ready for pilot testing by December 2016. Themes from AI focus groups and&#xD;
      operationalized changes to a culturally-adapted CRC screening decision aid Operationalized&#xD;
      Changes Healthcare mistrust - concern that inappropriate medical tests are recommended by&#xD;
      providers Religious advisor to provide information and conveys trust in CRC screening options&#xD;
      AI collectivism - stronger 'family' and community orientation toward health than individual&#xD;
      focus New messages emphasize the benefit of CRC screening to one's family and community&#xD;
      Privacy concerns- indication of difficulties and discomfort talking about CRC screening with&#xD;
      family Vignette that models family communication around CRC screening Fear of cancer and&#xD;
      screening - fear of cancer and screening process reduces motivation for screening AI CRC&#xD;
      survivor to share experience of being screened and treated early&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A. Setting Our current research is centered in North Carolina tribal communities,&#xD;
      primarily with the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, a state-recognized tribe that is located&#xD;
      in Southeastern North Carolina. There are 62,306 Lumbee tribal members, the majority of whom&#xD;
      (48,494) live in Robeson county. As with AI populations across the US, North Carolina AI have&#xD;
      high rates of poverty and low educational attainment. One-third (33%) of AI in Robeson County&#xD;
      are below the federal poverty level compared to 17% in North Carolina overall.45As a&#xD;
      state-recognized tribe, Lumbee are not eligible for services through the federally-funded&#xD;
      Indian Health Service,44 and many Lumbee tribal members use safety-net and federally&#xD;
      qualified health centers such as the Robeson Health Care Corporation (RHCC), partner on this&#xD;
      grant (see letter of support) to obtain health services.Robeson Health Care Corporation is a&#xD;
      federally qualified health center with six clinics located in Robeson and neighboring&#xD;
      counties. RHCC serves over 14,000 patients per year; 40% are AI. Nearly all, 95.6% of RHCC&#xD;
      patients are at or below 200% of the federal poverty line. According to recent reports, 6,295&#xD;
      RHHC patients were not up-to-date with CRC screening following recommended guidelines.RHHC&#xD;
      also has a long history of research collaboration on cancer screening projects.&#xD;
