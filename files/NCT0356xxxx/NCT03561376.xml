    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing routine surgery in the Department of Dermatology for any indication on&#xD;
      non-scalp skin and closed in linear fashion with scar greater than or equal to 4.5cm in&#xD;
      length will be invited to participate in this split scar, head to head study comparing zinc&#xD;
      oxide and petrolatum. Patients will apply respective ointments to each half of scar daily for&#xD;
      one month and maintain a log of these activities. They will be seen at 1 week, 4 weeks, 8&#xD;
      weeks, and 6 months post-operatively for photographic scar assessment and to complete the&#xD;
      patient portion of the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), a quantitative&#xD;
      objective assessment of scar appearance. Trained observers (board-certified dermatologists)&#xD;
      will score the observer portion of the scale. POSAS outcomes, post-operative infections,&#xD;
      linear density of epidermal seal will be assessed at the 1 week, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 6&#xD;
      months post-operative periods and compared between the two groups. Participants will have&#xD;
      parking validated for all visits and upon completion of all portions of the study will&#xD;
      receive a standardized skin care gift bag containing samples for hypoallergenic skin care&#xD;
      products (washes, moisturizers, etc.).&#xD;

      Patients who have undergone dermatologic excision for any indication with or without Mohs&#xD;
      micrographic surgical technique and surgically closed in linear fashion with scar length of&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 4.5cm on any site but the scalp will be approached for enrollment in&#xD;
      the study. Any closure in which one half of the linear scar appears grossly unequal to or&#xD;
      worse than the other (due to any number of causes, such as suture technique, etc.) will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study. Any patient whose surgical procedure was deemed as having high risk&#xD;
      of post-surgical infection would also be excluded from the study as well as those with known&#xD;
      history of topical zinc allergy. Consent will be obtained with one of the trained&#xD;
      co-investigators. Included in this consent will be consent to collection of basic patient&#xD;
      medical data pertinent to wound healing/scar formation will be obtained, such as history of&#xD;
      keloids, smoking, history of diabetes mellitus, history of cancer and/or on chemotherapy,&#xD;
      history of transplant, and immunosuppressive status, etc. for the purposes of this research.&#xD;
      Risk to patients using zinc oxide ointment has been deemed by the FDA as minimal. Of note,&#xD;
      zinc oxide ointment currently is the gold standard treatment for erosive diaper dermatitis on&#xD;
      newborns and infants. It is generally deemed safe clinically and its application to other&#xD;
      clinical settings outside of diaper rash has not been explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon providing consent for the study, the patient's surgical closure will be demarcated with&#xD;
      sterile inked pen and &quot;V&quot; will be drawn on one end and &quot;Z&quot; on the other. The control,&#xD;
      standard of care petrolatum (i.e. Vaseline) will be applied to the side indicated by &quot;V&quot; and&#xD;
      the experimental treatment zinc oxide will be applied to the &quot;Z&quot; side. As a general rule, if&#xD;
      oriented longitudinally, &quot;Z&quot; will mark distal, &quot;V&quot; will mark proximal. If oriented&#xD;
      horizontally (left to right), &quot;V&quot; will mark the left side, &quot;Z&quot; the right. The ointments and&#xD;
      standard pressure dressing will be administered in clinic upon closure and&#xD;
      consent/enrollment. Patients will be sent home with package containing standard wound&#xD;
      dressing materials as well as both zinc oxide and petrolatum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be sent home with instructions and wound care materials to perform the&#xD;
      following: (1) Keep post surgical pressure dressing in place for 48 hours (2) Gentle soap and&#xD;
      water cleansing after 48 hours once daily (3) With daily dressing changes self apply zinc&#xD;
      oxide ointment to side indicated by &quot;Z&quot; and petrolatum (vaseline) to side indicated by &quot;V&quot;&#xD;
      (3b) Patient will be encouraged to re-mark site Z and V to serve as reminder to enhance&#xD;
      compliance (4) Patient will sign off on daily log twice: once upon application of zinc oxide&#xD;
      to Z side and upon application of petrolatum to V side. (5) Patient will perform daily&#xD;
      dressing changes as above for one month. The application of daily ointment with or without&#xD;
      dressing is also routine standard of care at the present time. Draft of patient instructions&#xD;
      has been included with this submission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen at the routine standard of care visit 7 days post-op for suture&#xD;
      removal. At this point in time, accompanying dressing will be taken down, cleansed with&#xD;
      sterile saline, and patient wounds will be photographed under standardized conditions, with&#xD;
      avoidance of any clue as to which ointment was applied to which side. In addition, patients&#xD;
      will perform the patient portion of the POSAS (Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale&#xD;
      v2.0, a validated measure of scar cosmesis, with 6 to 60 scale, with low numbers represent&#xD;
      that scar appears most similar to normal skin, whereas 60 indicates that the scar is visually&#xD;
      furthest from normal skin, i.e. worst possible scar). Patients will also follow-up at 4&#xD;
      weeks, 8 weeks, and 6 months post-operatively for scar assessment. Patient parking will be&#xD;
      validated. For patients requesting optimal close clinical follow-up for post-surgical scars,&#xD;
      this appointment schedule represents the highest standard of care. At these visits,&#xD;
      photographs will be obtained, and patients will again be asked to complete the patient&#xD;
      portion of the POSAS scale. Upon completion of the six month follow-up visit for this pilot&#xD;
      study, patients will be given a basic skin care product sample gift bag, containing a&#xD;
      standardized collection of samples of hypoallergenic washes and moisturizers. Of note, if a&#xD;
      patient is unable to return for the final six month follow-up visit, patients will be allowed&#xD;
      to submit electronic photographs (non-standardized, self taken) with clear instructions to&#xD;
      send via secure message via MyUPMC, a secure interface allowing for communication between&#xD;
      patient's and doctors within the UPMC (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) network. This&#xD;
      option is to be reserved as a last resort. Patients will not receive the gift bag if unable&#xD;
      to return for this final study visit. Please note that patient obtained and entered&#xD;
      photographs are routinely used clinically for remote assessment of skin disorders for routine&#xD;
      clinical follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Board-certified dermatologists at the end of the study will evaluate the photographs obtained&#xD;
      at a later point in the study. Through photographic and/or edited technique if necessary,&#xD;
      they will be blinded to which side received zinc oxide and which side received petrolatum.&#xD;
      Indeed, the POSAS has been validated with photographic use. In addition, an estimation of the&#xD;
      linear proportion of epidermal seal will be evaluated visually based on clinical exam and/or&#xD;
      photographs. Specifically, the length of the wound will be measured at this visit and&#xD;
      distance of scar containing non grossly apposed skin edges will be measured. The sum of&#xD;
      length of non-sealed areas within the V side and within the Z side will be calculated. In&#xD;
      addition, clinical evidence of surgical site infection, wound disruption, and/or any other&#xD;
      post-surgical complications will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of study visits, POSAS score, epidermal seal, and other clinical data will be&#xD;
      statistically analyzed. Compliance rates will be calculated. Primary outcome of POSAS vs. %&#xD;
      epidermal seal will be utilized. A total of 30 participants has been established as a goal&#xD;
      for this pilot study with guidance from the Clinical and Translational Science Institute at&#xD;
      the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standardized post surgical scar assessment tool (SCAR, Scar Cosmesis Assessment and&#xD;
      Rating) will be utilized to objectively record scar outcomes. In addition, photographs of the&#xD;
      surgical sites will be taken at each visit. In exchange for their participation, all patient&#xD;
      wound care materials will be provided by the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These research procedures will take place in the surgical suites of the UPMC Falk Dermatology&#xD;
      Office Building and the UPMC St. Margaret's Dermatology Office Building. These activities are&#xD;
      to take place during the 2018-19 academic year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical staff at both sites will be involved in the conduct of the study. Patients&#xD;
      referred/scheduled to see faculty dermatologic surgeon Dr. Melissa Pugliano-Mauro will be the&#xD;
      population pool.&#xD;
