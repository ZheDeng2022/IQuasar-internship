      The investigators are measuring the effectiveness of Ocrevus™ in helping patients with hand&#xD;
      or arm weakness, especially if posed by a more advanced MS patient than those included in the&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ocrevus™ is the first FDA approved disease-modifying treatment for primary progressive&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis (PPMS) as well as relapsing MS. In the clinical trials considered by the&#xD;
      FDA (OPERA I/II, ORATORIO), the highest Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) included in&#xD;
      the participants was 5.5 (OPERA I/II) and 6.5 (ORATORIO). The EDSS score is heavily weighted&#xD;
      on walking ability and is not a useful measurement for UE function. The primary endpoint in&#xD;
      the primary progressive MS trial with Ocrevus™ was EDSS and in the relapsing MS studies, EDSS&#xD;
      was used as a secondary endpoint. The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) score (Z&#xD;
      score), a composite of quantitative measure of walking speed, upper limb coordinated movement&#xD;
      (9 Hole Peg Test/9HPT) and cognitive function, was obtained as a secondary clinical measure&#xD;
      with scores being favorably higher in patients treated with Ocrevus™ (OPERA I/II).The z&#xD;
      score, however, is not very useful in delineating which of the three clinical functions was&#xD;
      maintained or showed less progression given that three domains are included in the score.&#xD;
      Data presented recently from the Oratorio trial analyzed the intention to treat population of&#xD;
      PPMS patients and the subgroups of patients with upper extremity functional impairment using&#xD;
      the 9HPT; results demonstrated reduction in risk of clinical progression in upper extremity&#xD;
      disability in patients treated with Ocrevus compared to placebo. There was improvement in the&#xD;
      change from baseline to week 120 in 9HPT time in treated patients. Abnormal baseline 9HPT was&#xD;
      defined as &gt;25 seconds and upper extremities were defined as &quot;better hand&quot; and &quot;worse hand&quot;,&#xD;
      each individually tested, with clinical progression determined at 12 and 24 weeks in 3&#xD;
      sub-categories of progression: lengthened time of 9HPT &gt;15%, &gt;20% and 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators aim to not only replicate the results in the Oratorio trial with&#xD;
      upper extremity dysfunction, but also widen the spectrum of patients that may benefit (given&#xD;
      an expanded MS population of patients, not exclusive to PPMS and widen the It is anticipated&#xD;
      that by using a test that better emulates activities of daily life performed with the upper&#xD;
      extremity, such as the TEMPA (Test d'Evaluation de la performance des membres Superieurs e&#xD;
      Personnes Agees ) more real life application of the benefits of receiving treatment with&#xD;
      Ocrevus will be obtained, and it is anticipated that patients can maintain the function they&#xD;
      have or potentially improve function.&#xD;

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The TEMPA consists of 9 tasks that mimic tasks of daily living that include picking up a jar, taking a spoonful of coffee from a jar, pouring water from a pitcher, handling coins, writing on an envelope and opening a pill container, tying a scarf around one's neck, shuffle and deal playing cards, and picking up and moving small objects. The tasks are assessed by a rater by measuring speed of execution (seconds) and by functional rating of the subject's independence in performing them using an ordinal scale of 0 (completed without difficulty) to -3 (could not complete the task).</description>
