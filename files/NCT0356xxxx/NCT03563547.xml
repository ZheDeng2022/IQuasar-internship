  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inheritable, autosomal dominant disorder leading to&#xD;
      pathologically increased levels of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Dietary&#xD;
      treatment remains an important tool in the management of affected children even after the&#xD;
      decision for the initiation of pharmacotherapy is made. However, little evidence is available&#xD;
      on the beneficial effects of diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and diets enriched&#xD;
      with soy in children affected with FH. Based on these previous findings we hypothesize that&#xD;
      the LDL-C lowering effect of a fat-modified diet could be further increased by the addition&#xD;
      of soy-protein in children affected with HeFH.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective randomized controlled trial. The enrolled subjects were recruited&#xD;
      from the outpatient clinic for disorders of metabolism of the Medical University of Vienna.&#xD;
      Subjects were either allocated into a group treated with a dietary regimen high in&#xD;
      unsaturated fats, low in saturated fats and enriched with soy-protein (&quot;soy group&quot;) or a&#xD;
      group treated with a diet high in unsaturated fats and low in saturated fats (&quot;control&#xD;
      group&quot;) alone at random. All subjects had been instructed to adhere to a fat-modified diet as&#xD;
      described below prior to enrolment into the study as part of their routine treatment. Prior&#xD;
      to being considered for inclusion in the study all subjects had to undergo nutritional&#xD;
      protocoling using 24h dietary recall protocols, which were completed by their legal&#xD;
      guardians, for 7 days. This was done to confirm adherence to the routine dietary treatment.&#xD;
      Furthermore, all patients had been screened for metabolic diseases other than FH as part of&#xD;
      their initial routine assessment in our specialised centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in both groups had been instructed to achieve specific daily maximum intakes in&#xD;
      total fat (≤ 30% of total energy intake), saturated fatty acids (≤10% of total fat intake)&#xD;
      and cholesterol (≤ 300 mg). Furthermore the participating families had been trained to&#xD;
      replace as many visible fat sources as possible with rapeseed oil due to its favorable&#xD;
      composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids.24 Subjects allocated to the soy group and their&#xD;
      families were additionally instructed to consume at least 0.25 g of soy protein per kg&#xD;
      bodyweight per day and were provided with recipes and practical advice on how to achieve this&#xD;
      goal. Example provided: a child with a bodyweight of 30kg would have to consume the&#xD;
      equivalent of approx. 50g of Tofu per day to meet the treatment target. This dosage had been&#xD;
      reported as effective for LDL-C reduction in children in a previous, non-controlled study.10&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further appointments with an experienced dietitian were made after enrolment for both&#xD;
      treatment groups, totalling 7 training sessions (60 minutes each) over the course of the&#xD;
      first 7 weeks of the trial. This was done to identify possible issues with the practical&#xD;
      implementation of especially the soy-enriched diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were asked to provide weekly urine samples and blood was drawn immediately after&#xD;
      enrolment, week 7 and week 13, respectively. The urine- and plasma samples were immediately&#xD;
      frozen and later analysed for their isoflavone content. Isoflavone levels were assessed at&#xD;
      baseline to verify that the respective patients did not consume soy products prior to the&#xD;
      trial. All enrolled subjects had to participate for 13 weeks or were excluded from the&#xD;
      statistical evaluation (per protocol analysis). If relevant levels of isoflavones were&#xD;
      detected in either urine or plasma of subjects in the Control-group the subjects were to be&#xD;
      excluded from any further statistical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Vienna. Informed&#xD;
      consent from all participating subjects and their legal guardians was obtained prior to their&#xD;
      enrolment in the study. Our research was conducted in accordance with the latest Declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki.&#xD;
