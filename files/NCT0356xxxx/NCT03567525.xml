  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphoceles are a potentially serious complication of radical prostatectomy (RP) with pelvic&#xD;
      lymph node dissection. They are associated with abdominal pain, urinary tract symptoms,&#xD;
      fever, lower extremity swelling and deep vein thrombosis. They can be severe enough to&#xD;
      necessitate intervention in 5% of patients after RRP with PLND, with sequela that could&#xD;
      include infection and nerve damage. Studies evaluating strategies to preclude lymphocele&#xD;
      formation after RP have included comparisons of the use of titanium clips vs bipolar&#xD;
      coagulation to seal lymphatic vessels during pelvic lymph node dissection. In a recent&#xD;
      prospective randomized trial comparing these approaches, no differences were observed in the&#xD;
      rates of lymphocele formation as detected by ultrasound. There is a need to continue to test&#xD;
      potential strategies to minimize the formation of lymphoceles after RRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creation of a peritoneal iliac flap is one approach has potential towards this end. At the&#xD;
      Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Burlington, MA surgeons routinely fold the bladder into&#xD;
      a peritoneal flap to overlay the area of extended lymphadenectomy. It is thought that this&#xD;
      method prevents the formation of lymphoceles because the flap creates a window, which allows&#xD;
      drainage of the lymph fluid into the peritoneal cavity to be reabsorbed. While the Lahey&#xD;
      study supports the safety and effectiveness of the peritoneal flap approach, the procedure&#xD;
      has never been evaluated through a randomized prospective trial and the practice is certainly&#xD;
      not standard of care. We therefore propose a randomized, prospective clinical trial to be&#xD;
      conducted in the Hartford Hospital Urology Department to examine the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      peritoneal iliac flap on the formation of lymphoceles after RRP with pelvic lymph node&#xD;
      dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We hypothesize that, at 3 months after RP, rates of lymphocele formation (symptomatic&#xD;
           and asymptomatic lymphoceles) will be significantly lower in patients who have pelvic&#xD;
           lymph node dissection using the peritoneal iliac flap approach than in patients who have&#xD;
           pelvic lymph node dissection using the standard approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lymphoceles are often associated with lower urinary tract symptoms. We hypothesize that,&#xD;
           after RP, severity of urinary bother symptoms and urinary incontinence will be&#xD;
           significantly lower at each measurement period for patients who had pelvic lymph node&#xD;
           dissection using the peritoneal iliac flap approach relative to patients who had pelvic&#xD;
           lymph node dissection using the standard approach.&#xD;
