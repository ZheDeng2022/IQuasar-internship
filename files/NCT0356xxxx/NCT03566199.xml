    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of panobinostat nanoparticle formulation&#xD;
      MTX110 (MTX110) in treating participants with newly-diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine&#xD;
      glioma. Panobinostat nanoparticle formulation MTX110 may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of repeated administration of MTX110 co-infused&#xD;
      with gadoteridol given by intratumoral convection enhanced delivery in children with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the clinical efficacy of repeated administration of MTX110 given by&#xD;
      intratumoral convection-enhanced delivery (CED) in children with newly diagnosed DIPG in the&#xD;
      confines of a phase I and early efficacy study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive panobinostat nanoparticle formulation MTX110 intratumorally (IT) by CED&#xD;
      infusion on day 1 or days 1 and 2 as determined by dose level. Courses repeat every 4-8 weeks&#xD;
      for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment participants are followed up at 30 days and then every 2&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

             will be eligible if proven to be supportive of the diagnosis of a DIPG. Consensus of&#xD;
             diagnosis by the study team must be met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have completed focal radiotherapy within 14 weeks from time of enrollment&#xD;
