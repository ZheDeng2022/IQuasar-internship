      Identifying biomarkers of early pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) could facilitate&#xD;
      screening for individuals at higher than average risk and expedite the diagnosis in&#xD;
      individuals with symptoms and substantially improve an individual's chance of surviving the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a longitudinal study of subjects at higher than average risk of&#xD;
      PDAC in order to generate clinical data and bank serial blood specimens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have only an 10% chance of&#xD;
      surviving 5 years after diagnosis. Most PDAC is advanced and not amenable to curative&#xD;
      therapies at the time of diagnosis, owing to lack of symptoms in early disease, nonspecific&#xD;
      symptoms when they do develop resulting in a delay in diagnosis. Identifying biomarkers of&#xD;
      early PDAC could facilitate screening for individuals at higher than average risk and&#xD;
      expedite the diagnosis in individuals with symptoms and substantially improve an individual's&#xD;
      chance of surviving the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a longitudinal study of subjects at higher than average risk of&#xD;
      PDAC in order to generate clinical data and bank serial blood specimens. Subjects will&#xD;
      include individuals with family history of pancreas cancer, individuals with cystic pancreas&#xD;
      lesions or chronic pancreatitis, and individuals with new-onset diabetes. Identifying&#xD;
      specific biomarkers - blood markers and/or a clinical &quot;prodrome&quot; - in participants who go on&#xD;
      to develop PDAC could improve the diagnostic approach outcomes for patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      PDAC.&#xD;

      Detection of early PDAC will ideally use clinical and/or biochemical markers of early disease&#xD;
      in combination with novel imaging techniques which can identify disease much earlier than&#xD;
      with current modalities. This protocol will focus on clinical symptoms and blood biomarkers&#xD;
      described below and will allow the study of novel biomarkers in development using banked&#xD;
      blood specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying individuals with new-onset diabetes and/or diabetes in the setting of chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis, and who have clear evidence of type 3c diabetes may allow for targeted&#xD;
      screening of these individuals, with Mixed Meal Tolerance Test, for pancreatic cancer in&#xD;
      light of the high risk of cancer in these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood may be analyzed for other markers, including those currently in development and those&#xD;
      which may be developed in the future.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium (PCDC) includes collaborators at several institutions, including UNMC, working to identify biomarkers and develop novel imaging techniques to identify pre-malignant and subclinical PDAC. One of the primary objectives of the consortium is to establish a repository of serial biospecimens collected from subjects prior to their diagnosis of PDAC. These specimens will be readily available when biomarkers in development are ready for validation. Due to the low incidence of pancreas cancer, even in groups at substantially increased risk, obtaining enough specimens to use for biomarker identification from those subjects who go on to develop PDAC requires collaborative effort between multiple institutions. This proposal is the contribution from UNMC to the consortium's biorepository effort.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Data will be shared with the consortium on a rolling basis throughout the enrollment period.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Priority will be given to researchers affiliated with the PCDC. Primary investigators will review outside requests, which may be accepted on a case by case basis.</ipd_access_criteria>
