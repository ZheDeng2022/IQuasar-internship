      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anastomotic leakage is a dreaded major complication after colorectal surgery. The overall&#xD;
      incidence of anastomotic dehiscence and subsequent leaks is 2 to 7 percent when performed by&#xD;
      experienced surgeons. The lowest leak rates are found with ileocolic anastomoses (1 to 3&#xD;
      percent) and the highest occur with coloanal anastomosis (10 to 20 percent). Leaks usually&#xD;
      become apparent between five and seven days postoperatively. Almost half of all leaks occur&#xD;
      after the patient has been discharged, and up to 12 percent occur after postoperative day 30.&#xD;
      Late leaks often present insidiously with low-grade fever, prolonged ileus, and nonspecific&#xD;
      symptoms attributable to other postoperative infectious complications. Small, contained leaks&#xD;
      present later in the clinical course and may be difficult to distinguish from postoperative&#xD;
      abscesses by radiologic imaging, making the diagnosis uncertain and underreported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no uniform definition of an anastomotic dehiscence and leak. In a review of 97&#xD;
      studies, as an example, 56 different definitions of an anastomotic leak were used. The&#xD;
      majority of reports define an anastomotic leak using clinical signs, radiographic findings,&#xD;
      and intraoperative findings. The clinical signs include: Pain, Fever, Tachycardia,&#xD;
      Peritonitis, Feculent drainage, Purulent drainage. The radiographic signs include: Fluid&#xD;
      collections, Gas containing collections. The intraoperative findings include: Gross enteric&#xD;
      spillage, Anastomotic disruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors for a dehiscence and leak are classified according to the site of the&#xD;
      anastomosis (extraperitoneal or intraperitoneal). A prospective review of 1598 patients&#xD;
      undergoing 1639 anastomotic procedures for benign or malignant colorectal disease found a&#xD;
      significantly increased risk of anastomotic leak with extraperitoneal compared with&#xD;
      intraperitoneal anastomoses (6.6 versus 1.5 percent; 2.4 percent overall).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major risk factors for an extraperitoneal anastomotic leak include: The distance of the&#xD;
      anastomosis from the anal verge (Patients with a low anterior resection and an anastomosis&#xD;
      within 5 cm from the anal verge are the highest risk group for an anastomotic leak),&#xD;
      Anastomotic ischemia, Male gender, Obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major risk factors for an intraperitoneal anastomotic leak include: American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) score Grade III to V, Emergent surgery, Prolonged operative time,&#xD;
      Hand-sewn ileocolic anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controversial, inconclusive, or pertinent negative associations between the following&#xD;
      variables and an anastomotic leak have been reported: Neoadjuvant radiation therapy, Drains,&#xD;
      Protective stoma, Hand-sewn colorectal anastomosis, Laparoscopic procedure, Mechanical bowel&#xD;
      preparation, Nutritional status, Perioperative corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early diagnosis is crucial to treat patients limiting the related mortality. For this reason&#xD;
      several clinical items were proposed in literature to detect anastomotic leakage as soon as&#xD;
      possible: fever, pain, tachycardia, peritoneal, purulent or faecal drain, and dynamic ileus.&#xD;
      Moreover, also laboratory markers were proposed, such as leukocytosis, serum procalcitonin&#xD;
      (PCT) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). Finally, in 2009 den Dulk et al. proposed a leakage score&#xD;
      (DUtch LeaKage, DULK), that consider several items (fever, heart rate, respiratory rate,&#xD;
      urinary production, mental status, clinical conditions, signs of ileus, gastric retention,&#xD;
      fascial dehiscence, abdominal pain, wound pain, leukocytosis, CRP, increase of urea or&#xD;
      creatinine and nutrition status), to give a score, based on which is chosen a therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we planned this study to prospectively evaluate anastomotic leakage rate after&#xD;
      colorectal resections, trying to give a definite answer to the need for clear risk factors,&#xD;
      and testing the diagnostic yeald of DULK score and laboratory markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Prospective enrollment from September 2017 to September 2018 in 19 Italian surgical&#xD;
      centers. All patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery with anastomosis will be&#xD;
      included in a prospective database after having provided a written informed consent. A total&#xD;
      of 1,131 patients is expected based on a mean of 55 cases/year per center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preoperative risk factors of anastomotic leakage (age, gender, obesity, state of&#xD;
           nutrition, diabetes, cardiovascular, renal failure, inflammatory bowel disease, ASA&#xD;
           class I-II vs III)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Operative parameters (approach, procedure, anastomotic technique, time of operation,&#xD;
           pTNM stage)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Leukocyte count, serum CRP, serum procalcitonin and DULK score assessment in 2nd and 3rd&#xD;
           postoperative day. Minor and major complications according to Clavien-Dindo&#xD;
           classification&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Anastomotic leakage rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Morbidity-Mortality rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Length of postoperative hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recorded data and follow-up Potential patient-specific and intraoperative risk factors will&#xD;
      be recorded: gender, body mass index, nutritional status according to the Mini Nutritional&#xD;
      Assessment short-form, surgical indication (cancer, polyps, chronic inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease, diverticular disease), preoperative albuminemia, use of steroids, renal failure and&#xD;
      dialysis, preoperative leukocyte count, CRP, PCT cardiovascular or respiratory disease,&#xD;
      American Society of Anesthesia score, bowel preparation (decision made by operating surgeon),&#xD;
      laparoscopy or laparotomy, level of anastomosis and technique (mechanical or hand-sewn,&#xD;
      intra- or extra-corporeal), operative time, presence of drainage, surgeon and perioperative&#xD;
      blood transfusion(s). During the postoperative period, patients will be examined by the&#xD;
      attending surgeon daily. Fever (central temperature &gt; 38 °C), pulse, abdominal signs, bowel&#xD;
      movements, volume and aspect of drainage (if present) will be recorded daily. Leucocyte&#xD;
      count, CRP, PCT and Dulk score will be measured in the evening before the operation (in&#xD;
      addition to albuminemia) and on postoperative days 2, 3, and 6 (optional). The attending&#xD;
      surgeon will make any decision for complementary exams and imaging according to his own&#xD;
      criteria. The rate of any complication will be calculated and graded according to&#xD;
      Clavien-Dindo including all leaks (independently of clinical significance), wound infection,&#xD;
      pneumonia, central line infection, urinary tract infection. Urinary tract infection will be&#xD;
      diagnosed on the basis of positive urine culture with bacterial count. Central line infection&#xD;
      will be diagnosed on the basis of positive blood culture. Superficial and deep incisional&#xD;
      infections will be diagnosed according to the definitions of the Centers for Disease Control&#xD;
      and Prevention and a culture will be performed. Pneumonia will be diagnosed on the basis of&#xD;
      clinical symptoms, and physical and radiological examinations. The surgeons will be blinded&#xD;
      to the results of the CRP and PCT assays. Patients will be followed-up in the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic up to 6 weeks after discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome is anastomotic dehiscence (intended as any deviation from the planned&#xD;
      postoperative course related to the anastomosis, or presence of pus or enteric contents&#xD;
      within the drains, presence of abdominal or pelvic collection in the area of the anastomosis&#xD;
      on postoperative CT scan, performed at the discretion of the attending surgeon, leakage of&#xD;
      contrast through the anastomosis during enema or evident anastomotic dehiscence at&#xD;
      reoperation for postoperative peritonitis). Thus, all detected leaks will be considered&#xD;
      independently of clinical significance. No imaging will be performed routinely in order to&#xD;
      search for leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are morbidity and mortality rates, and postoperative length of stay. All&#xD;
      data will be prospectively recorded into CRF and transmitted to the coordinating center on a&#xD;
      monthly basis. Thereafter, all data will be incorporated into a spreadsheet (MS Excel),&#xD;
      checking for any discrepancy, that will be addressed and solved through strict cooperation&#xD;
      between chief investigator, data manager and participating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Quantitative values will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation,&#xD;
      median and range; categorical data with percentage frequencies. Mean values of duration of&#xD;
      stay will be compared according to the presence or absence of fistulas using Student's&#xD;
      two-sided t test (allowing for heterogeneity of variances) or with a non-parametric&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test. Mean values of DULK score, CRP and PCT levels will also be compared using&#xD;
      Student's two-sided t test (allowing for heterogeneity of variances) or with a non-parametric&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test. Both univariate analysis and multivariate analysis will be performed to&#xD;
      assess risk factors for leakage and overall complications. The odds ratio (OR) will be&#xD;
      presented followed by its 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Areas under the&#xD;
      receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve will be calculated. For all statistical tests&#xD;
      the significant level is fixed at p &lt; .05. Multivariate analysis will be performed using&#xD;
      logistic models. Statistical analyses will be carried out using STATA software (Stata Corp.&#xD;
      College Station, Texas, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Considering that the ASA grade (I and II vs. III) is mostly significant among&#xD;
      risk factors for anastomotic dehiscence, an estimation of the OR for anastomotic dehiscence&#xD;
      and ASA grade is equal to 5.6; assuming a confidence interval for the estimation of the OR at&#xD;
      95% and a maximum error equal to 0.04, the required sample size is n=1,062 (about 885 and 177&#xD;
      cases expected in ASA I-II and ASA III, respectively).&#xD;
