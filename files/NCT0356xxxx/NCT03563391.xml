  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, open-label, multi-site, growth, safety and tolerance study to&#xD;
      evaluate a NF (New Formula). A minimum of 45 evaluable infants with confirmed growth failure&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Growth failure for 30 infants will be due to congenital heart disease and&#xD;
      15 infants due to other organic or non-organic causes. Study infants (in-patient or living&#xD;
      with parents/ caregivers at home) will be fed the NF for a period of up through 16 weeks or&#xD;
      until the time the infant subject meets criteria for switching to a lower calorie density&#xD;
      formula, relative to baseline in infants with growth failure. Weight, height, head&#xD;
      circumference and mid upper arm circumference will be measured regularly throughout the&#xD;
      study. NF and other food intake, tolerance and stool diaries will be completed regularly.&#xD;
      Serious adverse and adverse events will be monitored throughout the study. Infants will be&#xD;
      evaluated, at each study visit, for criteria to switch to a lower calorie density formula.&#xD;
      The primary objective is to improve weight-for-age z score relative to baseline. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to improve weight-for-length, length-for-age, head&#xD;
      circumference-for-age, mid upper arm circumference-for-age, weight velocity and length&#xD;
      velocity z scores relative to baseline.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Infants must have attained term gestation (≥37 weeks of gestational age) at the time&#xD;
             of screening&#xD;

          2. Infants, male or female, aged 1 through 8 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Infants with congenital heart disease or other organic/non-organic cause of growth&#xD;
             failure with a weight-for-length z score ≤ -1.0 or weight gain ≤ -2.0 z score based on&#xD;
             WHO growth standards. (for weight gain metrics please see Appendix I): Weight gain (g)&#xD;
             for boys and girls by age ( -2 z scores for weight velocity). Infants with Down&#xD;
             syndrome must have a weight for length z-score ≤-1.0 z score. Infants with Down&#xD;
