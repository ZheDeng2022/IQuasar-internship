  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many malaria deaths occur in places where people have poor access to preventive and curative&#xD;
      health services. Prompt access to quality health services is critical in the case of severe&#xD;
      childhood diseases, among which severe malaria is particularly frequent in endemic areas. In&#xD;
      communities where parenteral treatment of severe malaria is not available, the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) recommends administration of a single rectal dose of artesunate (RAS) to&#xD;
      children less than 6 years, followed by immediate referral to an appropriate facility where&#xD;
      the full package of care for severe malaria can be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many African countries have already endorsed the use of pre-referral RAS. But treatment&#xD;
      guidelines vary widely across these countries and often do not align with the WHO&#xD;
      recommendation. With the impending availability of quality-assured rectal artesunate (QA RAS)&#xD;
      and countries poised to scale-up this intervention, it is critical to investigate the safe&#xD;
      and effective implementation of RAS as part of a continuum of care for severe malaria&#xD;
      patients. To ensure that RAS is well targeted, it is equally urgent to learn more about&#xD;
      frequency, treatment seeking and risk factors for severe malaria at community level. The&#xD;
      CARAMAL project has two major components: the pilot implementation of QA RAS in selected&#xD;
      areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nigeria and Uganda, and operational&#xD;
      research on the introduction of QA RAS into established integrated community case management&#xD;
      (iCCM) platforms. The CARAMAL project is funded by Unitaid and coordinated by the Clinton&#xD;
      Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI). UNICEF is responsible for QA RAS implementation. Swiss&#xD;
      TPH in partnership with the local research organizations Akena Associates Ltd. in Nigeria,&#xD;
      Kinshasa School of Public Health in DRC and Makerere University School of Public Health in&#xD;
      Uganda carries out the operational research component to generate evidence for the&#xD;
      responsible implementation of RAS. Finally, the CARAMAL project will generate a better&#xD;
      understanding of severe febrile illness, its management at all levels and key determinants of&#xD;
      health outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of the CARAMAL project is to contribute to reducing malaria mortality in&#xD;
      children globally by improving the community management of suspected severe malaria cases.&#xD;
      The project will contribute to this goal by advancing the development of operational guidance&#xD;
      to catalyse effective and appropriate scale-up of QA RAS as pre-referral treatment of severe&#xD;
      malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accompanying the pilot roll-out of QA RAS by UNICEF, the CARAMAL project will test whether it&#xD;
      is feasible to introduce QA RAS into established integrated community case management (iCCM)&#xD;
      platforms with only minimal additional supportive interventions and with minimal unintended&#xD;
      consequences such as inappropriate use as artemisinin monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the research activities described in detail below, the CARAMAL project aims to answer&#xD;
      the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. What are the minimal requirements of a community case management system to ensure that RAS&#xD;
      is an effective part of the continuum of care from the community to a referral facility&#xD;
      (defined as a health care facility equipped for inpatient care of severe malaria)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. What are the unintended consequences of scaled implementation, such as adverse drug&#xD;
      reactions, unforeseen costs [5], or unforeseen issues in treatment of malaria at all levels&#xD;
      of care, and how can they be addressed?&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Is there any use of RAS beyond the recommended guidelines, including full treatment of&#xD;
      severe cases with RAS at community level, and the treatment of uncomplicated malaria with&#xD;
      RAS?&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Can the introduction of pre-referral QA RAS reduce severe malaria case fatality ratio&#xD;
      over time under real-world operational circumstances in three distinct settings?&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the costs and cost-effectiveness of community and peripheral health facility based&#xD;
      RAS?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CARAMAL project has been designed as a multi-country operational research study&#xD;
      implemented in three highly malaria-endemic countries. It will be based on a before-and-after&#xD;
      plausibility design aligned with the roll-out of QA RAS through established community-based&#xD;
      health care provider systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 1: A patient surveillance system (PSS) to assess severe febrile illness/suspected&#xD;
      severe malaria incidence, case fatality rate, and related clinical patterns, diagnoses,&#xD;
      treatment and treatment outcomes from first contact to the point of recovery or death&#xD;
      (baseline and after RAS roll-out) Activity 2: Health care provider surveys (HCPS) to&#xD;
      establish the availability and uptake of QA RAS at all levels, and health providers'&#xD;
      knowledge, attitudes and practices towards RAS (baseline and after RAS roll-out) Activity 3:&#xD;
      Household surveys (HHS) to assess treatment seeking, caretakers' knowledge and attitudes&#xD;
      towards RAS, and malaria intervention coverage at community level (baseline and after RAS&#xD;
      roll-out) Activity 4: An economic evaluation to assess the costs and incremental&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of implementing RAS at community level compared to the current standard of&#xD;
      care Activity 5: Routine monitoring of process indicators along the entire case management&#xD;
      chain to continuously assess implementation progress of RAS as contextual information for&#xD;
      other outcome indicators&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 1, Patient surveillance system:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PSS will include all children &lt;5 years of age seeking care for a current/recent febrile&#xD;
      illness episode at the level of community based care providers in the study areas, including&#xD;
      Community Health Workers (CHWs) and primary health facilities (HF). All children diagnosed at&#xD;
      that level with severe febrile illness / suspected severe malaria will then be enrolled in&#xD;
      the PSS and tracked at the referral health facility and at the child's home 28 days after&#xD;
      initial diagnosis. In addition, all children &lt;5 years of age seeking care for a severe&#xD;
      febrile illness episode directly at the referral facility will be enrolled to evaluate&#xD;
      treatment seeking, diagnosis, treatment and disease outcome. These children will be excluded&#xD;
      from the case fatality ratio analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 2, Health care provider surveys:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sampling frame will include all registered providers at all levels operating in the study&#xD;
      areas, including public and private providers. A simple random sampling approach stratified&#xD;
      by provider level (CHW, primary health facility, etc.) will be used to select providers for&#xD;
      the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 3, Household surveys:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Household surveys will include randomly sampled households in the study areas. Households&#xD;
      will be selected using a two-stage random sampling approach (village-household) whereas the&#xD;
      sampling frames will consist of all villages in the study area and all households in the&#xD;
      village, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each household, the household heads and parents/caretakers of children &lt; 5 years of age&#xD;
      will be eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 1, patient surveillance system:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CHW / primary health facility (first contact) According to established routine practice,&#xD;
           the following procedures are performed: children attending a CHW or primary health&#xD;
           facility undergo examination, treatment and referral procedures as per local guidelines.&#xD;
           A rapid malaria test (mRDT) is performed on all children with a history of or acute&#xD;
           fever, including children with symptoms of severe febrile illness / children with danger&#xD;
           signs. The children are then treated as per the applicable national guidelines. Enrolled&#xD;
           children will be assigned a unique study ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Referral facility Children with severe febrile illness / suspected severe malaria and&#xD;
           either referred to or directly reporting to a referral facility in the study area will&#xD;
           be registered upon arrival in the facility. The study nurse will monitor the case&#xD;
           management of each registered patient and continuously enter study-specific details on&#xD;
           diagnosis and treatment provided throughout the patient's admission into an electronic&#xD;
           case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At home (day 28)&#xD;
&#xD;
           All children with severe febrile illness / suspected severe malaria and enrolled into&#xD;
           the patient surveillance system (PSS) by a CHW / primary health facility or at the&#xD;
           referral health facility will be followed up at their home by a member of the research&#xD;
           team. The primary purpose of this visit is to establish the health status of the child&#xD;
           using a structured questionnaire. It will also include a section on the&#xD;
           parent's/caretaker's experience and attitude towards the use of RAS. During the home&#xD;
           follow-up a finger-prick blood sample will be collected from all of children for:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  mRDT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Microcuvette sample for measuring haemoglobin (Hb) concentration In case of the&#xD;
                death of an enrolled child, the research team will attempt to conduct a verbal&#xD;
                autopsy at a later stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Activity 2, Health care provider surveys:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Health Care Provider Checklist A structured checklist completed to assess the&#xD;
           availability of essential medical supplies (incl. RAS) and equipment, human resource&#xD;
           capacity, infrastructure and documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Health Care Provider Questionnaire An interviewer administered questionnaire with&#xD;
           questions pertaining to the health worker's demographics, education and training, work&#xD;
           experience and supervision, type and utility of any work-related training received,&#xD;
           knowledge, attitudes and practices relevant to febrile case management (incl. diagnostic&#xD;
           algorithm and (RAS) treatment guidelines) and intermittent preventive treatment in&#xD;
           infants and pregnancy (IPTi, IPTp), experiences implementing malaria/febrile case&#xD;
           management and prevention guidelines. More in-depth questions will be asked to health&#xD;
           care workers administering RAS as well as different cadres of health workers providing&#xD;
           post-referral treatment, focusing on aspects relevant to the implementation of&#xD;
           pre-referral RAS and post-referral treatment of severe febrile illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 3, Household surveys:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three survey instruments will be completed with participating household heads and/or&#xD;
      household members:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Household Questionnaire A structured interviewer administered questionnaire to collect&#xD;
           information about coverage and uptake of mosquito nets behaviour change campaigns and&#xD;
           other malaria control interventions, alongside background demographic information on&#xD;
           each household member as well as indicators of the household's socio-economic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment Seeking Questionnaire A semi-structured interviewer administered questionnaire&#xD;
           completed with randomly selected household members who are parents or caretakers of a&#xD;
           child &lt;5 years of age. Parents/caretakers of children who reported a febrile illness&#xD;
           (irrespective of severity) in the two weeks prior to the survey will be interviewed&#xD;
           about that specific illness episode. The form collects information about the signs and&#xD;
           symptoms of the illness and subsequent treatment seeking behaviours, including sources&#xD;
           of treatment and types (if any) of drugs administered. Parents/caretakers of children&#xD;
           who did not experience a recent febrile illness will be asked about hypothetical care&#xD;
           seeking behaviour based on specific vignettes (one scenario of mild and one scenario of&#xD;
           severe febrile illness). The form furthermore collects information on the knowledge and&#xD;
           attitudes of the parents/caretakers towards RAS. The parent/caretaker will be asked&#xD;
           about previous experiences with RAS. Parents/caretakers without any previous experience&#xD;
           with RAS will be asked about their attitudes based on a vignette.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prevalence Form / blood sample collection A finger prick blood sample will be taken from&#xD;
           every household member below 5 years of age to assess changes in malaria prevalence and&#xD;
           anaemia over time in the study areas. A short form will accompany each finger-prick&#xD;
           blood sample, recording the individuals' demographic details, recent travel history,&#xD;
           intake of any medicine, the mRDT and Hb measurement result, and any treatment&#xD;
           administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 4, Economic evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financial and non-financial economic costs will be collected as part of routine project&#xD;
      records over the duration of the study. The evaluation will reflect multiple perspectives&#xD;
      including individual (i.e. patient), societal, and health systems-level (i.e. government).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 5, Routine monitoring of process indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Programmatic records of the implementation of QA RAS by UNICEF will be continuously assessed,&#xD;
      including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. RAS needs assessment data and orders&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reports from supportive supervision of CHWs&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CHW monthly reports&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. CHW, health facility registers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 1, Patient surveillance system:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimum sample size of 6,032 cases of severe malaria in children &lt; 5 years over 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 2: Health care provider surveys:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All referral health facilities in the project areas&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All non-referral health facilities in the study area (Uganda and DRC), while in Nigeria,&#xD;
           a random sample of 40 facilities will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  40 community health workers (Nigeria and Uganda).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity 3: Household surveys 906 household survey responses on treatment-seeking for severe&#xD;
      febrile illness will be required per country and individual survey round.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three health zones in DRC (Kenge, Kingandu and Ipamu),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A subset of local government areas (LGAs) in one state in Nigeria (Adamawa) , and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three districts in Uganda (Apac, Kole and Oyam)&#xD;

        The PSS will include all children &lt;5 years of age seeking care for a current/recent febrile&#xD;
        illness episode at the level of community based care providers in the study areas,&#xD;
        including CHWs and primary health facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, all children &lt;5 years of age seeking care for a severe febrile illness episode&#xD;
        directly at the referral facility will be enrolled to evaluate treatment seeking,&#xD;
        diagnosis, treatment and disease outcome. These children will be excluded from the case&#xD;
        fatality ratio analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        During baseline, RAS is expected not to be available at community level in the study area,&#xD;
        and the PSS will enroll primarily children not treated with pre-referral RAS, whereas after&#xD;
        RAS roll-out, RAS is expected to be administered at the level of community based health&#xD;
        care providers.&#xD;
