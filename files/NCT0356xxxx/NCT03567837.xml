  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the U.S., dietary fructose has increased in parallel with the increase in obesity and may&#xD;
      promote the development of diabetes and other chronic diseases. The largest source of dietary&#xD;
      fructose is sweetened beverages that are consumed by adolescents more than any other age&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will compare the rates of hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL), a process in the&#xD;
      liver that changes sugar into fat, in two groups of obese adolescents - one with prediabetes&#xD;
      and the other, metabolically healthy. Blood will be sampled before and hourly for 3 hours&#xD;
      after the consumption of a fructose-containing beverage. We hypothesize that the pre-diabetic&#xD;
      group will show greater DNL in response to fructose. This would support other evidence that&#xD;
      increased fructose-induced hepatic DNL is an early mechanism linking dietary sugar to the&#xD;
      adverse metabolic sequelae of obesity, including diabetes, fatty liver, dyslipidemia and&#xD;
      coronary disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Hepatic DNL in response to the ingestion of fructose:glucose 1:1 is significantly&#xD;
      greater in adolescents with obesity and prediabetes compared to adolescents with obesity who&#xD;
      are metabolically healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty obese adolescents, ages 12-21 years, will be recruited to each of two groups: 1)&#xD;
      prediabetes (n=15) and 2) metabolically healthy (n=15). An attempt will be made to achieve&#xD;
      similar age, sex and BMI distributions in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1- Screening: Eligible subjects will be enrolled after Informed consent/assent are&#xD;
      obtained by a physician investigator. The medical history will be reviewed and a physical&#xD;
      exam performed, including an assessment of pubertal status. Blood will be sampled after at&#xD;
      least a 12 hour fast (except water) for complete blood count, serum glutamate pyruvate,&#xD;
      glucose, HbA1C, and lipid panel, if not previously documented in the medical record within&#xD;
      three months of the screening visit. These tests may be done without fasting, but if the&#xD;
      glucose or lipid results are not normal, these two tests must be repeated after fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 - Sugar Challenge Test with Blood Sampling: Within three months of the screening&#xD;
      visit, eligible participants will return after at least a 12 hour fast (except water).&#xD;
      General health, family history and recent diet will be reviewed. The height, weight, waist&#xD;
      circumference at the umbilicus, and blood pressure will be recorded. A urine sample will be&#xD;
      obtained for microalbuminuria. After placement of an intravenous catheter and withdrawal of&#xD;
      the baseline blood samples, participants will drink a sweet beverage prepared by a dietician&#xD;
      (fructose:glucose 1:1, 3g/kg, in water). Blood sampling will continue every hour for three&#xD;
      hours( ~12 mL per time point).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percent body fat will be measured by bioimpedance. The percent body fat will be calculated by&#xD;
      computer software with prediction equations validated in the pediatric and adult age ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma samples will be obtained at 4 time points (0, 1, 2 and 3 hours), the fatty acid&#xD;
      composition of plasma very low density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLDL TG), including&#xD;
      %palmitate (16:0), will be measured. A lipid panel and VLDL triglycerides and apolipoprotein&#xD;
      B levels will also be measured at each time point. Other assays to be performed include&#xD;
      insulin and and glucose, HbA1C and high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of&#xD;
      inflammation). The urine sample will be assayed for microalbuminuria (albumin/creatinine &gt;30&#xD;
      mg/g).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis of the primary endpoint (increase in VLDL TG %16:0) will be performed in&#xD;
      the first three subjects of each group to determine whether the dose of sugar and sampling&#xD;
      duration of 3 hours are sufficient to produce a measurable increase in VLDL TG %16:0.&#xD;
