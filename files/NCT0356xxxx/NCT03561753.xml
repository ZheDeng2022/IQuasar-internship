    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis is the current leading cause of death due to an identifiable infectious agent&#xD;
      worldwide. The current standard regimen for tuberculosis requires a patient to take drug&#xD;
      combination (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide) for six to eight month&#xD;
      periods. The purpose of this study is to compare tuberculosis treatment therapy between the&#xD;
      current standard regimen and PRS derived combinatorial regimen. PRS derived regimen may&#xD;
      potentially allow for a shorter course of treatment, which may reduce problems associated&#xD;
      with adherence, toxicity, and development of drug resistance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is a major health problem of global proportions. Although drug sensitive TB&#xD;
      is a treatable disease, the current standard treatment requires 6 - 8 months of a multi-drug&#xD;
      regimen to achieve relapse-free cure. This long course of treatment is often associated with&#xD;
      toxicity, poor compliance, and development of drug resistance. A more effective drug&#xD;
      combination that provides more rapid sterilization of tissues has the potential to ameliorate&#xD;
      these critical problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current drug regimen for treating tuberculosis is lengthy and onerous, and hence&#xD;
      complicated by poor compliance leading to drug resistance and disease relapse. Previously,&#xD;
      using an output-driven optimization platform, parabolic response surface (PRS, previously&#xD;
      called Feedback System control or FSC), and an in vitro macrophage model of Mycobacterium&#xD;
      tuberculosis infection, we identified several new experimental drug regimens among billions&#xD;
      of possible drug-dose combinations that outperform the current Standard Regimen. We used the&#xD;
      PRS platform to optimize the in vivo drug doses of novel regimens (designated PRS regimen) in&#xD;
      a mouse model of pulmonary tuberculosis and then showed that the regimens sterilized much&#xD;
      more rapidly than the Standard Regimen and substantially reduced treatment time to&#xD;
      relapse-free cure by 25% for PRS regimen, which consists of Clofazimine (Cfz), Ethambutol&#xD;
      (E), high dose Pyrazinamide (Z, high), and Prothionamide (Pto). The regimen have the&#xD;
      potential to provide a markedly shorter course of treatment for tuberculosis in humans. As&#xD;
      PRS regimen omit isoniazid, rifampicin, fluoroquinolones, and injectable aminoglycosides,&#xD;
      they are suitable for treating many cases of multidrug and extensively drug-resistant&#xD;
      tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 Significance of the study Based on results in cell culture in macrophages and in mice we&#xD;
      anticipate that PRS regimen will prove to be more effective and will allow a shorter course&#xD;
      of treatment than the standard regimen. By allowing a shorter course of treatment, problems&#xD;
      with adherence, toxicity, and development of drug resistance can be reduced. Moreover,&#xD;
      because the regimen does not include INH or RIF, it can be used in cases of TB that are&#xD;
      resistant to those drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Summary of Experimental Design This is a randomized, controlled, open-label pilot&#xD;
           clinical trial. Previously untreated, smear positive tuberculosis patients (aged 18 - 65&#xD;
           years) with radiographic evidence of TB and whose bacteria are sensitive to first-line&#xD;
           drugs will be randomly distributed to group A (standard regimen) and B (new short course&#xD;
           PRS regimen). The study will compare sputum conversion rate at the end of treatment&#xD;
           between treatment regimens and will evaluate objective indicators of treatment success&#xD;
           rate and incidence of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identification of Subjects: Potentially eligible subjects will be identified from among&#xD;
           subjects seen at or referred to the Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital for treatment of&#xD;
           tuberculosis. Subjects will be informed about the study and those who express interest&#xD;
           in participation will be provided a written consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Consent Process: As described in detail below, Subjects will be informed that&#xD;
           participation is voluntary and that they will receive appropriate care for their&#xD;
           condition regardless of whether or not they participate in the study. Because subjects&#xD;
           have active TB, they will be in isolation in the Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital. The&#xD;
           investigator will review the consent form with the subject and ensure that the subject&#xD;
           understands the consent form and that all of the subject's questions have been answered.&#xD;
           Because timely initiation of treatment is important, subjects will be allowed up to two&#xD;
           days to decide whether to participate in the study or to receive standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Screening for Eligibility: Screening tests indicated in the Table of Study Procedures&#xD;
           (located at the end of this document) and required for assessment of eligibility per&#xD;
           inclusion/exclusion criteria will be completed within 14 days prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Randomization: Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 by using a random number&#xD;
           generator either to Group A (standard care) or to Group B (the investigational PRS&#xD;
           regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Study Treatment: Subjects are treated according to their assignment to Group A or Group&#xD;
           B as indicated below.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group A, Standard Regimen (2EHRZ/4HR): The standard six-month regimen is eight weeks of&#xD;
           daily treatment with isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide followed by&#xD;
           sixteen weeks of isoniazid and rifampin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All drugs are administered orally, seven days/week. Study drugs are dosed by weight as&#xD;
           shown in the below. Group B, PRS Regimen (4EZ [high dose] Cfz Pto): The PRS regimen is 4&#xD;
           months of daily Cfz, Emb, Pto, and high dose pyrazinamide, dosed by weight according to&#xD;
           below.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The drug dosing for both Group A and Group B are summarized in the below:&#xD;
&#xD;
           ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… Isoniazid (H):daily dose (gm)0.3(weight&#xD;
           &lt;50kg);0.3(weight≥50kg),use method: 1 times/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rifampin (R):daily dose (gm)0.45(weight &lt;50kg);0.6(weight≥50kg),use method: 1&#xD;
           times/day（Fasting medication）.&#xD;

&#xD;
           Pyrazinamide (High dose):daily dose (gm)1.75(weight &lt;50kg);2.0(weight≥50kg),use&#xD;
           method:1～2 times/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
           clofazimine（Cfz）:daily dose (gm)0.15(weight &lt;50kg);0.15(weight≥50kg),use&#xD;
           method:1～3times/day.&#xD;

&#xD;
           ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patient follow up After 6-months standard treatment or 4-months short term PRS regimen&#xD;
           treatment, subjects will have long term follow up to evaluate efficacy and ensure&#xD;
           absence of relapse. The checkup times are at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and&#xD;
           24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Efficacy i Bacteriology: sputum smear microscopy, culture using the Becton&#xD;
      Dickinson Company mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) system and Lowenstein-Jensen&#xD;
      (LJ) slant culture. MGIT testing will be used to evaluate drug susceptibility .&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii Radiology: All patients undergo chest X-ray and CT scan before treatment. X-ray will be&#xD;
      reviewed after 8 weeks of treatment and at end of treatment and during the follow-up period.&#xD;
      CT scan will be reviewed at end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii Bacterial load of sputum samples will be evaluated within two weeks after the start of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv Time to culture positivity: Time to culture positivity will be performed by MGIT culture&#xD;
      within two months after the start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v Evaluation of results: We shall employ the World Health Organization (WHO) uniform&#xD;
      standards in evaluating cure rate and treatment success rate, the sputum negative conversion&#xD;
      rate, incidence of adverse events and patient compliance and other indicators. We shall&#xD;
      compare these outcomes between the experimental group and the standard group to analyze the&#xD;
      effect of each treatment regime.&#xD;
