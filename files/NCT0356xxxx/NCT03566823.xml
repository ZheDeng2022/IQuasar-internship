    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinical Remission Based on 2-item Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission was defined by 2-item PRO subs-cores of average worst daily abdominal pain less than or equal to (&lt;=) 3 (based on 11 point numerical rating scale [NRS] ranging from 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst imaginable pain]); and average daily stool frequency &lt;=2 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) as per the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) over the 7 most recent days. BSFS ranges from 1 (separate hard lumps, hard to pass), 2 (sausage-shaped, but lumpy), 3 (like a sausage but with cracks on the surface), 4 (like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft), 5 (soft blobs with clear-cut edges), 6 (fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool), 7 (watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid). Participants with missing data at Week 16 or discontinuation before Week 16 were considered failures. Number of participants with clinical remission were reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Endoscopic Response at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic response was defined as a decrease in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) of at least 25 percent (%) from baseline. The SES-CD considers ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, rectum in terms of: size of ulcers, ulcerated surface, affected surface and presence of narrowing. Each graded from 0-3. Scale ranges from 0-56 with a higher score indicating greater severity of disease. Participants with missing data at Week 16 or who discontinued before Week 16 were considered failures. Number of participants with endoscopic response were reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinical Remission Based on Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission was defined as a CDAI score of &lt;150. CDAI assesses CD based on clinical signs/symptoms such as number of liquid stools, intensity of abdominal pain, general well-being (subjective), and presence of complications, use of antidiarrheal, presence of abdominal mass, physical examination and hematocrit (objective). CDAI score is equal to sum of weighted scores for subjective and objective items which range from 0-149 points: asymptomatic remission, 150-220 points: mild to moderate active CD, 221-450 points: moderate to severe active CD, &gt;451 points: severely active to fulminant disease. Higher score indicating more severity. Number of participants with clinical remission as measured by CDAI were reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Enhanced Endoscopic Response at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Enhanced endoscopic response was defined as a decrease in SES-CD by matching segments of at least 50% from baseline. The SES-CD considers ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, rectum in terms of: size of ulcers, ulcerated surface, affected surface and presence of narrowing. Each graded from 0-3. Scale ranges from 0-56 with a higher score indicating greater severity of disease. Participants with missing data at Week 16 or who discontinued before Week 16 were considered non-responders. Number of participants with enhanced endoscopic response were reported.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 8, 12 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>The IBDQ is a psychometrically validated PRO instrument for measuring the disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL) in participants with IBD, including CD. The IBDQ consists of 32 items, which are grouped into 4 domains and scored as: bowel function (10 to 70), systemic symptoms (5 to 35), emotional status (12 to 84), and social function (5 to 35). The total IBDQ score ranges from 32 to 224. For the total score and each domain, a higher score indicates better HRQL. A score of at least 170 corresponds to clinical remission and an increase of at least 16 points is considered to indicate a clinically meaningful improvement.</description>

             determines low risk of infection (ie, participant would be acceptable for&#xD;
             immunosuppressant [eg, anti-TNF] treatment without additional action) This&#xD;
             consultation must be included in source documentation Results from a chest x-ray,&#xD;
             taken within the 12 weeks before or during screening (Visit 1)must show no&#xD;

        <title>Number of Participants With Clinical Remission Based on 2-item Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) at Week 16</title>
        <description>Clinical remission was defined by 2-item PRO subs-cores of average worst daily abdominal pain less than or equal to (&lt;=) 3 (based on 11 point numerical rating scale [NRS] ranging from 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst imaginable pain]); and average daily stool frequency &lt;=2 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) as per the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) over the 7 most recent days. BSFS ranges from 1 (separate hard lumps, hard to pass), 2 (sausage-shaped, but lumpy), 3 (like a sausage but with cracks on the surface), 4 (like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft), 5 (soft blobs with clear-cut edges), 6 (fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool), 7 (watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid). Participants with missing data at Week 16 or discontinuation before Week 16 were considered failures. Number of participants with clinical remission were reported.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Endoscopic Response at Week 16</title>
        <description>Endoscopic response was defined as a decrease in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) of at least 25 percent (%) from baseline. The SES-CD considers ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, rectum in terms of: size of ulcers, ulcerated surface, affected surface and presence of narrowing. Each graded from 0-3. Scale ranges from 0-56 with a higher score indicating greater severity of disease. Participants with missing data at Week 16 or who discontinued before Week 16 were considered failures.

        <description>Clinical remission was defined as a CDAI score of &lt;150. CDAI assesses CD based on clinical signs/symptoms such as number of liquid stools, intensity of abdominal pain, general well-being (subjective), and presence of complications, use of antidiarrheal, presence of abdominal mass, physical examination and hematocrit (objective). CDAI score is equal to sum of weighted scores for subjective and objective items which range from 0-149 points: asymptomatic remission, 150-220 points: mild to moderate active CD, 221-450 points: moderate to severe active CD, &gt;451 points: severely active to fulminant disease.

        <title>Number of Participants With Clinical Remission Based on 2-Item PRO With Endoscopic Response at Week 16</title>
        <description>Clinical remission was defined by 2-item PRO subs-cores of average worst daily abdominal pain &lt;=3 (based on 11 point NRS ranging from 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst imaginable pain]) over the 7 most recent days and average daily stool frequency &lt;=2 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) as per BSFS ranging from type 1 (separate hard lumps-like stools) to type 7 (entirely liquid stools) over the 7 most recent days. Endoscopic response was defined as a decrease in SES CD of at least 25% from baseline. The SES-CD considers ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, rectum in terms of: size of ulcers, ulcerated surface, affected surface and presence of narrowing. Each graded from 0-3. Scale ranges from 0-56 with a higher score indicating greater severity of disease. Participants with missing data at Week 16 or who discontinued before Week 16 were considered failures. Number of participants with clinical remission and endoscopic response were reported.</description>

        <description>Clinical response was measured by at least a 100-point reduction in the CDAI from baseline (CDAI-100 response). CDAI assesses CD based on clinical signs/symptoms such as number of liquid stools, intensity of abdominal pain, general well-being (subjective), and presence of complications, use of antidiarrheal, presence of abdominal mass, physical examination and hematocrit (objective). CDAI score is equal to sum of weighted scores for subjective and objective items which range from 0-149 points: asymptomatic remission, 150-220 points: mild to moderate active CD, 221-450 points: moderate to severe active CD, &gt;451 points: severely active to fulminant disease.

        <description>The IBDQ is a psychometrically validated PRO instrument for measuring the disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL) in participants with IBD, including CD. The IBDQ consists of 32 items, which are grouped into 4 domains and scored as: bowel function (10 to 70), systemic symptoms (5 to 35), emotional status (12 to 84), and social function (5 to 35). The total IBDQ score ranges from 32 to 224. For the total score and each domain, a higher score indicates better HRQL. A score of at least 170 corresponds to clinical remission and an increase of at least 16 points is considered to indicate a clinically meaningful improvement.</description>
