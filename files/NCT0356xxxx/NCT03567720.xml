    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, Multi-Cohort, Open-Label, Multi-Center Study. Cohort 1 will be a&#xD;
      single-arm study of intratumoral tavokinogene telseplasmid (tavo) plus electroporation (EP)&#xD;
      in combination with pembrolizumab therapy. Cohort 2 will be a single-arm study of&#xD;
      intratumoral tavo-EP plus pembrolizumab with nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Subjects with TNBC and EP accessible cutaneous / subcutaneous disease will be enrolled in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be comprised of a screening period, treatment period and a long-term&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be treated with intratumoral tavo-EP to the accessible lesions on Days&#xD;
      1, 5 and 8 every 6 weeks and with IV pembrolizumab (200 mg) on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for&#xD;
      up to 17 cycles of tavo-EP and 33 cycles of pembrolizumab from baseline (approximately 2&#xD;
      years) or until subsequent disease progression. For Cohort 2, subjects will be treated with&#xD;
      an approved chemotherapy per standard of care, limited to nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®). All&#xD;
      accessible lesions, each ≥ 0.3 cm × 0.3 cm, may be treated; except where possible, 1&#xD;
      measurable lesion by RECIST (size ≥ 1.0 cm) should be selected and left untreated for the&#xD;
      duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term Follow-up: All subjects will be followed after the End of Study (EOS) visit for&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) (through 90 days from the last dose of study drug) and&#xD;
      long-term survival status for up to 1 year. EOS visit will occur 4 weeks after last study&#xD;
      treatment administration.&#xD;
