  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine whether there are differences in ovarian&#xD;
      suppression between women who are feeding at the breast compared with women who are pumping.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the main study, the aim is to compare reproductive health outcomes, including&#xD;
           amenorrhea rates, duration of lactation, and resumption of sexual activity, between&#xD;
           mothers who are exclusively breastfeeding (i.e. feeding at the breast) and those who are&#xD;
           pumping after a term or preterm delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the sub-study, the aim is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of using&#xD;
           urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) detection kits at home to detect ovulation in&#xD;
           exclusively breastmilk feeding women.&#xD;

      Women will be recruited for this study during routine prenatal care. Interested and eligible&#xD;
      participants will undergo an informed consent process. After, participants will answer&#xD;
      questions regarding demographic information, medical history, obstetric and reproductive&#xD;
      history, previous lactation history, and the Infant Feeding Intentions questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are eligible after the second eligibility verification at the time of&#xD;
      delivery hospitalization will be enrolled in the study. Enrolled participants will be given&#xD;
      breastmilk and infant feeding logs to complete. Study staff will contact participants at 1,&#xD;
      2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months after delivery to ask about breastmilk feeding practices in the last&#xD;
      24 hours, infant feeding, vaginal bleeding, sexual activity, use of contraceptive methods,&#xD;
      and repeat pregnancies. In between the monthly phone calls, study staff will ask participants&#xD;
      about the occurrence of vaginal bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the sub-study, participants are recruited from the main study. Those who are eligible and&#xD;
      interested will undergo an informed consent process. Participants will be given urinary LH&#xD;
      detection kits and instructions for use at time of enrollment. Daily urine LH testing will&#xD;
      start after 8 weeks postpartum. Participants will also receive monthly diaries to complete in&#xD;
      addition to the breastmilk and infant feeding logs in the main study. Study staff will&#xD;
      contact participants at 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months to review the diary information. If the&#xD;
      urine LH test is positive, the participant will undergo a blood draw for serum progesterone&#xD;
      levels to confirm ovulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned enrollment is 394 participants for the main study and 40 participants in the&#xD;
      sub-study.&#xD;
