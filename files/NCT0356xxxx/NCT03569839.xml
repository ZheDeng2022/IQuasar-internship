      Scientific background&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increasing degree of automation and informatisation of dynamical processes enables higher&#xD;
      quality of achieved goals, lower costs and lower eventual impact on humans and nature alike.&#xD;
      Automatic control is an infrastructural field that comprises mathematical modelling,&#xD;
      simulation of dynamical systems and automatic control methods. The systematic approach&#xD;
      enables the use of control methods in various technical and nontechnical fields, therefore,&#xD;
      the advances in automatic control are very useful in interdisciplinary projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likewise, there are many processes in medicine that can be improved by automatic control. In&#xD;
      the literature, there have been some approaches to closed-loop control of depth of&#xD;
      anaesthesia, but none seem to have influenced clinical practice. Within the project the&#xD;
      investigators will develop a system for closed-loop control of depth of anaesthesia using BIS&#xD;
      index, which will be based on a predictive model and will consider individual properties of&#xD;
      each patient that are obtained from the measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem identification&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform a general anaesthesia, it is necessary to use substances, which enable deep&#xD;
      unconsciousness, analgesia, amnesia and muscle relaxation, all required for performing a&#xD;
      surgery or a diagnostic procedure. General anaesthesia and related dynamic activities in the&#xD;
      human body is a complicated process, which includes pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      mechanisms, which have not been fully studied yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the general anaesthesia the anaesthesiologist needs to monitor the patient's vital&#xD;
      functions and maintain the functions of vital organs. To achieve anaesthesia, substances are&#xD;
      introduced in different manners into the patient's body. In clinical practice, the most&#xD;
      commonly used methods are the intravenous induction of an anaesthetic agent, i.e., injection&#xD;
      of the anaesthetic into a vein, and inhalation induction of anaesthesia, whereby the patient&#xD;
      inhales the substance from the breathing mixture. Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) is an&#xD;
      anaesthesiologic technique, where substances are injected intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anaesthesiologist needs to adjust the dosage of anaesthetic to maintain the appropriate&#xD;
      depth of general anaesthesia according to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the&#xD;
      anaesthetic agent and considering the type of procedure. Inadequate depth of anaesthesia is&#xD;
      manifested with the activation of sympathetic nerves or in the most unlikely event with the&#xD;
      patient awakening. Too deep anaesthesia is manifested with a drop in blood pressure level and&#xD;
      heart rate frequency as well as slow post-operative awakening of the patient from general&#xD;
      anaesthesia. In modern clinical practice, the depth of anaesthesia is determined by assessing&#xD;
      the relevant clinical signs (iris, sweating, movements), by interpreting hemodynamic&#xD;
      measurements and by estimating the depth of anaesthesia from EEG signals, for which several&#xD;
      established measurement systems already exist, e.g. BIS index, Narcotrend, Scale Entropy and&#xD;
      Response Entropy. BIS index measurement is a non-invasive method, where a BIS monitor is&#xD;
      connected to electrodes on the patient's head. By measuring the EEG signals the bispectral&#xD;
      index is defined, representing the depth of anaesthesia. The BIS monitor provides a single&#xD;
      dimensionless number, which ranges from 0 (equivalent to EEG silence) to 100. A BIS value&#xD;
      between 40 and 60 indicates an appropriate level for general anaesthesia, whereas for&#xD;
      long-term sedation due to head injuries a value below 40 is appropriate. The reference can&#xD;
      thus be set to the applicable value; the manner and speed of approaching the reference value&#xD;
      depend on the specific characteristics of the procedure and the pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of the substance in the patient's body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the proposed research with particular emphasis on the originality of the&#xD;
      proposed research and its potential impact for the development of new research directions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anaesthesiologist adjusts the injection of intravenous anaesthetic agents regarding the&#xD;
      depth of anaesthesia. The closed-loop system for administration of intravenous anaesthetic&#xD;
      agent will enable immediate reaction and adjustment of the intravenous anaesthetic flow. In&#xD;
      this project the investigators will focus on the closed-loop control of flow in intravenous&#xD;
      administration of propofol . Induction of propofol affects the BIS index and an adequate&#xD;
      controller sets the infusion pump so that the BIS index follows as closely as possible the&#xD;
      trajectory, prescribed by the anaesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research project is divided in two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the development of a mathematical model describing the impact of anaesthetic-agent&#xD;
           administration on the depth of anaesthesia (BIS);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the development of a closed-loop control system for depth of anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase will begin with the modelling of dynamics of anaesthetic-agent administration&#xD;
      impacting the anaesthetic depth. The advantages of developing a mathematical dynamical model&#xD;
      are as follows: better comprehension of the process and its dynamics; the model presents the&#xD;
      basis for developing a simulator and for running simulation experiments that are useful in&#xD;
      the closed-loop control-system design phase; the dynamical mathematical model can be employed&#xD;
      in the control algorithm, especially for predictive control approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The input of the controller is represented by two signals: the reference value of BIS index&#xD;
      and the actual value of BIS index. The controller uses these two signals to calculate the&#xD;
      suitable input signal of the infusion pump, which administers propofol with a flow set by the&#xD;
      controller. Once the propofol is administered into the body, its level in blood increases and&#xD;
      consequently the concentration at the effect site, i.e. central nervous system, increases,&#xD;
      too. Changing of the propofol concentration is a dynamic process, which depends on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic system of the patient. The concentration level of propofol at the effect site&#xD;
      represents the input of pharmacodynamic system, describing the depth of anaesthesia, which&#xD;
      could be treated as the output of pharmacodynamic system. The depth of anaesthesia affects&#xD;
      the brain waves, measured by electrodes for measuring EEG signals. The BIS monitor measures&#xD;
      the EEG signals and uses these measurements to establish the BIS index. The induction of&#xD;
      other anaesthetic agents (e.g. remifentanil analgesic), which also partially impacts the BIS&#xD;
      index, is considered as a disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The originality of the expected results&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the depth of anaesthesia will be treated from 3 perspectives: modelling,&#xD;
      simulation, and control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problem of modelling the effect of propofol is described in literature in various ways.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models, such as Marsh, Schneider, Kataria, Schüttler,&#xD;
      White-Kenny have been developed for such purposes. The models typically define the basic&#xD;
      structure of the dynamic operating system of propofol and the parameters depend on individual&#xD;
      patients. The values of model's parameters are affected by the patient and his&#xD;
      characteristics (weight, height, age, sex etc.) as well as individual sensitivity to propofol&#xD;
      and the ability to excrete propofol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mathematical model of propofol affecting the dynamics of depth of anaesthesia will be&#xD;
      developed based on the existing models in literature. The investigators will develop the&#xD;
      model using classic modelling approaches, such as differential equations with the&#xD;
      Laplace-domain and state-space representations, as well as advanced approaches: nonlinear&#xD;
      dynamics will be treated using fuzzy logic, namely Takagi-Sugeno models. An appropriately&#xD;
      validated dynamical model for propofol activity will be the basis for developing a simulator&#xD;
      assisting the anaesthesiologist in safe study of anesthesiologic procedures. It will simplify&#xD;
      the understanding of the operating mechanism of propofol and enable testing of different&#xD;
      scenarios of administering propofol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several developed pharmacokinetic models are used in certain infusion pumps for target&#xD;
      controlled infusion (TCI), where the pump sets the proper flow of the medication with regard&#xD;
      to the model. The problem with these models is that they often do not reflect the real&#xD;
      dynamics, which also depends on individual sensitivity of the patients to the substance,&#xD;
      therefore such approaches, based on open-loop induction, often do not yield the best&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The algorithm for closed-loop control of anaesthetic depth will be based on 2-DOF control,&#xD;
      which means that it can be functionally divided into two parts: the feedforward and the&#xD;
      feedback part. Hence, the algorithm merges the advantages of both open-loop and closed-loop&#xD;
      control. The feedforward part will use the model of propofol to calculate the flow according&#xD;
      to BIS index reference trajectory. On the other hand, the feedback part will provide the&#xD;
      appropriate flow corrections based on BIS index measurements. The advantage of the proposed&#xD;
      approach is that the feedforward part of the control algorithm can bring the actual BIS index&#xD;
      value close to the reference trajectory, whereas the feedback part compensates the control&#xD;
      error, which occurs due to inaccurate modelling, noise and eventual disturbances on the real&#xD;
      system, such as for instance the induction of remifentanil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control algorithm will be based on the developed dynamic model of propofol that will be&#xD;
      used for predicting the depth of anaesthesia. By online adaptation of the parameters of the&#xD;
      internal dynamic model, the algorithm will consider the individual patient's response to&#xD;
      propofol, estimated from the measurements during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project work will begin with modelling and simulation studies of propofol effects. The&#xD;
      modelling procedure will involve theoretical and experimental approaches. Within the&#xD;
      theoretical modelling framework, the investigators will use the knowledge on pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamic mechanisms, whereas the experimental approach will complement the&#xD;
      theoretical one by using the appropriate measurements for identifying the structure and the&#xD;
      parameters of the model. Mathematical modelling of complex systems is an iterative procedure,&#xD;
      requiring verification and validation of the developed model in every consecutive step. The&#xD;
      quality of the data, obtained from suitably designed experiments, is of utmost importance.&#xD;
      The measured signals must be properly synchronized, appropriately filtered, sampled and&#xD;
      informationally-adequate segments have to be selected for identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The developed model will be tested in the Matlab-Simulink environment. The virtual simulation&#xD;
      environment will enable various experiments for validation of the model behaviour and&#xD;
      comparison to the measured dynamics of depth of anaesthesia. The investigators will develop a&#xD;
      user interface that will facilitate the conduction of simulation experiments. The developed&#xD;
      system for closed-loop control of depth of anaesthesia will be first tested in a virtual&#xD;
      environment. Finally, the investigators will also test it - under anaesthesiological&#xD;
      supervision - in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anaesthesiological protocol with detailed descriptions of the course of operation and&#xD;
      induction of particular agents is described in the application that is being considered at&#xD;
      the National Medical Ethics Committee of Slovenia. Due to space restrictions the&#xD;
      aforementioned details are not stated here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance and potential impact of the results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the obvious advantages of closed-loop control of anaesthetic depth, such approaches&#xD;
      are not yet used in clinical practice. Hence, the main result of this project will be the&#xD;
      development and the study of implementation potential of closed-loop control system for depth&#xD;
      of anaesthesia, based on BIS index measurements. In the first part of the project the&#xD;
      investigators will develop dynamical model dealing with the effects of anaesthesiological&#xD;
      agents on the depth of anaesthesia, whereas the second part will be devoted to the&#xD;
      development of a system for closed-loop control of depth of anaesthesia. The developed model&#xD;
      will be validated by comparing its outputs it to the measurements of dynamical processes on&#xD;
      real patients. Finally, the performance of the closed-loop control system will be assessed in&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that by using the proposed concept of closed-loop control of depth of anaesthesia,&#xD;
      which is measured by BIS index and controlled by propofol administration, a better course of&#xD;
      depth anaesthesia than in manual operation will be achieved. The control system will avoid&#xD;
      excessive overshoots of BIS index trajectory, react instantly to unexpected dynamic&#xD;
      behaviour, effectively compensate disturbances and consider a priori unknown pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamic properties of a particular patient. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      anaesthesiologist will be notified only in cases of unpredicted value of BIS index or&#xD;
      propofol flow outside the prescribed constraints. In such a manner, the anaesthesiologist&#xD;
      will be able to devote his attention to other critical aspects of anaesthesia. Although the&#xD;
      anaesthesiologist will not have to continuously monitor the BIS index value, the automatic&#xD;
      system will decrease the deviation of depth of anaesthesia from the desired value. Improved&#xD;
      tracking of the reference trajectory will certainly be beneficial for the patients as it will&#xD;
      decrease the possibility of being awake during the procedure and at the same time prevent&#xD;
      excessive administration of propofol, which will ease the postoperative recovery and adverse&#xD;
      events of propofol. It will also decrease the amount of propofol used during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exceptional socio-economic or culturally relevant achievements of the project leader&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main field of research of the project leader Assist. Prof. Dr. Gorazd Karer are&#xD;
      modelling, simulation and control of dynamical systems. Since his PhD defence in 2009 he has&#xD;
      been intensively working especially on advanced approaches to mathematical modelling and on&#xD;
      control of dynamical processes. He is the author or co-author of 16 scientific papers, 28&#xD;
      conference papers, 1 scientific monograph, 1 chapter in a scientific monograph, 1&#xD;
      terminological dictionary, 3 studies and the supervisor of 14 successfully defended bachelor&#xD;
      theses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      He is involved in several courses in the field of modelling, system theory and automatic&#xD;
      control at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana. The courses&#xD;
      Automatic Control Systems and Automatic Control are the basic courses in the Control&#xD;
      Engineering study programme. The courses Control Systems Instrumentation and Control&#xD;
      Technology Instrumentation deal with technological aspects and sensors. The courses Modelling&#xD;
      and Signal Processing and Modelling Methods treat modelling of dynamical systems. The&#xD;
      approaches from the latter will be useful especially for the first stage of the research&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2013, he published a scientific monograph with Springer Verlag titled Predictive&#xD;
      Approaches to Control of Complex Systems with his co-author Prof. Dr. Igor Škrjanc. The&#xD;
      monograph has been favourably accepted in the scientific community as it has been downloaded&#xD;
      in electronic form more than 11.000 times since it had been made available online at&#xD;
      Springer. The monograph deals with advanced control algorithms for systems with complex&#xD;
      dynamics, which also include the dynamic processes during anaesthesia. Therefore, the&#xD;
      approaches described in the monograph represent an excellent basis for the development of a&#xD;
      system for closed-loop control of depth of anaesthesia proposed in this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      He was the initiator and one of the authors of the Dictionary of automatic control, systems&#xD;
      and robotics, published in 2014. In the preparation phase, the Terminological Section of the&#xD;
      Fran Ramovš Institute of the Slovenian Language at the Research Centre of the Slovenian&#xD;
      Academy of Sciences and Arts (ZRC SAZU) was involved. During the project he was intensively&#xD;
      working on the terminological definitions of concepts from his research field. Such a&#xD;
      terminological experience facilitates the communication in interdisciplinary teams,&#xD;
      especially with co-workers that are not familiar with the field of automatic control.&#xD;
      Therefore, it will also benefit the cooperation with anaesthesiologist involved in the&#xD;
      proposed project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      He was the secretary of the Automatic Control Society of Slovenia from 2010 to 2014 and has&#xD;
      been a member of the Executive Committee since 2014. The contacts within the society enable&#xD;
      connections to the experts working in the field of automatic control both in academia and in&#xD;
      industry, which provides a good overview of the state of automatic control in Slovenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      He was involved in the Competence Centre for Advanced Control Technologies, where a control&#xD;
      approach, based on key performance indicators (KPI) and dynamic model identification was&#xD;
      developed. The approach is conceptually related to the proposed closed-loop control system&#xD;
      for depth of anaesthesia. The methods for acquiring knowledge from the history of KPI will&#xD;
      also be useful for developing the proposed control system, of course by considering the&#xD;
      anaesthesia-related particularities and by involving the knowledge of the collaborating&#xD;
      anaesthesiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organisational structure and feasibility of the project&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be realized in collaboration with a research group at the Department of&#xD;
      Anaesthesiology and Surgical Intensive Therapy (KOAIT) at the University Medical Centre (UKC)&#xD;
      Ljubljana, led by As. Dr. Iztok Potočnik. The group consists of anaesthesiologists that have&#xD;
      access to the equipment needed for the theoretical results of the project and the simulation&#xD;
      studies to be clinically validated. The clinical part of the research will be carried out at&#xD;
      the Department of Ophthalmology UKC Ljubljana for vitroretinal surgeries, at the&#xD;
      Neurosurgical Department UKC Ljubljana for patients undergoing surgery due to expansive&#xD;
      processes in the head, and at the Intensive Care Unit KOAIT UKC Ljubljana for patients&#xD;
      needing long-term sedation due to head injuries. For establishing the plasmatic&#xD;
      concentrations of anaesthetic agents the investigators will cooperate with the Institute of&#xD;
      Clinical Chemistry and Biochemistry UKC Ljubljana. The first measurements will be conducted&#xD;
      after obtaining the approval from the National Medical Ethics Committee of Slovenia.&#xD;
