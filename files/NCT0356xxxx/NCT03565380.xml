  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of falls in patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is high and related to&#xD;
      lower limb muscle weakness and poor balance control. However, since routine post-TKA&#xD;
      rehabilitation is uncommon, it is paramount to explore alternative strategies to enhance&#xD;
      balance and physical functioning in post-TKA patients. As Tai Chi is a proven strategy for&#xD;
      improving balance in older people, the proposed study aims to determine the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of a 12-week community-based post-TKA multimodal Tai Chi program and to collect&#xD;
      preliminary data with respect to the efficacy of such a program in improving balance and&#xD;
      physical functioning in post-TKA patients as compared to usual postoperative care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a single-blinded 2-arm RCT. TKA participants will be randomized to either a 12-week&#xD;
      community-based rehabilitation program starting at 12 weeks after TKA, or usual&#xD;
      post-operative care without outpatient physiotherapy. A third group of asymptomatic controls&#xD;
      will be recruited to provide comparisons at various time points. All post-TKA participants&#xD;
      will undergo five clinical assessments: 1 week before TKA, and at 6, 12, 24 and 52 weeks&#xD;
      after TKA. The untreated asymptomatic controls will be assessed at baseline, and 12 and 52&#xD;
      weeks from baseline&#xD;

    <description>The recruitment and attrition rates will be monitored on a monthly basis to determine the presence of any specific trends. The recruitment rate (all potential participants), retention and attrition rates (all randomized participants) and completion rates (all enrolled participants) will be assessed at the end of study.

    <description>Attendance and exercise logbooks will be used to monitor non-adherence. The instructor will communicate with non-adherent participants to understand the reasons and barriers for non-adherence and to develop appropriate strategies to improve adherence. Furthermore, to assess the acceptability of the intervention, each participant in the intervention group will be invited to participate in a face-to-face or video call interviews semi-structured interview based on participants' preferences within 1 month after the final follow-up.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive 12 x 90 minute sessions of supervised exercises over 12 weeks. In addition to usual care, supervised exercise will be held at the Center of Sports Training and Rehabilitation inside the University and each class will be restricted to no more than 8 participants to ensure sufficient personalized attention. Each training session involves warm-up together with stretching of lower extremity muscles, strengthening exercises of the major lower extremity muscle groups by Theraband, balancing exercise, Tai Chi training, and rest/ cool-down. All lower-extremity exercises will be performed bilaterally.</description>
