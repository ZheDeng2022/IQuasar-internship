      Introduction Knee osteoarthritis is a common disease of joint degeneration. Chronic&#xD;
      inflammation is the major cause of this disease. One-third of the people over 65 years of age&#xD;
      have Knee OA and the prevalence in women is more than in men. One-third of the people over 65&#xD;
      years of age have Knee OA and the prevalence in women is more than in men. The risk factors&#xD;
      include age, weight, genetic factor, sex, bone density, and the past history of trauma or&#xD;
      work. The more important risk factors are age and weight. These multiple factors make the&#xD;
      change of knee joint, like chronic inflammation, joint remodeling and loss of function that&#xD;
      make the change of joint homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis criteria of knee OA is based on two groups. In 1957, Kellgren and Lawrence&#xD;
      established the criteria of radiological assessment and in 1986, Altman's group created the&#xD;
      criteria of classification of idiopathic knee OA. In the beginning, only four pictures&#xD;
      presented the four grade of knee OA without description. In 1963, Lawrence wrote the original&#xD;
      description. Altman and his team used clinical signs combined with laboratory or radiography&#xD;
      to established the diagnosis criteria. Now, the most used method is clinical and radiographic&#xD;
      examination. In the clinical part, the patient should have knee pain with at least one of&#xD;
      three items: age over than 50 years, the time of morning stiffness is less than 30 minutes or&#xD;
      crepitus. In the radiography, the patient's X ray should show the definite osteophytes. The&#xD;
      sensitivity can reach 91 percent and the specificity can reach 86 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee joint is a diarthrodial joint. Two adjacent bones are covered by a layer of specialized&#xD;
      articular cartilage and are encased in a connective tissue capsule lined by a synovial&#xD;
      membrane, consisting of a thin cell layer of macrophages and fibroblasts. The main structural&#xD;
      elements of knee include the articular cartilage (with chondrocytes), tidemark (separating&#xD;
      the calcified and articular cartilage), calcified cartilage, and subchondral cortical and&#xD;
      trabecular bone. The advanced osteoarthritic changes characterized by fissuring and&#xD;
      fragmentation of the articular cartilage, chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy,&#xD;
      duplication and advancement of the tidemark, expansion of the zone of calcified cartilage,&#xD;
      thickening of the subchondral cortical plate and vascular invasion of the bone and calcified&#xD;
      cartilage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The signaling of cytokine is an important part of progression of knee OA. The initial is&#xD;
      inflammation, maybe from cartilage or synovium. Then the hypertrophic chondrocyte and the&#xD;
      macrophage of synovium will secret IL-1, 4, 13, TNF-α,β, MMP1,13 and ADAMTS 4, 5. The major&#xD;
      function of MMP and ADAMTS is to degrade the articular cartilage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of knee OA by OARSI (Osteoarthritis Research Society International) has one&#xD;
      core treatment and four recommend treatment by different OA types. The core treatment&#xD;
      includes strength training and exercise, weight management and education. The recommend&#xD;
      treatment includes NSAIDs by oral or topical, acetaminophen, corticosteroid and duloxetine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug treatments are mostly related to relief of symptoms and there is no disease-modifying OA&#xD;
      drug approved by the agencies. And the side effects of NSAIDs. In the GI tract, the patient&#xD;
      may have nausea, dyspepsia, heartburn and diaphragm disease. In the kidney, there are acute&#xD;
      or chronic renal failure with dose/duration-dependent effect. But the side effect of topical&#xD;
      NSAIDs is less than oral NSAIDs in the GI tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to the description of Knee OA in ancient China, the symptoms of knee OA have been&#xD;
      recorded in the Huangdi Neijing 2000 years ago. APLD is an old formula since Tang dynasty&#xD;
      about 1200 years ago. In the rat models, it is effective in terms of the proliferation of&#xD;
      cartilage chondrocytes and the damaged knee joint tissue repairing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the evidence, there are 10 clinical trials to study the effect of TCM in the KOA&#xD;
      since 2004. The effect of TCM in improving symptoms of knee OA is similar with it of NSAIDs&#xD;
      and better than glucosamine sulfate. The major effect is pain relief and the special effect&#xD;
      is improving muscle strength that NSAIDs cannot do. The results are usually the improvement&#xD;
      of symptoms but there are no the bio- mechanisms of TCM. 2016, Chen et al. published a&#xD;
      meta-analysis about TCM and knee OA. There are 23 studies that include 2362 subjects. 18 of&#xD;
      the studies showed significantly improved VAS pain scores, six of the studies showed&#xD;
      significantly improved WOMAC pain subscale scores, and 16 of the trials showed significantly&#xD;
      improved total effectiveness rates. But in the quality of these studies, only &quot;incomplete&#xD;
      outcome data&quot; can reach &quot;Low risk of bias&quot; and other items get &quot;high risk of bias&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;unclear risk of bias&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researches of animal models and cell lines presented that the herbs have the ability of&#xD;
      analgesic effect, anti-inflammation, the regulation of cell cycle (apoptosis), anti-&#xD;
      oxidation and anti-degradation. Like ginseng, ginseng Rb1 decreases the inflammation by&#xD;
      decreasing IL-1b, decreases degradation of cartilage by decreasing MMP-1, 13 and increasing&#xD;
      collagen type II and improves cell differentiation process by Notch signaling. Resveratrol&#xD;
      from cranberries and grapes has effects of anti-inflammation by decreasing IL-1b, TNF-a,&#xD;
      COX-2 and NF-kB and regulate the homeostasis of cartilage by increasing collagen II and&#xD;
      decreasing MMP-13. Pharmacological actions of herbs include decrease of substance P,&#xD;
      inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor, promotion of chondrocyte proliferation and&#xD;
      vasodilation. These actions are different from the effects of NSAIDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the design and methodology of the 10 studies are gradually improving, the quality of&#xD;
      these studies is still not enough. But the potential of Chinese medicine is still huge.&#xD;
      According to the statement above, researchers should focus on the whole knee joint including&#xD;
      skin, fat, vessel, nerve, muscle, synovium, ligament, bone and cartilage. TCM formula usually&#xD;
      composited of various herbs which may affect different tissues of knee joint and play a&#xD;
      synergic effect. The DMOADs of Chinese medicine is a novel prospect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Materials This study is to evaluate the efficacy of herbal formula TGF treating&#xD;
      knee joint osteoarthritis(KOA) and its biochemical mechanism. The study design is a parallel&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial includes 180 patients with KOA.&#xD;
      The patients are random allocated into study group(TGF) and control group(TGFP). After the 12&#xD;
      weeks treatment course, another 4 weeks is to follow-up the condition without medication.&#xD;
      Assessments will be performed before and after treatment and the end of follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are (1) age between 50~75 years old, (2) diagnosis of osteoarthritis:&#xD;
      The Clinical/Radiographic classification criteria of American College of Rheumatology,&#xD;
      American College of Rheumatology, (3) chronic knee pain over 3 months. The exclusion criteria&#xD;
      are (1) the past history with systemic joint disease, such as autoimmune disease, (2) the&#xD;
      patient with history of knee surgery or waiting for the total knee replacement, (3) any&#xD;
      disease that affect the function of lower extremities, such as trauma, tumor or compensation&#xD;
      of abnormal posture, (4) the condition that cannot participate this study, (5) the subjects&#xD;
      non-compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are the WOMAC (VAS version, 3.1), VAS for pain and the used dosage of&#xD;
      Celebrex before and after treatment. The WOMAC is the VAS version, 3.1 and divided into three&#xD;
      sub-scales -- pain, stiffness and function. Pain (5 items): during walking, using stairs, in&#xD;
      bed, sitting or lying, and standing. Stiffness (2 items): after first waking and later in the&#xD;
      day. Physical Function (17 items): stair use, rising from sitting, standing, bending,&#xD;
      walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on / taking off socks, rising from bed,&#xD;
      lying in bed, getting in / out of bath, sitting, getting on / off toilet, heavy household&#xD;
      duties, light household duties. Each item has 0-100 mm to evaluate the status and the higher&#xD;
      values represent a worse outcome. These three sub-scales were summed to a total score (0-2400&#xD;
      mm). Visual analogue scale for pain is to evaluate the status of knee pain when check point.&#xD;
      Using 0-100 mm scale is to evaluate knee pain by visual analogue scale. &quot;0&quot; is no pain and&#xD;
      &quot;100&quot; is the worst pain that subjects had experienced before. The subject gives the value&#xD;
      under the moment of check point. The used dosage of Celebrex is another method to evaluate&#xD;
      the situation of pain in a period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are X ray, Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire (CCMQ),&#xD;
      WHOQOL-BREF, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, high-sensitive C reactive protein, Biomarkers&#xD;
      (C-telopeptide of type II collagen, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, Osteocalcin, Leptin,&#xD;
      Interleukin-1, Interleukin-6, matrix metalloproteinase-3, matrix metalloproteinase-13,&#xD;
      ADAMTS-4, transglutaminase-2), metabolomics and mitochondrial function. The X ray are taken&#xD;
      in the baseline, the 12th weeks and the 16th weeks to evaluate the change after treatment.&#xD;
      The Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire (CCMQ) is to evaluate the constitution.&#xD;
      This scale (Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire) includes nine constitutions and&#xD;
      each constitution has 6-8 items that used 1-5 points to evaluate the degree. &quot;1&quot; means&#xD;
      &quot;better&quot; and &quot;5&quot; means &quot;worse&quot;. The transformed points is equal to [(original points - the&#xD;
      number of items)/(the number of items*4) ]*100. The WHOQOL-BREF is to evaluate the quality of&#xD;
      life. This scale is &quot;World Health Organization Quality of Life - BREF&quot;. It contains 4 domains&#xD;
      (Physical health, Psychological, Social relationships and Environment) and 26 items (&quot;1&quot;&#xD;
      means &quot;worse&quot; and &quot;5&quot; means &quot;better&quot;). This scale used the following steps to calculate the&#xD;
      transformed points: 1.Check all 26 items from assessment have a range of 1-5, 2.Reverse 3&#xD;
      negatively phrased items, 3.Compute domain scores, 4. Delete cases with &gt;20% missing data,&#xD;
      5.Check domain scores. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) actually measures the rate of&#xD;
      fall (sedimentation) of erythrocytes (red blood cells) in a sample of blood that has been&#xD;
      placed into a tube. Results are reported as the millimeters of clear fluid (plasma) that are&#xD;
      present at the top portion of the tube after one hour. The higher value means more&#xD;
      inflammation. High-sensitivity C-reactive Protein is a protein that increases in the blood&#xD;
      with inflammation and infection as well as following a heart attack, surgery, or trauma.&#xD;
      Thus, it is one of several proteins that are often referred to as acute phase reactants. The&#xD;
      high-sensitivity CRP test measures low levels of CRP in the blood to identify low levels of&#xD;
      inflammation that are associated with risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). The&#xD;
      concentration of C-Telopeptide of Type II Collagen (CTX-II), Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix&#xD;
      Protein (COMP), Osteocalcin, Leptin, interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), a disintegrin and&#xD;
      metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-4 (ADAMTS-4) and Transglutaminase 2 (TG-2) are&#xD;
      evaluated by ELISA kit. About the metabolite of the drugs, this measurement used LC-MS to get&#xD;
      the molecular weight of Chinese herbal metabolites form blood, urine and synovial fluid. This&#xD;
      method can help to identify the active substance from the formula (TGF). But now, the exactly&#xD;
      active substance is unclear. About mitochondrial function, this study will focus on mtDNA&#xD;
      copy number, the expression of mRNA in PGC-1α, NRF1 and mtTFA by quantitative polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction, the expression of protein in PGC-1α, NRF1 and mtTFA by Western blotting and&#xD;
      anti-oxidant capacity by OxiSelectTM Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) Assay Kit&#xD;
      (ABTS).&#xD;
