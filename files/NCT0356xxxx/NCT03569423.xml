      Introduction Previous studies document that, although Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is&#xD;
      the most worldwide performed refractive procedure, surface ablation may be safer to avoid&#xD;
      flap complications, corneal weakening, and a higher risk of iatrogenic keratectasia&#xD;
      associated with LASIK and thus the era of surface ablation emerged as an alternative (1).&#xD;
      Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is one of the surface ablation procedures and performed&#xD;
      after corneal epithelial debridement accompanied by post-operative pain, discomfort, and high&#xD;
      grade of corneal haze, all of which limit its popularity (2). The traditional method for&#xD;
      corneal epithelium removal before excimer LASER was manual scraping, which was later enhanced&#xD;
      by using an alcohol solution 20% or brush (3). In 2003, Camellin introduced a new&#xD;
      alcohol-assisted technique called laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK) that&#xD;
      allowed the epithelium to be preserved as a flap and applied back to the stromal corneal bed&#xD;
      after laser treatment (4). Also in 2003, Pallikaris invented epithelial laser in situ&#xD;
      keratomileusis (Epi-LASIK) which is another method that uses the epithelial flap and&#xD;
      performed with a microkeratome (called epi-keratome) with a blunt oscillating blade. After&#xD;
      trans-epithelial photorefractive keratectomy (TPRK) was introduced, where removal of the&#xD;
      epithelium is done by phototherapeutic ablation followed by refractive ablation of the&#xD;
      corneal stroma. Several studies emerged and advocated many techniques for epithelial removal&#xD;
      , but this 2-step technique was not worldwide used due to the prolonged surgery time with the&#xD;
      older generation of lasers, corneal dehydration, increased post-operative pain, and a&#xD;
      deficiency of adjusted nomograms (5). When new generations of faster lasers, improved&#xD;
      ablation algorithms, and nomograms have emerged, it allowed development of a new TPRK non&#xD;
      touch: all-surface ablation technique which allows ablation the corneal epithelium and stroma&#xD;
      in a single-step with one ablation profile. This aspheric profile is calculated according to&#xD;
      data from the literature estimating that the normal corneal epithelial thickness is 55 Î¼m&#xD;
      centrally and 65 peripherally at 4 mm radially from the center (6). A number of recent&#xD;
      studies demonstrated that this single-step TPRK is a relatively new procedure with many&#xD;
      advantages such as, reduced surgical time, minimizing the size of epithelial defect to that&#xD;
      required for stromal ablation, no alcohol use avoiding potential toxicity to the limbal&#xD;
      cells, less post-operative pain and corneal haze with rapid healing time and faster visual&#xD;
      recovery (7).Thus, there is a need for an updated comparative evaluation based on a larger&#xD;
      number of eyes. The aim of our study is to compare 6-months un-corrected distant visual&#xD;
      acuity (UDVA) and best corrected distant visual acuity (BCDVA) means, refractive results,&#xD;
      safety, and efficacy of single-step TPRK with alcohol-assisted PRK (AAPRK) as primary&#xD;
      outcomes and comparison of surgical time, pain scores, and haze levels, complete epithelial&#xD;
      healing time, as secondary outcomes among the two procedures when used to correct mild to&#xD;
      moderate myopia and myopic astigmatism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and methods This study is a prospective, consecutive, nonrandomized case-control&#xD;
      study that includes eyes that underwent either single-step TPRK or AAPRK between February&#xD;
      2017 and April 2018, at the Security Forces Hospital, Ophthalmology department, Riyadh,&#xD;
      Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study was approved by the local ethical board committee. Before&#xD;
      the surgical procedure, each patient was adequately informed about the study as well as the&#xD;
      risks and benefits of the surgery, and signed informed consent in accordance with the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 200 eyes of 100 consecutive patients were included; One hundred eyes underwent&#xD;
      TPRK (study group) and 100 eyes underwent AAPRK (control group). The study design choice of&#xD;
      the procedure was fixed for each patient: the right eye underwent TPRK and the contra-lateral&#xD;
      left eye AAPRK. Patients demographics and preoperative variables are demonstrated in Table&#xD;
      (1). There are no significant differences in pre-operative variables of patients in the TPRK&#xD;
      and AAPRK groups except the patients' genders. The percentage of females is 77% and males&#xD;
      23%. Patients who attended all visits, without any missing data, were included in the&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Examination The preoperative examination included UDVA, BCDVA, manifest and&#xD;
      cycloplegic refraction, slit lamp biomicroscopy, tonometry, Pentacam camera (OCULUS- Netzteil&#xD;
      Art., pentacam HR, Germany), tomography (Sirius, SCHWIND eye-tech-solutions GmbH,&#xD;
      Kleinostheim, Germany), and dilated fundus examination using binocular ophthalmoscopy.&#xD;
      Contact lenses use and medical history, including any systemic diseases, were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Technique All surgeries were performed with 6th-generation Amaris excimer LASER 193,&#xD;
      version 750 S (Schwind eye-tech-solutions GmbH&amp; Co.KG, Mainparkstrasse, Kleinostheim,&#xD;
      Germany). Ablations were based on aberration-free algorithms calculated using ORK-CAM&#xD;
      software with beam size 0.54 mm full width and high-speed eye tracking. Treatments were&#xD;
      performed by 2 surgeons (BA &amp; ESH ) using an identical surgical protocol. The treatments were&#xD;
      mostly aimed at emmetropia. Before the surgery, tetracaine hydrochloride 0.5% ophthalmic&#xD;
      solution (Bausch &amp; Lomb, Minims) and moxifloxacin 0.5% (Vigamox, Alcon Co.) drops were&#xD;
      instilled 3 times within a 5-minutes interval. The eyelids were prepared with antiseptic&#xD;
      Chlorohexidine Gluconate 0.05% solution (Saudi Medical Solution Company) and opened using a&#xD;
      wire lid speculum. In the AAPRK group, the cornea was exposed to a 20% ethyl alcohol solution&#xD;
      for 25 seconds with the use of a well. Subsequently, a superficial cut of the epithelium was&#xD;
      made with either an 8.5 or 9.5 mm diameter trephine. The epithelium was mechanically debrided&#xD;
      with the well or with a blunt spatula, then LASER treatment with the same machine was&#xD;
      initiated. In the TPRK group, where aspheric aberration-free TPRK ablation algorithm was used&#xD;
      (Schwind eye-tech-solutions), the epithelium was removed during laser ablation only from the&#xD;
      area of the total ablation zone. In both groups and in all cases, immediately after&#xD;
      treatment, the eye was washed with a balanced salt solution (BSS) for 20 seconds. Then, to&#xD;
      fight against post-operative corneal haze, mitomycin C 0.02% (MMC) was applied for 30 seconds&#xD;
      followed by copious irrigation of the eye with BSS. Intra-operative complications were not&#xD;
      noted and surgical time starting from eye lid speculum insertion to the time of its removal&#xD;
      at the end of the procedure were recorded. After the surgery, a bandage contact lens was&#xD;
      applied (BIOMEDICS Evolution CL ocufilcon D 45%, water 55%) for 7 days. The postoperative&#xD;
      regimen included tobradex eye drops 0.3% (Tobramycin 0.3% - dexamethazone 0.1% sterile eye&#xD;
      drops, Alcon Co.) with tapering dose for 1 month starting with QID/ 1 week, TID/ 1 week, BID/&#xD;
      1 week and once a day/1 week, moxifloxacin drops 0.5% (Vigamox, Alcon Co.) for 2 weeks, and&#xD;
      sodium hyaluronate 0.2% (Hyfresh eye drops, Jamjoom Pharma Co.) drop / 2 hours and a gradual&#xD;
      decreasing of the frequency for 3 months. Pain killer oral medication tablet/ 6 hours was&#xD;
      used in the first post-operative days if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Examinations Patients were instructed to visit the clinic for postoperative&#xD;
      examinations and follow up after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. Examinations&#xD;
      at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months included UDVA ,but the BCDVA and manifest&#xD;
      refraction were measured at 1, 3, and 6 months. Slit lamp biomicroscopy was done in each&#xD;
      visit. Corneal haze grading was evaluated according to Fantes et al., 1990 proposal (0 = no&#xD;
      haze; 0.5 = trace haze on oblique illumination; 1 = corneal cloudiness not interfering with&#xD;
      the visibility of fine iris details; 2 = mild effacement of fine iris details; 3 and 4 =&#xD;
      details of the lens and iris not discernible). Healing time in which complete&#xD;
      re-epithelialisation occurred in both eyes were recorded. In post-operative day 1, day 3 and&#xD;
      week 1, We used a discrete, 11-category numeric pain scale (NPS, 0 = no pain and 10 = the&#xD;
      worst possible pain) to evaluate pain score in each eye and patients response were recorded&#xD;
      at early postoperative period. Six months post-operatively, patients were asked about the&#xD;
      overall satisfaction with each procedure as high, moderate, low, and not satisfied, and&#xD;
      whether they would decide to have the surgery again (yes, no) were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Patients' data were entered in Microsoft Excel, copied and analyzed&#xD;
      using Sigma Plot-Scientific Data Program for the 2 groups, Paired student's t-test was used&#xD;
      for the UDVA &amp; BCDVA means in decimal values and for MRSE means. Mann-Whitney test was used&#xD;
      for pain scores, haze levels, and healing time. For all tests, a (P value &lt; 0.05) was&#xD;
      considered statistically significant. A Graph Pad Prism 5 program was used for graphs&#xD;
      constructions.&#xD;
