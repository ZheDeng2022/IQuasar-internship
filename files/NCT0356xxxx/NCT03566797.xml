  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SC-CIP is increasing in patients after critical illness. Pathogenesis is still largely&#xD;
      unclear. Gut microbiome composition, gut permeability, bacterial translocation, inflammation&#xD;
      and/or genetic variants contribute to the pathogenesis The aim of this project is to study&#xD;
      gut microbiome composition, gut permeability, bacterial translocation, inflammation, bile&#xD;
      acid composition and genetic polymorphisms by conducting a prospective cohort study in&#xD;
      patients with a high risk to develop SC-CIP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondary sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients (SC-CIP) is a rare, quickly&#xD;
      progressive, cholestatic liver disease which is observed in patients suffering from a severe&#xD;
      illness with the need for long term treatment on an intensive care unit (ICU). Invasive&#xD;
      ventilation, polytrauma, hypotension, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, burns, complex&#xD;
      operations and severe (co-) morbidities such as obesity have been discussed as risk factors.&#xD;
      Patients suffering from SC-CIP do not have any underlying liver disease. Usually, long- term&#xD;
      ICU treatment is described as the trigger mechanism for the development of this disease,&#xD;
      although also rapid development of SC-CIP after an ICU stay as short as nine days is&#xD;
      described in a single case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of SC-CIP is not fully understood yet: Ischemic injury of the intrahepatic&#xD;
      biliary system, bile cast formation and recurrent biliary infections are discussed as major&#xD;
      factors. The disease leads to a progressive destruction of the intra- and extrahepatic&#xD;
      biliary tree with the development of strictures resulting in liver fibrosis with in some&#xD;
      cases rapid progression to cirrhosis with the need for liver transplantation within months.&#xD;
      The gold standard for diagnosis is endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP),&#xD;
      although magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) as non-invasive alternative can&#xD;
      lead to the diagnosis in most cases. Prognosis is poor and transplant-free survival has been&#xD;
      found to be 40 months in average. Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment, which&#xD;
      shows excellent outcome and quality of life comparable to other indication for liver&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological analysis of bile from patients with SC-CIP and primary sclerosing cholangitis&#xD;
      (PSC) show a significant different microbiological profile in these two cohorts with&#xD;
      dominance of drug resistant organisms in the bile of SC-CIP. No data on the gut microbiome in&#xD;
      SC-CIP are available so far. Other chronic liver diseases show distinct changes in microbiome&#xD;
      composition with potential influence on the inflammation process in these liver diseases&#xD;
      (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcoholic liver disease, PSC and liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis). In general a decrease in diversity, a higher abundance of potentially pathogenic&#xD;
      species and a lower abundance of beneficial species has been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysbiosis is thought to increase intestinal permeability. Increased gut permeability is most&#xD;
      frequently observed in liver cirrhosis but was also found in alcohol-induced injury, NAFLD&#xD;
      and hepatitis C-mediated liver injury. With an impaired gut permeability bacteria from the&#xD;
      intestinal lumen can be translocated into extraintestinal parts of the body (lymph nodes,&#xD;
      blood) and prompt inflammatory responses. Genetic polymorphisms in the Nucleotide-binding&#xD;
      oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) gene, a known risk factor for bacterial&#xD;
      translocation, increases the odds of developing SC-CIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the gut microbiome composition is altered in SC-CIP and that this is&#xD;
      associated with increased gut permeability and markers of inflammation. Reasons for this&#xD;
      might lie in gene polymorphisms influencing bacterial translocation or bile acid composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to prospectively assess the incidence of SC-CIP in a cohort of&#xD;
      patients at risk for developing SC-CIP (ICU treatment with the need for mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation &gt;/= 5 days) and study differences in gut&#xD;
      microbiome composition, gut permeability, bacterial translocation, inflammation as well as&#xD;
      genetic polymorphisms in patients developing SC-CIP and patients with comparable disease&#xD;
      severity who did not develop SC-CIP.&#xD;
