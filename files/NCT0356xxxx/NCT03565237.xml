&#xD;
               -  Participant aged ≥ 6 years that has been previously treated with plasma-derived&#xD;
                  and/or recombinant factor IX (FIX) concentrate(s) for a minimum of 150 exposure&#xD;
                  days (EDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participant aged &lt; 6 years that has been previously treated with plasma-derived&#xD;
                  and/or recombinant FIX concentrate(s) for a minimum of 50 EDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant has no evidence of a history of FIX inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant is human immunodeficiency virus negative (HIV-); or HIV+ with stable&#xD;

             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participant is hepatitis C virus negative (HCV-) by antibody or PCR testing (if&#xD;
             positive, antibody titer will be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)), as&#xD;
             confirmed by central laboratory at screening; or HCV+ with chronic stable hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The participant is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol.&#xD;

             by central laboratory at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participant has been diagnosed with an inherited or acquired hemostatic defect other&#xD;
             than hemophilia B.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participant's platelet count is &lt; 100,000/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Participant has a clinically significant medical, psychiatric, or cognitive illness,&#xD;
             or recreational drug/alcohol use that, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             affect participant's safety or compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Participant is currently receiving, or is scheduled to receive during the course of&#xD;
             the study, an immunomodulating drug (eg, corticosteroid agents at a dose equivalent to&#xD;
             hydrocortisone greater than 10 mg/day, or α-interferon) other than antiretroviral&#xD;
             chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;

             product (IP) or investigational device within 30 days prior to enrollment or is&#xD;
             scheduled to participate in another clinical study involving an IP or investigational&#xD;
             device during the course of this study.&#xD;
