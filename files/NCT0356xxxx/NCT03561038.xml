  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized controlled trial of all the patients referred to University of&#xD;
      Arkansas Medical for Medical Sciences (UAMS) for endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided biopsy of&#xD;
      solid mass lesions. EUS guided tissue acquisition will be performed in all these patients&#xD;
      using both needle types (22-gauge Franseen Fine Needle Biopsy (FNB) (Acquire, Boston&#xD;
      Scientific Corporation, Natick, Mass) and 22-gauge Fork-tip FNB needle (SharkCore,&#xD;
      Medtronic)) with randomization of the order in which the needle will be used.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All procedures will be performed by the advance endoscopists Dr Sumant Inamdar (SI) and Dr&#xD;
      Benjamin Tharian (BT) using a linear array echoendoscope (Olympus UCT180, Olympus America&#xD;
      Corp, Center Valley, Pa) with patients in the left lateral decubitus position after&#xD;
      administration of anesthesia (propofol or general anesthesia). During EUS, the mass will&#xD;
      first be punctured using either needle based on the randomization assignment. Tissue&#xD;
      acquisition will be performed using the fanning maneuver (4 strokes at 4 different locations&#xD;
      within the mass). After performing 2 dedicated passes for cell block for histological&#xD;
      analysis using the randomized needle, 2 additional passes will be made for cell block with&#xD;
      the alternate needle. Sample obtained from each pass is placed into a separate container to&#xD;
      be analysed separately. The occurrence of immediate adverse events will be noted at the time&#xD;
      of procedure, and late adverse events will be documented by follow-up telephone calls at 1&#xD;
      week post-procedure&#xD;
