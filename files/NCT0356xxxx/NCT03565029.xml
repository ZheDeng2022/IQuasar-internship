      NO-CUT is a one-stage phase II trial seeking to establish whether an oxaliplatin-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy preceding standard neo-adjuvant fluoropyrimidines-based chemo radiotherapy, can&#xD;
      safely spare demolitive surgical intervention in patients with operable rectal cancer,&#xD;
      without increasing the risk of distant relapse. The trial also has a translational component&#xD;
      aimed at establishing whether selected genomic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic markers are&#xD;
      predictive of tumor and patient outcome.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer death in Europe. Rectal cancer accounts for about 25-30% of all colorectal cancer&#xD;
      diagnoses. Five-year survival rates depend on stage at diagnosis, about 92% for stage I, 87%&#xD;
      for stage II A, 63% for stage II B, 89% for stage III A, 69% for stage III B, and for stage&#xD;
      III C cancers the survival rate is about 53%; stage IV rectal cancers have a 5-year relative&#xD;
      survival rate of about 11%. With the chemoradiation therapy (CRT), the resulting pathologic&#xD;
      complete response (pCR) across all stages has been documented in up to 30% of patients. Most&#xD;
      importantly, patients achieving pCR have lower rates of tumor recurrence, and improved&#xD;
      survival, compared to those who do not achieve pCR. Moreover, data from the National Surgical&#xD;
      Quality Improvement Project document a 35% risk of morbidity associated with both low&#xD;
      anterior and abdominoperineal resection. Long-term morbidity includes bowel and bladder&#xD;
      incontinence, sexual dysfunction, and complications associated with temporary and permanent&#xD;
      stomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the observation of the absence of residual tumor in the pathological specimens of a&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients treated with CRT for local or locally advanced rectal&#xD;
      cancer, in the early-2000s, two clinical issues arose: firstly, if pCR could be predicted&#xD;
      after CRT with clinical, radiological, or endoscopic restaging assessment thus defining&#xD;
      clinical complete response (cCR); and secondly if patients with cCR should necessarily&#xD;
      undergo radical surgery to achieve cure at the cost of morbidity, mortality, and functional&#xD;
      consequences associated with radical rectal surgery. Consequently, an increasing number of&#xD;
      reports suggested that non-operative management (NOM), consisting of close surveillance of&#xD;
      patients with cCR, could be an acceptable alternative to rectal surgery (proctectomy). Led by&#xD;
      small prospective series published since the late 90's by Habr-Gama and colleagues, several&#xD;
      small international series have reported similar oncologic outcomes in cCR patients followed&#xD;
      by close active surveillance (the so-called watch-and-wait (W&amp;W) or NOM approach) compared to&#xD;
      those treated with radical surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 2011 and 2013 a NOM approach was carried out in 31 patients achieving cCR out of 259&#xD;
      (12%). In their analysis, a further 98 patients, selected from a United Kingdom regional&#xD;
      registry, similarly managed from 2005 to 2015, were added to the NOM group (129 patients).&#xD;
      Overall Survival and Disease Free Survival rates resulted at least comparable to that of&#xD;
      patients treated with standard surgery following neo-adjuvant CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, these small single institution pilot studies have been conducted enrolling&#xD;
      small cohorts of patients with less than 500 patients having been evaluated worldwide. A high&#xD;
      variability in stage at diagnoses, local recurrence rate, distant recurrence rate (0-60% and&#xD;
      0-17%, respectively) and type and outcome of salvage therapy (0 to 100%) have been reported&#xD;
      and no reliable data on long term outcomes are available. Based on these limitations, the NOM&#xD;
      of rectal cancer deserves consideration within purposely designed clinical trials.&#xD;
