      The CortiCom system consists of 510(k)-cleared components: platinum PMT subdural cortical&#xD;
      electrode grids, a Blackrock Microsystems patient pedestal, and an external NeuroPort Neural&#xD;
      Signal Processor. Up to two grids will be implanted in the brain, for a total channel count&#xD;
      of up to 128 channels, for six months. In each participant, the grid(s) will be implanted&#xD;
      over areas of cortex that encode speech and upper extremity movement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The successful adoption of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) as assistive technologies (ATs)&#xD;
      for disabled populations depends on the ability to elicit rapid, intuitive, and reliable&#xD;
      control signals. To date, it is not known which sources of neural information provide the&#xD;
      most natural and efficient means of control. This study will directly assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      two sources of neural control signals, speech and motor cortex, for BCI control of software&#xD;
      and devices using investigators' Cortical Communication (CortiCom) system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CortiCom system consists of 510(k)-cleared components: platinum PMT subdural cortical&#xD;
      electrode grids, a Blackrock Microsystems patient pedestal, and an external NeuroPort Neural&#xD;
      Signal Processor. Up to two grids will be implanted in the brain, for a total channel count&#xD;
      of up to 128 channels, for six months. In each participant, the grid(s) will be implanted&#xD;
      over areas of cortex that encode speech and upper extremity movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators' study will be the first to investigate the efficiency and intuitiveness of two&#xD;
      contrasting neural control strategies for BCI: Motor imagery and speech. As the first study&#xD;
      to chronically and simultaneously record from human speech and motor regions, this study&#xD;
      seeks to achieve the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  demonstrate the ability to decode intended upper extremity movements using information&#xD;
           decoded from primary motor cortex arm/hand area;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  demonstrate the ability to decode intended speech from articulatory speech cortex; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine the most effective and intuitive user strategies (e.g. imagined speech or&#xD;
           imagined movement) and optimal neural sources for brain-computer interactions,&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient populations targeted in this study are amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),&#xD;
      brainstem stroke, locked-in syndrome (LIS), and tetraplegia. Individuals within these&#xD;
      populations may have normal cortical function and cognition while suffering from motor or&#xD;
      combined speech and motor deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on research by colleagues, as well as investigators' own experience working with&#xD;
      participants affected by epilepsy implanted with high density electrocorticographic grids,&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that long-term recording of neural activity from the targeted&#xD;
      cortical areas may provide a new communication channel for these clinical populations. The&#xD;
      utilization of high-channel-count (up to 128 channel) ECoG grids, in combination with&#xD;
      simultaneous coverage of speech and motor cortex, will enable investigations into the&#xD;
      performance of speech-mediated and motor-mediated control efficacy as applied to a variety of&#xD;
      end effectors, such as computers, tablets, headsets for virtual or augmented reality, smart&#xD;
      lights, televisions, and assistive technologies. Additionally, eye-tracking may be utilized&#xD;
      in combination with neural commands to improve target selection performance and ease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this study, investigators will assess the performance of speech- and motor-mediated&#xD;
      control using chronic, high-channel count ECoG grid neural implants in pursuit of a&#xD;
      high-performing, clinically beneficial BCI assistive technology.&#xD;

    <description>This study outcome will be considered successful if the device is not explanted during the 26-week period of the study. Explantation of the device prior to the completion of the 26-week period implies that the device is putting the subject at risk (e.g. through a serious infection at the implantation site) and therefore must be removed.</description>
