  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to evaluate the 2-year progression free survival rate of elderly&#xD;
      patients with primary CNS lymphoma followed by combination of rituximab and methotrexate&#xD;
      followed by rituximab and cytarabine.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As described, standard therapy for patients with primary CNS lymphoma is not based on a high&#xD;
      level of evidence yet, and studies in elderly patients with this disease are very limited.&#xD;
      Based on the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database, it is estimated that about 100 ~ 150&#xD;
      cases of primary central nervous system lymphoma are diagnosed per year in Korea, but there&#xD;
      is no analysis through prospective studies. As described previously, MTX monotherapy in&#xD;
      elderly patients is relatively safe and does not reduce clinical utility. Although the&#xD;
      autologous therapy may consider autologous stem cell transplantation, it is difficult to&#xD;
      apply in elderly patients. Brain radiation therapy is not a primary consideration because it&#xD;
      may cause neurological sequelae, especially in elderly patients. High-dose cytarabine is a&#xD;
      safely administered drug that has been used extensively in clinical studies involving the&#xD;
      treatment of elderly patients.Rituximab has not been studied prospectively for medications,&#xD;
      doses, and intervals that are expected to play a role in patients with primary CNS lymphoma,&#xD;
      as described above, and may be caused by reducing the number of cytotoxic anticancer drugs in&#xD;
      elderly patients And to reduce the treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the authors propose a two-phase study in which R-A induction therapy is performed&#xD;
      after R-M induction therapy in elderly patients with primary CNS lymphoma.&#xD;
