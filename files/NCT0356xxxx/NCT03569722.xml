      EpxCogScreen is a phone-based intervention to administer the Rapid Cognitive Screen, a&#xD;
      validated screening tool for dementia, over SMS text messaging. The results of the screen are&#xD;
      sent to the physician automatically, which allows physicians to monitor their patients and&#xD;
      gives them the ability to respond rapidly to any concerns of cognitive decline. In this&#xD;
      study, patients' at-home RCS scores done by EpxCogScreen will be compared to their in-clinic&#xD;
      RCS scores, and to clinical diagnosis of dementia (where available), to investigate the&#xD;
      validity of EpxCogScreen.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Telemedicine is a modern field of clinical medicine that incorporates telecommunication and&#xD;
      information technology to diagnose and manage health care remotely. Interventions range from&#xD;
      telephone reminders to remote physician consultation by video conference. Simple technology&#xD;
      such as telephones and SMS texting are ubiquitous forms of communication that have the&#xD;
      potential to increase the frequency of physician-patient contact. Use of SMS messaging, for&#xD;
      example, may help to improve patient adherence, promote education and engagement, allow&#xD;
      real-time collection of critical biometric and clinical data over time, and bridge the gap&#xD;
      between recognizing adverse events and actual disease management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One geriatric syndrome that may benefit from early detection is dementia. Dementia is&#xD;
      characterized by impairments in cognitive function, such as memory, comprehension,&#xD;
      visual-spatial orientation, language, and/or judgement. The most common form of dementia is&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease, but vascular dementia and Lewy-body dementia can also cause cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. It is estimated that 47.5 million people are affected with dementia worldwide and&#xD;
      it is the most common form of disability in the geriatric population over the age of 65,&#xD;
      affecting 1 in 9 people in that population [van der Linde, et al., 2016]. A formal diagnosis&#xD;
      for Alzheimer's relies primarily on clinical evaluation by a clinician (e.g., neurologist,&#xD;
      psychiatrist), usually in conjunction with results from neuropsychological testing and/or&#xD;
      informant reports re patients' memory and thinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2011, the Affordable Care Act added routine cognitive screening as a component of the&#xD;
      Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, but did not recommend a universal screening tool [Cordell et&#xD;
      al., 2012]. This initiative was supported by many public organizations, including the&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Association. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) currently does&#xD;
      not recommend universal cognitive screening for older adults [Lin et al., 2013]. Nonetheless,&#xD;
      there may be benefits to case finding among older adults patients through the use of&#xD;
      screening measures. For example, early intervention has been shown to delay placement into&#xD;
      nursing homes, empower patients to be more involved with their care plan, and allow&#xD;
      physicians to identify and manage comorbidities such as depression, malnutrition, and falls&#xD;
      more effectively [Dubois et al., 2016; Weimer et al., 2009]. Delayed admission into nursing&#xD;
      homes and fewer hospitalizations are associated with decreased healthcare costs for patients,&#xD;
      their families, and the healthcare system [Weimer et al., 2009]. It also has been reported&#xD;
      that a lot of Alzheimer's patients are undiagnosed, in part, because screening has not yet&#xD;
      reached standard-of-practice in geriatric and primary care clinics [Dubois et al., 2016].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare professionals may not be able to regularly screen for cognitive dysfunction due to&#xD;
      time constraints in clinical practice. Typical neuropsychological tests for cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction, such as the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), are administered in the physician's&#xD;
      office and can take 7 to 15 minutes to complete. The Rapid Cognitive Screen (RCS) is a 3-item&#xD;
      screening tool that takes less than 5 minutes to complete. This screen has exhibited good&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity in detecting both mild cognitive impairment and dementia in&#xD;
      patients over the age of 65 [Malmstrom et al., 2015]. EpxCogScreen utilizes the RCS to create&#xD;
      a phone-based screen for cognitive dysfunction that can be done in-home when administered by&#xD;
      a caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the RCS will be administered in a healthcare clinic using standard procedures,&#xD;
      and at home using a telemedicine (text-based) format called EpxCogScreen. Patients-caregiver&#xD;
      dyads will be recruited from a geriatric medicine clinic at an academic medical health&#xD;
      center. A healthcare professional will administer the RCS to a patient in the clinic, one&#xD;
      month subsequent to this, a caregiver will administer the RCS to patients in-home via&#xD;
      EpxCogScreen using SMS messaging on a smartphone. Each caregiver will be given the option to&#xD;
      receive RCS administration instructions via text, or to use directions from a handout that&#xD;
      the caregiver received while in clinic. Patient responses will be recorded through text.&#xD;
      Physicians will be notified immediately through EpxCogScreen system if a patients in-home RCS&#xD;
      score is 3 or more points lower than their RCS score from the previous month's healthcare&#xD;
      clinic visit. Individuals will have the ability to opt out of the study electronically via&#xD;
      text and phone at any point during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association of in-home RCS scores with the clinic RCS scores and with the clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of cognitive dysfunction in medical records will be investigated in this study.&#xD;
      Data analysis will evaluate the association of RCS components (recall, clock drawing,&#xD;
      insight) and total scores for in-home versus clinic measurements; and the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of the in-home, SMS text-based RCS will be determined by comparison to clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of cognitive dysfunction from chart review, and by comparison to RCS clinic&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
