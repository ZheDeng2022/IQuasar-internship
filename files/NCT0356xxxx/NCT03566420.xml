      Scientific background ( Statement of the problem) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child abuse is a worldwide problem facing millions of children annually regardless their&#xD;
      socio-economic level and culture, it affects the child's physical, mental health, well-being&#xD;
      and development through his life (WHO, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization stated that 23% of children worldwide were physically abused in&#xD;
      2014 (WHO, 2014). In Egypt, children face different types of abuse, the 2014 Demographic&#xD;
      Health Survey (DHS) shows that 93% of children aged 1 to 14 years old have been exposed to&#xD;
      violent disciplinary practices, including psychological aggression and/or physical punishment&#xD;
      (UNICEF Egypt, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusively dentists are in strategic position to detect signs of child abuse as 50-70% of&#xD;
      reported physical child abuse cases include head and neck trauma and 25% of physical abuse&#xD;
      injuries occur in or around the mouth. In addition, dentists can notice the characteristic&#xD;
      properties of the family because they have a continued relationship with pediatric patients&#xD;
      and their families (Shannon et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for carrying out this study As published data about Knowledge, personal views and&#xD;
      experiences of dentists toward physical child abuse in Egypt is sparse. This study will be&#xD;
      conducted to cover this point among a group of dental interns in Egypt and highlight their&#xD;
      role in detecting and reporting physical child abuse cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to the practitioners&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase the awareness of pediatric dentists about child abuse and highlight their role&#xD;
           in detecting and reporting physical abuse cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge about physical signs of abuse and how to act with these cases will give the&#xD;
           dentists confidence in reporting decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discovering the main causes of dentists' hesitation in reporting diagnosed physical&#xD;
           child abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to the patient and population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As 50-70% of reported physical abuse cases occur in the head and neck area (Shannon et&#xD;
           al., 2016), so the dentist may be the first person to detect the physical abuse toward a&#xD;
           child and help in protecting him from repeated injuries by his reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asking the parents and the children about the physical signs that the dentist suspects&#xD;
           may make the parent fear from reporting and stop his act.&#xD;

      Review of literature :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Databases and websites as PubMed, Google were searched for relevant literature in English&#xD;
      until October 2017 with key words &quot;Child abuse, Child maltreatment, Physical child abuse,&#xD;
      Violence against children, Dentists, pediatric dentists&quot; Sonbol et al., 2011 conducted a&#xD;
      study to assess Knowledge, educational experiences and attitudes towards child abuse amongst&#xD;
      Jordanian dentists, using structured self-administered questionnaire. The target population&#xD;
      was all dentists registered in the Jordanian Dental Association Council (general dentists and&#xD;
      specialists) , the respondents were 256, 34% of them said that they had formal training in&#xD;
      recognizing and reporting child abuse, and 42% had continuing education training on the&#xD;
      topic, 50% of the dentists suspected a case of child abuse in the past 5 years, but only 12%&#xD;
      reported their suspicions. The main reasons for not reporting suspicions of abuse were fear&#xD;
      from anger of parents (43%), uncertainty about diagnosis (41%) and uncertainty about referral&#xD;
      procedures (41%). Those dentists who had formal training in dental school and&#xD;
      post-qualiﬁcation courses in child abuse were signiﬁcantly more likely to report suspicions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sousa et al., 2011 conducted a study to assess the attitudes and perceptions of dentists&#xD;
      regarding child abuse, and to investigate professional characteristics associated with the&#xD;
      identification of suspected child abuse. A self-administered questionnaire was sent to the&#xD;
      276 dentists (general dentists and specialists) in Pelotas, Brazil with response rate 68%.&#xD;
      Most dentists (85.7%) had never suspected child abuse cases. Among those who suspected, 76.0%&#xD;
      didn't report the cases to authorities. No differences were observed between sexes, years of&#xD;
      graduation, types of licenses, and the frequency at which children were treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harsimran et al., 2015 conducted a cross-sectional survey to general dentists in Moradabad&#xD;
      city in India to assess their knowledge and attitude regarding child abuse and to identify&#xD;
      the barriers in reporting these cases using self-administered questionnaire sent by mail to&#xD;
      120 of them the response rate was 97%. Questions pertaining to knowledge of dentists showed&#xD;
      that nearly 89.7% of them were able to distinguish between accidental injury and physical&#xD;
      abuse. The rate of detecting cases of child abuse by respondents was (60%), Lack of knowledge&#xD;
      about dentist's role in reporting child abuse accounted to 55% in the reasons for hesitancy&#xD;
      to report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rodrigues et al., 2015 conducted a systematic review to assess the perception, knowledge and&#xD;
      attitude of dentists towards the detection and management of domestic violence against&#xD;
      children (DVAC) cases. A systematic search was performed in 6 databases: PubMed,&#xD;
      ScienceDirect, LILACS, SciELO, GoogleScholar, and OpenGrey. No restriction of language, time,&#xD;
      and publication status was considered. The search resulted in 1.024 articles, of which 18 fit&#xD;
      the eligibility criteria. The knowledge for detecting cases of DVAC obtained during the under&#xD;
      graduation course was classified by the dentists (in 39% of the articles) as &quot;insufficient&quot;.&#xD;
      When suspecting of cases involving domestic violence, most of the dentists (in 77.75% of the&#xD;
      articles) considered reporting to the competent authorities. However, the dentists were not&#xD;
      sure about who these authorities are (in 31.25% of the articles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mogaddam et al., 2016 conducted a study to assess Knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of&#xD;
      dentists regarding physical child abuse in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the target populations for&#xD;
      this study were pediatric dentists, pediatric dentistry residents, and dental interns&#xD;
      practicing in all of the dental schools in Jeddah. 270 self-administered questionnaires were&#xD;
      distributed; the response rate was 77%. The participants showed insufficient knowledge of the&#xD;
      signs and symptoms of child physical abuse, actions that should be taken in suspected cases,&#xD;
      circumstances in which to report such cases, and the legal authorities to which they should&#xD;
      be reported. The attitudes of participants towards detecting and reporting cases were&#xD;
      generally positive. Only 11% of the participants had suspected a case of child abuse, and&#xD;
      only 3% of them reported it. The main causes of under-reporting were lack of knowledge about&#xD;
      referral procedures and fear of anger from family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess knowledge, personal views and experiences of a group of dental interns toward physical&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires, Appendix 1 will be distributed to the dental interns and give them 30&#xD;
           minutes to answer it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All questionnaires will be collected at the same day, to prevent any of the participants&#xD;
           to search for the answers of questions that related to their knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants during answering the questionnaire are not allowed to ask their colleagues,&#xD;
           to ensure accuracy of the answers of knowledge questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The researcher is not allowed to help the participant in answering the questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants are allowed to ask the researcher any question either to clarify any part&#xD;
           of the questions or anything about the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The researcher will deal with the participant personally, so there is no risk of the&#xD;
           same dentist to complete more than one questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the participants finish answering the questionnaires, it will be collected and&#xD;
           subjected to statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be collected during 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are going to apply a convenient consecutive sampling; it will include all Dental interns&#xD;
      at Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University. Dental interns will be invited to complete the&#xD;
      questionnaire. All number of interns will be reported, response rate will be calculated and&#xD;
      no attempt is made to follow up with dental interns who were absent in the day of the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scores will be calculated according to the options selected by the intern dentists. The data&#xD;
      will be analyzed using the statistical analysis software SPSS version 20. The individual&#xD;
      scores will be summed up to yield a total score. Descriptive statistics will be calculated as&#xD;
      mean scores, standard deviation and frequency distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference of the oral health knowledge, attitude and practice between different&#xD;
      categories will be assessed by Student's t-test or ANOVA according to the number of&#xD;
      categories. The difference between male and female doctors will be assessed by student's&#xD;
      t-test. P value &lt; 0.05 will considered significant, All test will be 2 tails.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration&#xD;
