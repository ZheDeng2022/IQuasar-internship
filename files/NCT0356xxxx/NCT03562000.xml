  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After the admission in ICU, most patients have to be intubated in order to control haematosis&#xD;
      in case of acute respiratory failure, to reduce the metabolic crisis during severe&#xD;
      haemodynamic shock, or to protect upper airways in case of impairment of consciousness. After&#xD;
      the initial phase of etiological treatment, as soon as the patients no more required the&#xD;
      intubation, weanibility has to be checked (thanks to a weaning trial with or without pressure&#xD;
      support) before the separation attempt is decided on an evaluation of the overall&#xD;
      extubability, based in particular on a subjective assessment of cough strength. The cases of&#xD;
      re-intubation can be related to several factors such as: i) a ventilatory insufficiency&#xD;
      indicating an imbalance between the muscular pomp function and the mechanical constraint of&#xD;
      the chest; ii) an acute cardiogenic oedema; iii) an obstruction of the superior airways,&#xD;
      possibly due to an imbalance between the bronchial overload and the cough efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preventing extubation failure should avoid exposing such patients to an over-risk of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality due to the consequences of a prolonged invasive ventilation. This&#xD;
      prevention can be implemented thanks to an early detection of the patients the most at risk&#xD;
      and then a coherent intervention to manage of each risk factor involved. For example, the&#xD;
      inspiratory insufficiency can be fixed by the use of Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV), as&#xD;
      proposed for patients developing a final hypercapnia at the end of the weanibility test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have been conducted to improve the prediction of extubation failure. As this&#xD;
      is notably influenced by the cough efficacy before extubation, it has been proposed to assess&#xD;
      the peak flow expiratory during voluntary cough. The Cough Peak Flow could for example&#xD;
      replaced some semi-quantitative measures of cough strength associated to a low&#xD;
      reproducibility. The most validated threshold for a weak cough is &lt; 60 L/min and it has&#xD;
      recently been demonstrated that it remained valuable when directly assessed using the&#xD;
      built-in ventilator flow-meter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the meantime, new devices of mechanical cough assistance have been developed and are&#xD;
      frequently used for patients presenting a chronic neuro-muscular disease affecting their&#xD;
      ability to spontaneously clear their airways from an inappropriate bronchial overload.&#xD;
      However, the interest of such devices for a systematic use after extubation has not been&#xD;
      validated with a sufficient level of evidence to be recommended, in particular because of the&#xD;
      bias of the single randomised monocentric study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study consists in demonstrating in an open multicentre randomised&#xD;
      study (focused on the patients with an objective low cough strength) the superiority of a&#xD;
      systematic strategy combining mechanical cough assistance and non-invasive ventilation on&#xD;
      standard care (manual post-extubation physiotherapy and NIV for restrictive indications) to&#xD;
      reduce the re-intubation rate at 48h.&#xD;

A mechanical cough assistance technic using the Cough Assist device (Model E70® by Philips Respironics, Carlsbad, CA, USA) before extubation then after extubation then 3 times a day (with possible additional treatment on demand) during 7 days maximum (with a possible cessation if the patient has strictly no bronchial overload during three consecutive physiotherapy sessions)&#xD;
