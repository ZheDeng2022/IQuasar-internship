  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial of PrEP@Home, a home care system for Human&#xD;
      Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP). Individuals entering into PrEP&#xD;
      care at an initial in-person study visit will be randomized to the PrEP@Home system for&#xD;
      home-based PrEP care follow-up visits or to the control standard of care for clinic-based&#xD;
      follow-up visits. The primary aim of this study is to assess protective levels of PrEP&#xD;
      medication for the intervention arm compared to the control arm.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical guidance calls for quarterly follow-up visits for individuals taking PrEP. Yet these&#xD;
      visits impose burdens on the healthcare system and on patients that could hinder persistence&#xD;
      of patients in PrEP care. Preliminary data indicate that a home-based care system for PrEP is&#xD;
      feasible, acceptable, and may increase patient willingness to remain in care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study explores the effect of a home-based PrEP support system on maintenance in PrEP&#xD;
      care. The study will enroll 396 participants into a stratified randomized, controlled trial&#xD;
      comparing the PrEP@Home intervention arm to the standard of care control arm. The study seeks&#xD;
      to explore intervention performance among highly impacted groups, and therefore will target a&#xD;
      sample that is 50% Black and 50% aged 18-34 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals in the intervention and control arms will have a baseline study visit, in which&#xD;
      patients will be prescribed PrEP. Participants randomized to the intervention arm will&#xD;
      receive home care for PrEP at months 3, 6, 9, and 12. Home care will include a mailed package&#xD;
      with materials for HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI)/creatinine specimen&#xD;
      self-collection, materials for return shipping, and a link to an electronic, self-report&#xD;
      behavioral assessment. Home care will also include access to the intervention version of the&#xD;
      study app to facilitate patient-provider and patient-system interactions. Study clinicians&#xD;
      will monitor patients in home care, and renew prescriptions as indicated. Control arm&#xD;
      participants will be linked to a local PrEP provider, where they will be seen for quarterly&#xD;
      clinic visits per standard of care. Control participants will have access to the control&#xD;
      version of the study app that contains only research elements pertinent to their&#xD;
      participation in the control arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At months 6 and 12, all participants will be mailed materials for dried blood spot (DBS)&#xD;
      self-collection to allow for measurement of tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) levels. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is a comparison of the levels of TFV-DP, a measure that provides information&#xD;
      regarding protective levels of PrEP, for the intervention relative to the control arm.&#xD;

    <description>Measurement of TFV-DP levels will be conducted for participants in both arms using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry methods on self-collected DBS samples. TFV-DP level can be translated to an interpretation that indicates mean number of days per week PrEP is ingested over a time period of approximately 1-month preceding specimen collection. The cutpoint used for the primary outcome measure will be TFV-DP levels considered to be a surrogate for substantial protection: &gt;700 femtomole per blood spot (fmol/punch), a level indicating &gt;4 doses/wk.</description>

    <description>The PrEP@Home system includes a home care kit mailed quarterly to participants. The kit includes components for self-collection of urine, rectal swab, pharyngeal swab and microtube blood collection, and materials for return shipping. Biological tests routinely performed at PrEP follow-up visits will be conducted on the specimens. At months 6 and 12, the kit will include materials to assess for protective levels of TFV-DP.&#xD;
The system includes a study app through which participants may track the mailing of home testing kits, access quarterly surveys, and communicate with study clinicians. The surveys will include domains that physicians assess at PrEP care quarterly follow-up visits (sexual risk, illicit substance use, PrEP adherence, side effects).&#xD;
Lab and survey results will be sent to study clinicians and if the results show no contraindications for PrEP continuation, the clinician may renew a participant's PrEP prescription. Telemedicine visits will be scheduled as necessary.</description>
