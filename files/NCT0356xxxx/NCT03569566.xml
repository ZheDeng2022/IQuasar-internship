  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have investigated determinant factors for endurance performance among&#xD;
      different athletes, untrained individuals and patients focusing on the impact of age, genes&#xD;
      and training intensity. A further step in this research will be to investigate the impact of&#xD;
      age, genes, training intensity and history of tick-bourne disease on endurance performance in&#xD;
      elite endurance athletes. We are planning a project with a two-step model. In step one we&#xD;
      will, in a cross-sectional study design, investigate potential relationships between age,&#xD;
      training intensity, training volume, genes, exosomes and history of tick-bourne disease and&#xD;
      physiological variables and endurance performance. In step two we will investigate&#xD;
      differences in training adaptation by observing and monitoring all training done by the&#xD;
      participants during a 6-months period. The participants will be tested for several&#xD;
      physiological variables before, after 3- months and after this period. We will also&#xD;
      investigate the impact of age, training intensity, training volume, genes and history of&#xD;
      tick-bourne disease on the results from the physiological tests and performance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be designed in a two-step model. In the first step, we will investigate&#xD;
      potential relationships between age, genes, exosomes, miRNA, training intensity, and history&#xD;
      of tick-borne disease, and physiological laboratory-tests and performance in a roller-skiing&#xD;
      performance test. This study will have a cross-sectional design. In the second step we will&#xD;
      examine potential differences in training adaptations to a 6-months observation of&#xD;
      self-selected training. We then will categorize the athletes into three groups, based on&#xD;
      training volume and training intensity. We will then investigate possible relationships&#xD;
      between training volume and training intensity and physiological variables, genes, age and&#xD;
      possible history of tick-bourne disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEP 1: Cross-sectional study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the aim of the study is to investigate effects of age, genes, exosomes, training and&#xD;
      history of tick-borne disease on training adaptations and endurance performance in elite&#xD;
      endurance athletes, we will recruit active cross-country skiers from 16 - 50 years. These&#xD;
      athletes have shown to have some of the highest aerobic capacities in the world (Ingjer,&#xD;
      1991).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both males and females will be included for participation in this project, and we will try to&#xD;
      include equal amount of both sexes. The athletes will be recruited from relevant,&#xD;
      cross-country skiing milieus in Southeast Norway by open invitation and advertisement.&#xD;
      Invited athletes must sign a declaration for participation and a declaration of health&#xD;
      status, before participation. In the declaration for participation, the athletes will be&#xD;
      informed briefly about the background of this project, which tests they are going to take,&#xD;
      and how these tests will be performed and how the results are being contained and presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be as descriptive statistics, and simple and multiple regressions-&#xD;
      and correlation analysis in the cross-sectional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEP 2: 6-months training observation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment routines, inclusion- and exclusion criteria will be the same as in STEP 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The athletes will first undergo a week of testing and registration (like STEP 1) at the end&#xD;
      of the competitive season. During the 6-months period, the athletes will register all normal&#xD;
      training in training diaries, and most importantly by use of heart rate measures. The&#xD;
      researchers will not assign the participants to a certain training program or intervention,&#xD;
      but just observe and register their training already planned out by themselves and/or their&#xD;
      trainer(s). We will then examine the effects of this training on physiological variables and&#xD;
      cross-country skiing performance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first tests will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physiological determinants as described in Støren et al. (2012; 2013; 2014) and Sunde et&#xD;
           al. (in progress)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood samples for the analyze of genes, types of exosomes and its cargo, miRNA and&#xD;
           history of tick-borne disease The same tests will be used after 3 months into the&#xD;
           training period, and post observation. Tests and test procedures will be specified&#xD;
           later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be as descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing as General Linear&#xD;
      Models ANOVA (repeated measurements), and simple- and multiple regressions- and correlation&#xD;
      analysis to examine increase or decrease in relation to age, gender, physical capacity and&#xD;
      genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests and test procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same test procedures will be followed in both STEP 1 and STEP 2 of the project, and pre-,&#xD;
      mid- and post-test. All tests will be executed in two following days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registration of body weight, body height and BMI, and blood samples for exosomes, genes&#xD;
           and tick-borne disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximal jump tests (SJ, CMJ and CMJas)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VO2max test in running, followed by blood samples for exosomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance field-test in roller skiing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LT-test and energy cost of double poling (Cp)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VO2peak in double poling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples for exosomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1RM half-squat, followed by blood samples for exosomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1RM pull down&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAY 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the athletes arrives, body weight and body height will be measured. Blood samples will&#xD;
      be taken for analysis of exosomes, genes and tick-borne disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples and genetic analysis To examine the effects of exosomes, genes and history of&#xD;
      tick-borne disease on training adaptation and endurance performance among elite endurance&#xD;
      athletes, it will be necessary to gather blood samples for examination of genetic variation,&#xD;
      exosome cargo, exosome content and antibodies for tick-borne diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The field, Exercise Genomics, explore the variation in single candidate genes relation to&#xD;
      physiological responses to exercise in a population. Therefore, it is relevant to apply&#xD;
      research on genes relation to training adaptations and human endurance performance, but also&#xD;
      in relation to health-related physical activity. We also want to analyze volume and types of&#xD;
      exosomes in response to training, with a focus on content of miRNA, proteins and/or DNA as&#xD;
      biological markers for physiological training response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research project we need blood samples from recruited cross-country skiers to examine&#xD;
      genetic variations, which have been related to cause an effect on physiological responses&#xD;
      like fat oxidation, glucose utilization, insulin sensitivity, muscle hypertrophy, VO2max and&#xD;
      blood pressure. The exosomes will be isolated from plasma by an ultracentrifugation method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for analysis of biological markers We want blood samples (EDTA-blood) from all&#xD;
      participants. Blood samples will be taken in relation to the training interventions, and will&#xD;
      be used for DNA isolation, DNA analysis, exosome isolation from plasma and isolation of&#xD;
      antibodies from plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jumping variables (SJ, CMJ, CMJas):&#xD;
&#xD;
      After arrival and registration of body weight and body height, the athletes will be&#xD;
      instructed to perform a 10-minutes self-conducted warm-up before testing. For measuring jump&#xD;
      height, we will use a force plate and the Muscle Lab v.2 system (Ergotest Technology,&#xD;
      Langesund, Norway) The first jump procedure will be by measuring squat jump (SJ) height. The&#xD;
      subjects' starts with a 90° knee angle, with a forward leaned position and with their hands&#xD;
      attached to the hips. The subjects' will then jump with maximal force, without any counter&#xD;
      movement in the knees or hips. The subjects perform minimum three and maximum six jump with&#xD;
      maximal force, where the highest jump will be registered as the result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this, the subjects will perform the second jumping procedure, who will be the&#xD;
      counter-movement jump (CMJ). The athletes start in an upright position with their hands&#xD;
      attached to the hips. They will thereafter perform a maximal jump with plyometric movement.&#xD;
      The subjects perform minimum three and maximum six jump with maximal force, where the highest&#xD;
      jump will be registered as the result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last jump procedure is the counter movement jump with arm movement. The subjects starts&#xD;
      in the position like CMJ, but are now allowed to use the arms. They will be instructed to&#xD;
      perform a jump with maximal force. The subjects perform minimum three and maximum six jump&#xD;
      with maximal force, where the highest jump will be registered as the result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects' are given three minutes rest between each jumping procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VO2max in running:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test will be performed on a motorized Woodway PPS55-treadmill (Waukesha, WI, USA),&#xD;
      calibrated for elevation and speed. A Cortex MetaLyzer II (Cortex Biophysik GmbH, Leipzig,&#xD;
      Germany) measures VO2 every 10 s through the test. The subjects' will be instructed to&#xD;
      perform a 10-minutes self-conducted warm-up before testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test starts at 8 - 12 km/h, and a 6% elevation. A 1% elevation increase will be performed&#xD;
      up to 8%. From there, only speed increases with 0,5 km/h every 30 second until voluntary&#xD;
      exhaustion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contra indications during testing will end the test. The participants are allowed to stop the&#xD;
      test at any given time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate if VO2max is reached, we will use the following criteria: flattening of the&#xD;
      O2-curve, RER &gt; 1.05, 3 - 5 beats under the athlete's maximal heart rate (HRmax), Borg scale&#xD;
      &gt; 16 and blood lactate levels &gt; 8.0 mmol/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time-trial performance test on roller skies The participants will be instructed to perform a&#xD;
      minimum 15 minutes self-conducted warm-up before test. They will use their own roller-skiing&#xD;
      equipment during this test. Before testing, the athletes will be informed to use Swenor&#xD;
      2-wheels, or equal, during this test to prevent any differences in rolling resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this test, the athletes participate in randomly assigned pairs, with a 1-minute start&#xD;
      interval between subjects. They will perform six laps of 940 meters, as fast as they can,&#xD;
      using only the double-poling technique. No drafting is allowed. Stopwatches register&#xD;
      performance time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total time used in this time-trial will be used as result from this test. Heart rate will&#xD;
      be monitored by the athletes private watches, and registered immediately after finish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAY 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactate threshold (LT) og cost of poling (Cp) during double-poling The test will be performed&#xD;
      on a Rodby RL2500E - treadmill with rubber belts (Rodby Innovation, Vänge, Sweden), special&#xD;
      made for double poling. The participants will perform a minimum 10 minutes self-conducted&#xD;
      warm-up before testing, and for familiarization to the treadmill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactate, VO2 and RER will be measured during several 4-minute submaximal work periods&#xD;
      (minimum 3 and maximum 6) at 4% inclination. All the athletes will use the same roller-skies,&#xD;
      but they will use their own poles and shoes during the test. The procedure for this test will&#xD;
      be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Work period 1: The workload will represent approximately 60% HRmax. The speed of the&#xD;
           treadmill will be set to 11.5 km/h and 6 - 7 km/h for males and females respectively,&#xD;
           and will be held constant through the 4-minute work period. After 4 minutes, the&#xD;
           treadmill stops and lactate measuring will be proceeded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Work period 2, 3 and 4 (eventually 5 and 6): The speed will increase progressively&#xD;
           (evaluated by research-personal) through the work periods, until blood lactate exceeds&#xD;
           estimated LT-values (LT = warm-up lactate value (taken after the first work period) +&#xD;
           2,3 mmol/l).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HR and VO2 will be measured every 20 second from the 3.00 minute point in every work&#xD;
           period (3.00 / 3.20 / 3.40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood lactate is measured by a Lactate Scout+ apparatus (Senslab, EKF Diagnostics, Germany),&#xD;
      which is based on whole blood analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contra indications during testing will end the test. The participants are allowed to stop the&#xD;
      test at any given time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registration of VO2 during the work periods are later used for calculations of Cp at 70%&#xD;
      Vo2max.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VO2peak double poling The test will be performed at least 5 minutes after the LT-test on the&#xD;
      same treadmill specialized for double poling. All the athletes will use the same&#xD;
      roller-skies, but they will use their own poles and shoes during the test. VO2, HR and RER&#xD;
      will be measured continuously during this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test will proceed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The speed is set to 7 km/h for both males and females, at a 6 % inclination and is held&#xD;
           constant through the whole test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The speed progressively increase by 1 km/h every minute for males and females, until&#xD;
           exhaustion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three continuously highest VO2 measures will be used for calculation of VO2max. The test&#xD;
      will be followed by registration of blood lactate (as described earlier), Borg scale, RERpeak&#xD;
      and HRpeak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1RM half squat:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this test, a Precor smith-machine (Precore, Woodinville, WA, USA) will be used. The&#xD;
      athletes will be given at least 60 minutes rest between last test, and this test. The&#xD;
      participants will follow a standardized warm-up procedure as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 repetions à 50% 1RM,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 repetions à 60% av 1RM,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 repetions à 70% av 1RM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 repetions à 80% av 1RM. A 3-minute rest period will be given between every work&#xD;
           period. The participants will be instructed to lift with maximal speed from the first&#xD;
           workload, for measuring muscle power. MuscleLab v. 2 (Ergotest Technology, Langesund,&#xD;
           Norway) will measure power during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the standardized warm-up, the workload will increase progressively until 1RM is&#xD;
      reached. In this part of the test, the participants only perform one repetion pr. workload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1RM pull down: A Gym2000 pull-down machine (Gym2000 AS, Vikersund, Norway) will be used for&#xD;
      this test. The protocol for this test is identical to the 1RM half-squat protocol.&#xD;

      Blood samples will be taken, and will be used for the following purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DNA isolation and analysis: DNA genome will be isolated from white blood cells. This DNA&#xD;
           genome will be contained in a biobank - Exercise Genetics. Well-known genetic variations&#xD;
           in genes will be tested showing relevance to training adaptations (ACE, ACTN3 etc.).&#xD;
           Only known polymorphisms will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exosome isolation from plasma: We will isolate exosomes from plasma by the&#xD;
           ultracentrifugation method. We will investigate the volume and specific types of&#xD;
           exosomes, in relation to the training intervention. We also want to examine the&#xD;
           exosome-cargo, like miRNA, protein content, mRNA and DNA content.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isolation of antibodies from plasma: We want to investigate antibodies to examine&#xD;
           potential on-going disease, recently disease or earlier disease of Barbesia, Anaplasma&#xD;
           or other actual tick-borne agens. We also want to isolate DNA from blood and use&#xD;
           real-time PCR for anaplasma and Neo Ehrlichia analysis.&#xD;
