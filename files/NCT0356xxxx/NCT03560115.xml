      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single heel-rise test (SHRT) is a method of assessing the strength and endurance of&#xD;
      plantar-flexors manually. Single heel-rise test also known as calf rise test, is a method of&#xD;
      assessing the strength of plantar-flexor. The test was first done to determine the integrity&#xD;
      of calf muscle. There are few studies which has established the reliability and normative&#xD;
      value of heel-rise test in adults. But till date, there is no documented evidence of&#xD;
      normative value of heel-rise test in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is focused to derive reliability and normative value of single heel-rise test in&#xD;
      children of age group 8-12 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit healthy school-going children of 8-12 years age. Any pathology which&#xD;
      can limit or interfere with the test outcome will be excluded. The samples will be collected&#xD;
      by stratified sampling technique. Procedure of test will be demonstrated prior to the test.&#xD;
      Heel raising and lowering will be performed until child feels fatigue. Test will be performed&#xD;
      on both the lower extremities individually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test will be assessed on both the heel individually. Three sessions will be conducted by the&#xD;
      same rater on same child for intra-rater and test-retest reliability, and another rater will&#xD;
      assess the test on same individual for establishing inter-rater reliability. Normative value&#xD;
      of the test will be determined by deriving the mean of test-values for each age group.&#xD;

      1. Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Plantar flexors play a crucial role in gait cycle, during foot clearance. It assists in&#xD;
           forward propulsion, and is also responsible for maintaining the static and dynamic&#xD;
           balances. Single heel-rise test is a physical examination which evaluates the strength&#xD;
           of plantar-flexors. This study aims to assess the intra-rater and inter-rater&#xD;
           reliability and normative value of single heel-rise test in healthy school-going&#xD;
           children of age group 8-12 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1.Problem Statement: The documented evidences does not have normative value for single&#xD;
           heel-rise test in children. The normative value is provided only for adults. Therefore,&#xD;
           there is an absolute need of deriving normative value for this test in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2.Purpose of the study: The purpose of this study is to derive the normative value of&#xD;
           single-heel rise test along with reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3.Objectives of the study: 1.3.1.To establish inter-rater and intra-rater and&#xD;
           test-retest reliability of single heel-rise test 1.3.2.To derive normative value of&#xD;
           single heel-rise test&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a cross-sectional study. The study protocol has been approved from the&#xD;
      Institutional Ethics Committee of Maharishi Markandeshwar (Deemed to be University).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the anthropometrics of the children will be taken prior to the test which includes&#xD;
      height, weight, calf muscle girth and length. The maximum number of heel-rises will be&#xD;
      performed by the child in single limb stance until maximal exertion will be recorded. The&#xD;
      test will be repeated in standing position on both the sides. For balancing, 2-finger support&#xD;
      on wall will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability testing: For inter-rater, 2 raters will assess on two different sessions on same&#xD;
      day. For intra-rater, same rater will assess the test twice on same day, and after 24 hours&#xD;
      for test-retest reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normative value: The mean of all the test-values for each age group will be normative value&#xD;
      for that particular age group.&#xD;
