  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, non-randomized, non-blinded study designed to collect device data in&#xD;
      patients with permanent His bundle (HB) pacing lead and an existing Abbott permanent&#xD;
      pacemaker, defibrillator, or cardiac resynchronization device. Prospective data collection&#xD;
      includes surface electrocardiograms, intracardiac electrograms, and pacing parameters,&#xD;
      recorded during a patient visit. Additional retrospective data collection includes procedural&#xD;
      data during the HB pacing lead and device implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 200 subjects will participate in this clinical investigation. The clinical&#xD;
      investigation will be conducted at up to 8 centers worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the clinical investigation is expected to be 1 year, including&#xD;
      enrollment and data collection from all subjects.&#xD;
