             or collecting duct carcinoma is acceptable) with radiologic or histologic evidence of&#xD;
             metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with up to one (and only one) anti-VEGF or VEGFR inhibitor (small&#xD;
             molecule or antibody).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors,&#xD;
             version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) criteria.&#xD;

             assessment tool for functional impairment. It can be used to compare effectiveness of&#xD;
             different therapies and to assess the prognosis in individual patients. In most&#xD;
             serious illnesses, the lower the Karnofsky score, the worse the likelihood of&#xD;
             survival.)&#xD;

          -  Most recent systemic therapy or most recent radiation therapy ≥ 2 weeks of first study&#xD;
             drug dose.&#xD;

          -  Systemic corticosteroids greater than the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone or&#xD;
             equivalent alternative steroid (except physiologic dose for adrenal replacement&#xD;
