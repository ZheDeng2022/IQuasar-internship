      Proposal: A randomized controlled feasibility study comparing a multi-modal prehabilitation&#xD;
      protocol to usual care for women undergoing neo-adjuvant therapy for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Study population: Sixty patients who are undergoing curative intent neo-adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy for breast cancer will be randomized to intervention (n=30) or standard care&#xD;
      (n=30) at a single site (Sunnybrook).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: A multi-modal program composed of an exercise prescription that will&#xD;
      progressively increase in intensity and duration towards the current physical activity&#xD;
      guidelines, nutritional counseling, stress counseling, and smoking cessation (as needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Exercises will be instructed and demonstrated by a physiotherapist prior to the&#xD;
      initiation of chemotherapy and will continue up until surgery. Nutritional and stress&#xD;
      counseling, as well as smoking cessation, will be offered at initial consult with&#xD;
      physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Protocol: The prehabilitation program entails a home-based exercise with both&#xD;
      total-body physical exercise and exercises specific to the upper quadrant over the period&#xD;
      between baseline assessment and surgery. The exercise prescription will be provided by a&#xD;
      physiotherapist based upon the baseline assessment and will consist of a goal of 60 minutes&#xD;
      of home-based, unsupervised exercise on 4 days per week, including aerobic and resistance&#xD;
      training. Each session will be individualized and based upon the baseline assessment and&#xD;
      generally include: a 5-minute warm-up, 25 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise (for&#xD;
      example: brisk walking, treadmill, stationary bike) (intensity of 3-6 on the 0-10 Rating of&#xD;
      Perceived Exertion Scale) (attached, Appendix A) and 25 minutes of upper quadrant-specific&#xD;
      training (Appendix B), and a 5-minute cool-down consisting of stretches (Appendix B). The&#xD;
      program introduction will include a description and demonstration of all of the exercises&#xD;
      that will follow the baseline assessment. The participant will have an opportunity to try the&#xD;
      exercises in the presence of the physiotherapist who will provide corrective feedback if&#xD;
      necessary. The physiotherapist will discuss safety precautions (posture, breathing, etc.) and&#xD;
      provide the participant with an exercise manual that describes the exercises in the program&#xD;
      and the safety precautions. To complete the exercises at home, each participant will be&#xD;
      provided with resistance Theraband(s) (red and yellow) required to complete the upper&#xD;
      quadrant exercises that they may keep at the end of the study. Training intensity progression&#xD;
      will occur when the participant can complete the aerobic exercise with mild exertion and/or&#xD;
      when the participant can complete 15 repetitions of a given upper quadrant exercise without&#xD;
      eliciting at least moderate exertion (i.e. 3 to 6 on the Rating of Perceived Exertion scale).&#xD;
      The prehabilitation program will be supported with a manual including institutionally created&#xD;
      postoperative rehabilitation exercises that comprise a significant proportion of the&#xD;
      preoperative exercise prescription. The physiotherapist will communicate with the&#xD;
      participants every 2 weeks to ensure program compliance, support appropriate progression, and&#xD;
      to address any barriers to exercise (including questions about appropriate exercise&#xD;
      completion) that may prevent ongoing participation (see contact with team Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grip Strength: Grip strength is commonly used to assess upper extremity strength in patients&#xD;
      with breast cancer (Sagen 2009) and will be assessed via the &quot;Jamar Hand&quot; dynamometer&#xD;
      according to established protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aerobic Fitness: Aerobic fitness will be measured using the 6-minute walk test (6 Minute Walk&#xD;
      Test). This test is a practical standardized measure of functional capacity and has been&#xD;
      widely used for measuring the submaximal level of functional capacity in cancer patients&#xD;
      (Vardar 2015, Santa Mina 2014, Schmidt 2013). This test will measure the distance that the&#xD;
      patient can walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition counseling: The registered dietitian will provide an initial individualized&#xD;
      nutrition assessment and counseling session. The consultation will be about 60 minutes in&#xD;
      length and can be conducted in person or via telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's nutritional history, assessment of usual intake and weight history will be&#xD;
      reviewed to help identify any nutritional issues/concerns. The session will focus on the&#xD;
      goals of nutrition before and during treatment, provide strategies to help the patient&#xD;
      optimize or enhance the nutritional quality of the diet, maintain a healthy weight and&#xD;
      minimize weight gain and address any nutrition-related questions or concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registered dietitian will follow-up with the patient 4 weeks after the initial&#xD;
      consultation to review the nutrition care goals and outcomes, answer questions re. any&#xD;
      potential nutrition-related side effects from treatment and address any other questions or&#xD;
      concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be encouraged to contact the dietitian as needed during treatment for&#xD;
      on-going support of if any nutrition related questions or concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress counseling: Stress management intervention: Stress management intervention will&#xD;
      consist of a 60-90 minute individual session with a psychiatrist specializing in psychosocial&#xD;
      oncology. The therapy session will be cognitive-behavioral in orientation. The components&#xD;
      will include a psychoeducational module on the stress response to physical symptoms;&#xD;
      problem-solving and coping skills; relaxation techniques; and guided imagery. During the&#xD;
      initial session, participants will be oriented conceptually to four types of interventions&#xD;
      for reducing anxiety and coping with stress: (1) Progressive muscle relaxation; (2)&#xD;
      mindfulness; (3) deep breathing; and (4) imagery/visualization. Each intervention will have&#xD;
      accompanying written materials, which will also contain links to online audio materials. The&#xD;
      additional materials contain written and spoken instructions allowing for self-directed&#xD;
      learning and practice of each of the four stress-reducing interventions. Participants will be&#xD;
      invited to choose one or two of the four strategies to practice with the therapist in the&#xD;
      initial session, and in any subsequent sessions that participants attend. The therapist will&#xD;
      instruct participants to choose one audio file to listen to at each chemotherapy session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional face-to-face 60 minute individual booster sessions will be offered to participants&#xD;
      on a monthly basis until surgery, in order to review problem solving and coping skills,&#xD;
      relaxation techniques, and guided imagery. If patients are found to need a greater frequency&#xD;
      of psychiatric intervention or undergo a psychiatric crisis, or if they require psychotropic&#xD;
      medications at any point during the study, the PI will be informed and a referral will be&#xD;
      made to an alternate psychiatrist (if the patient chooses) at the Odette Cancer Centre who is&#xD;
      not involved in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2 weeks the patients in the intervention (prehabilitation arm) will be asked these&#xD;
      questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each telephone follow-up or email, the frequency of use and acceptability will be assessed&#xD;
      with the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Over the past two weeks, how often did you listen to one of the audio materials? Never&#xD;
      Less than half the days More than half the days Once each day More than once per day&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2a) During your most recent chemotherapy session, did you listen to any of the audio&#xD;
      materials? Yes; No (2b) If no, please explain why _______________&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3) In a general sense, how satisfied are you with the audio materials you have received?&#xD;
      Very satisfied 5; Mostly satisfied 4; Indifferent 3; or mostly dissatisfied 2; Very&#xD;
      dissatisfied 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the prehabilitation sessions, patients will fill in an 'acceptability of&#xD;
      psychotherapy' evaluation (CSQ scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking cessation: If required. Sunnybrook has a comprehensive smoking cessation program in&#xD;
      place. 16% of patients in the Odette Cancer Program are smokers (internal data). For those&#xD;
      patients who identify as a smoker (answered &quot;yes&quot; to the question of &quot;Have you used any forms&#xD;
      of tobacco in the past 6 months?&quot;), a brief smoking cessation intervention will be provided&#xD;
      outlining the benefits of quitting as well as the impact of continued smoking on the&#xD;
      treatments for cancer (chemotherapy, surgery and radiation). These patients will be given&#xD;
      education on the use of nicotine replacement therapy and will be offered a redemption card&#xD;
      for 4 boxes of free nicotine replacement therapy products of their choice and advised to&#xD;
      speak with their pharmacist. Patients will also be encouraged to accept a referral to Smokers&#xD;
      Helpline which provides free smoking cessation counseling (telephone, texting or web-based)&#xD;
      with a Quit Coach.&#xD;
