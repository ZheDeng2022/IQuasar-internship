    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a randomized controlled trial designed to test the effect of the&#xD;
      administration of adjunctive azithromycin in conjunction with standard outpatient treatment&#xD;
      for uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in children aged 6-59 months. Children&#xD;
      presenting to nutritional programs in Burkina Faso who meet eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized to a single dose of oral azithromycin or a 7-day course of amoxicillin (standard&#xD;
      of care) upon admission into the program. All enrolled children will receive ready-to-use&#xD;
      therapeutic foods (RUTF). Enrolled children will be followed at each weekly clinic follow-up&#xD;
      visit up to 8 weeks following admission. Data on anthropometric indicators, vital status, and&#xD;
      adverse events will be collected during follow-up. Nutritional recovery over the 8-week study&#xD;
      period will be compared by arm.&#xD;
