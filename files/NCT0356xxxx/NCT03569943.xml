  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Middle ear surgery is performed in a deep workspace through a narrow approach to the tympanic&#xD;
      cavity, either by the external auditory canal, or by drilling the temporal bone. It uses thin&#xD;
      and long instruments as a delicate and precise gesture on the ossicular chain or manipulation&#xD;
      of very light prostheses is necessary. The results of middle ear procedures relies upon the&#xD;
      surgeon experience and his gesture accuracy. For this reason, a robot-based device designed&#xD;
      to assist the surgeon during middle ear procedure has been build. The goal of the present&#xD;
      protocol is to evaluate the robot in a simple procedure to ensure its safety before using the&#xD;
      device in more complex cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The precision of the robot during transtympanic tube placement will be evaluated. The&#xD;
      following benefits are expected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significantly reduced risk of transtympanic tube on the other side of the eardrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positioning of the transtympanic tube in the desired tympanic quadrant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduces the size of the entry point to prevent tearing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced risk of injury to the external auditory canal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the safety of use of the robot is demonstrated in this protocol, the goal will be to&#xD;
      evaluate it later in more complex surgical gestures in other protocols. The future&#xD;
      application of the robot will be the placement of middle ear implant prosthesis in the&#xD;
      context of the surgery for cholesteatoma, otosclerosis or insertion of cochlear implants.&#xD;

      Description of the population to be studied and justification of its choice:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is going to include a single group of patients presenting a vestibular schwannoma&#xD;
      that will benefit from an removal by translabyrinthine approach with exclusion from the&#xD;
      middle ear under general anesthesia. During this surgery, the tympanic membrane is&#xD;
      systematically sacrificed and the inner ear opened with as consequence a complete loss of&#xD;
      residual hearing and vertigo for a few days. In this protocol research, the patients will&#xD;
      participate by accepting an robot based placement of a tympanic ventilation drain during the&#xD;
      surgery before the sacrifice of the tympanic membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be adults, living in France, benefiting from the cover of the French&#xD;
      health care system. The people participating to the research will have to give their consent&#xD;
      to participate to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Name and brief description of one or several experimental medical devices:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of the device RobOtol® is based on a teleoperated system with 6 degrees of&#xD;
      freedom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical device is European Conformity (CE) marked since in June, 2016. The team of Ear,&#xD;
      Nose and Throat (ENT) of Pitié-Salpêtrière (PSL) university hospital will lead this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description and justification of the methods and the duration of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studied device is a drain mounted on a trocar placed by means of the teleoperated system&#xD;
      RobOtol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard device and procedure is a drain inserted by the surgeon with forceps after&#xD;
      incision of the eardrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The equipment RobOtol will be driven by the surgeon. The procedure will be conducted under&#xD;
      general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summarize of predictable and known benefits and risks for the people participating to the&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no individual expected benefit considering the choice of the included population in&#xD;
      the protocol. The population was chosen to eliminate the risks of unwanted effect during the&#xD;
      installation of the drain by the robot (in particular the risks for the tympanic membrane).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients presenting an indication of tympanic ventilation drain placement (ex: serous&#xD;
      otitis), have the exceptional risks, a hearing loss, a secondary infection of the drain or&#xD;
      vertigo, or facial palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population chosen in this study has to benefit from a removal of a vestibular schwannoma.&#xD;
      Within the procedure of this surgery, a total loss of the hearing, a sacrifice of the&#xD;
      tympanic membrane and vertigo are expected and predictable consequences of the surgical&#xD;
      technique. For that reason, there is no additional risk of complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only risk is the fact that the general anesthesia will be prolonged for the study, for&#xD;
      approximately 15 min on a surgery requiring an average duration of anesthesia of 5,5 hours (1&#xD;
      hour of perioperative anesthesia, 4,5 hours of surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROGRESS OF THE SEARCH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modalities(Methods) of recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen adults presenting a vestibular schwannoma that will benefit from a removal by&#xD;
      translabyrinthine approach with exclusion from the middle ear under general anesthesia will&#xD;
      be included after information and obtaining of their written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visit of selection and inclusion The recruitment of the patients will be made from the&#xD;
           line of the new patients by the investigators for the consultation of ENT of PSL.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit of selection / inclusion in the study by the ENT ( D0):&#xD;
&#xD;
           O Clinical examination: otoscopy, check of the diameter of the external auditory canal o&#xD;
           Check of the criteria of inclusion and non inclusion o Information of the patient o&#xD;
           Signature of the informed consent by the patient o Collection clinical data: sex, age,&#xD;
           operated side (left / right), previous otological history, diameter of the external&#xD;
           auditory canal&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Visit of follow-up of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
           The intervention by the ENT (D14):&#xD;
&#xD;
           The intervention will take place in the operating room of the building Babinski and the&#xD;
           service of ENT;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Visit of the end of the research There is no visit of post-operative follow-up nor visit&#xD;
           of the end of planned research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient sees his participation in the research ending after the removal of the tympanic&#xD;
      membrane at D0.&#xD;
