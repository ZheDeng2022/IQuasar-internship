    <description>The frequency of participants with total AEs, AEs by categories of intensity (mild, moderate, severe), seriousness and relatedness was presented. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical trial. The intensity of an AE was classified using the following 3-point scale: mild=awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity; moderate=event sufficient to affect usual activity (disturbing); or severe= inability to work or perform usual activities (unacceptable). Seriousness refers to death, hospitalization/ prolongation of existing hospitalization, a life-threatening experience, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or congenital anomaly. The possibility of whether the IMP caused the AE would be classified as: reasonable possibility, no reasonable possibility. All the reasonable possible causality to the IMP were referred to as adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Relatedness of AEs to IMP was assessed by the investigator.</description>

        <description>The frequency of participants with total AEs, AEs by categories of intensity (mild, moderate, severe), seriousness and relatedness was presented. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical trial. The intensity of an AE was classified using the following 3-point scale: mild=awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity; moderate=event sufficient to affect usual activity (disturbing); or severe= inability to work or perform usual activities (unacceptable). Seriousness refers to death, hospitalization/ prolongation of existing hospitalization, a life-threatening experience, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or congenital anomaly. The possibility of whether the IMP caused the AE would be classified as: reasonable possibility, no reasonable possibility. All the reasonable possible causality to the IMP were referred to as adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Relatedness of AEs to IMP was assessed by the investigator.</description>

Vaginal itching: Grade 1 (mild)-itching causing no, mild or moderate inference with usual social &amp; functional activities; Grade 2 (moderate)-itching causing inability to perform usual social &amp; functional activities; may require intervention such as antihistamine or bathing. Vaginal dryness: Grade 1 (mild)-dryness causing no or minimal inference with usual sexual, social &amp; functional activities; Grade 2 (moderate)-dryness causing greater than minimal inference with usual sexual, social &amp; functional activities. Vaginal discharge by participant report: Grade 1 (mild)-mild-moderate increase in amount above participant BL-no sanitary protection required; Grade 2 (moderate)-profuse increase in discharge requiring pad use or other hygienic intervention.</description>
