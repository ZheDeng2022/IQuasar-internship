  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Family Sodium Watcher program in this study is designed to improve adherence to a sodium&#xD;
      restricted diet in patients with HF using strategies that educate both patients and family&#xD;
      caregivers about sodium monitoring and that stress a gradual progressive adaptation to low&#xD;
      sodium food for both patients and family caregivers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) emerged as a significant public health threat in the 1990s and has now&#xD;
      reached epidemic proportions. Despite advances in the medical treatment of HF, patients with&#xD;
      HF face frequent hospitalizations for acute exacerbations. Inadequate self-care strategies,&#xD;
      in particular non-adherence to a sodium restricted diet (SRD), is a main cause of these&#xD;
      rehospitalizations. Prior interventions to increase adherence have focused on increasing&#xD;
      knowledge about restricting sodium in the diet have met with limited success. Unaddressed by&#xD;
      these interventions are the major barriers of measuring and tracking daily sodium intake,&#xD;
      family members who continue to eat high sodium diets, and a preference for salty&#xD;
      foods-particularly in the elderly who have a decreased sense of taste. It is possible to&#xD;
      retrain the taste buds to enjoy low salt foods by gradually reducing the amount of sodium in&#xD;
      foods over the course of 16 weeks. This retraining works best with direct involvement and&#xD;
      support from family members. The Family Sodium Watcher Program (Family SWaP) proposed in this&#xD;
      study incorporates the use of a unique electronic salt monitoring device that easily measures&#xD;
      salt content in food-the major source of sodium. The intervention is designed to improve&#xD;
      adherence to a SRD by both patients and family caregivers through education and strategies&#xD;
      for gradual taste adaptation to low salt foods.&#xD;
