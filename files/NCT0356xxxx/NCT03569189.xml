  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of a 7-day westernised high-fat (65% of kilocalories),&#xD;
      high-calorie (150% of requirements) diet on markers of inflammation in the blood and white&#xD;
      adipose tissue. Participants will firstly complete a 3-day weight maintenance phase (Days&#xD;
      1-3) before completing a 7-day high fat diet intervention (Days 4-10). On days 4 and 11&#xD;
      participants will complete a laboratory visit where anthropometric measurements, blood and&#xD;
      adipose samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that consuming a high-fat, high-calorie diet for 7 days will&#xD;
      alter the inflammatory responses in white adipose tissue and will induce metabolic&#xD;
      endotoxaemia / systemic inflammation.&#xD;
