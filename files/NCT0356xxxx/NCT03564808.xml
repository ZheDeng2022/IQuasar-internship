      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contour deformities of the face requiring soft tissue augmentation are usually associated&#xD;
      with hyper pigmentation of overlying skin. These deformities often result from a variety of&#xD;
      conditions like trauma, infection and certain acquired diseases1. Contour deformities of face&#xD;
      cause both functional as well as aesthetic problems for the patient. Hyper pigmentation of&#xD;
      overlying skin makes these deformities more pronounced and iniquitous. Conventionally,&#xD;
      contour problems are treated by using allogenic fillers, major flap surgery and fat&#xD;
      grafting2. Flap surgery causes donor site morbidities and does not address pigmentary&#xD;
      changes. Allogenic fillers, on the other hand,are expensive and also do not improve hyper&#xD;
      pigmentation of overlying skin. Lasers and de-pigmentary creams have been described for&#xD;
      addressing pigmentary issue but no satisfactory measure is available so far. Moreover, these&#xD;
      modalities do not treat contour deformity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autologous fat grafting has gained acceptance to improve skin texture and post inflammatory&#xD;
      hyper pigmentation associated with contour deformities of face2,3. Fat, being an autologous&#xD;
      tissue, is an ideal choice to rejuvenate hyper pigmented skin owing to its abundant&#xD;
      availability in areas like abdomen, buttocks, thighs and arms without any significant donor&#xD;
      site morbidity. Repeat sessions of fat injection can be done if needed. Fat grafting is not&#xD;
      new and it may be a safe and natural method to improve skin hyper pigmentation. One major&#xD;
      problem related to fat grafting is resorption of grafted fat at recipient site ranging from&#xD;
      40% to 80% 4. It requires multiple sessions of fat injection. In literature, many treatment&#xD;
      options have been utilized to solve this issue of resorption, one of these is enrichment of&#xD;
      fat graft with mesenchymal stem cells 5. Mesenchymal stem cells derived from fatty tissue&#xD;
      possess potential to proliferate as well as differentiate into multiple cell lines6,7. These&#xD;
      mesenchymal cells not only increase consistency of grafted fat but also lead to rejuvenation&#xD;
      of the skin overlying the fat grafted area and improve pigmentary changes of this overlying&#xD;
      skin. However, previously published data has failed to establish a clear association of&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells with improvement in hyper pigmentation of skin overlying fat grafted&#xD;
      contour deformities of face. In order to find a reliable mean to decrease hyper pigmentation&#xD;
      of skin overlying contour deformities of face, more work is needed to be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study we propose the novel idea of lipo-filling the contour defects of face&#xD;
      associated with overlying skin hyper pigmentation using enriched conventional fat graft with&#xD;
      ex-vivo expanded fat derived mesenchymal stem cells to potentiate the improvement in&#xD;
      overlying skin hyper pigmentation and to enhance reliability of the final outcome of&#xD;
      surgery8,9,10,11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of the study is to compare the improvement in skin hyper pigmentation after&#xD;
      conventional fat grafting and stem cell enriched fat grafting for contour deformities of face&#xD;
      associated with hyper pigmentation of overlying skin. If enrichment of fat graft with fat&#xD;
      derived mesenchymal stem cells can increase its effect on improvement in the hyper&#xD;
      pigmentation of overlying skin, this innovative strategy can render fat transfer a reliable&#xD;
      option for soft tissue augmentation in contour deformities of face with overlying skin hyper&#xD;
      pigmentation2. This can definitely improve final clinical outcome by decreasing donor site&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.4 OBJECTIVES: To compare the long term effect on skin hyper pigmentation after conventional&#xD;
      fat grafting and adipose-tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells enriched fat grafting for the&#xD;
      treatment of deformities of the face associated with overlying skin hyper pigmentation.&#xD;
