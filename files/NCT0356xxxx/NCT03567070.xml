  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is observed that pregnant women using psychoactive substance (s) have a more random and&#xD;
      more accidental pregnancy follow-up than women with no addictive problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consumption approach can be either omitted during the pregnancy monitoring, or entrusted&#xD;
      to the course or more often in late pregnancy or occurs more brutally during delivery at the&#xD;
      time of complications (neonatal or obstetric). In this context, health professionals are&#xD;
      looking for levers that allow women to take appropriate care quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This difficulty of access to care questions us and all the more because the time of the&#xD;
      pregnancy is a moment of important psychic reorganization conducive to modify its habits, to&#xD;
      change its glance on its consumptions and thus to start a care concerning addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invesigators hypothesize that this population has less access to medical care during&#xD;
      pregnancy for fear of stigmatization by the health care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invesigators propose a multicenter qualitative study based on individual clinical interviews&#xD;
      to collect the testimony of women who used psychoactive substance (s) during their pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this work is to identify ways to improve the multidisciplinary medical&#xD;
      management of these women by focusing on the representations they can make care of.&#xD;
