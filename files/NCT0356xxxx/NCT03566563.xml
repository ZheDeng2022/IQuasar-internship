  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C (HCV) is a major health problem amongst people who inject drugs (PWID) and have&#xD;
      limited contact with health care services. Halfway houses (HH) serve to reintegrate former&#xD;
      drug users into society. Strategies to eliminate HCV must focus on screening for HCV amongst&#xD;
      HH. Linkage to care for PWID population is an issue globally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to determine the sero-prevalence, demographics, disease distribution and factors&#xD;
      associated with the risk of HCV transmission amongst former drug users at Halfway Houses. The&#xD;
      secondary aim would be to determine the best models of care that can be used to link these&#xD;
      individuals to existing healthcare services in a pragmatic, randomised fashion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Halfway Houses are invited to participate in a program of HCV education, point-of-care&#xD;
      screening using Oraquick test and staging with FibroscanÂ® by a small mobile team of&#xD;
      healthcare workers. A detailed survey regarding illicit drug injecting practices is&#xD;
      performed. Those who are tested positive are referred to medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the prevalence of Hepatitis C within the drug injecting population&#xD;
      along with the stages of liver disease such that models for disease burden can be determined.&#xD;

      This is a pragmatic observational study of point of care HCV screening in the halfway house&#xD;
      resident /PWID population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the secondary aim the HCV positive subjects are randomised to traditional referral pathway&#xD;
      (HCV positive cases attend primary care facilities to get referral to specialist clinic in&#xD;
      hospital) and 'direct' open access where the HCV positive cases has direct open access to&#xD;
      specialist clinic as above (by passing primary care physicians). We observe the no. of&#xD;
      subjects being linkage to specialist care, and HCV treatment&#xD;

        Halfway House (HH) residents are largely former injecting drug users who have a high&#xD;
        prevalence of Hepatitis C. Typically upon release from prisons, there are housed at HH as&#xD;
        an interim step prior to re-integration back into society. The prevalence of Hepatitis C&#xD;
        within this community allows the estimation of the national prevalence of Hepatitis C in&#xD;
        the country.&#xD;
