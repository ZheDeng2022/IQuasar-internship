  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults are at higher risks of tripping and falling than young adults. These falls may&#xD;
      lead to serious injuries (bone fractures, head traumaâ€¦) and premature death. They also have&#xD;
      an important economic cost for the society. One of the reasons identified for this increased&#xD;
      risk of falling is the modification of muscles and tendons functional and architectural&#xD;
      parameters with age. It is now well established that muscles of older adults are smaller and&#xD;
      weaker, while tendons, that modulate the outcomes of muscle contraction, are less able to&#xD;
      resist to tension and transmit forces more slowly than in young age. These changes have&#xD;
      functional implications, especially in tasks that require to quickly generate high forces,&#xD;
      such as recovering from a trip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine the links between muscle-tendon characteristics and locomotion,&#xD;
      and to understand whether they can be improved by a four-months collagen supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure the muscular strength and tendon stiffness of lower limb&#xD;
      musculotendinous units (MTU) for older adults using isokinetic dynamometry (IKD) and&#xD;
      ultrasounds. Participants' abilities to recover from a trip will then be evaluated using a&#xD;
      custom built tripping device while walking on a treadmill (participants will wear a whole&#xD;
      body harness attached to a rope secured to the ceiling). These performances will be linked to&#xD;
      MTU characteristics and compared between both age groups. Finally, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of a nutritional supplementation on the mechanical properties of elderly&#xD;
      tendons and its potential impacts on their ability to safely recover from a trip, on their&#xD;
      lean mass, and on other life quality related markers (joint pain, balance, stair climbing&#xD;
      capacities...).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that this study will lead to a new intervention aiming to improve&#xD;
      the safety of older adults performing their daily activities using nutritional&#xD;
      supplementation, which is known to have better adherence than training interventions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Being able to walk safely, to go up and down stairs and to recover from an unexpected gait&#xD;
      perturbation are vital for older adults' autonomy, home maintenance and life quality. It is&#xD;
      therefore of major interest to understand the mechanisms responsible for older adults (OA)&#xD;
      decreased functional abilities. This study aims first to understand the links between muscles&#xD;
      and tendons characteristics and functional capacities of OA, and second to evaluate whether a&#xD;
      4-month collagen supplementation can improve OA musculotendinous properties, thereby&#xD;
      improving their function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trips are caused by an unexpected perturbation during the swing phase of gait (i.e. when the&#xD;
      foot is not in contact with the ground). Recovering from a trip requires the production of&#xD;
      fast and large muscle torques at the hips, knees and ankles joints to counteract the forward&#xD;
      rotation of the body, and the propulsion of the forward leg anteriorly to the centre of mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For OA, falling when walking on a flat surface is potentially damaging, and falling while&#xD;
      using stairs is even more dangerous. Indeed, over 65% of falls leading to brain injury in OA&#xD;
      happen in stairs and 10% of fall death in the US happen in stairs. Older adults with joints&#xD;
      problem are more susceptible to report difficulties when using stairs than those without.&#xD;
      Those with multiple joints problems are also up to 20 times more likely to have difficulties&#xD;
      in stair climbing than OA without joint problems. Mechanically, older adults operate closer&#xD;
      to their maximal joint moment capacities at the knee (ascent and descent) and ankle (ascent).&#xD;
      They thus have less reserve to adjust to any perturbation that could happen and are at more&#xD;
      risks of falling than young adults (YA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal gait, but also trip recovery and stair climbing are dependent on the muscles and&#xD;
      tendons capacities to produce and transmit adequate forces in a short amount of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With age, muscular and tendinous properties decline: muscles, that are responsible for the&#xD;
      production of forces, become weaker and smaller, and tendons, that are responsible for the&#xD;
      transmission of forces from muscles to the skeleton, become less stiff. It has been shown&#xD;
      that changes in the gastrocnemius tendon's properties affect the ability of elderly to&#xD;
      maintain balance during dynamic and demanding postural tasks, complicating OA daily living&#xD;
      activities. This may especially be so when the individual is not only required to generate&#xD;
      large joint moments, but to do so quickly, as is the case when trying to avoid a fall. OA&#xD;
      with decreased muscle and tendon properties do not generate and transmit adequate forces in&#xD;
      magnitude and velocity, which may be responsible for their decreased ability to recover from&#xD;
      a trip and in some cases may lead to falls. Therefore, interventions that improve&#xD;
      muscle-tendon properties of OA are likely to have benefits for recovering from a trip and&#xD;
      preventing a fall occurring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training interventions have been developed to minimise the effect of age on OA physical&#xD;
      condition but although strength training can improve tendon stiffness and muscle strength,&#xD;
      participants' adherence to these protocols can be low. Developing interventions with similar&#xD;
      effects and which are easier to follow (that do not require modification of participants'&#xD;
      routine) is thus of major interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that collagen supplementation improves the blood collagen synthesis and the&#xD;
      resistance to tension of collagenous tissues in the body. In this study, the investigators&#xD;
      will test a collagen supplement designed to improve joint, muscle and whole-body function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the investigators understand that the structure of muscles and tendons determines&#xD;
      their function and has key roles in overall physical function and ability to recover from a&#xD;
      trip, the investigators do not yet fully understand these mechanisms and how best to improve&#xD;
      them. The research area will be centred upon the muscle-tendon properties and interactions&#xD;
      that determine physical function in two different conditions (stair climbing and trip&#xD;
      recovery), and whether these can be improved by collagen supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will therefore evaluate changes in bone mineral density, lean mass, tendon&#xD;
      stiffness, muscle strength, stair climbing and tripping recovery capacities before and after&#xD;
      a 4-month supplementation period in 80 OA allocated either to the active product or to the&#xD;
      placebo group.&#xD;
