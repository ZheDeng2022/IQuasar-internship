  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inadequate sleep quality and duration may result in adverse health outcomes and poorer&#xD;
      quality of life. Despite the availability of behavior modification and pharmaceuticals to aid&#xD;
      sleep optimization and quality approximately 50% men and women continue to experience&#xD;
      difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. Individuals with sleep disorders may find&#xD;
      adherence to such interventions difficult to maintain (e.g. behavior modification) or the&#xD;
      therapies may pose a risk (e.g. dependence on pharmaceuticals). A need exists for alternative&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions, particularly those that are simple and cost effective.&#xD;
      Observational and anecdotal data supports honey as a functional food to promote better sleep.&#xD;
      As an initial step towards developing an evidence base for honey for improvement of sleep&#xD;
      quality the investigators propose to conduct a preliminary open-label proof-of-principle&#xD;
      study to assess the feasibility (primary outcome) and potential effectiveness (secondary&#xD;
      outcome) of honey in improving sleep quality before embarking upon a full-scale pivotal&#xD;
      clinical trial. The study data will confirm safety of honey use in a population of poor&#xD;
      sleepers and to identify where improvements in study design are necessary in planning of a&#xD;
      larger clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The feasibility study will involve an open-label, crossover study with 20 participants (Age&#xD;
      18 - 55; 10 male, 10 female) in a population-based setting meeting the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      giving informed consent. As a feasibility study, the investigators did not conduct a power&#xD;
      analysis and sample size is typical of other feasibility studies. To control for possible&#xD;
      differences in sex, an equal number of male and female participants will be recruited.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from clients of the Medicine Shoppe Pharmacy (Place Riel) and&#xD;
      invited to participate through their interaction with the study pharmacists (Carla Guedo or&#xD;
      Amber Ly) or by poster advertisement posted at the participating pharmacy or posted around&#xD;
      the university and on PAWS. Prospective participants will undergo a screening to determine&#xD;
      suitability for inclusion into the trial using an adaptation of the PharmaZZZ screening form&#xD;
      (see attached document). Prior to the initiation of the treatment arms, consented&#xD;
      participants will have baseline characteristics collected (sex, age, body weight, smoking&#xD;
      status, socio-professional status). Furthermore, consented participants will complete a&#xD;
      screening form (modified from the PharmaZZZ program, see attachment) and an Insomnia Severity&#xD;
      Index (see attachment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the intervention, participants will be instructed to limit consumption of coffee, black&#xD;
      tea, alcohol, energy drinks, and other caffeinated products one week before and during the&#xD;
      treatment and washout periods. The interventions are raw honey (1.5 tablespoons) or melatonin&#xD;
      (5 mg sublingual tablet). To randomize sequence of treatment and participants, the&#xD;
      investigators will employ a randomization table in a standard statistical textbook. Three&#xD;
      days prior to the treatment intervention, participants will be asked to eat supper at&#xD;
      approximately 6 pm and maintain a consistent intake of macronutrients for each supper meal. A&#xD;
      nutritionist will be consulted to help plan supper meals. During this 3 day period&#xD;
      participants will complete a daily sleep hygiene Log (see attachment) and morning sleep log&#xD;
      (see attachment), which assesses subjective measures of sleep quality and amount. On the&#xD;
      fourth day participants will continue the daily sleep hygiene log and sleep log, and evening&#xD;
      meal pattern, but will take either melatonin or honey by mouth within 30 minutes of going to&#xD;
      sleep for three consecutive days. At the end of the 3 day treatment period, participants will&#xD;
      discontinue with the sleep logs and prescriptive meal pattern and resume usual activities&#xD;
      during a 7 day washout between treatment arms. Participants also will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ) (see attachment, slightly modified from published&#xD;
      questionnaire), a standardized self-reporting instrument that assesses ease of getting to&#xD;
      sleep (questions 1 - 3), the quality of sleep (questions 4, 5), awakening from sleep&#xD;
      (questions 6, 7), and behavior following wakefulness (questions 8 - 10) in the morning of day&#xD;
      4 and day 7 of the treatment arm. LSEQ is considered a sensitive indicator of how the subject&#xD;
      perceives or feels changes in sleep quality and latency. At the end of the washout,&#xD;
      participants will repeat the cycle with the alternative treatment (i.e. 3 days prior to the&#xD;
      treatment intervention, participants will be asked to eat supper at 6 pm, maintain a&#xD;
      consistent intake of macronutrients for each supper meal, complete a daily sleep hygiene log&#xD;
      and sleep log, begin alternative treatment on fourth day for 3 days, and then discontinue&#xD;
      with the sleep logs and prescriptive meal pattern, complete LSEQs, and resume usual&#xD;
      activities). The investigators will provide participants with a visual schedule (calendar) to&#xD;
      follow to ensure that each understands the requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The honey will be Canada #2 White Honey from SweetHeart Pollinators (Janeil Enterprises,&#xD;
      Eatonia, SK). Melatonin (5 mg sublingual tablet; McKesson) will be dispensed by the&#xD;
      participating pharmacists (Carla Guedo or Amber Ly). Each treatment requires that the&#xD;
      dispensing pharmacist place an appropriate volume of the treatments into individual&#xD;
      disposable condiment containers with lids using aseptic techniques. An individual&#xD;
      appropriately labeled container for each treatment day will be made available to the&#xD;
      participants. The treatments will be known to the participant and study personnel. All used&#xD;
      and unused containers will be returned to the pharmacist to assess compliance. The pharmacist&#xD;
      will maintain accurate records of all treatments dispensed with identification of the&#xD;
      participant to whom they were dispensed, date of dispensing, and unused treatments. Each&#xD;
      participant will obtain the study's supply of each treatment (3 containers/treatment) in&#xD;
      larger plastic bags labelled as &quot;Study Treatment honey or melatonin&quot; with dosing instructions&#xD;
      (e.g. using a teaspoon consume the entire contents of the container once daily within 30&#xD;
      minutes of going to sleep and follow with a small glass of water). The participant will&#xD;
      return to the pharmacy all used and unused containers as well as completed logs and&#xD;
      questionnaires to the pharmacy at the end of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For evaluation of sleep quality, criteria will be the monitoring of participant perception of&#xD;
      sleep quality by using the morning sleep logs and the LSEQ. Stopping rules or discontinuation&#xD;
      criteria for a participant includes violation of exclusion criteria and non-compliance with&#xD;
      the protocol. Participants will also be free to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any&#xD;
      time. If a participant withdraws, no further data will be collected from the participant. The&#xD;
      subjective variables of sleep quality will be assessed using repeated measures analysis of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVA). Other variables of interest will be analyzed using a student's t-test for&#xD;
      continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Patient demographic&#xD;
      data and subjective sleep variables will be reported descriptively as means and standard&#xD;
      deviations.&#xD;

    <description>Feasibility of participants to be compliant to standardized assessment tool of sleep quality, the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire. This questionnaire consists of 10 questions with a scale from 1 - 9, the highest number for each symptom measured representing the best sleep quality. Score of 5 is the baseline such that a score of 5 indicates no change and a higher or lower value from 5 indicates a change in a symptom. A total score will be reported to determine whether the intervention resulted in a change in sleep quality.</description>
