    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the treatment could maximize intestinal&#xD;
      absorption, minimize the inconvenience of diarrhea, and avoid, reduce or eliminate the need&#xD;
      for parenteral support (PS) to achieve normal growth, to avoid parenteral nutrition&#xD;
      complications and to achieve the best possible quality of life for the patient&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The short bowel syndrome (SBS) may be defined as a severe malabsorption caused by reduction&#xD;
      of intestinal absorptive surface following massive resection of the small intestine.&#xD;
      Teduglutide (Revestive®) is an analog of glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), a naturally&#xD;
      occurring hormone that regulates the functional and structural integrity of the cells lining&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of the treatment is to maximize intestinal absorption,&#xD;
      minimize the inconvenience of diarrhea, and avoid, reduce or eliminate the need for&#xD;
      parenteral support (PS) to achieve the best possible quality of life for the patient. The&#xD;
      rationale for the use of Revestive® is based on data obtained, especially in the trial in SBS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with 0.05 mg/kg/day was safe and well tolerated (no recorded side effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients remained stable despite substantial reduction in parenteral nutrition (PN) supply as&#xD;
      evidenced by stable body weight and height, serum electrolytes, pancreatic enzymes and renal&#xD;
      function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment was associated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced PN volume and calories delivered by 25 and 45% respectively with 20% of patients&#xD;
           weaned off PN during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased Enteral Nutrition (EN) supply in volume and calories by 40 and 62%&#xD;
           respectively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased in plasma citrulline during the treatment period, but decreased after&#xD;
           Teduglutide discontinuation The recommended dose of Revestive® in children and&#xD;
           adolescents (aged 1 to 17 years) is the same as for adults (0.05 mg/kg body weight once&#xD;
           daily).&#xD;
