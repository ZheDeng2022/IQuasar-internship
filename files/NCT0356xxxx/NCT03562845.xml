  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is an observational, multi-center study to determine if a new blood test&#xD;
      (Immunobiogram®) done after renal transplant can help predict how well the immune system is&#xD;
      working and responding to a new kidney. These blood tests could, in the future, potentially&#xD;
      guide how doctors manage patient's anti-rejection medication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rejection in renal transplants is a major problem unsolved in the long term, as 30-50% of&#xD;
      patients lose their kidney due to rejection, or rejection mechanisms are involved elsewhere.&#xD;
      One of the presumed key factors that may deliver such bad outcomes is the difficulties to&#xD;
      personalise immunosuppressive treatment; a medical need that currently relies on&#xD;
      immunosuppressive levels for some medications (pharmacokinetics), clinical guideline&#xD;
      recommendations, adverse events profiles and some expensive biomarkers which are not widely&#xD;
      used. Immunobiogram® (IMBG) is a tool that evaluates the sensitivity/resistance profile of&#xD;
      patients to each of the most widely used and representative immunosuppressant drugs (IM).&#xD;
      Thus, IMBG offers information that could become pivotal in clinical management of renal&#xD;
      transplanted patients, if its potential benefits are proven. In this clinical study, a&#xD;
      technology validation will be performed in which the robustness of the bioassay will be&#xD;
      evaluated; and a correlation between the current clinical prognoses of each patient and&#xD;
      resistance patterns will be explored.&#xD;

    <description>Robustness of Immunobiogram® (IMBG) as an In Vitro Diagnostic Bioassay to study the sensitivity/resistance patterns of Immunosuppressant drugs in Renal Transplantation, evaluated as follows:&#xD;
Immunobiogram® offers personal sensitivity/resistance patterns of Immunosuppressive Medications (IM), with a range of responses for each IM drug considering all patients included&#xD;
Immunobiogram® shows intrasubject consistency in terms of similarity with a maximum +/- 20% of variation in the inhibitory dose/distance 50 (ID50), in the three IMBG performed on inclusion; and additionally, similar consistency must be observed in the last three IMBG performed one month after inclusion</description>

    <arm_group_label>ARM 1-Bad vs Good Clinical Evolution</arm_group_label>
    <description>This arm is intended to evaluate the correlation of Immunobiogram® sensitivity/resistance patterns with clinical prognosis as it may be judged at this moment considering clinical outcomes and immune-biomarker evolution in the past 12 to 18 months. Thus, it may confirm the BH-Pilot study findings. Renal transplant patients of two types will be included:&#xD;
Patients who, over previous months, have had a bad clinical evolution, in which rejection mechanisms were involved&#xD;
Patients with a good and stable clinical evolution&#xD;
IMBG sensitivity/resistance profiles will be compared amongst the two groups to evaluate the differences.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>ARM 2-Stable Renal Transplant Patients</arm_group_label>
    <description>This arm is intended to evaluate robustness of Immunobiogram® as an IVD test. Thus, it will be performed intrasubject comparisons and inter-time evaluation of two sets of Immunobiogram® separated by 30+/- 10 days, each including three IMBG determinations (IMBGx3 - IMBGx3, the two sets separated by 30+/- 10 days). The intended evaluation will be to analyse the similarities between all IMBG tests performed, both between the same set and also between the two sets planned.</description>
