  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and perceived effectiveness of the&#xD;
      culturally-adapted COMFORT Communication Curriculum in two Native American reservation&#xD;
      communities. Participants in one community will have an advance care planning conversation&#xD;
      with a healthcare professional trained in the the culturally-adapted curriculum. Participants&#xD;
      in the other community will receive usual care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advance care planning (ACP) is an important component of palliative care (PC), and is a&#xD;
      critical, ongoing dialogue between health care professionals (HCPs), patients, and families;&#xD;
      where patients' comprehension of their illness and illness progression, goals of care, and&#xD;
      treatment choices are discussed. Essential to ACP is the interdisciplinary team, where each&#xD;
      member must be comfortable and confident initiating conversations about quality of life and&#xD;
      end-of-life (EOL) care. ACP is often hindered by low health literacy, including PC health&#xD;
      literacy, uncertainty regarding illness trajectory and end-of-life palliative care (EOLPC)&#xD;
      options, and lack of awareness about ACP among patients. For HCPs, discomfort, lack of EOL&#xD;
      communication training, and knowledge of cultural differences are often barriers to ACP.&#xD;
      Foundational to ACP is PC health literacy, which necessitates considering semantics,&#xD;
      eliminating misconceptions, and recognizing uncertainty. Ensuring access to ACP for patients&#xD;
      with serious life-limiting illness requires that all healthcare disciplines receive&#xD;
      evidence-based EOLPC communication training. The COMFORT communication curriculum (CC) is an&#xD;
      intervention that trains interdisciplinary HCPs to provide patient- and family-centered EOLPC&#xD;
      communication. Patient outcomes related to this intervention have not been studied. Moreover,&#xD;
      the curriculum's efficacy and fit has not been specifically tested with minority groups.&#xD;
      Native Americans (NA) are disproportionately affected by serious life-limiting conditions and&#xD;
      life expectancy is 4 years less than all other US races. Despite greater morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, NAs use of PC is largely unknown. Yet, it has been identified that tribal&#xD;
      communities are requesting EOLPC services and will participate in ACP when conducted in a&#xD;
      culturally-respectful manner. There is an urgent need to develop culturally-relevant&#xD;
      communication approaches specific to EOLPC, including ACP, for use with NAs with serious&#xD;
      life-limiting illness. The investigators propose a collaborative clinical trial to: 1)&#xD;
      Culturally-adapt the COMFORT CC for pilot testing with NA communities; 2) Implement the&#xD;
      culturally-adapted COMFORT CC in 2 tribal communities by training 20 interdisciplinary&#xD;
      (nurses, social workers, primary care providers) HCPs to conduct culturally-respectful and&#xD;
      relevant ACP; 3) Conduct a pilot, wait-list controlled trial of the culturally-adapted&#xD;
      COMFORT CC in 2 tribal communities to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and perceived&#xD;
      effectiveness by comparing 30 NAs completing ACP with a trained HCP and 30 NAs receiving&#xD;
      usual care. Implementing a culturally-relevant communication intervention to improve EOLPC&#xD;
      health literacy is a high priority for the Rosebud and Pine Ridge reservations in South&#xD;
      Dakota. This proposed study will culturally-adapt and evaluate the COMFORT CC on these 2&#xD;
      reservations and will provide the foundation for an R01-funded intervention study that could&#xD;
      positively impact EOLPC literacy and outcomes among the 566 US federally recognized NA&#xD;
      tribes.&#xD;

    <description>This will be evaluated by patient report using the validated Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale- Community (MUIS-C) pre and post outpatient clinic visit only at the intervention site. Uncertainty in illness (construct) is often discussed in relationship to health literacy, and for purposes of this study, end of life palliative care health literacy. This outcome will be evaluated by patient report using the validated MUIS-C, which has been used extensively in cancer, cardiac, and chronic illness patients and in cross-cultural studies. The MUIS-C is a 23-item Likert-format scale, where patients score items from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The total score range is 23-115, with higher scores indicating a greater level of uncertainty. Reported Cronbach's alphas are 0.74 to 0.92.</description>

    <description>Healthcare professionals participating in the COMFORT Communication Curriculum (CC) training will complete a C-COPE (Comfort with Communication in Palliative and End of Life Care) questionnaire before and after training. This will be done only at the intervention site.The C-COPE operationalizes the key components within the COMFORT CC and is a 28-item instrument including 2-ranked items and 26 Likert-format items, where healthcare professionals score items from 1 (not difficult) to 5 (very difficult). The range of possible C-COPE total scores is 26-130, with higher scores indicating less comfort with end of life palliative care communication, while rated items are categorized according to patient, family, and team communication. Preliminary psychometric analysis of test-retest reliability with ICC &gt; 0.77, internal reliability for total score with Cronbach's alpha = 0.91.</description>

        Focus Groups. Aim 1.1: Patient eligibility criteria: 1) Native American; 2) 18 years old or&#xD;
        greater; 3) and diagnosis with one or more serious life-limiting illness, such as renal&#xD;
        failure, cancer, or heart disease, as defined by the International Statistical&#xD;
        Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). Caregiver eligibility&#xD;
        criteria: 1) 18 years old or greater; 2) primary caregiver of a family member participant.&#xD;
        Healthcare Professional eligibility: employment 1 year or more as a nurse, social worker,&#xD;
        or primary care provider at Indian Health Service. An Elder is eligible if he/she is Native&#xD;
        American and an identified elder in the community. Tribal health leader/representative&#xD;
        inclusion criteria: 1) Native American; 2) 18 years old or greater; 3) live in the&#xD;
        community; 4) employed by tribal health administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cognitive Interviews. Aim 1.2: The investigators will recontact and reconsent those&#xD;
        patients, family caregivers, and Elders who participated in the focus groups (Aim 1.1)&#xD;
        (Total of 10; 5 per site) to conduct interviews assessing the culturally-adapted COMFORT&#xD;
        Communication Curriculum's cultural relevance and fit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        COMFORT Communication Curriculum Training. Aim 2.1: Healthcare Professionals (nurses,&#xD;
        social workers, primary care providers) will be recruited through Indian Health Service&#xD;
        nursing and clinic administrators and must be employed for 1 year or more by Rosebud Indian&#xD;
        Health Service to participate in the COMFORT Communication Curriculum education (Total of&#xD;
        10). The wait-list control arm (Pine Ridge Healthcare Professionals; total of 10) will&#xD;
        receive the education following completion of data collection in the intervention group.&#xD;
        Participants will be recruited through Indian Health Service nursing and clinic&#xD;

        contact phone number and be given an information sheet by trained project Indian Health&#xD;
        Service personnel regarding the interview purpose. Researchers will contact the participant&#xD;
        via phone within 2 business days of visit and if still agreeable, schedule a face-to-face&#xD;
