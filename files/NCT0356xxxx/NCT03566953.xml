  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the objective of this study is to compare the caries index between Sudanese and Egyptian&#xD;
      adult Population in patients with different diet habits and different oral hygiene state in&#xD;
      range of (18-40) years old&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A main factor for planning any preventive program is to accurately assess a person's risk of&#xD;
      developing a caries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a relative lack of data pertaining to adults in the developing world in general and&#xD;
      in Sudan in particular. Most of the studies focused on school children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many people in Sudan do not receive regular dental care and have acute problems when seen by&#xD;
      a dentist. In Sudan the dentist-to-patient ratio is 1:33,000 compared with approximately&#xD;
      1:2,000 in most industrialized countries. Relative to the size of the Sudanese population,&#xD;
      there are very few dentists and this restricts access to regular dental care. Other factors&#xD;
      which influence dental. Attendance in Sudan include the lack of public funding for oral&#xD;
      healthcare and dental insurance schemes to ameliorate the cost of care. For this reason,&#xD;
      insufficient awareness of the culture of selecting suitable foods to preserve the health of&#xD;
      the mouth and teeth, as prevention is better than treatment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will help the clinician to compare the incidence of caries between different&#xD;
      nationality they have different diet habits ,food traditions , and they have different&#xD;
      education and cultural levels as these factors can reflect the health care system , and to&#xD;
      determine the effect of these factors clearly on dental caries It also allow the clinician to&#xD;
      develop the most suitable preventive treatment plan for each patient by evaluating the main&#xD;
      causative factor to patient and to eliminate that factor so that we can arrest an ongoing&#xD;
      active lesion and prevent developing a new lesion at lowest therapeutic cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be informed in the same visit about the causative factor of the carious&#xD;
      lesion in general, the role of diet in particular and instructed about the suggested&#xD;
      treatment plan ,to change the lifestyle to the better and strengthen the concept of&#xD;
      &quot;prevention is better than treatment&quot;&#xD;
