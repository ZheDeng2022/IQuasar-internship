  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to assess at how differences in the microbiome&#xD;
      (naturally occurring bacteria) of a baby may protect, or put a baby at risk, for allergic&#xD;
      problems. The microbiome refers to the thousands of bacteria and molds that live in and on&#xD;
      our bodies. The microbiome plays an important role in our health. Differences in the&#xD;
      microbiome can affect our immune system in ways that might make some people more likely to&#xD;
      get allergies and asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early life events and exposures are very important for establishing the human microbiome. The&#xD;
      newborn baby's microbiome changes very quickly during the first weeks and months of life.&#xD;
      There is information that suggests C-section birth is associated with higher risk of certain&#xD;
      diseases, including allergies and asthma. Some researchers think one reason for this is that&#xD;
      passing through the mother's vaginal canal during birth exposes the baby to bacteria that&#xD;
      promote healthy immune system development, something that C-section babies don't get.&#xD;
      Transferring these potentially beneficial vaginal bacteria to C-section babies may help&#xD;
      prevent some diseases later.&#xD;

      This is a pilot study of 120 pregnant women and their infants conducted at hospitals in the&#xD;
      Mount Sinai Health System in New York, NY. Eighty women will deliver via elective, unlabored&#xD;
      C-section, and 40 will undergo spontaneous vaginal delivery. The 80 women undergoing&#xD;
      C-section will be randomized in a masked (blinded) 1:1 fashion to have their neonates undergo&#xD;
      vaginal seeding or placebo seeding immediately after birth (within 10 minutes) followed by&#xD;
      standard care.The infants of the 40 women undergoing spontaneous vaginal delivery will&#xD;
      receive usual standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 120 pregnant women will have biospecimens collected to assess their vaginal, skin, gut,&#xD;
      placental, breast milk, and oral microbiome. All infants will have biospecimens collected to&#xD;
      assess their gut, skin, nasal, and oral microbiome, as well as blood to assess allergen&#xD;
      sensitization and immune markers. Infants will be followed with at-home stool collections and&#xD;
      questionnaires weekly for the first 4 weeks and at weeks 8, 26, and 39. An in-person study&#xD;
      visit will occur at 13 weeks and 52 weeks, and the primary endpoint will be assessed at 52&#xD;
      weeks. Study enrollment is projected to occur over 24 months.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study will enroll pregnant women during the third trimester of pregnancy whose infants have a first-degree relative ( the mother, biological father, or full sibling) with atopic disease or food allergy.The study excludes women with a history of active atopic dermatitis within the past 5 years to avoid the potential transfer of vaginal microbiota to the infant that may predispose to atopic disease.Women undergoing elective, unlabored C-section will be randomized to have their infants undergo vaginal seeding or placebo seeding plus standard of care. Women and infants who undergo placebo seeding will serve as a control population.In addition, women and infants undergoing vaginal delivery will also be included as a second control group, in part to determine if vaginal seeding will decrease allergen sensitization rates to a level similar to vaginally delivered infants, and also to serve as a comparator group for gut microbiome development during the infant's first year of life.</intervention_model_description>
