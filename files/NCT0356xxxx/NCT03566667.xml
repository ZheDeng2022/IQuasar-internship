    <textblock>
      Background: In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and concomitant&#xD;
      cardiovascular conditions cardio-selective beta-blockers reduce mortality and can be used&#xD;
      without significant negative effects on lung function or respiratory symptoms. Observational&#xD;
      studies indicate that beta-blocker therapy in COPD even without overt cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      is associated with reduced risk for mortality and COPD exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The overall purpose of our study is to examine the benefit of general beta-blocker&#xD;
      therapy on important patient-oriented measures in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD). Our primary hypothesis that treatment with beta-blockers in patients with COPD and no&#xD;
      comorbid heart disease at baseline can prevent a Composite measure of hospitalizations due to&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases, COPD exacerbations and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: 1700 patients with C OPD. Inclusion criteria are FEV1/FVC &lt; 70, age &gt;40 years and&#xD;
      sinus rhythm 50-120/min. Exclusion criteria include hypersensitivity against metoprolol,&#xD;
      atrioventricular (AV) block II or II or sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker, atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation or flutter, clinical signs of or previously known cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure &lt; 90, severe asthma, present beta-blocker therapy or ongoing COPD&#xD;
      exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Metoprolol at a target dose of 100 mg in addition to standard COPD care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control: No placebo control. Randomized, pragmatic un-blinded controlled study where the&#xD;
      control Group receives standard COPD care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: The primary outcome is a composite measure of all-cause mortality, C OPD&#xD;
      exacerbations, and cardiovascular events after one year. Endpoint data from Swedish national&#xD;
      registries and clinical follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance: Beta-blocker treatment to attenuate morbidity in patients with COPD could have&#xD;
      great clinical and social importance at a low cost.&#xD;

      Purpose and aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of our study is to examine the benefit of general beta-blocker therapy on&#xD;
      important patient-oriented measures in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Our&#xD;
      primary aim is to examine if treatment with beta-blockers in patients with COPD and no&#xD;
      comorbid heart disease at baseline can prevent hospitalizations due to cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases, COPD exacerbations and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and concomitant cardiovascular&#xD;
      conditions cardio-selective beta-blockers reduce mortality and can be used without&#xD;
      significant negative effects on lung function or respiratory symptoms. Observational studies&#xD;
      indicate that beta-blocker therapy in COPD even without overt cardiovascular disease, is&#xD;
      associated with reduced risk for mortality and COPD exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Does treatment with metoprolol at an aimed dose of 100 mg in addition to standard&#xD;
      care statistically significantly decrease the one year rate of a composite measure of death,&#xD;
      COPD exacerbations or hospitalization due to a cardiovascular event, in patients with COPD&#xD;
      and no cardiovascular disease at baseline? Secondary: Does treatment with metoprolol at an&#xD;
      aimed dose of 100 mg in addition to standard care: -decrease the one year rate of a death&#xD;
      (all-cause and cause-specific), in patients with COPD and no cardiovascular disease at&#xD;
      baseline? -decrease the one year rate of exacerbations, in patients with COPD and no&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease at baseline? -decrease the one year rate of hospitalization for&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, heart failure, atrial fibrillation or other forms of&#xD;
      arrhythmia, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or cerebral hemorrhage in patients with&#xD;
      COPD and no cardiovascular disease at baseline?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCCT) with a pragmatic approach, i.e. a study&#xD;
      characterized by a minimized number of inclusion and exclusion criteria, a reduced number of&#xD;
      follow-up visits, a reduced complexity at the visits, and an intervention that is additional&#xD;
      to standard care but with no placebo control (Figure 1). Invitation letters are sent to all&#xD;
      patients, managed at the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Orebro University Hospital or&#xD;
      primary health care centers in Region Orebro County, with a doctor´s diagnosis of COPD, no&#xD;
      International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for cardiovascular diseases and no&#xD;
      present beta-blocker therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and follow-up will take place at the Clinical Research Support Center in Orebro. In&#xD;
      addition, several other Swedish centers for clinical trials have accepted to take part in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention with metoprolol at an aimed dose of 100 mg is prescribed electronically&#xD;
      through the ordinary record system, and with financial burdening of the project unless the&#xD;
      patient is already part of the high-cost protection for medication. A total of 1700 patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to standard care or intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated sample size and statistical power&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is calculated on the basis of: 1) an estimated overall 1-year risk of death of 1%&#xD;
      in this mixed cohort of patients with various stages of COPD, 2) a 1-year risk for COPD&#xD;
      exacerbations of 20% and 3) a 1-year risk of myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation,&#xD;
      other arrhythmias, heart failure, stroke, TIA or cerebral hemorrhage leading to&#xD;
      hospitalization of 2%. The combined 1-year primary endpoint is estimated at 23% (expected&#xD;
      survival probability of 0.77) for individuals randomized to usual standard care. With a 5%&#xD;
      two-sided alpha level and statistical power set to 80%, 763 patients in each group (total&#xD;
      n=1526) is needed to detect a 25% reduction of the primary endpoint in the beta blocker&#xD;
      group, corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.75. In order to control for dropouts and crossing&#xD;
      from one group to the other 1700 patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle. Differences between groups in the&#xD;
      time-to-event-end points will be assessed using the log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier methodology&#xD;
      and Cox proportional hazard model. Differences between study groups will be assessed with&#xD;
      unpaired t-tests on original scale or log scale as appropriate. Ordinal variables will be&#xD;
      assessed with chi-2 test for trend or Mann-Whitney U test, and Pearson's chi-square test or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test will be used to test differences between proportions. Subgroup analyses&#xD;
      will be carried out for patients with a resting heart rate of &lt;80 vs. ≥80 beats per minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedure and and study data base&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following written informed consent randomization is performed with a 1:1 allocation using the&#xD;
      Smart Trial system web page. A study data base with all patients included in the study will&#xD;
      be generated within the Smart-Trial system. The patients' identity will always be&#xD;
      confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with the principles of International Council for Harmonisation of Technical&#xD;
      Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use - Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP), monitoring&#xD;
      of the study will be arranged by the Sponsor and occur on site before, during and after the&#xD;
      trail. During the study, monitors will have regular contacts with the study site to ensure&#xD;
      that the study is conducted and documented properly in compliance with the protocol, Standard&#xD;
      Operating Procedures (SOPs), ICH-GCP and applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of monitoring visits will occur throughout the trial. The main part of the&#xD;
      monitoring will be centralized by regular checks of the data quality in the database. The&#xD;
      monitors will review source documents for verification of consistency with the study data&#xD;
      recorded in an electronic case report form (eCRF) according to risk based monitoring.&#xD;
      Investigators and other responsible personnel must be available during the monitoring visits,&#xD;
      possible audits and inspections and should devote sufficient time to these processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, applicable regulatory&#xD;
      requirements such as and the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki as adopted by&#xD;
      the 18th World Medical Assembly in Helsinki, Finland, in 1964 and subsequent versions. The&#xD;
      study is approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board of Uppsala, Sweden (DNr 2017-210B) and&#xD;
      the Swedish Medical Products Agency (EudraCT no: 2017-001507-76).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting procedures for Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only AE and SAE that are not considered as signs and symptoms expected and related to the&#xD;
      endpoints or known side effects from the study drug will be reported in this study. Events&#xD;
      defined as endpoints in the study (e.g. all-cause death, (cardiovascular events requiring&#xD;
      hospitalization or COPD exacerbations) will not be reported as AE. This means that other&#xD;
      clinical signs and symptoms, which are reported by the patient and observed by the&#xD;
      investigator, and in the opinion of the investigator are unexpected in relation to actual&#xD;
      diagnosis, will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Event (SUSAR) reporting procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the responsible investigator judges the SAE as being drug-related and unexpected (SUSAR)&#xD;
      the event must be reported to the sponsor within one working day. SUSARs will be reported&#xD;
      using the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) form&#xD;
      (http://www.cioms.ch/index.php/cioms-form-i) which will be sent to the Medical Products&#xD;
      Agency, since sponsor is not able to report electronically to the EudraVigilance database.&#xD;
      The sponsor is responsible for information to all involved investigators in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annual report&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safety report, including assessment of overall safety and all reported SUSARs will be&#xD;
      submitted yearly to the Regulatory Authorities and if requested to the Ethics Committee.&#xD;
