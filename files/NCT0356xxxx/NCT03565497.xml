      Specific Aims for this Project Are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the ability of two forms of mindfulness training, relative to a control&#xD;
           intervention, to engage specific &quot;triple-vulnerability&quot; mechanistic targets that&#xD;
           characterize low SES smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The investigators hypothesize that both versions of the mindfulness training will&#xD;
                show greater target engagement than the control treatment for mechanistic targets&#xD;
                assessed under standard smoking conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The investigators hypothesize that the enhanced mindfulness training,&#xD;
                Mindfulness+IE, will show greater target engagement than the other two conditions&#xD;
                for mechanistic targets assessed during the nicotine deprivation window.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To show that the hypothesized differential target engagement results in differential&#xD;
           smoking self-control as evaluated by greater time to lapse, fewer cigarettes smoked, and&#xD;
           different smoking topography in the McKee Lapse protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To expand and refine the list of SOBC targets by showing the specific relationship&#xD;
           between currently identified assays and empirically-validated alternative targets, with&#xD;
           attention to showing which of the targeted mechanisms in which contexts are most linked&#xD;
           to clinically-relevant outcomes assessed in the McKee protocol, and which offer&#xD;
           redundant or non-significant prediction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the success of mechanistic target engagement in two&#xD;
      specific contexts: under standard smoking conditions and under nicotine deprivation (stress)&#xD;
      conditions. After screening, consent, and baseline assessment, participants selected on the&#xD;
      basis of inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to one of three intervention&#xD;
      conditions: (1) a health-education control condition (CC), (2) a mindfulness training&#xD;
      condition (MT), or (3) a mindfulness training condition combined with training applying&#xD;
      mindfulness skills in the context of interoceptive exposure (Mindfulness+IE). Following 6&#xD;
      sessions of these interventions, delivered over 3 weeks, participants will then undergo the&#xD;
      standard smoking assessment of mechanistic targets. Two days later (and matching the&#xD;
      progression to quit-attempt challenges following treatment), participants will undergo the&#xD;
      deprivation window assessment (14 hours of smoking abstinence) of these same mechanistic&#xD;
      targets, followed by evaluation of lapse behavior and smoking topography in the McKee&#xD;
      paradigm to yield: (1) latency to initiate smoking during a monetarily reinforced delay&#xD;
      period, (2) the number of cigarettes smoked during a subsequent 60-minute self-administration&#xD;
      period, and (3) exploratory analysis of smoking topography: puff volume, puff duration, and&#xD;
      inter-puff interval. Participants will be recruited to Boston University through study&#xD;
      advertisements targeted to low SES neighborhoods, with attention to health service centers&#xD;
      and religious institutions serving low SES individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following telephone screening for basic eligibility, participants will be scheduled for an&#xD;
      informed consent interview and subsequent baseline assessment session. Interventions are to&#xD;
      be completed over the subsequent 3 weeks, and post-treatment assessments of the mechanistic&#xD;
      targets are scheduled for one-week (standard smoking assessment) and one week + 2 days&#xD;
      (deprivation-window assessment) from the last intervention session. For the standard smoking&#xD;
      window assessments, participants are asked to smoke .5 hour before the scheduled assessment&#xD;
      session. The deprivation-window assessment is scheduled two days later, (for example,&#xD;
      scheduled for 12:00 noon, with smoking to cease at 10PM the night before). Upon arrival to&#xD;
      the lab, nicotine abstinence will be verified by expired CO levels, as determined by a&#xD;
      cut-off of half of the participant's screening session CO concentration or &lt;10 PPM (those&#xD;
      failing will be rescheduled). After verification of abstinence, participants will complete&#xD;
      assessment of the triple-risk mechanistic target variables. These assessments will be&#xD;
      followed by the McKee Lapse protocol: participants will be instructed that over the next 50&#xD;
      min, they will have the option to initiate a cigarette self-administration (smoking) session&#xD;
      at any point or to delay initiation in exchange for monetary reinforcement. If participants&#xD;
      choose to delay, they will be awarded funds for each 5-minute increment they are able to&#xD;
      resist smoking. Once participants choose to end the delay period in order to smoke (or resist&#xD;
      smoking for the entire 50 minute delay period), they will then participate in a 60-minute&#xD;
      cigarette self-administration session, in which they will be given the choice to either smoke&#xD;
      their preferred brand of cigarettes or receive monetary reinforcement for cigarettes not&#xD;
      smoked. Participants will be given funds at the beginning of the self-administration session&#xD;
      and will lose a portion of the funds for each cigarette smoked. When participants smoke in&#xD;
      this protocol, we will use the Clinical Research Support System (CReSS) to measure smoking&#xD;
      topography. The reliability and acceptability of use of the portable CReSS device is well&#xD;
      documented,88,94 and is recommended over direct observation. Topography data will include&#xD;
      puff CO volume, puff duration, and inter-puff interval. Puff level data will be averaged to&#xD;
      compute mean topography variables for each participant.&#xD;

Content focuses on discussions of a variety of healthy lifestyle topics, such as healthy eating, time management, recommended health screenings, and cancer and cardiovascular prevention. Content is delivered using a combination of lectures, videos, handouts, and discussions while allowing participants to set their own realistic wellness goals, which they can gradually incorporate into their lives.</description>
