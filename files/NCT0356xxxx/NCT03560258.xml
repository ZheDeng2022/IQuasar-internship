      This study will evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and preliminary assessment of efficacy&#xD;
      of a novel vaccine encoding conserved elements (CE) of the HIV-1 Gag core protein, p24Gag, as&#xD;
      a therapeutic vaccine in HIV-1 infected persons who are on antiretroviral therapy (ART).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will randomly assign participants to one of three groups. Participants in Arm 1&#xD;
      will receive p24CE1/2 pDNA vaccine at Weeks 0 and 4, followed by p24CE1/2 pDNA admixed with&#xD;
      full-length p55^gag pDNA vaccine at Weeks 12 and 24. Participants in Arm 2 will receive&#xD;
      full-length p55^gag pDNA vaccine at Weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24. Participants in Arm 3 will&#xD;
      receive placebo at Weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur at Weeks 0, 4, 6, 12, 24, 26, and 48 and may include physical&#xD;
      examinations and blood and urine collection. Some participants may undergo leukapheresis and&#xD;
      stool sample collection.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or&#xD;
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and&#xD;
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than&#xD;
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA assay. NOTE:&#xD;
             The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a U.S. FDA-approved kit, which is required for all IND&#xD;
             studies. WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
             Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a&#xD;
             test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive&#xD;
             initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an&#xD;
             E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle&#xD;
             (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral&#xD;
             load.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving a stable ART regimen for a minimum of 2 years prior to study entry and with&#xD;
             no changes in the components of their antiretroviral therapy for at least 90 days&#xD;
             prior to study entry. One of the agents must include an integrase inhibitor,&#xD;
             non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), or a boosted-protease&#xD;
             inhibitor (PI). NOTE: Changes in the ART regimen for reasons other than virologic&#xD;
             breakthrough during the 2-year period are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD4 cell count greater than 500 cells/mm^3 obtained within 60 days prior to study&#xD;
             entry at any U.S. laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nadir CD4 cell count greater than 350 cells/mm^3. NOTE: Candidate recall or&#xD;
             documentation is acceptable.&#xD;

          -  One documented plasma HIV-1 RNA that is below the limit of detection of an&#xD;
             FDA-approved assay between 24 and 36 months prior to the screening HIV-1 RNA and/or&#xD;
             one documented plasma HIV-1 RNA that is below the limit of detection of an&#xD;
             FDA-approved assay between 12 and 24 months prior to the screening HIV-1 RNA, and one&#xD;

             collected fewer than 12 months prior to the screening HIV-1 RNA (see the protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: A single, unconfirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA above the limit of detection but&#xD;
                  less than 400 copies/mL is allowed if followed by an HIV-1 RNA below detectable&#xD;
                  limits, but not in the 6 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: One documented plasma HIV-1 RNA that is below the limit of detection&#xD;
                  between 24 and 36 months prior to the screening HIV-1 RNA and one between 12 and&#xD;
                  24 months prior to the screening HIV-1 RNA are preferred. However, in cases where&#xD;
                  a plasma HIV-1 RNA is not available in one of these windows, but there has been&#xD;
                  uninterrupted ART during the window and suppressed HIV-1 RNA before and after the&#xD;

                  post-menopausal as defined above, or women who have undergone surgical&#xD;
                  sterilization [e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation or&#xD;
                  salpingectomy]), she is eligible without requiring the use of a contraceptive&#xD;
                  method. Acceptable documentation of surgical sterilization and menopause is&#xD;
                  participant-reported history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Indication of willingness to have the leukapheresis procedure. NOTE: Until 60 days&#xD;
             after the last participating site is activated, each site will be limited to three&#xD;
             participants in screening/enrollment at any given time. During this time period, these&#xD;
             first three participants at each site will be required to agree at the screening visit&#xD;
             to undergo the leukaphereses at the pre-entry and week 26 timepoints. Once the 60 day&#xD;
             period after the last participating site is activated has passed, and at least 50% of&#xD;
             the target accrual has agreed to undergo the leukaphereses, a study participant&#xD;
             agreeing to the leukaphereses will be optional but highly recommended. The study team&#xD;
             will inform the participating sites when this leukapheresis-optional period has begun.&#xD;
