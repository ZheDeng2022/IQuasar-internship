      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Dose Escalation Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) in order to determine a maximally tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of REGN4018 as monotherapy and in combination&#xD;
      with cemiplimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Dose Expansion Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess the preliminary efficacy of REGN4018 as monotherapy and in combination with&#xD;
      cemiplimab, (separately by cohort) as determined by the objective response rate (ORR) by&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1&#xD;

    <description>Dose Expansion Phase&#xD;
The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item subject self-report questionnaire composed of both multi-item and single scales, including global health status/quality of life, functional Scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social) , symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Participants rate items on a 4-point scale, with 1 as &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 as &quot;very much.&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 62 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dose Expansion Phase&#xD;
MOST-T24 (MOST v2) (King et al. 2018) contains 24 of the original 35 items, focusing on symptoms (21 items) and well-being (3 items). The prevalence of each MOST item at assessment time points can be summarized by providing the mean, standard deviation and proportions based on the MOST response format, a numeric rating scale with integers from zero to 10, with five verbal anchors: 'No trouble at all' (0), 'Mild' (1-3), 'Moderate' (4-6), 'Severe' (7-10), and 'Worst I can imagine' (10). For all multi-item indexes, except the MOST-well-being index, compute the average of the component items (range 0-10) and then multiply this score by 10 (0-100 range). Thus, a higher score is equal to higher symptom burden. To calculate the MOST-Well-being index, repeat these same steps (i.e. take the average of the component items and multiply this score by 10) and then subtract this score from 100 so that a higher score is equal to greater well-being.</description>
