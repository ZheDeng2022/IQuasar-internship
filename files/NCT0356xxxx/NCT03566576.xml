    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the tolerability and toxicity of different&#xD;
      dose of Anlotinib puls Pemetrexed/Docetaxel in Second-line Treatment of Advanced Gene&#xD;
      Negative Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer , to provide a reference of dosage for Phase&#xD;
      II clinical trials&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single -center study conducted in China to compare the tolerability and&#xD;
      toxicity of different dose of Anlotinib Plus Pemetrexed / Docetaxel in patients of Advanced&#xD;
      Gene Negative Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.From low dose group up to high dose&#xD;
      group, each one had 3 patients at least.Primary group received anlotinib 8mg. The dose of&#xD;
      Anlotinib would increase gradually until MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized to arm A and arm B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: Patients were instructed to take folic acid 400ug orally daily beginning 1 week before&#xD;
      the first dose of pemetrexed and continuing daily until 3 weeks after the last dose of&#xD;
      pemetrexed. A 1000ug B12 injection was administered intramuscularly approximately 1 week&#xD;
      before the first dose of pemetrexed and was repeated approximately every 9 weeks until after&#xD;
      discontinuation. All target volumes were instructed to take dexamethasone (4 mg orally twice&#xD;
      daily the day before, the day of, and the day after pemetrexed) as a prophylactic measure&#xD;
      against skin rash. Patients on the pemetrexed arm received 500mg/m2 pemetrexed as a 10-minute&#xD;
      intravenous infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle and 8mg/10mg/12mg Anlotinib orally daily on&#xD;
      day 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: Patients on the docetaxel arm received 60mg/m2 docetaxel as a 10-minute intravenous&#xD;
      infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle and 8mg/10mg/12mg anlotinib orally daily on day 1to 14 of&#xD;
      a 21-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 18 patients will be enrolled to ensure that roughly 9 patients per arm complete&#xD;
      treatments for primary endpoint analysis.&#xD;

A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) event is defined as any of the following events:&#xD;
CTCAE Grade 4 event (ANC&lt;1000/ul, body temperature≥38.5°C);&#xD;
Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity (except for nausea and vomiting that could be improved with optimal supportive care, escalation of alkaline phosphatase) If a DLT is experienced in any cohort, the cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects. If 2 DLTs are experienced in any cohort, the dose escalation ceased. The MTD was defined as the dose having at most two out of six patients experience DLT.</description>
