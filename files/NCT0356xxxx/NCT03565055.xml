  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project aims at early detection, early intervention, and recovery of&#xD;
      individuals with psychosis and prevention of their family members who are at high risk of&#xD;
      having developmental problems and developing psychosis episode in later stages of their life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It consists of two major parts with the following study designs &amp; aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I : Developing a comprehensive and integrative psychosocial and community skills&#xD;
      training programme (IPCST) and conducing a pilot randomised controlled trial to compare the&#xD;
      study outcomes between the two settings in Hong Kong and Beijing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop IPCST as an innovative intervention model targeting individuals with first or&#xD;
           recent onset of psychosis to reduce their stay in mental hospital and bridges them to&#xD;
           independent living in the community with optimal social and professional support;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate IPCST in terms of the clinical, vocational, and psychosocial outcomes of&#xD;
           participants using a randomized controlled trial design and compare these outcomes&#xD;
           between Hong Kong and Beijing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the cost-effectiveness of IPCST in the two cities; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To train professionals and research personnel in Hong Kong and mainland for&#xD;
           implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Exploring the health needs of younger family members of individuals with early&#xD;
      psychosis and the strategies in preventing this clinical high risk group from developing&#xD;
      psychotic episode and developmental problems in later stages of their lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify the potential developmental problems or sufferings of theses younger family&#xD;
           members living with patients with mental illness;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To provide baseline assessment of their psychosocial stress, mental health, and quality&#xD;
           of life;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify interventions that may prevent them from developing psychosis and other&#xD;
           developmental problems and improve their mental health.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research is to develop and test on a pilot basis the clinical efficacy of the IPCST on&#xD;
      the clinical and recovery outcomes of outpatients with first and recent-onset psychosis in&#xD;
      one-year follow-up period in one regional outpatient care service of both Hong Kong and&#xD;
      Beijing, China. All outcomes will be assessed by a trained Research Assistant who is blind to&#xD;
      group assignment in each city separately. In Hong Kong, the study venue will be one Early&#xD;
      Assessment Service for Young People with Early Psychosis (EASY) in Kwai Chung Hospital under&#xD;
      the Kowloon West Hospital Cluster, Hospital Authority Hong Kong. In Beijing, the study venues&#xD;
      consist of the Sixth Hospital of Peking University, the Chaoyang Third Hospital, and the&#xD;
      Haidian Mental Health Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both sites, the study venues are serving for first or recent-onset psychosis residing in&#xD;
      the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to previous psychosocial interventional studies, the primary outcomes of this study&#xD;
      are patients' mental status and level of functioning. Secondary outcomes include the rate and&#xD;
      length of psychiatric hospitalizations, vocational status, social skills, family functioning,&#xD;
      and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 100 participants would be recruited for this project, 50 to be recruited from Hong&#xD;
      Kong Kwai Chung; 50 to be recruited from mainland China sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: Participants of this part will be randomly allocated to experimental or control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group participants will receive a 12-week, 48-hours of IPCST programme which&#xD;
      includes both individual and group training on psychoeducation, motivational interviewing&#xD;
      skills, neurocognitive and social cognition, and augmented supported employment with social&#xD;
      skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group participants will receive the usual psychiatric treatment they have been&#xD;
      receiving from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive assessment on their primary (symptom severity and functioning)&#xD;
      and secondary (re-hospitalisation rates, family functioning, social skills, and employment&#xD;
      status and satisfaction, and quality of life) outcomes at baseline and immediately (Post-test&#xD;
      1), 6 months (Post-test 2), and 12 months (Post-test 3) after completion of the interventions&#xD;
      by a research assistant. Each assessment episode lasts about 1.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Participants of this part will undergo a 30 minutes to 1 hour individual interview&#xD;
      conducted by a research assistant that covers semi-structured open-ended questions and basic&#xD;
      assessment of psychosocial stress, health and mental health status, and quality of life using&#xD;
      quantitative measures.&#xD;
