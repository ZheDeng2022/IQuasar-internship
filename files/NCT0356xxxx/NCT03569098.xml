    <measure>Least Square (LS) Mean Change From Baseline in the Daily Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) Score at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 in the double-blind treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The NPRS is a widely used and validated unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults. Participants were asked to rate the intensity of their foot pain during physical activity (example, walking, standing or running) based on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;worst possible pain&quot;. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome. Daily pain intensities were recorded by the participant using an electronic diary (eDiary) for 7 consecutive days prior to each study visit. Baseline was defined as the daily NPRS score averaged over the 7 consecutive days prior to the Baseline visit (Day 1).</description>

    <measure>LS Mean Change From Baseline in the Daily Modified Foot Function Index (mFFI) Disability Subscale Score at Weeks 4, 8 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 4, 8 and 12 in the double-blind treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The foot function index (FFI) was developed to assess foot-related pain, disability and activity limitations and later revised to include foot-related health and quality of life. A modified version of FFI specific to this study was used. The mFFI consists of a total of 21 items grouped into 3 subscales: pain (7 questions), disability (9 questions) and activity limitation (5 questions). The mFFI disability subscale is rated using numeric rating scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 represents &quot;no difficulty&quot; and 10 represents &quot;so difficult unable to do&quot;. For each item, the participant was asked to record the number value which best corresponded to effect of the foot complaints. To obtain a subscale score, the item scores for a given subscale (i.e., pain, disability or activity limitation subscales) were totaled and divided by maximum total possible and then multiplied by 100. Each subscale score, as well as the total score, ranged from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 8 and 12 in the double-blind treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a 36-item questionnaire which measures the extent to which physical health impacts an individual's functional ability and perceived wellbeing in mental, social, and physical aspects of life. The SF-36 has 8 subscales: physical function, role physical, bodily pain, global health, vitality, social function, role emotional and mental health. Each scale ranges from 0-100, where 0= lowest level of health and 100= highest level of health. Scores on these subscales can be aggregated into the physical component summary (physical function, role physical, bodily pain and global health) and mental component summary (mental health, vitality, social function and role emotional). Physical component summary score ranges from 0.65 to 80.73 and mental component summary score ranges from -8.81 to 81.65, where low score indicates lowest level of health and high score indicates highest level of health. Positive change from Baseline indicates an improvement in quality of life.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This Phase II double-blind study was conducted at 27 sites in the United States between 19 June 2018 and 22 May 2020 in adult participants suffering from clinically significant hallux abducto valgus (HV) who have not undergone surgery for their condition.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study consisted of a screening period (up to 3 weeks), followed by a double-blind treatment period (Cycle 1). From Week 12, retreatment criteria were evaluated every 4 weeks to determine eligibility to receive treatment in the open-label period (Cycles 2 and 3). Total study duration was a maximum of 36 weeks. A total of 186 participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups (placebo, Dysport 300 units (U) and Dysport 500 U) in the double-blind treatment period.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>On Cycle 1 Day 1 in the double-blind treatment period, participants received a single dose of placebo (matching with Dysport) intramuscular injection distributed between 4 injection points in the 4 targeted muscles of the study foot.&#xD;
Following the double-blind treatment period, all participants who met retreatment criteria were treated during the open-label period with Dysport 300 U on Cycle 2 Day 1 and either Dysport 300 U or 500 U on Cycle 3 Day 1.&#xD;
The 4 targeted muscles of the study foot were the oblique head of the adductor hallucis muscle, the transverse head of the adductor hallucis muscle, the flexor hallucis brevis muscle and the extensor hallucis brevis muscle.</description>

        <description>The NPRS is a widely used and validated unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults. Participants were asked to rate the intensity of their foot pain during physical activity (example, walking, standing or running) based on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;worst possible pain&quot;. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome. Daily pain intensities were recorded by the participant using an electronic diary (eDiary) for 7 consecutive days prior to each study visit. Baseline was defined as the daily NPRS score averaged over the 7 consecutive days prior to the Baseline visit (Day 1).</description>

        <title>LS Mean Change From Baseline in the Daily NPRS Score at Weeks 4 and 12</title>
        <description>The NPRS is a widely used and validated unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults. Participants were asked to rate the intensity of their foot pain during physical activity (example, walking, standing or running) based on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;worst possible pain&quot;. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome. Daily pain intensities were recorded by the participant using an eDiary for 7 consecutive days prior to each study visit. Baseline was defined as the daily NPRS score averaged over the 7 consecutive days prior to the Baseline visit (Day 1).</description>

        <population>The ITT analysis set included all randomized participants. For participants without any available post-Baseline NPRS average scores, the Weeks 4 and 12 average pain scores were imputed.</population>

        <title>LS Mean Change From Baseline in the Daily Modified Foot Function Index (mFFI) Disability Subscale Score at Weeks 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>The foot function index (FFI) was developed to assess foot-related pain, disability and activity limitations and later revised to include foot-related health and quality of life. A modified version of FFI specific to this study was used. The mFFI consists of a total of 21 items grouped into 3 subscales: pain (7 questions), disability (9 questions) and activity limitation (5 questions). The mFFI disability subscale is rated using numeric rating scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 represents &quot;no difficulty&quot; and 10 represents &quot;so difficult unable to do&quot;. For each item, the participant was asked to record the number value which best corresponded to effect of the foot complaints. To obtain a subscale score, the item scores for a given subscale (i.e., pain, disability or activity limitation subscales) were totaled and divided by maximum total possible and then multiplied by 100. Each subscale score, as well as the total score, ranged from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome.</description>

          <title>LS Mean Change From Baseline in the Daily mFFI Pain Subscale Score at Weeks 4, 8 and 12</title>
          <description>The FFI was developed to assess foot-related pain, disability and activity limitations and later revised to include foot-related health and quality of life. A modified version of the FFI specific to this study was used. The mFFI consists of a total of 21 items grouped into 3 subscales: pain (7 questions), disability (9 questions) and activity limitation (5 questions). The mFFI pain subscale is rated using numeric rating scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;. For each item, the participant was asked to record the number value which best corresponded to the effect of the foot complaints. To obtain a subscale score, the item scores for a given subscale (i.e., pain, disability or activity limitation subscales) were totaled and divided by the maximum total possible and then multiplied by 100. Each subscale score, as well as the total score, ranged from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome.</description>

A modified version of the FFI specific to this study was used. The mFFI consists of a total of 21 items grouped into three subscales: pain (7 questions), disability (9 questions) and activity limitation (5 questions). The mFFI items are rated using numeric rating scales ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 represents &quot;no pain/no difficulty/none of the time&quot; and 10 represents &quot;worst pain imaginable/so difficult unable to do/all of the time&quot; for pain, disability and activity limitation subscales, respectively. For each item, the participant was asked to record the number value which best corresponded to the effect of the foot complaints. To obtain a total score, the scores of all 3 subscales were totaled and divided by 3. Each subscale score, as well as the total score, ranged from 0 to 100.

To obtain a subscale score, the item scores for a given subscale (i.e., pain, disability or activity limitation subscales) were totaled and divided by the maximum total possible and then multiplied by 100. Each subscale score, as well as the total score, ranged from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>LS Mean Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) of Foot Pain Score at Weeks 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>An assessment of PGI-I of foot pain was conducted by the participant using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from -3= very much worse to +3= very much improved. Higher scores indicate a better outcome. The PGI-I was assessed by the participant answering the following question: &quot;Compared to your foot pain prior to the study treatment initiation, your foot pain while performing physical activities (example, standing, walking or running) now is: +3=very much improved; +2=much improved; +1=minimally improved; 0=no change; -1=minimally worse; -2=much worse; -3=very much worse&quot;.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Score at Weeks 8 and 12</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is a 36-item questionnaire which measures the extent to which physical health impacts an individual's functional ability and perceived wellbeing in mental, social, and physical aspects of life. The SF-36 has 8 subscales: physical function, role physical, bodily pain, global health, vitality, social function, role emotional and mental health. Each scale ranges from 0-100, where 0= lowest level of health and 100= highest level of health. Scores on these subscales can be aggregated into the physical component summary (physical function, role physical, bodily pain and global health) and mental component summary (mental health, vitality, social function and role emotional). Physical component summary score ranges from 0.65 to 80.73 and mental component summary score ranges from -8.81 to 81.65, where low score indicates lowest level of health and high score indicates highest level of health. Positive change from Baseline indicates an improvement in quality of life.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Based on the results of the primary analysis the sponsor terminated the study early due to lack of efficacy of the tested doses at the primary endpoint. The decision by the sponsor to terminate the study early was not related to any safety or tolerability concerns with Dysport.</limitations_and_caveats>
