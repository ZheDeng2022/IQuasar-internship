      The purpose of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective randomized study with 2 years of follow-up we want to compare the migration&#xD;
      of the uncemented trabecular metal (TM) versus the cemented tibial and femoral components of&#xD;
      the new Persona® total knee arthroplasty (TKA) assessed by model based radiostereometric&#xD;
      analysis (MB-RSA). Also, we want to compare the adaptive bone remodeling induced by the&#xD;
      uncemented TM versus the cemented tibial and femoral components of the new Persona® TKA&#xD;
      assessed by dual energy-X-ray (DEXA). Data generated for both above mentioned, will be also&#xD;
      compared with historical RSA and DEXA data for the NexGen TKA using TM tibia modular and&#xD;
      monoblock.&#xD;

      Detailed Description: Main Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The uncemented TM Zimmer Persona® TKA will have migration on the same level as the&#xD;
           cemented Zimmer Persona® TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The uncemented TM Zimmer Persona® TKA will have less loss of BMD compared to the&#xD;
           cemented version of the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective randomized study where the patients scheduled for TKA are randomized to receive&#xD;
      tibial and femoral components with two different fixation modes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: an uncemented TM Zimmer Persona® TKA (uncemented tibia and femur components).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: a cemented Zimmer Persona® TKA (cemented tibia and femur components). Operation:&#xD;
      Operation Planning of the operations are performed based upon standing knee X-rays (not&#xD;
      involving the ankle and hip joint) and no preoperative templating is performed. The&#xD;
      operations are performed at the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Gentofte Hospital by three&#xD;
      experienced TKA surgeons that will be included in the research group. All patellas will be&#xD;
      resurfaced with a cemented all polyethylene patella component. During surgery the patients&#xD;
      participating in the study will be prepared for MB-RSA by insertion of a minimum of 6&#xD;
      Tantalum markers (0.8 mm) in the bone of the proximal tibia and 6 markers in the distal&#xD;
      femur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous antibiotics (1.5g Cefuroxim) are administered three times during the first day&#xD;
      and night of surgery and low molecular weight heparin is administered for prevention of deep&#xD;
      venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Local analgesics (Naropin ®, Toradol ®) are&#xD;
      injected in the knee joint and in the soft tissue around the knee during surgery.&#xD;
      Physiotherapy begins on the day of surgery and the patients will be mobilized with full&#xD;
      weight-bearing using crutches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical examination (n=60): preoperatively and with follow-up after 1 and 2 years with&#xD;
           evaluation of the knee function using the Knee Society's Knee Scoring System.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient-reported outcome measurements (n=60). Obtained preoperatively and after 1 and 2&#xD;
           years using the Oxford knee score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Conventional X-rays (n=60) are obtained preoperatively (standing knee X-rays (not&#xD;
           involving the ankle and hip joint)), with classification of the degree of arthrosis&#xD;
           estimating the Ahlbäck score. X-rays are also obtained postoperatively before the&#xD;
           patients are discharged and after 1 year and 2 years with the aim of evaluating knee&#xD;
           alignment, and development of osteolytic lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. CT-scans (n=60) 3 months postoperatively for measurements of hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle,&#xD;
           and component slope, rotation, and size matching.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Special X-rays suitable for MB-RSA measurements (n=60) of migration of the tibial and&#xD;
           femoral components is performed within the first week after the operation and after 3,&#xD;
           6, 12, and 24 months. The precision of the RSA measurements is estimated from double&#xD;
           examinations in 12 patients of the study. RSA X-rays will be performed using a biplane&#xD;
           RSA arrangement with a 90° angle between the two X-ray tubes (Calibration cage 21; Tilly&#xD;
           Medical Products AB, Lund, Sweden) and analysis of X-rays will be performed by the&#xD;
           MB-RSA commercial software (RSAcore, Department of Orthopedics, Leiden University&#xD;
           Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands), available at the Skaane University Hospital,&#xD;
           Lund, Sweden. The manufacturer (Zimmer Biomet) will provide the CAD models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. DEXA analysis of the adaptive changes in BMD of the periprosthetic bone of the distal&#xD;
           femur and proximal tibia. DEXA analysis will be performed preoperatively of the distal&#xD;
           femur (lateral projection) and proximal tibia (coronal projection) as baseline, then&#xD;
           again within the first postoperative week and subsequently at 3 months, 6 months, 1&#xD;
           year, and 2 years. The precision of the BMD measurements of the proximal tibia and&#xD;
           distal femur will be estimated from double measurements of patients (n=12) included in&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of sample size MB-RSA There exist only three previously published studies&#xD;
      measuring femoral component migration. In all studies the marker-based RSA technique was&#xD;
      used, and none of them presented results with mean and standard deviation (SD). However, one&#xD;
      study gave the results as mean MTPM, and we chose the mean MTPM after 2 years of follow-up&#xD;
      (0.88 mm for cemented components) as our primary effect parameter, used in the sample size&#xD;
      calculation. The rationale for using MTPM two years postoperatively, is because it has been&#xD;
      shown to be the best predictor for later aseptic loosening of the tibial component after&#xD;
      primary TKA. SD was estimated from the most recently published study using MB-RSA for&#xD;
      evaluation of cemented tibial component migration. In that study, the mean (+/- SD) MTPM&#xD;
      after 2 years of follow-up was 0.47 (+/- 0.16) and 0.45 (+/-0.21) in the two study groups.&#xD;
      Since the level of MTPM of the tibial components was substantially lower than seen for the&#xD;
      above mentioned femoral components. We adjusted the SD in the sample size calculation to&#xD;
      constitute the same percentages of the mean values as in the tibial component MB-RSA study by&#xD;
      Ejaz et al. (2015). Since the previously published studies measuring femoral component&#xD;
      migration did not find any statistically significant difference between cemented and&#xD;
      uncemneted fixation we selected a relatively low minimum relevant difference (MIREDIF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type I error = 5% Statistical power = 85 % MIREDIF 0.3 mm SD = 0.35 mm Sample size&#xD;
      calculation resulted in a sample size of n = 24 in each group. In the study we have planned&#xD;
      to include and randomize (block-randomization with 10 in each block) a total of 60 patients.&#xD;
      This will secure a high statistical power even if some of the participants should drop out&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEXA&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data for the sample size calculations were obtained from new DEXA data for our own&#xD;
      research group: data from a study evaluating the adaptive bone remodeling around the&#xD;
      Vanguard® uncemented porous-coated femoral component with one year of follow-up. Using&#xD;
      one-year follow-up data could be justified because the decrease in BMD seen beyond the first&#xD;
      postoperative year is very limited in most studies. We considered a difference of 8% between&#xD;
      groups to be a clinically relevant difference that we wanted to be able to detect with a high&#xD;
      statistical power:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type I error = 5% Statistical power = 90 % MIREDIF 8% SD = 8.4% Sample size calculation&#xD;
      resulted in a sample size of n = 25 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study we have planned to include and randomize (block-randomization with 10 in each&#xD;
      block) a total of 60 patients. This will secure a high statistical power even if some of the&#xD;
      participants should drop out during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations We do not expect that the patients participating in the study will&#xD;
      experience any special side effects or complications related to the use of the two TKAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has not been performed any fundamental changes in implant design compared to other&#xD;
      types of standard TKAs and the implant fixation modes (cemented or uncemented with a TM&#xD;
      ingrowth surface) are well known and in wide spread use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation dose to the patients from MB-RSA X-rays and DEXA is relatively low compared with&#xD;
      many conventional X-ray examinations.The total accumulated radiation dose to a patient&#xD;
      participating in all examinations during the study is estimated to be approximately 2 mSv.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tantalum has been used for more than 50 years and is a very biocompatible material without&#xD;
      any tendency to corrosion.Tantalum beads for RSA have been used in several clinical studies&#xD;
      for more than 20 years. More than 20.000 beads have been implanted in more than 2.000&#xD;
      patients and no side effects from Tantalum beads have been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation will be performed in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration, and all patients will receive both oral and written information before informed&#xD;
      consent to participate is obtained. At any time being the patient will be able to cancel&#xD;
      participation (also without any explanation) in this investigation. The patient will receive&#xD;
      the best possible treatment in any circumstances. The study will not be started until&#xD;
      approval from the Scientific Ethical Committee of the Capital Region of Denmark and the&#xD;
      Danish Data Protection Agency has been obtained, and it will be registered at&#xD;
      clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and inconveniences:This investigation will not add to the general risks of getting TKA.&#xD;
      Patients participating must accept some inconvenience in terms of additional examinations and&#xD;
      hence transportation to and from the hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events: All adverse events will be recorded in the CRF and will include details&#xD;
      concerning the nature, onset, duration, severity, relationship to the device and relationship&#xD;
      to the operative procedure and outcome. The affected patient(s) will be questioned about any&#xD;
      adverse event(s) at each subsequent follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients experiencing adverse events will be relevantly monitored by clinical assessment and&#xD;
      lab examinations decided by the treating physician. All adverse events will be monitored&#xD;
      until recovery or stabilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information and consent Patients who are planned to receive a TKA (and fits within the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study) at Gentofte Hospital will be informed about&#xD;
      the trial in the preoperative interview. In addition to the oral information provided, the&#xD;
      patients will be given written information. This conversation will take place in an enclosed&#xD;
      space without distractions or interruptions. The patient will receive adequate verbal and&#xD;
      written information about the purposes, processes, potential benefits and risks including&#xD;
      possible side effects. Investigator will ensure all patients have read and understood the&#xD;
      information and consent form. Patients will be informed that they are entitled to&#xD;
      consideration before consent is given. The subjects will also be informed that it is&#xD;
      voluntary and that they at any time may withdraw from the trial. It is the investigator's&#xD;
      responsibility to ensure the above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be obtained written informed consent from all subjects before enrollment, and a&#xD;
      copy of the information and consent form will be given to the subjects.Existing legislations&#xD;
      made by the Scientific Ethical Committee regarding informed consent will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data protection All information will be kept confidential, and all data handled according the&#xD;
      guidelines of the Danish Data Protection agency. The persons involved in this trial are&#xD;
      obliged to professional secrecy. The investigator will maintain a list of identification of&#xD;
      all enrolled patients. This list will contain the patients' full names and dates of birth&#xD;
      (including social security numbers (CPR-numbers)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected data will be recorded in a case report form (CRF). CRFs and the medical records&#xD;
      will be made available to third parties according to Danish law. Patients will be informed in&#xD;
      writing that the results will be stored and analyzed in a computer which preserve patients'&#xD;
      anonymity and that the local laws regarding personal data will be complied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also receive written information concerning the possibility of audit from the&#xD;
      public authorities, and patients will be informed that the GCP unit of Copenhagen University&#xD;
      Hospital likewise is granted access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator ensures that the project will follow the rules of Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
