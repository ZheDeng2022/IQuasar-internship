      This is an international (North America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia), multi-center,&#xD;
      prospective, open-label treatment study, designed to continue to provide the study medication&#xD;
      to all patients who completed 12 months of treatment (including those treated with placebo)&#xD;
      in the IEDAT-02-2015 trial, completed the study assessments, do not present safety&#xD;
      contraindication to continuation of treatment, and provided informed consent. The study aims&#xD;

      This is an international (North America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia), multi-center,&#xD;
      prospective, open-label treatment study, designed to continue to provide the study medication&#xD;
      to all patients who completed 12 months of treatment (including those treated with placebo)&#xD;
      in the IEDAT-02-2015 trial, completed the study assessments, do not present safety&#xD;
      contraindication to continuation of treatment, and provided informed consent. The study aims&#xD;
      to collect information on the long-term safety and efficacy of the trial treatment. Patients&#xD;
      meeting all selection criteria will receive monthly infusions of EDS-EP (dose range of ~14-22&#xD;
      mg DSP/infusion). If this dose of EDS-EP is not tolerated, the patient should be discontinued&#xD;
      from the study. During the study, long-term efficacy assessments will be performed every 6&#xD;
      months, while safety parameters will be assessed at each monthly visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ICARS, EQ-5D-5L and the CGI-C/S will be administered by a site rater. All patients&#xD;
      enrolled in this study will have participated in Study IEDAT-02-2015, and there will be no de&#xD;
      novo enrollment of new patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator will ask all patients who meet the above requirements, and&#xD;
      determine their interest in continuing to receive treatment with the study medication in a&#xD;
      new protocol. The Principal Investigator will then determine the eligibility of the patients&#xD;
      on the basis of his/her clinical judgement of patients' status and their safety.&#xD;
