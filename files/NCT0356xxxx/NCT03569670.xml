  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control trial where patients will be randomized to receive one of two&#xD;
      types of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) all-polyethylene (AP) tibial components: cruciate&#xD;
      retaining (CR) or posterior stabilized (PS). We will use radiostereometric analysis to assess&#xD;
      the stability of the implants at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 year&#xD;
      post-operatively. The main objective of this project will be to determine which AP tibial&#xD;
      component offers the greatest stability. Additionally, we will seek to determine whether&#xD;
      patient BMI significantly impacts the stability of AP tibial components.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With healthcare expenditures rising as our population ages, there have been significant&#xD;
      efforts targeted towards streamlining costs associated with various medical treatments. One&#xD;
      area of substantial spending in the orthopaedic surgery field is total joint replacements.&#xD;
      The effort to reduce costs has sparked a renewed interest in the use of allpolyethylene (AP)&#xD;
      tibial components in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, there has been ample research demonstrating that AP tibial components have&#xD;
      performed as good as, or better, than metal-backed (MB) tibial components. Some studies have&#xD;
      estimated that cost savings could be as high as 50% with routine use of AP tibial components.&#xD;
      While sufficient literature exists demonstrating the equivalence or superiority of AP versus&#xD;
      MB designs, there is a paucity of work done comparing different types of AP tibial&#xD;
      components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tibial components in TKA can be of the posterior stabilizing (PS) or cruciate retaining (CR)&#xD;
      variety. To date, we are unaware of any study that directly compares AP tibial PS components&#xD;
      to AP tibial CR components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) has evolved as an exceptionally precise and reliable method&#xD;
      for assessing the migration of components in total joint arthroplasty. Using RSA data, it is&#xD;
      possible to accurately predict, within the first 24 months post-operatively, the survival of&#xD;
      a total joint arthroplasty. Furthermore, the use of RSA outcomes in arthroplasty research&#xD;
      allows for adequately powered studies with significantly smaller sample sizes than previously&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project will be to determine which AP tibial component offers the&#xD;
      greatest stability. Additionally, we will seek to determine whether patient body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) significantly impacts the stability of AP tibial components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will prospectively enroll patients who will be undergoing a total knee arthroplasty by one&#xD;
      of the study investigators. Potentially eligible patients will have the project explained to&#xD;
      them during their preadmission clinic visit prior to surgery and if interested a member of&#xD;
      the research team will perform the informed consent process. Should a patient elect to&#xD;
      participate in the study they will sign the informed consent form and complete demographics&#xD;
      and baseline health related quality of life questionnaires including Oxford Knee, EQ-5D, and&#xD;
      the VR-12, in addition to the Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index&#xD;
      (WOMAC) which is already completed as per standard of care. The baseline demographic&#xD;
      characteristics that will be collected include age, BMI, gender, and relevant medical&#xD;
      comorbidities. Patients will be randomized to have either a PS or CR all-poly tibial&#xD;
      component used during surgery. Randomization will be stratified by BMI to ensure equal&#xD;
      distribution in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery the surgeon will insert 6-9 tantalum beads in the proximal tibial, 6 beads in&#xD;
      the polyeythylene tray, and another bead into the tip of the polyethylene stem. These beads&#xD;
      will be used to measure migration of the implants on RSA imaging (radiostereometric&#xD;
      analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RSA x-rays will be taken at baseline (2 weeks) and at the 6-week, 3 months, 6 months and&#xD;
      1 year and 2 year follow-up appointments. These images will be taken at Robarts Research&#xD;
      Institute in the RSA analysis suite. At the 3month, 6 month, 1 year and 2 year visits we will&#xD;
      also collect health related quality of life questionnaires including the WOMAC, Oxford Knee,&#xD;
      EQ-5D and the VR-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and data collector will be blinded to treatment arm. The person who will analyze the&#xD;
      RSA images will be able to see which treatment arm participants belong to (based on viewing&#xD;
      xrays) however the hypothesis of the study will not be revealed to them prior to analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative cost information will also be collected using institutional cost data in&#xD;
      order to compare differences in OR costs between the two implant designs and across BMI&#xD;
      categories.&#xD;
