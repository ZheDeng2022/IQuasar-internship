      The good clinical practice guidelines for the surveillance of workers after occupational&#xD;
      exposure to lung carcinogens were approved by the Haute Autorité de la Santé (French National&#xD;
      Authority for Health) and the Institut National du Cancer (French National Cancer Institute)&#xD;
      in December 2015 and one recommendation of these guidelines concerns the setting-up of a&#xD;
      trial of low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) lung cancer screening in subjects&#xD;
      occupationally exposed to lung carcinogens at high-risk of lung cancer (Expert consensus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In LUCSO study, the investigators propose to conduct, under strictly defined conditions, a&#xD;
      feasibility study of lung cancer screening in a population defined as being at high risk of&#xD;
      lung cancer according to these good clinical practice guidelines. This population consists of&#xD;
      smokers, aged from 55 to 74 years, currently or previously exposed to International Agency&#xD;
      for Research on Cancer lung group 1 lung carcinogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the complex organization of lung cancer&#xD;
      screening in the target population. This evaluation will focus on the following indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening activity indicator: screening coverage rate over two years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test quality indicator: validity of self-administered questionnaires to target the&#xD;
           high-risk population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination quality indicator: lung cancer detection rate, lung cancer detection rates&#xD;
           by stage, validity of low-dose chest CT scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up indicator: smoking cessation rate, mortality rate This trial will be conducted&#xD;
           in 8 French departments, by six reference centers specialized in occupational health&#xD;
           (SRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the exploratory nature of this trial, it is proposed to initially test the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of lung cancer screening sequentially over the first two years&#xD;
      (Phase 1: 2021-2023, 24 months) in only two SRC (Val-de-Marne and Gironde).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted in several steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of subjects currently or previously occupationally exposed to lung&#xD;
           carcinogens by a screening invitation letter sent by Departmental Cancer Screening&#xD;
           Centers to subjects aged from 55 to 74 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation of occupational exposure to lung carcinogens&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluation of the lung cancer risk level and verification of eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Screening procedure: Chest CT scans will be performed by centers specialized in chest&#xD;
           imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Lung cancer follow-up when an abnormality suggestive of lung cancer is demonstrated.&#xD;

      The good clinical practice guidelines for the surveillance of workers after occupational&#xD;
      exposure to lung carcinogens were approved by the Haute Autorité de la Santé (French National&#xD;
      Authority for Health) and the Institut National du Cancer (French National Cancer Institute)&#xD;
      in December 2015 and the Recommendation R12 of these guidelines concerns the setting-up of a&#xD;
      trial of low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) lung cancer screening in subjects&#xD;
      occupationally exposed to lung carcinogens at high-risk of lung cancer (Expert consensus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In LUCSO study, the investigators propose to conduct, under strictly defined conditions, a&#xD;
      feasibility study of lung cancer screening in a population defined as being at high risk of&#xD;
      lung cancer according to these good clinical practice guidelines. This population consists of&#xD;
      smokers, aged from 55 to 74 years, currently or previously exposed to International Agency&#xD;
      for Research on Cancer lung group 1 lung carcinogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the organization of lung cancer screening&#xD;
      in the target population. This evaluation will focus on the following indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening activity indicator: screening coverage rate over two years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test quality indicator: validity of self-administered questionnaires to target the&#xD;
           high-risk population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination quality indicator: lung cancer detection rate, lung cancer detection rates&#xD;
           by stage, validity of low-dose chest CT scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up indicator: smoking cessation rate, mortality rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the population recruited in each step of the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop a tool to identify subjects exposed to pulmonary carcinogens and with high-risk&#xD;
           of lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the impact of the proposed screening programme on smoking cessation at one, two&#xD;
           and three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the social impact of the screening campaign&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the programme&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will take place in multidisciplinary and specialized reference centers&#xD;
      (SRC) in various French districts participating in the programme, to welcome patients&#xD;
      participating. It is organized into six workpackages (WP):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WP1: Methodology - Epidemiology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WP2: Evaluation of occupational exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WP3: Imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WP4: Lung cancer follow-up strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WP5: Smoking cessation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WP6: Medico-economic analysis Six specialized reference centers are proposed in four&#xD;
           different regions in order to test a potential region effect and to allow the&#xD;
           recruitment by each SRC of about 200 to 600 new eligible subjects per year and per&#xD;
           department according to the population and the age pyramid of each department&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SRC1: Centre Intercommunal de Créteil for the Val-de-Marne (94), Seine-et-Marne (77),&#xD;
           and Essonne (91) departments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SRC2: Bordeaux University Hospital for the Gironde (33) department&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SRC3: Rennes University Hospital for the Ille-et-Vilaine (35) department&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SRC4: Brest University Hospital for the Finistère (29) department&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SRC5: Caen University Hospital for the Calvados (14) department&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SRC6: Rouen University Hospital for the Seine-Maritime (76) department&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of these centers is voluntary and possesses the four essential prerequisites: an&#xD;
      occupational health clinic - radiology team with specific skills in chest imaging -&#xD;
      pulmonology team or network of pulmonologists specialized in lung cancer - smoking cessation&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the complexity of this organization, it is proposed to initially test the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of the screening programme sequentially for the first two years&#xD;
      (24 months) in two SRCs (SRC1 and SRC2): &quot;Phase 1: 2021-2023&quot;. It is expected to extend the&#xD;
      study to the other SRCs after two years: &quot;Phase 2: 2023-2029&quot;. Ad hoc adjustments will be&#xD;
      decided for the creation of SRCs in the third year on the basis of the data acquired in the&#xD;
      two pilot departments, especially on the expected target population participation rate.&#xD;
      Mortality will be monitored at least until 2031.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted in several steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of subjects currently or previously occupationally exposed to lung&#xD;
           carcinogens by a screening invitation letter sent by Departmental Cancer Screening&#xD;
           Centers to subjects aged from 55 to 74 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation of occupational exposure to lung carcinogens&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluation of the lung cancer risk level and verification of eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Screening procedure: Chest CT scans will be performed by centers specialized in chest&#xD;
           imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Lung cancer follow-up when an abnormality suggestive of lung cancer is demonstrated.&#xD;
