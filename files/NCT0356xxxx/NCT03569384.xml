      Introduction In order to guarantee chronic patients and elderly a high quality service from&#xD;
      health care organizations in the coming decades, new technologies have been implemented to&#xD;
      treat patients from a distance. There is still a need for more studies on the efficacy and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of tele-rehabilitation (TR) and its long-term effects needs also to be&#xD;
      determined. To guarantee individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) a&#xD;
      high quality service from health care organizations in the coming decades and economically&#xD;
      save the national health systems for an expensive bill for the treatment of COPD, new actions&#xD;
      plans has to be taken into use. Hereby, more patients can be treated with less human&#xD;
      resources while still sustaining or even improving today's services. The importance of such&#xD;
      welfare action plans has to maintain a high quality of service that individuals with COPD are&#xD;
      willing to accept. Here, TR seems to be a good welfare action plans. Despite proof of&#xD;
      improved cost-effectiveness, no studies support the benefits of TR in COPD patient with&#xD;
      respect to adherence, security, treatment efficacy and improved quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To assess and compare the feasibility and effect of a tele-rehabilitation program with a&#xD;
      new and innovative TR platform (NITRP) compared to standard treatment with respect to&#xD;
      exercise capacity, quality of life and activities of daily living in patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method and material The study is a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the&#xD;
      effects of tele-rehabilitation and conventional rehabilitation in patients with severe COPD.&#xD;
      54 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be randomized in two groups to either a 8&#xD;
      week tele-rehabilitation program or a conventional COPD rehabilitation program at the&#xD;
      hospital. Participants will be tested at baseline, 8 weeks, 3 and 6 months after cessation of&#xD;
      the training programs. In the intervention group, a real- and a virtual physiotherapist agent&#xD;
      will facilitate the rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations This study will not pose any risk to the patient as compared to&#xD;
      current practice. Participation is voluntary and the patient may at any time withdraw from&#xD;
      the study without consequences for future care or treatment. The questionnaires and the test&#xD;
      methods used are clinically recognized instruments. Signed informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      from the all participants after verbal and written information and before the study starts.&#xD;
      The study will not be initiated before approval from the Ethics Committee and the Data&#xD;
      Protection Agency has been obtained. The study will follow the general research ethical rules&#xD;
      as expressed in the Helsinki Declaration II.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      To guarantee chronic patients and elderly a high quality service from health care&#xD;
      organizations in the coming decades, new technologies has been implemented to treat patients&#xD;
      from a distance. This document reflects the latest research studies based on&#xD;
      tele-rehabilitation (TR), its application in chronic lung diseases and the topics that still&#xD;
      needs to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tele-rehabilitation Studies of TR in patients with lymphedema (Galiano-Castillo et al., 2014)&#xD;
      or COPD (Paneroni et al., 2014)(Tousignant et al., 2012)(Dinesen, Seeman, and Gustafsson,&#xD;
      2011)(Dinesen, Huniche, and Toft, 2013) or in the orthopedic areas as, lower back&#xD;
      (Palacín-Marín, Esteban-Moreno, Olea, Herrera-Viedma, &amp; Arroyo-Morales, 2013), knee (Cabana&#xD;
      et al., 2010) (Tousignant, Moffet, et al., 2011) (Tousignant, Boissy, et al., 2011) and&#xD;
      shoulder (Eriksson, Lindström, Gard, &amp; Lysholm, 2009)(Eriksson, Lindström, &amp; Ekenberg, 2011)&#xD;
      show that tele-technology has been developed to a level where it is possible to treat, test&#xD;
      and follow-up patients from a distance. Patients who have not been offered such solutions&#xD;
      face increased risks of hospital-acquired infections (Dancer, 2009) and longer travel and&#xD;
      waiting time to get treated. The public sector expects higher expenditure due to treatment&#xD;
      and transportation cost, specifically in chronic patients and the elderly whose numbers tends&#xD;
      to increase according to demographics trend (Palacín-Marín et al., 2013)(Barros, Francisco,&#xD;
      Zanchetta, &amp; César, 2011)(Parker &amp; Thorslund, 2007)(Yach, Hawkes, Gould, and Hofman, 2004).&#xD;
      Such facts points to the need of creating and improving solutions that overcome such health&#xD;
      care challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TR seems to be a good approach to reach patients in low inhabited areas (Hill and Sppath,&#xD;
      2010), changing health care to self-care (Haarder, 2011), empowering patient's awareness of&#xD;
      their disease and increasing the flexibility patients need to acquire to obtain healthier&#xD;
      behaviors. Although the interest in TR research is high, there is still a need for more&#xD;
      studies on the efficacy (Paneroni et al., 2014) and cost-effectiveness of TR (Paneroni et&#xD;
      al., 2014) (Langberg, Lindahl, Kidholm, and Dinesen, 2014) just as the long-term effects of&#xD;
      TR have to be determined (Langberg et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) COPD is among the most resource costly diseases&#xD;
      we face in our century (Kjøller, Juel, and Kamper-Jørgensen, 2007). In Denmark, approximately&#xD;
      430,000 people have COPD of which around 50,000 have severe COPD (Kirkegaard N, Brandt A,&#xD;
      Timm H, 2013)(Mannino, Doherty, and Sonia Buist, 2006). Eriksen (Eriksen and Vestbo, 2010)&#xD;
      states that up to 42.3% of patients with COPD discharged from hospitals are readmitted the&#xD;
      following year, and 17% of patients treated in emergency departments require hospitalization.&#xD;
      Danish pulmonary physicians concluded that COPD cost the Danish society three billion DKK in&#xD;
      2002 (Hos, 2007) where up to 20% of the most severe COPD patients consume over 70% of the&#xD;
      total health expenditure (Jansson et al., 2002). Nowadays, some municipalities have already&#xD;
      problems with offering rehabilitation services to all COPD patients in some areas in Denmark&#xD;
      (Kjøller et al., 2007). Actions implementing TR for COPD patients have been started and&#xD;
      research begins to show some improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD The objective of treatment for patients with COPD is to&#xD;
      delay the progression of the disease, prevent acute exacerbations, improve quality of life,&#xD;
      reduce symptoms and reduce mortality. Rehabilitation of COPD includes among others physical&#xD;
      training and patient education (Sundhedsstyrelsen, 2007). There is a need for an improved&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of exacerbations (Barnes, Calverley, Kaplan, &amp; Rabe, 2013). Despite&#xD;
      the poor evidence about determinants of physical activity and impact of treatment in COPD&#xD;
      patients (Gimeno-Santos et al., 2014), a wide range of interventions are commonly used by&#xD;
      physiotherapist to treat individuals with COPD (Kozu et al., 2011),(Kenn, Gloeckl, and Behr,&#xD;
      2013) (Garrod and Lasserson, 2007). Researchers have shown significant improvement in general&#xD;
      condition (Lacasse, Guyatt, and Goldstein, 1997)(Ries, Kaplan, Limberg, and Prewitt,&#xD;
      1995)(Lacasse, Goldstein, Tj, and Martin, 2009)(Nava, 1998)(Simpson, Killian, McCartney,&#xD;
      Stubbing, and Jones, 1992), quality of life (Wijkstra et al., 1995)(Bendstrup 1997),&#xD;
      long-term survival (Godoy 2007), sputum clearance (Garrod 2007) (Oldenburg 1979);&#xD;
      Health-related quality of life (Almagro 2013) (Blackstock 2013) (Jones, 2013)(Bendstrup et&#xD;
      al. 1997), training of muscle strength and exercise tolerance (Ortega et al., 2002)(Bendstrup&#xD;
      et al., 1997), walking distance (Ries et al. 2007) (Ringbaek 2008) (Wedzicha et al., 1998),&#xD;
      exercise capacity, endurance (Lacasse et al., 1997) (Ries et al., 1995) (Lacasse et al.,&#xD;
      2009) (Nava 1998) (Simpson et al., 1992); days of hospitalization (Ries et al., 2007)&#xD;
      (Griffiths et al., 2000), tachypnea (Lacasse et al., 1997) (Ortega et al., 2002) and&#xD;
      morbidity (Godoy, 2007). Although the advantages of PR are many, its implementation should be&#xD;
      placed alongside the routine treatment options (Ozalevli 2010). It has been shown that the&#xD;
      frequency of emergency department presentations and hospital admissions in COPD patients was&#xD;
      significantly reduced after participation in early discharge care with ongoing follow-up&#xD;
      support (Lawlor et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tele-rehabilitation in COPD Tele-rehabilitation at home is feasible and well accepted by&#xD;
      patients, although technology may be perceived as difficult (Paneroni et al.,&#xD;
      2014)(Tousignant et al., 2012). It seems to improve walking capacity, dyspnea, quality of&#xD;
      life and daily physical activity (Paneroni et al., 2014). The interaction between the COPD&#xD;
      patients at home and the healthcare professionals at the clinic through TR has evolved as a&#xD;
      dialogue channel forming the basis for mutual learning processes and new relationships&#xD;
      (Dinesen 2011). Here, patients exhibit four types of attitudes about their&#xD;
      tele-rehabilitation: indifference, learning as part of situations in everyday life, feeling&#xD;
      of security and motivation for performing physical training (Dinesen et al., 2013).&#xD;
      Preliminary evaluations from tele-rehabilitation initiatives in Scotland showed&#xD;
      tele-rehabilitation to be more cost effective for patients living in remote areas compared to&#xD;
      an out-reach- or centralized model (Hill 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion There is still a need for more studies of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      TR, just as also the long-term effects of TR have to be determined. To guarantee individuals&#xD;
      with COPD a qualitative service from health care organizations in the coming decades and&#xD;
      economically save the national health systems for an expensive bill to treating COPD, new&#xD;
      actions plans has to be taken in mind in order to treat more patients with less human&#xD;
      resources and still sustaining or improving today's services. The importance of such welfare&#xD;
      action plans has to maintain a quality of service that individuals with COPD are willing to&#xD;
      accept. Here, TR seems to be a good welfare action plans. Despite improved cost&#xD;
      effectiveness, evidence supporting patient ´s adherence and security, treatment efficacy and&#xD;
      improvements of quality of life with tele-rehabilitation in COPD is still warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To assess and compare the feasibility and effect of a tele-rehabilitation program with a&#xD;
      new and innovative TR platform (NITRP) compared to standard COPD rehabilitation with respect&#xD;
      to exercise capacity, quality of life and activities of daily living in patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the study is to assess the effect of tele-rehabilitation with a NITRP&#xD;
      compared to standard COPD rehabilitation on exercise capacity and quality of life in COPD&#xD;
      patients based on the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activities of daily living, exercise capacity and health-related quality of life are equal or&#xD;
      improved by tele-rehabilitation compared to conventional COPD rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary purpose is to investigate the efficacy and cost effectiveness of&#xD;
      tele-rehabilitation with a NITRP compared to standard COPD rehabilitation on &quot;number of acute&#xD;
      exacerbations and number of visits to the health care system in a period of time&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;rehabilitation- and transportation costs&quot; in rehabilitation of COPD patients based on the&#xD;
      following hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rehabilitation costs of tele-rehabilitation are lower or equal compared to conventional&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD AND MATERIAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of&#xD;
      tele-rehabilitation and conventional rehabilitation in patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 54 adult patients with moderate to severe COPD referred for conventional COPD&#xD;
      rehabilitation in the outpatient clinic at the Department of Respiratory Medicine and&#xD;
      Allergy, Aarhus University Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to be eligible to participate in this study, the patient must meet all of the&#xD;
      following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diagnosis of COPD (FEV1/FVC &lt; 70% in a stable phase of the disease) Age &gt; 18 years Referred&#xD;
      for conventional COPD rehabilitation Compliant patient willing to fulfill the study&#xD;
      requirements Signed informed consent Oxygen therapy is not an obstacle for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potential patient who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from&#xD;
      participation in this study if:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Musculoskeletal disorders limiting training Dizziness, significant sensory or motor&#xD;
      disabilities, dementia or terminal malignant disease precluding training Severe comorbidities&#xD;
      such as i.e. unstable heart disease, dysregulated diabetes, known malignant disease, any&#xD;
      other illness making the patient inappropriate for participating in the study Non-compliant&#xD;
      patient Severe vision or hearing impairment Non-Danish speaking Unwillingness or inability to&#xD;
      follow the protocol COPD exacerbation in the preceding 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation In this non-inferiority study of tele-rehabilitation vs. standard&#xD;
      rehabilitation, we will use 6MWT as the primary outcome. Power calculations based on previous&#xD;
      rehabilitation studies in COPD results I 54 patients that should participate in this study.&#xD;
      The biggest allowed difference in 6MWT: +/- 35 m (Puhan et al 2008) to accept the H0: same&#xD;
      mean difference, assuming equal group sizes, means that 18 patients is needed in each group.&#xD;
      A drop-out rate less than or equal to 30% is expected (Sohanpal et al 2012). The maximum&#xD;
      dropout rate in the present study is set to 40%. Thus, the final power calculations results&#xD;
      in 54 patients, significance rate 0.05. Therefore, 27 patients will enrolled in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment All COPD patients referred for rehabilitation at the Department of Respiratory&#xD;
      Medicine and Allergy, Aarhus University Hospital that might be eligible will be informed&#xD;
      about the study by their respiratory physician or physiotherapist when evaluated after&#xD;
      referral for rehabilitation. The patients will be asked if they are interested in&#xD;
      participating in this study, and if so, they will receive verbal and written information. An&#xD;
      enrolment letter will also be hung up at the outpatient clinic to inform potential&#xD;
      participants about the project. An advertisement will be published in local newspapers, on&#xD;
      AUH facebook and on www.forsoegsperson.dk (Appendix 4). In this information the study is&#xD;
      explained in detail. Potential participants are entitled to at least one day consideration&#xD;
      time before they decide whether to participate in the trial. They have the right to be&#xD;
      accompanied by a family member, friend or acquaintance for the oral information they will&#xD;
      receive previous to the enrolment. . The patients have to give their informed signed consent&#xD;
      to the principal investigator or his designee before the patient can enter the trial.&#xD;
      Clinical stability will be assessed by the physician. If patients are eligible they will be&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention group or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of subjects There will be no changes in the patients' regular treatment due to&#xD;
      participation in the tele-rehabilitation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational treatment The intervention is the use of a tele-rehabilitation program during&#xD;
      8 weeks. The patient's training time will be registered automatically. The control group will&#xD;
      receive standard COPD rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Escape medication In case of a COPD exacerbation or any other medical incidence, the patient&#xD;
      will be treated to the discretion of the clinician in charge and excluded from the study.&#xD;
      However, the patients will be offered to be included again at the moment clinical stability&#xD;
      is reached and the patient again fulfils inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation, blinding &amp; treatment allocation Randomisation will allocate patients to either&#xD;
      the intervention or control group and will be performed electronically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures The trial is registered in the public database of Clinical Trials.gov. After&#xD;
      informed consent, the patients will be screened at baseline and physical examination,&#xD;
      pulmonary function tests and 6MWT will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on comorbidities and smoking status will be registered. All patients will be&#xD;
      asked to fill in the questionnaires on health-related quality of life, general-well-being and&#xD;
      anxiety. Patients will be asked to wear a pedometer and record steps during 7 days and will&#xD;
      be instructed not to change their daily routine while wearing this device. After returning&#xD;
      back the pedometer, patients allocated to the intervention group will receive instructions&#xD;
      about the tele-rehabilitation program while patients allocated to the control group will&#xD;
      start the standard rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In week 8, the intervention group will again receive a pedometer to register steps for 7 days&#xD;
      during the intervention. 8 weeks after the end of the intervention program, pulmonary&#xD;
      function tests, 6MWT and the questionnaires will be repeated. The same investigations and&#xD;
      questionnaires are performed at follow-up after 3 and 6 months after the end of the&#xD;
      rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients allocated to the control group will follow the same procedure during the first 9&#xD;
      weeks, except not using tele-rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group COPD patients in the control group will undergo the conventional standardized&#xD;
      rehabilitation program as implemented at the Department of Respiratory Medicine and Allergy,&#xD;
      Aarhus University Hospital. The program is an 8 weeks program consisting of 2 weekly group&#xD;
      training sessions at the hospital with instruction by a physiotherapists and 6 hours of&#xD;
      education about COPD and its treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group The intervention group will follow this procedure Video Consultation (VC)&#xD;
      Sessions: Each patient will have the opportunity to have minimum one VC per week the first&#xD;
      month, one VC each second week the second month one VC a month the rest of the trial. Here&#xD;
      the physiotherapist, via history will extract the information needed to calibrate the daily&#xD;
      tele rehabilitation program according to patient's physical status and needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retraining breath: Patients will also be instructed to use different techniques to breath&#xD;
      during the video consultations with the physiotherapist. The patient receives advice on how&#xD;
      to the use breathing retraining techniques such as pursed lip breathing. Because COPD&#xD;
      patients suffer from obstructed airways, the goal for them using PLB will be to increase&#xD;
      their positive expiratory pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chat Sessions: Each patient has the opportunity to chat with the physiotherapist any time via&#xD;
      the chat module of the system. The patient and physiotherapist will be reminded via mail,&#xD;
      anytime someone is writing in the chat, allowing the users to interact when needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workout Sessions with a Virtual Physiotherapist Agent (VPA): The patient will train according&#xD;
      to what is decided by the physiotherapist and the patient in the VC or chat meetings.&#xD;
      Normally, the patients will train 10-20 minutes daily at home with its individual and&#xD;
      tailored VPA. Instead of ergometer bike training, the patient will receive some easy training&#xD;
      tools such as elastics and weights that can be used in the different exercises showed by the&#xD;
      VPA to reach the same intensity of work out. The VPA will then be animated to motivate and&#xD;
      encourage the patient to exercises at home. A digital diary will automatically register the&#xD;
      data obtained by the system on patient's performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' security: In order to minimize the risks of possible accidents while performing the&#xD;
      exercises, the patient will answer questions before and after each exercise performance that&#xD;
      the physiotherapist can follow in real time via scales and use to calibrate the performance&#xD;
      of the virtual physiotherapist. The patient has the opportunity to chat with the&#xD;
      physiotherapist 24 hours per day any time if needed and for consultation reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study parameters/endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in the 6MWT measured at week 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in the 6MWT measured 3 and 6 months after cessation of the tele-rehabilitation program&#xD;
      compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in total score in health-related quality of life measured by SGRQ at week 9, and 3 and&#xD;
      6 months after cessation of the tele-rehabilitation program compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in total score in health-related quality of life measured by GAD-7 at week 9, and 3&#xD;
      and 6 months after cessation of the tele-rehabilitation program compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in component scores (symptoms, activity &amp; impact) in health-related quality of life&#xD;
      measured by SGRQ at week 9, and 3 and 6 months after cessation of the tele-rehabilitation&#xD;
      program compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost of the tele-rehabilitation program&#xD;
&#xD;
      End point measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function tests (PFT):&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFT are done as part of the routine follow-up and performed to prove disease stability. The&#xD;
      following pulmonary function indices will be registered:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) Forced vital capacity (FVC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 minute walk test A 6 minute walk test will be performed at baseline, after 8 weeks, and&#xD;
      after 3 and 6 months after cessation of the program to assess exercise performance. The&#xD;
      purpose of this test is to see how far and fast the test person can walk during 6 minutes.&#xD;
      This test is a sub-maximal exercise test used to assess aerobic capacity and endurance. The&#xD;
      distance covered over a time of 6 minutes is used as the outcome by which to compare changes&#xD;
      in performance capacity. During this test the patient will be asked to walk between two cones&#xD;
      placed 30 meters apart. The patient is asked to go to the speed he thinks he can walk without&#xD;
      stopping during 6 minutes. Oximetry, pulse and Borgs Dyspnea Score are tracked before, after&#xD;
      6, 7, and 8 minutes. Total distance is recorded after 6 minutes. The patient stops walking&#xD;
      after 6 minutes but recovery is also recorded at 7 and 8 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pedometer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the physical activity status of the patient, measurement of the number of steps&#xD;
      walked is an indication of the magnitude of physical activity. In controlled laboratory&#xD;
      settings, the Yamax Digi-walker SW-200 has consistently been shown to be among the most&#xD;
      accurate. It's a small device worn on the belt or waist and responds to vertical&#xD;
      accelerations of the hip during gait cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, and after 8 weeks, 3 and 6 months, the patient will be asked to self-administer&#xD;
      the following questionnaires on quality of life and general well-being:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IADL Instrumental Activity of Daily Living consists of seven questions related to shopping,&#xD;
      housework, cooking, walks, money management, handling of medications and use of telephone.&#xD;
      Both patients and their closest relatives (mostly spouses) should reply. For each of the&#xD;
      seven questions, a score of zero indicates no need for help, one indicates some needs and two&#xD;
      indicates inability to perform an activity without assistance. A total score is calculated on&#xD;
      a scale from 0 to 14. Higher scores indicate greater dependence. The form has been translated&#xD;
      into Danish (Appendix 1), SGRQ Sct. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire is a disease specific,&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaire with 50 items comprising two domains with 3 components as&#xD;
      symptoms, activity and impacts. Each is scored from 0-100, with higher scores corresponding&#xD;
      to worse health related quality of life. SGRQ has been developed for COPD patients and found&#xD;
      to be a valid measure of health related quality of life (Appendix 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GAD-7:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The General Anxiety Disorder Score measures the presence and severity of general anxiety&#xD;
      disorder. It is a 7 self-rated items. Each item scores 0-3. The total score range is 0-21.&#xD;
      Reliability and validity are excellent (Appendix 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD exacerbations The number of exacerbations and visits to the general practitioner,&#xD;
      emergency room or hospital during rehabilitation and follow-up will be registered, first via&#xD;
      a diary and corroborated then by short interviews performed during follow-up at 8 weeks and 3&#xD;
      and 6 months after cessation of training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost The average cost of the hospital rehabilitation program and transportation per patients&#xD;
      for an eight weeks standard and tele-rehabilitation program and transportation will be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Information about patient demographics, lung function (spirometry with&#xD;
      measurement of FEV1 and FVC), oxygen saturation, comorbidities, smoking habits, BMI, blood&#xD;
      pressure, visits to the clinic, number of exacerbations, use of any public health care&#xD;
      service and cost of it will be registered at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis There will be used Wilcoxon rank sum test for assessing, the primary endpoint&#xD;
      comparing the performance of the physical functions tests between the intervention group and&#xD;
      control group from base line to 8 weeks, 3 and 6 months after and for the test variables with&#xD;
      correction for multiple comparisons. A p-value less than 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant. All patients will be analyzed in the groups they originally were&#xD;
      randomized from according to the intention-to-treat principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in activities of daily living and health-related quality of life between the two&#xD;
      groups from baseline to 8 weeks, 3 and 6 months after will be compared with Chi2 test or&#xD;
      Fischer's exact test for categorical data. Continuous data will be compared with t -tests or&#xD;
      Wilcoxon rank sum test depending on distribution. A p-value less than 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Copyrights, distribution and implications Authorship must meet the Vancouver rules, and&#xD;
      everyone who has contributed under this framework will be named in the author list. The&#xD;
      authors will try to publish the results of the study in international peer-reviewed journals&#xD;
      and present them at relevant conferences. Moreover, the results will be published in other&#xD;
      relevant media. All positive, negative and inconclusive results will be published&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical issues Since rehabilitation is a standard treatment offer, it is not expected that&#xD;
      this study will result in any risk to patients. Participation is voluntary and the patient&#xD;
      may, at any time, withdraw from the study without consequences for future care or treatment.&#xD;
      Questionnaires and test methods used are clinically recognized instruments. An informed&#xD;
      written consent will be obtained from the participants after verbal and written information.&#xD;
      The Regional Research Ethics Committee will be applied in order to obtain their consent to&#xD;
      carry out the study. The is approved by the Data Protection Agency for permission for data&#xD;
      recording and storage of data. The data will be rendered anonymous through a code system and&#xD;
      stored safely in accordance with applicable rules of the organizers. The study follows the&#xD;
      general research ethics rules as expressed in the Helsinki Declaration II (&quot;World Medical&#xD;
      Association Declaration of Helsinki: Ethical Principles for Medical Research involving Human&#xD;
      Subjects,&quot; 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passed on information from the patient journal system Patient data as mentioned below will be&#xD;
      passed on from the electronic patient files to the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gender, age, marital status, comorbidities and smoking status will be passed on at the&#xD;
      beginning of the study to compare the data at the end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone number, address and or E-mail from participants in the focus group will be passed&#xD;
      on with the goal to contact the participant in the case there is a break in the connection&#xD;
      via the tele rehab devices or if we need to send a new updated devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health status, number of exacerbations in the last period, days of hospitalization, number of&#xD;
      visits to the hospital or number of visits from healthcare suppliers to participants at home&#xD;
      will be used to calculate the health care expenditure for each participant.&#xD;
