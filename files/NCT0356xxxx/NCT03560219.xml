  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequently encountered cardiac arrhythmia. Emerging data&#xD;
      suggests that common genetic variants are associated with the development of AF. The main&#xD;
      feature of the structural remodelling in AF is atrial fibrosis and is considered the&#xD;
      substrate for AF perpetuation. Genome-wide association studies suggest that AF-susceptibility&#xD;
      variants may modulate atrial fibrosis. However, the association between atrial fibrosis and&#xD;
      genetic polymorphisms in humans has not yet been specifically investigated. In this study, we&#xD;
      plan to investigate the relationship between genetic polymorphisms, atrial fibrosis and other&#xD;
      components of thrombogenic substrate in patients with non-valvular AF. Primary objectives of&#xD;
      this study are to assess associations between (i) polymorphic genetic variants and atrial&#xD;
      fibrosis (detected by magnetic resonance imaging), (ii) polymorphic genetic variants and&#xD;
      components of thrombogenic substrate (inflammation, endothelial function, prothrombotic&#xD;
      state, atrial functions).&#xD;

      components of thrombogenic substrate (inflammation, endothelial function, prothrombotic&#xD;
      state, atrial functions). Patients are planned to be recruited from four major cardiology&#xD;
      departments: Memorial Ankara Hospital, Ministry of Health Subspecialty Training Hospital of&#xD;
      Turkey, Ufuk University and Gazi University hospitals. Key variables that will be recorded&#xD;
      include the clinical, contrast-enhanced MRI, biomarkers, echocardiographic and assessment of&#xD;
      endothelial function. All statistical analyses will be conducted using Stata version 11.0&#xD;
      (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Univariate and multivariate regression models will be used&#xD;
      to determine the odds ratio of each variable to assess the association of the clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory parameters, and genotype profiles with the presence of LA fibrosis. Furthermore,&#xD;
      data mining methods like support vector machines and/or random forests are planned to be used&#xD;
      for detecting the impact of each potential predictor on the risk of LA fibrosis.&#xD;
      Additionally, to determine the effect of different alleles of the identified risk SNPs, 2-way&#xD;
      and 3-way multi dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis will be performed. Bioinformatics&#xD;
      investigations to determine SNP-SNP, SNP-gene and SNP-Phenotype interactions will be&#xD;
      performed by combined p-value and biological network analysis.&#xD;
