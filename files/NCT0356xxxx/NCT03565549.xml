      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness and usefulness of a simple one word&#xD;
      mnemonic in the memory retention of the different components of the Canadian CT Head Rule&#xD;
      (CCHR) in senior medical students and interns. The CCHR, a clinical decision rule used by&#xD;
      emergency physicians to determine the need of head CT in the context of minor traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury (mTBI). A rapid recall of the rule in the clinical setting would be expected to&#xD;
      improve its utilization and overcome one of the barriers in its implementation. This would&#xD;
      ultimately result in better utilization of resources and reduction in unnecessary exposure to&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minor head injury is a serious public health problem. It is defined as a history of loss of&#xD;
      consciousness, amnesia, or disorientation and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13-15 [1].&#xD;
      Patients with minor head injury are frequently encountered in the emergency department and&#xD;
      the outpatient settings [2]. In the United States, it is estimated that each year there are&#xD;
      about 1.2 million Emergency Department (ED) visits and 800,000 visits to the outpatient&#xD;
      setting related to minor head injury [2]. Although most patients with minor head injury can&#xD;
      be discharged without sequelae after observation, a small proportion deteriorates and&#xD;
      requires neurosurgical intervention for intracranial pathology [3]. Therefore, early&#xD;
      diagnosis of such injuries by computed tomography (CT) followed by early surgery is very&#xD;
      important in the treatment of those patients. Therefore, when faced with such situation,&#xD;
      clinicians have to make the decision whether further investigation in the form of CT imaging&#xD;
      of the head is necessary to rule out an intracranial lesion. Not imaging a minor head injury&#xD;
      could potentially lead to significant consequences if an intracranial pathology is missed. On&#xD;
      the other hand, imaging all patients will lead to unacceptable exposure to ionizing radiation&#xD;
      and waste valuable health resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical decision rules (CDRs) are tools that attempt to formally test, simplify, and&#xD;
      increase the accuracy of clinicians' diagnostic and prognostic assessments. They guide&#xD;
      clinicians, establish pretest probability, provide screening tests for common problems, and&#xD;
      estimate risk [4]. A number of CDRs have been developed to guide clinicians dealing with&#xD;
      minor head injuries on deciding whether CT scan of the head is indicated or not&#xD;
      [1,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]. Among the multitude of CDRs, the Canadian CT Head Rule (CCHR) has&#xD;
      been repeatedly shown to be useful with good sensitivity and specificity [13,14]. It was&#xD;
      first developed and tested among 3212 patients with head injuries in 10 Canadian institutions&#xD;
      between 1996 and 1999 and published in 2001[1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CCHR consists of five high-risk factors (failure to reach GCS of 15 within 2 h, suspected&#xD;
      open skull fracture, any sign of basal skull fracture, vomiting ≥2 episodes, or age ≥65&#xD;
      years) and two additional medium-risk factors (amnesia before impact &gt;30 min and dangerous&#xD;
      mechanism of injury). The high-risk factors are 100% sensitive for predicting need for&#xD;
      neurological intervention, and would require only 32% of patients to undergo CT. The&#xD;
      medium-risk factors are 98·4% sensitive and 49·6% specific for predicting clinically&#xD;
      important brain injury, and would require only 54% of patients to undergo CT [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its demonstrated validity, awareness and use of the rule remains low in many parts of&#xD;
      the developed world, including Canada [15]. In fact there is evidence that implementation of&#xD;
      the rule did not lead to a reduction in emergency department use of CT imaging and in some&#xD;
      occasions there was actually an increase over time in use of CT scans [16]. Several barriers&#xD;
      of implementation have been suggested. One of these is physicians' forgetting the details of&#xD;
      the rule at the bedside [17]. Having a simple mnemonic that acts as a memory aid to the&#xD;
      different components of the rule may help overcome this barrier. Mnemonics have been shown to&#xD;
      enhance retention of clinical decision rules such as the Ottawa Ankle and Foot Rules [18].&#xD;
      Therefore, this study proposes the hypothesis that a mnemonic to remember the CCHR will&#xD;
      enhance retention of the components of this clinical decision rule by physicians and medical&#xD;
      students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether the use of a&#xD;
      mnemonic would improve mid-term and long-term knowledge and retention of the CCHR. The&#xD;
      participants will be interns and medical students from the Sultan Qaboos University and Oman&#xD;
      Medical College. The study tool will be an online survey that will be emailed to all enrolled&#xD;
      medical students in both institutions. The initial email will gather demographic and level of&#xD;
      education of participants and their initial knowledge about the CCHR. Then participants will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive either a table of the rule produced by the developers of the rule&#xD;
      listing the CCHR and a second group will receive the mnemonic. The second email will measure&#xD;
      the immediate retention of the rule. A follow up email six months after the randomization&#xD;
      will assess the retention of the CCHR between the two arms of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will aim to recruit all interns and final year medical students. The study will&#xD;
      require at least 150 participants in each arm in order to attain 95% power in detecting a 5%&#xD;
      difference between variable of the two arms. Randomization will be done using a software&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mnemonic VAGABOND will be used to enhance students' retention of the CCHR in this study.&#xD;
      The mnemonic stands for:&#xD;
&#xD;
      V for Vomiting more than 2 times A for Amnesia G for GCS less than 15 for more than 2 hours A&#xD;
      for Age more than 65 years B for Basal skull fracture ON for OpeN skull fracture D for&#xD;
      Dangerous mechanism&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires are accessible on the following weblinks:&#xD;

&#xD;
      Data will be directly entered into a pre-populated Statistical Package for Social Sciences&#xD;
      (SPSS) datasheet. The study will present a descriptive analysis of all the variables&#xD;
      collected. In order to assess the significance of differences in the variables between the&#xD;
      two arms of participants, a series of Chi-Square tests and the Fisher exact tests will be&#xD;
      used where appropriate. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software will be&#xD;
      utilized in the data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess whether the use of a mnemonic enhances the awareness of a clinical&#xD;
      decision rule among interns and medical students. It will highlight the value of using simple&#xD;
      mnemonics in teaching clinical decision-making. Such data is valuable for medical educators&#xD;
      in other settings where critical clinical decisions can be made based on available rules.&#xD;
