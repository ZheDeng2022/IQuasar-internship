  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Second-hand smoking (SHS) is a health hazard to infants and children, in whom it is&#xD;
      associated with lower respiratory tract infections, wheezing, cough, middle ear infections&#xD;
      and sudden infant death syndrome. The high prevalence of smoking in adults in China, 52.9%&#xD;
      among men, 2.4% among women, results in many children being exposed to SHS at home. Data on&#xD;
      the effectiveness of evidence-based smoking hygiene intervention to reduce SHS exposure among&#xD;
      young children (e.g., aged 5 or below) is lacking in China. Children in the rural setting are&#xD;
      more exposed to SHS due to the lack of tobacco control policy initiative in the rural setting&#xD;
      and the high prevalence of smoking among the rural public. In the proposed project we aim to&#xD;
      examine the effectiveness of a protection motivation theory-based smoking hygiene&#xD;
      intervention (SHI), delivered by community health worker (CHW) in 6 different contacts, to&#xD;
      reduce SHS exposure among young children in two rural areas of China: Taizhou city (Zhejiang&#xD;
      Province) and Dali city (Yunnan province). The results of this study will provide clinical&#xD;
      evidence for the development of CHW-delivered interventions designed to reduce exposure to&#xD;
      SHS and related morbidity and mortality among children in rural China. The successful results&#xD;
      could also be used to draft guidelines for health promotion interventions, which could be&#xD;
      implemented as a policy for all primary health care settings in rural China and other&#xD;
      developing countries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Second-hand smoking (SHS) is a health hazard to infants and children, in whom it is&#xD;
      associated with lower respiratory tract infections, wheezing, cough, middle ear infections&#xD;
      and sudden infant death syndrome. With a population of 1.2 billion, China is the world's&#xD;
      largest producer and consumer of tobacco, with over 350 million smokers. The high prevalence&#xD;
      of current smoking among men (60.2%) and women (6.9%) in China, reflect the fact that a large&#xD;
      number of young children are exposed to SHS at home. The high exposure to SHS increases&#xD;
      children's risk of tobacco-induced morbidity and mortality. Children in the rural setting&#xD;
      even are more exposed to SHS due to the lack of tobacco control policy initiative in the&#xD;
      rural setting and the high prevalence of smoking among the rural public.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While evidence-based intervention to reduce children's exposure to SHS was proven effective&#xD;
      in the United States, data on the effectiveness of evidence-based interventions to reduce SHS&#xD;
      exposure among young children (e.g., under age 5) is lacking in rural China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      China's unique public health history and homogeneity of the population provide an&#xD;
      unprecedented opportunity to examine the effects of an exposure reduction intervention (we&#xD;
      will call this as &quot;smoking hygiene intervention, SHI&quot;) among children. Community health&#xD;
      workers (CHWs), who play an important role in delivering other health interventions (i.e.&#xD;
      vitamin supplementation and treatment for acute respiratory infection), offer a resource for&#xD;
      delivery of SHI intervention in the community level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this growing problem and to develop local evidence base, the proposed study will&#xD;
      examine the effectiveness of a protection motivation theory (PMT) -based SHI, delivered by&#xD;
      community health worker (CHW) in 6 different contacts, to reduce SHS exposure among young&#xD;
      children and promote parental quitting in two rural setting of Zhejiang and Shanxi provinces.&#xD;
      The results of this study will provide clinical evidence for the development of CHW-delivered&#xD;
      interventions designed to reduce exposure to SHS and related morbidity and mortality among&#xD;
      children in rural China. The successful results could also be used to draft guidelines for&#xD;
      health promotion interventions, which could be implemented as a policy for all primary health&#xD;
      care settings in rural China and other developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of the smoker household members of young children aged 5&#xD;
      years or below in the selected community. Families with at least one smoker in the household&#xD;
      (mother, father or other household members) will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      intervention study. Investigators will recruit a total of 400 smoker household members; 200&#xD;
      from rural Zhejiang province and 200 from rural Yunnan province (Dali district).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided into two parts. The first is a baseline assessment study. The&#xD;
      second is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of households in the targeted community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of the baseline assessment is to obtain baseline data on second-hand tobacco&#xD;
           exposure among young children, the health status of children and smoking status of&#xD;
           household members, and to screen and offer an invitation to participate in the study. A&#xD;
           structured questionnaire, after pilot testing, will be used for data collection. A brief&#xD;
           screening form to assess eligibility for intervention study will also be completed&#xD;
           during the baseline assessment. All the collected screening forms, both eligible and not&#xD;
           eligible, will be kept in the research office and will follow the institutional data&#xD;
           storage and safety procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Investigators will recruit four interviewers to work on this project. Interviewers will&#xD;
           collect baseline data and the follow-up data at 2 months and 6 months. Interviewers will&#xD;
           forward all of their collected data on a weekly basis to a central data supervisor based&#xD;
           at participating collaborating institutions. Interviewers will also do the followings:&#xD;
           measure carbon monoxide (CO) level in exhaled air of those smokers who reportedly&#xD;
           quitted smoking (at 2-and 6-months), and collect child's urine samples for cotinine&#xD;
           measures. Criteria for the interviewer will be (1) at least higher secondary school&#xD;
           graduate, (2) ability to speak and read Mandarin Chinese fluently, (3) ability to speak&#xD;
           local (Taizhou or Dali) dialect and (4) familiarity with the populations in which they&#xD;
           will be working.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Training of interviewer: Interviewers will receive training on: (a) Research ethics to&#xD;
           ensure that they follow the guidelines of the US NIH standard and Duke Kunshan&#xD;
           guidelines to collect data, (b) data collection methods, (c) measuring carbon monoxide&#xD;
           level in exhaled air, (d) collection of urine samples, and (e) storage of urine samples&#xD;
           in cool box. The intensive 1-day training will be provided by the investigators and will&#xD;
           be conducted in Chinese.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The training will provide them with the necessary communication and interview skills so&#xD;
           that they can conduct successful interviews and collect useful data. During the&#xD;
           training, the interviewers will be taken through the questionnaire question by question,&#xD;
           explaining them thoroughly and the information required. They will also perform mock&#xD;
           testing to measure CO in exhaled air and collection and storage of urine samples.&#xD;
           Training methods that will be used will include, discussions, practice and role play.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomized controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect preliminary data regarding the intervention's effectiveness we will conduct an&#xD;
      RCT. After confirming the eligibility criteria and informed consent, the household members&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to either the intervention group or the control group.&#xD;
      Randomization will be done by opening a serially labeled opaque and sealed envelope with a&#xD;
      card indicating the randomly allocated group (i.e. A= Intervention group, B= Control group).&#xD;
      The trial will begin as soon as the baseline assessment has been completed and the relevant&#xD;
      institutes have given ethical approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessment: Follow-up will be carried out at 2 months and 6 months after initial&#xD;
      contact for both the intervention and control group. The 2-month and 6-month follow up data&#xD;
      will be collected by interviewers who will be blinded to the study conditions of the&#xD;
      households. Each follow-up assessment will last about 30 minutes. At 2 month follow-up, the&#xD;
      household smoking practices, health-related information of children and the smoking status of&#xD;
      all subjects will be assessed by interviewers through face-to-face interview using the&#xD;
      standard questionnaire. At 6 month follow-up, all subjects will be contacted by interviewers&#xD;
      for final assessment through a face-to-face interview. Their household smoking practices,&#xD;
      smoking and quitting related information and health-related information of child will be&#xD;
      collected using the standard questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community Health Worker (CHW): Intervention will be provided by CHWs who have been working in&#xD;
      the relevant community centers for at least 3 months. CHWs will be literate (at least a&#xD;
      higher secondary school degree), have participated in community work or clinical work for&#xD;
      children, and be fluent in both the local dialect and Mandarin Chinese. After training, they&#xD;
      must be competent in counseling parents of young children or other household members on SHI.&#xD;
      CHWs must be available and willing to visit households to deliver interventions at subjects'&#xD;
      homes or other convenient facilities within the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training of CHW: CHWs will be trained on SHI. Guidelines will be developed detailing the SHI.&#xD;
      The intensive 2-day training (8 hours each) will be provided by the investigators and will be&#xD;
      conducted in Chinese. The curriculum for the training will include the following key&#xD;
      components: (i) health consequences of smoking and SHS. It will emphasize the acute health&#xD;
      effects of secondhand smoke on children, especially regarding the development of asthma,&#xD;
      exacerbation of existing asthma, middle ear infections, upper respiratory infections, and&#xD;
      perhaps the relationship between secondhand smoke exposure and sudden infant death syndrome&#xD;
      (SIDS). These would be key components of the training so that the workers truly understand&#xD;
      the devastating impact that secondhand smoke can have on the health of these children, and so&#xD;
      that when intervening with parents, they can emphasize these health effects accurately, (ii)&#xD;
      benefits of reducing children's exposure to SHS. It will discuss both health and economic&#xD;
      benefits and use real-life examples to illustrate the fact; (iii) understanding child&#xD;
      development issues in different stages of childhood; iv) basic counseling skills; v)&#xD;
      motivational enhancement strategies; (vi) assessment of smoking status using CO monitor, and&#xD;
      vi) study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance assessment of CHW: The assessment of the performance of the CHWs is very crucial&#xD;
      to the success of the study. This will allow us to find out whether the CHWs still possess&#xD;
      the skills obtained during the training and are being used. The assessment of their&#xD;
      performance will be done through the following methods in every two months during the 6&#xD;
      months of the intervention period. The first will be done through the random examination of&#xD;
      the action plan (i.e. summary note) being kept by the CHW for each subject. From the action&#xD;
      plan, supervisors can indicate whether CHWs are providing intervention based on the protocol&#xD;
      and whether the appropriate measures were taken based on the problems noted in the action&#xD;
      plan. The supervisor will also assess the performance of CHWs by observing them while&#xD;
      counseling household members. The supervisor will accompany CHW and observe at least 2&#xD;
      counseling sessions. The report of these assessments will be compiled by the supervisor and&#xD;
      reviewed by investigators to determine whether there is need of refresher course for the&#xD;
      CHWs.&#xD;
