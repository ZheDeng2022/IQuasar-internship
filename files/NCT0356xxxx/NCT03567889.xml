      The trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of Daromun neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery&#xD;
      and adjuvant therapy to improve in a statistically significant manner the recurrence-free&#xD;
      survival (RFS) of Stage IIIB/C melanoma patients with respect to the standard of care&#xD;
      (surgery and adjuvant therapy).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is an open-label, randomized, controlled, two-arm multi-center study of the&#xD;
      efficacy of Daromun neoadjuvant intratumoral treatment followed by surgery and adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy versus surgery and adjuvant therapy in clinical stage III B/C melanoma patients. 186&#xD;
      patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Daromun treatment followed by surgery&#xD;
      and adjuvant therapy (Arm 1) or surgery and adjuvant therapy (Arm 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, follow-up for assessing recurrence-free survival will be performed up to five&#xD;
      years after randomization. Survival information will also be collected in the following year&#xD;
      (up to six years in total after randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label study, so there is no blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who successfully complete the screening evaluations and are eligible for&#xD;
      participation in the study will be enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to two parallel&#xD;
      treatment arms: Daromun plus surgery and adjuvant therapy (Arm 1) or surgery and adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy (Arm 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure a balance across treatment groups, stratified randomization with permuted block&#xD;
      will be used and separate randomization list for each subgroup (stratum) will be produced.&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified on the basis of the following prognostic factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage of disease (2 levels): Stage IIIB vs. Stage IIIC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Planned post-surgical adjuvant therapy (2 levels): anti-PD-1 and other adjuvant&#xD;
           therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that a neoadjuvant Daromun treatment&#xD;
      followed by surgery and adjuvant therapy improves in a statistically significant manner the&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival (RFS) of Stage IIIB/C melanoma patients with respect to the standard&#xD;
      of care (surgery and adjuvant therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint of the study is RFS in a time-to-event analysis in the Daromun plus surgery&#xD;
      and adjuvant therapy treatment group (Arm 1) versus the surgery plus adjuvant therapy control&#xD;
      group (Arm 2). Analysis will be based on the &quot;Intention To Treat&quot; population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key secondary objective of the study is to demonstrate that a neoadjuvant Daromun&#xD;
      treatment followed by surgery and adjuvant therapy improves in a statistically significant&#xD;
      manner the overall survival (OS) of patients with resectable Stage IIIB/ or C melanoma&#xD;
      patients with respect to the standard of care (surgery and adjuvant therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients enrolled in both arms, FDA-approved post-surgery adjuvant therapies (as part of&#xD;
      the standard of care) are allowed and decided at the investigator's discretion. These include&#xD;
      high-dose interferon- α2b, anti-CTLA-4 antibodies (e.g. Ipilimumab), anti-PD1 antibodies&#xD;
      (e.g. Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab), targeted therapies (e.g. Dabrafenib + Trametinib), or other&#xD;
      new FDA-approved treatments.&#xD;
