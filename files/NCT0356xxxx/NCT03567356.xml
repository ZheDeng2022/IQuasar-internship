  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the feasibility and acceptability of a novel approach for improving the delivery and&#xD;
      effectiveness of XRNTX treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) - the MAT-PLUS intervention.&#xD;
      The components of the MAT-PLUS intervention are: XRNTX, initiated during an episode of&#xD;
      inpatient/residential treatment and dosed monthly, provides opioid receptor blockade, relapse&#xD;
      prevention and overdose prevention; Significant other engagement empowers family members or&#xD;
      other designated concerned others, providing concrete guidance for monitoring, supervision,&#xD;
      and improving adherence for their loved one in treatment; Assertive outreach incorporates&#xD;
      frequent multi-channel outreach, in a model that specifically targets engagement and&#xD;
      motivation for medication adherence; Counselor care coordination and case management focused&#xD;
      on medication management and adherence. This objective #1 will be accomplished by conducting&#xD;
      a small-scale, 2-arm, open label, RCT pilot study of 4 months of treatment with the MAT-PLUS&#xD;
      intervention (significant other engagement and training, medication care coordination by&#xD;
      counselors, assertive outreach) + TAU (monthly doses of XRNTX + routine counseling), vs TAU&#xD;
      for n=40 (20 per arm) patients with OUD. Adult patients ages 18+ who receive an initial dose&#xD;
      of XRNTX during an index episode of inpatient/residential/detox treatment for opioid&#xD;
      addiction at a public-sector community treatment program treatment, with intention to&#xD;
      continue in outpatient treatment. The experimental arm will receive the MAT-PLUS intervention&#xD;
      for 4 months of ongoing outpatient treatment with XRNTX. The control arm will receive 4&#xD;
      months of standard TAU (XRNTX + clinic-based counseling) without MAT-PLUS. At the beginning&#xD;
      of the trial an additional small (N = 4 or 5) group of test patients will receive the&#xD;
      MAT-PLUS intervention to test and refine the study procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Residential detox is an ideal opportunity for initiation of relapse prevention medication,&#xD;
      particularly XRNTX, which requires some delay after recent opioid use. But concerns from the&#xD;
      field emphasize barriers to induction (as highlighted by the recent results of the CTN51 XBOT&#xD;
      study), poor adherence and retention. Clarification is needed on optimal delivery, including&#xD;
      a psychosocial treatment platform that is focused more specifically on medication adherence&#xD;
      through engagement and empowerment of significant others, and through training and&#xD;
      supervision of counselors. Adherence in non-research conditions has been a barrier. To&#xD;
      address these gaps, it is proposed this robust intervention, incorporating XRNTX into a&#xD;
      multi-component model of care emphasizing adherence enhancement. Assertive outreach is a&#xD;
      well-described intervention that is effective in chronic illness, eg in the Assertive&#xD;
      Community Treatment (ACT) model for serious and persistent mental illness, and the Integrated&#xD;
      Dual Disorder Treatment (IDDT) model for co-occurring disorders. Significant other&#xD;
      involvement is a well-established method of improving adherence (e.g. in Network Therapy and&#xD;
      Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training). Significant other involvement is also&#xD;
      built into the standard Medication Management model (used in XBOT,COMBINE and others) but it&#xD;
      has not been actually used in most implementations. Finally, the use of counselors to drive&#xD;
      medication adherence takes advantage of the typically greater contact and alliance that&#xD;
      counselors have with patients compared to medical staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several adherence enhancement components are combined synergistically: XRNTX, initiated&#xD;
      during residential treatment and dosed monthly; significant other engagement empowers&#xD;
      caregivers, providing guidance for encouragement, monitoring and supervision of medication&#xD;
      adherence; Assertive outreach incorporates frequent multi-channel contact, case management;&#xD;
      Counselor role clarification, training and supervision provides a clear focus on medication&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome for this objective is # of doses of XRNTX received within the planned 4&#xD;
      months duration of outpatient treatment. The primary analysis will be a comparison of the&#xD;
      mean # of doses in the intervention compared to the control group. Additional analyses will&#xD;
      include comparisons of % of subjects receiving all 4 doses, % of subjects receiving at least&#xD;
      1 dose as outpatients as a demonstration of linkage from inpatient to outpatient treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes for this feasibility objective include process outcomes for feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability, including: # and type of outreach attempts (phone call, email, text,&#xD;
      facebook message, etc) and successful contacts with patients and significant others,&#xD;
      utilization of TAU counseling, rates of return to treatment after dropout. Lastly,&#xD;
      assessments of satisfaction and significant other involvement will be obtained through focus&#xD;
      groups conducted separately with patients and significant others to assess qualitative&#xD;
      acceptability factors, both barriers and facilitators to success.&#xD;
