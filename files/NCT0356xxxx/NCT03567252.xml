  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This program encourages community members to walk approximately 1 mile to the Whitesburg&#xD;
      Farmers Market each Thursday or Saturday. The study aims to determine if walking to the&#xD;
      market to receive vouchers improve health outcomes beyond controls who receive nutrition&#xD;
      education.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the summer of 2018, community members of Whitesburg, Kentucky (KY) were recruited to join&#xD;
      the Tanglewood to Table walking program, and community members of Harlan, KY were invited to&#xD;
      serve as controls. Each Thursday or Saturday, participants report whether or not they walked&#xD;
      the 1 mile trail to the farmers market, how many steps the walked in the previous 7 days and&#xD;
      they reported which fruits and vegetables they consumed the previous week. The control group&#xD;
      will receive nutrition education handouts. The program is from June 2018 - January 2019.&#xD;
      Participants complete questionnaires about fruit and vegetable consumption and physical&#xD;
      activity. Participants also provided physical and biological measurements. Recruiting for the&#xD;
      2018 Walking Program will begin in May.&#xD;

Answers will include: 0= No, and I do not intend to in the next 6 months, 1= No, but I intend to in the next 6 months, 2= No, but I intend to in the next 30 days, 3=Yes, I have been but for less than 6 months, and 4=Yes I have been for the past 6 months. Data will be presented as the average intention to consume dark green vegetables compared between groups over time. Scores range from 0-4; higher scores indicate increased consumption.</description>

        <title>Change in Red and Orange Vegetable Consumption</title>
        <description>Participants will complete a survey at baseline, 4 months, and 8 months that will ask them if they eat at least 5.5 cups of red and orange vegetables per week. Answers will include: 0=No, and I do not intend to in the next 6 months, 1=No, but I intend to in the next 6 months, 2=No, but I intend to in the next 30 days, 3=Yes, I have been but for less than 6 months, and 4=Yes I have been for the past 6 months. Data will be presented as the average intention to consume red and orange vegetables compared between groups over time. Scores range from 0-4; higher scores indicate increased consumption.</description>

        <title>Change in Walking 1 Mile Per Day</title>
        <description>Participants will complete a survey at baseline, 4 months, and 8 months that will ask them if they walk at least 1 mile per day. Answers will include:0=No, and I do not intend to in the next 6 months, 1=No, but I intend to in the next 6 months, 2=No, but I intend to in the next 30 days, 3=Yes, I have been but for less than 6 months, and 4= Yes I have been for the past 6 months. Data will be presented as the average intention to walk 1 mile per day compared between groups over time. Scores range from 0-4; higher scores indicate increased walking.</description>
