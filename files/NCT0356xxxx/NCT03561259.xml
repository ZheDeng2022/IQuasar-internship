    <textblock>
      OPTIMUM (MIBG 2014-01) is a Phase II, Two arm, non-randomized, open-label study of&#xD;
      therapeutic 131I-iobenguane (131I-MIBG) as single agent or in combination with Vorinostat for&#xD;
      the treatment of neuroblastoma. The study will be conducted in male and female subjects,&#xD;
      greater than 1 year of age, with iobenguane avid, who have recurrent or progressive disease,&#xD;
      regardless of overall response to frontline therapy, where frontline therapy includes a&#xD;
      minimum of 4 cycles of induction therapy at any time prior to enrollment, high-risk&#xD;
      neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are eligible for combination treatment will receive vorinostat 180 mg/m2/dose&#xD;
      (maximum dose 400 mg) once daily for 14 days (Day -1 to Day 12) continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive 18 mCi/kg of 131I-MIBG intravenously on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject qualifies, the subject will receive the second treatment course of 131I-MIBG&#xD;
      in combination with vorinostat or 131I-MIBG alone (no sooner than 6 weeks following first&#xD;
      treatment course). Subject must have an overall response of stable disease or better, as&#xD;
      assessed by the Investigator, and meet certain predefined criteria to receive the second&#xD;
      course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a screening period of up to 4 weeks, the duration in the study treatment phase for&#xD;
      an individual subject, who receives two treatments, is up to 26 weeks. For an individual&#xD;
      subject, who receives one treatment only, the duration of the treatment phase is 16 weeks. In&#xD;
      addition, there is a 2-year follow-up after the treatment phase, during which assessments&#xD;
      will be performed to assess disease progression, as well as record adverse events.&#xD;

    <description>Overall response (Yes/No) is based on the International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC, published 2017).
