  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PET has an established role in the initial staging of patients with newly diagnosed lung and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tumors.PET avidity is described with both maximum and mean standardized&#xD;
      uptake values.Malignant cells have increased activity on PET, defined as the standardized&#xD;
      uptake value (SUV), with increased uptake of FDG in tumor due to elevated levels of GLUT&#xD;
      receptors, elevated intracellular levels of hexokinase and increased rates of glycolysis.&#xD;
      However, there is a subset of patients with lung and gastrointestinal tumors that are not PET&#xD;
      avid.These patients may present with clinically and systemically aggressive disease with a&#xD;
      declining performance status and/or weight loss.&#xD;

      This study will be a retrospective review of patients in the tumor registry with lung and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tumors, not limited to but including small and non-small cell lung cancers,&#xD;
      stomach cancer, small intestinal cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, liver and intrahepatic&#xD;
      bile duct cancers, gallbladder and extrahepatic bile duct cancers, and pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a maximum of 10,000 charts/records that will be reviewed to compile the data.&#xD;
      Data to be collected will include patients' name, medical record number, date of birth, race,&#xD;
      ethnicity, gender, medical history, medications, vital and performance status, vital signs&#xD;
      including weight and body mass index, date of cancer diagnosis, clinical and pathologic&#xD;
      stage, pathology, treatment course, prior treatment, location of primary lesion, and smoking&#xD;
      history. CT and PET findings to be reviewed include the number of involved lymph nodes, size&#xD;
      of primary tumor, average/maximum PET avidity in both the primary tumor and involved lymph&#xD;
      nodes.&#xD;

    <description>The goal of this assessment is to identify patients with lung and gastrointestinal tumors and collect the data on tumor stage location, histology, PET avidity, and weight loss/performance status so that it will be possible to correlate SUV values associated with cachexia by using CTCAE version 4.0 to collect and log AE and SAE related to cachexia. Since, this is a retrospective study no patients is contacted only patient charts are used to study cachexia-inducing tumors which will allow an early intervention to combat cachexia by correlating SUV values associated with cachexia. This retrospective study would help in the early intervention of cachexia induced weight loss and poor performance status.</description>

        No subjects will be contacted or recruited. All data will be acquired retrospectively. The&#xD;
        medical charts are the subjects. The data from these charts will be entered into a password&#xD;
        protected excel spreadsheet.The charts will be identified by name, medical record number,&#xD;
        and date of birth. At the time of study, many of the patients will have expired but some&#xD;
        will be alive and in the regional North Texas area. Thus, given the fact the majority of&#xD;
        patients will have expired at the time of this study and the minimal risk nature of this&#xD;
        retrospective chart review, we could not reasonably conduct this research with a full&#xD;
        waiver of consent. The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects; the&#xD;
        waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; the&#xD;
        research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration.&#xD;
