      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IW-3718 administered to&#xD;
      patients with GERD who continue to have persistent symptoms, such as heartburn and&#xD;
      regurgitation, while receiving once-daily (QD), standard dose PPIs.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in WHSS at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The WHSS is defined as the weekly average of the DHSS. The DHSS for a day is the greater of the 2 items assessing heartburn severity (Item #1 &quot;Burning feeling behind the breastbone or in the center of the upper stomach&quot; and Item #2 &quot;Pain behind the breastbone or in the center of the upper stomach&quot;). The DHSS items are assessed on a 5-point ordinal scale, where 0=Did Not Have, 1=Very Mild, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, 4=Moderately Severe, and 5=Severe; higher scores indicate worse symptoms. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Weekly Regurgitation Frequency Score (WRFS) at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The WRFS is defined as the average of available daily regurgitation frequency scores (DRFS) during a week. DRFS is defined as the maximum score of the 2 items measuring regurgitation from a particular day (Item #6 &quot;Regurgitation [liquid or food moving upwards toward your throat or mouth]&quot; and Item #7 &quot;An acid or bitter taste in the mouth&quot;). The DRFS items are assessed on a 4-point ordinal scale, where 0=Never, 1=Rarely, 2-Sometimes, 3=Often, and 4=Very Often; higher scores indicate worse symptoms. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Were Overall Heartburn Responders During the 8-Week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>An overall heartburn responder is a participant who is a weekly heartburn responder for at least 4 of the 8 treatment weeks and for at least 1 of the final 2 treatment weeks (i.e., Week 7 and Week 8). A weekly heartburn responder is a participant with a decrease of &gt;/= 45% from baseline in WHSS. A participant who reported heartburn severity for less than 4 days during a week is not considered a responder for that week.&#xD;
The WHSS is defined as the weekly average of the DHSS. The DHSS for a day is the greater of the 2 items assessing heartburn severity (Item #1 &quot;Burning feeling behind the breastbone or in the center of the upper stomach&quot; and Item #2 &quot;Pain behind the breastbone or in the center of the upper stomach&quot;). The DHSS items are assessed on a 5-point ordinal scale, where 0=Did Not Have, 1=Very Mild, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, 4=Moderately Severe, and 5=Severe; higher scores indicate worse symptoms. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Heartburn-Free Days During the 8-Week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of heartburn-free days is calculated as the number of heartburn-free (DHSS=0) days divided by the number of diary entry days. The DHSS for a day is the greater of the 2 items assessing heartburn severity (Item #1 &quot;Burning feeling behind the breastbone or in the center of the upper stomach&quot; and Item #2 &quot;Pain behind the breastbone or in the center of the upper stomach&quot;). The DHSS items are assessed on a 5-point ordinal scale, where 0=Did Not Have, 1=Very Mild, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, 4=Moderately Severe, and 5=Severe; higher scores indicate worse symptoms. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement</description>

The DHSS items are assessed on a 5-point ordinal scale, where 0=Did Not Have, 1=Very Mild, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, 4=Moderately Severe, and 5=Severe; higher scores indicate worse symptoms. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The WRFS is defined as the average of available daily regurgitation frequency scores (DRFS) during a week. DRFS is defined as the maximum score of the 2 items measuring regurgitation from a particular day (Item #6 &quot;Regurgitation [liquid or food moving upwards toward your throat or mouth]&quot; and Item #7 &quot;An acid or bitter taste in the mouth&quot;). The DRFS items are assessed on a 4-point ordinal scale, where 0=Never, 1=Rarely, 2-Sometimes, 3=Often, and 4=Very Often; higher scores indicate worse symptoms.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Were Overall Heartburn Responders During the 8-Week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>An overall heartburn responder is a participant who is a weekly heartburn responder for at least 4 of the 8 treatment weeks and for at least 1 of the final 2 treatment weeks (i.e., Week 7 and Week 8). A weekly heartburn responder is a participant with a decrease of &gt;/= 45% from baseline in WHSS. A participant who reported heartburn severity for less than 4 days during a week is not considered a responder for that week.&#xD;
The WHSS is defined as the weekly average of the DHSS. The DHSS for a day is the greater of the 2 items assessing heartburn severity (Item #1 &quot;Burning feeling behind the breastbone or in the center of the upper stomach&quot; and Item #2 &quot;Pain behind the breastbone or in the center of the upper stomach&quot;). The DHSS items are assessed on a 5-point ordinal scale, where 0=Did Not Have, 1=Very Mild, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, 4=Moderately Severe, and 5=Severe; higher scores indicate worse symptoms.
