      The purpose of this study is to compare two different ways to treat chronic low back pain.&#xD;
      The two types of treatment that the investigators will compare are called Usual Care and ABC&#xD;
      Care. Usual Care tends to focus on the spine. ABC Care focuses on the entire body and the&#xD;
      mind. With Usual Care, participants will work with their own doctor to come up with a&#xD;
      treatment plan. With ABC Care, participants will work with the investigators' ABC providers&#xD;
      and their team. The investigators believe ABC Care will help reduce pain, lower costs, and&#xD;
      increase participants' ability to do the things they enjoy doing better than Usual Care. In&#xD;
      ABC Care the investigators hope to avoid treatments like surgeries where participants get&#xD;
      metal rods put in their back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is being done at three Veterans Hospitals: the Veterans Administration of&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS) in Pittsburgh, PA; the North Texas VA Medical Center in&#xD;
      Dallas, TX; and the Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center in Richmond, VA. This research&#xD;
      study is being paid for by the Rehabilitation Research and Development section of the&#xD;
      Veterans Health Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be enrolling about 450 participants at 3 sites or around 150 at each&#xD;
      site.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Degenerative disease of the lumbar spine is ubiquitous in older adults, but low back pain is&#xD;
      not. Treatments that focus exclusively on degenerative spine disease, such as spinal&#xD;
      injection and surgery, have resulted in rising costs and exposure to potentially&#xD;
      life-threatening morbidity but outcomes have not improved. The investigators posit that to&#xD;
      improve treatment outcomes for older adults with chronic low back pain (CLBP - back pain that&#xD;
      has been present on at least half the days for at least 6 months), the condition should be&#xD;
      approached as a syndrome, that is, a final common pathway for the expression of many&#xD;
      contributors, in the same way that geriatricians approach the evaluation and treatment of&#xD;
      delirium and falls. Using this model, the lumbar spine is considered a weak link, but is&#xD;
      rarely the sole treatment target. Conditions that commonly contribute to pain and disability&#xD;
      in older adults with CLBP include hip osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, anxiety, maladaptive&#xD;
      coping, and myofascial pain, each of which is associated with specific evidence-based&#xD;
      treatments. Because such conditions are not routinely evaluated in patients with CLBP, it is&#xD;
      perhaps not surprising that first line treatments that do not specifically target multiple&#xD;
      contributors (e.g. spine-focused physical therapy and analgesics) often provide suboptimal&#xD;
      treatment outcomes. This often results in continued treatment-seeking including potentially&#xD;
      toxic medications and invasive, expensive, and potentially life-threatening procedures such&#xD;
      as complex spinal fusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central question that the proposed randomized trial is designed to answer is: What is the&#xD;
      efficacy of caring for older adults with CLBP in Aging Back Clinics (ABC), where the patient&#xD;
      is first treated as an older adult, and second as a patient with CLBP, compared with usual&#xD;
      care (UC)? The investigators have developed evidence and expert-opinion based guidelines for&#xD;
      the evaluation and treatment of 12 key contributors to pain and disability in older adults&#xD;
      with CLBP. The investigators' prior work also supports the commonplace nature of multiple&#xD;
      contributors to CLBP in older Veterans and the feasibility of delivering patient-centered&#xD;
      comprehensive care that follows the investigators' published guidelines. The investigators&#xD;
      now wish to implement these guidelines in the investigators' ABC clinics and compare this&#xD;
      approach to that of UC in older Veterans. Proof of the hypotheses could significantly impact&#xD;
      patient care by reducing pain and disability and identifying key conditions whose treatment&#xD;
      could prevent the pursuit of invasive treatments and their associated potential morbidity and&#xD;
      cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 450 Veterans age 65-89 with CLBP will be recruited from primary care provider practices&#xD;
      at 3 VAs - VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Dallas VA, and Richmond VA to meet a target&#xD;
      randomization of 330. Individuals will be randomized to receive either ABC care or UC and&#xD;
      they will be followed for one year. Those in ABC care will be referred to a generalist (e.g.,&#xD;
      geriatrician, physiatrist, rheumatologist) that has been identified and trained in a&#xD;
      structured assessment to identify the conditions for which evidence and expert opinion-based&#xD;
      algorithms have been created. Usual care will not be constrained. Outcomes will be assessed&#xD;
      at baseline and over the telephone at three later time points: 6 months, 9 months and 12&#xD;
      months. Health Care Utilization will be assessed monthly. Gait speed, a strong predictor of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in older adults, will be measured at baseline. The proposed clinical&#xD;
      trial has the potential not only to improve pain-related disability, but also to reduce&#xD;
      morbidity, increase quality of life, and limit healthcare utilization.&#xD;

        About 450 Veterans (150 from each site) will be recruited, (to target randomizing 330&#xD;
        participants), from the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS), the VA North Texas&#xD;
        Healthcare System (Dallas, TX), and the Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center (Richmond&#xD;
        VA). The investigators anticipate the need to telephone screen ~1050 (i.e., ~175 per site&#xD;
        per year) to obtain 450 participants who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria. No one&#xD;
        will be excluded on the basis of race, gender or ethnicity. Based upon the data from each&#xD;
        of the three sites, the investigators anticipate that overall participant sample will be&#xD;
        97% male, 3% female, 2% Hispanic or Latino, 98% Not Hispanic or Latino, 1% American&#xD;
        Indian/Alaskan Native, 0% Asian, 2% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 18% Black or&#xD;
        African American, and 79% White or Caucasian. Non-Veterans will not be recruited to&#xD;
        participate.&#xD;
