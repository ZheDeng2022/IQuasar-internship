  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to further assess treatment efficacy and safety after using&#xD;
      QuiremSpheres® for the treatment of patients with unresectable primary liver cancer or&#xD;
      unresectable liver metastases suitable for SIRT and allocated to this treatment by a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary tumor board.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver tumors can be of primary (Hepatocellular Carcinoma, HCC) or metastatic (mainly from&#xD;
      colorectal carcinoma, CRC) origin. Both HCC and CRC are common causes of death from cancer&#xD;
      worldwide. The overall incidence of HCC and CRC remains high in developing countries and is&#xD;
      steadily rising in most industrialized countries. Available treatment options depend on the&#xD;
      size, number, and location of tumors, on liver status, overall performance status and&#xD;
      comorbidities, on patency of portal vein and presence of extrahepatic metastatic disease.&#xD;
      They include surgical (liver resection, liver transplantation), systemic (e.g. chemotherapy,&#xD;
      immunotherapy), ablative (thermal ablation, chemical ablation) and intra-arterial&#xD;
      (chemoembolization, radioembolization) modalities. Radioembolization, also known as Selective&#xD;
      Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) with microspheres containing a radiation-emitting isotope&#xD;
      (Yttrium-90 or Holmium-166) delivers localized radiation in the vasculature around liver&#xD;
      tumors with relatively limited concurrent injury to the surrounding normal/healthy tissue.&#xD;
      Yttrium-90 radioembolization is currently included in several guidelines (EASLEORTC, ESMO).&#xD;

    <description>1. Tumor response in the liver&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>2. Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events&#xD;
• Safety will be evaluated by monitoring and recording the grade 3, 4 and 5 adverse events (AE) and all adverse device effects (ADE) occurring during and after treatment throughout follow up of patients. Severity of adverse events will be rated following the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. Safety assessment will also be based on routine blood tests with an emphasis on the liver function parameters obtained at baseline, after the SIRT procedure and throughout the follow up period.</description>
