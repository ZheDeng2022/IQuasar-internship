  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unhealthy diet has long been associated with high uric acid levels and gout. The DASH diet&#xD;
      may lower uric acid levels. This study will examine the effects of the DASH diet on uric acid&#xD;
      in adults with a history of gout.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The public health burden of gout is substantial. Several lines of evidence suggest that a&#xD;
      DASH diet might lower uric acid. However, there are no trials of the DASH diet in adults with&#xD;
      gout. This trial is a cross-over study of the effects of a DASH-like diet on uric acid in&#xD;
      adults with gout and hyperuricemia, who are not taking urate-lowering therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perpetuated by the &quot;Western&quot; lifestyle and resulting obesity epidemic, the prevalence of gout&#xD;
      has increased over the past few decades to 3.9% of US adults (8.3 million individuals). This&#xD;
      prevalence increases with age to 9.3% of US adults over 60 years (4.7 million).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be community-dwelling adults, aged 18+ with a baseline serum uric acid&#xD;
      level of 7 mg/dL, who have a self-reported history of gout and are not taking urate lowering&#xD;
      medications (e.g. allopurinol, febuxostat, probenecid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is comprised of two study periods: (1) a dietitian-directed diet (DD) or (2)&#xD;
      self-directed usual diet (SD). Each period lasts 4 weeks. All participants will participate&#xD;
      in both periods, but half will undergo the dietitian-directed diet first while the other half&#xD;
      will undergo the self-directed diet first. During the dietitian-directed diet, participants&#xD;
      will receive $105/week of foods in a pattern that conforms to the DASH diet. The DASH diet&#xD;
      emphasizes fruit, vegetables, lean meat, low fat dairy, and high fiber, while restricting red&#xD;
      meat, sweets, and sugary beverages. During the self-directed diet, participants will be asked&#xD;
      to eat their typical diet outside of the study. Investigators anticipate 40 participants in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is uric acid. Secondary outcomes of this study include: body mass index,&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose. Both&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes will be measured 3 times: (1) before the study begins&#xD;
      (baseline), (2) after period 1 (at 4 weeks), and (3) after period 2 (at 8 weeks).&#xD;
      Patient-reported outcomes, dietary compliance, and urine electrolytes will be assessed&#xD;
      throughout the study as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary comparison will be serum uric acid concentrations measured after the 4-week&#xD;
      dietitian-directed diet versus uric acid concentrations measured after the 4-week&#xD;
      self-directed diet (DD vs. SD). Comparisons will be made within person using generalized&#xD;
      estimating equations (GEE) with and without adjustment for baseline uric acid concentration.&#xD;
      Investigators will use GEE models for secondary outcomes as well.&#xD;

            <description>During the self-directed diet, participants will be asked to consume their typical diet for 4 weeks. There will be no subsidy during this period. This is followed by the 4-week Dietitian-Directed Diet.&#xD;
During the Dietitian-Directed Diet, participants will be provided $105/week ($15/day) to purchase foods in servings that correspond to the DASH diet and thus include fruits, vegetables, lean meat, low fat dairy, and high fiber foods. Participants will also be asked to restrict red meat, sweets, and sugary beverages during this intervention period. A dietitian will help participants order foods from a digital supermarket. Foods will be delivered to the Johns Hopkins ProHealth Research Clinic for weekly pick-up. This study period will last 4 weeks.&#xD;

      <time_frame>This was a crossover design of 2 interventions. Each intervention lasted about 4 weeks. Adverse events in response to the intervention were assessed at the end of each intervention period during an in-person visit. Thus adverse event surveillance was performed at 4 weeks and 8 weeks for each participant in the study.</time_frame>

          <title>Dietitian-Directed Diet</title>
          <description>Participants will be provided $105/week ($15/day) to purchase foods in servings that correspond to the DASH diet and thus include fruits, vegetables, lean meat, low fat dairy, and high fiber foods. Participants will also be asked to restrict red meat, sweets, and sugary beverages during this intervention period. A dietitian will help participants order foods from a digital supermarket. Foods will be delivered to the Johns Hopkins ProHealth Research Clinic for weekly pick-up. This study period will last 4 weeks.&#xD;
Subsidy for food purchases and dietitian education: $105/wk of DASH-like foods over 4 weeks purchased with the help of a dietitian in a proportion that reflects the DASH diet.</description>

          <title>Self-Directed Diet</title>
          <description>Participants will be asked to consume their typical diet for 4 weeks. There will be no subsidy during this period.</description>
