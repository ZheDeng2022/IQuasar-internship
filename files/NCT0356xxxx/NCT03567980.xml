  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seborrheic dermatitis is a common and recurrent dermatosis that characteristically involves&#xD;
      the scalp, nasolabial folds, eyebrows, glabella, and upper eye lids. It presents as an&#xD;
      erythematous, thin scaly patch with a greasy sandpaper texture that varies depending on&#xD;
      disease severity. While seborrheic dermatitis most frequently occurs on the face, it can&#xD;
      involve other areas of the body especially the chest, abdomen, and axilla. Overall incidence&#xD;
      is thought to be between 2-5% of the general population, though this is likely an&#xD;
      underestimation. Pruritus is variable, though the signs and symptoms of this disorder are&#xD;
      certainly worsened by certain external conditions especially weather, personal perspiration,&#xD;
      stress, and poor hygiene. Patients often complain about the red, scaly patches on the face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antifungal agents are frequently used as monotherapy or in combination regimens in the&#xD;
      treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. Topical corticosteroids are often used for their&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects. Long term use of topical steroids on the face is not a preferred&#xD;
      treatment modality due to the risk of striae development and other textural changes that&#xD;
      occur over time. Therefore, topical crisaborole may be an alternative given its&#xD;
      non-corticosteroid anti-inflammatory action. Crisaborole is a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4)&#xD;
      inhibitor that increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels to exert its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects. While it has not previously been investigated for its effects in&#xD;
      seborrheic dermatitis, further studies evaluating its role in this disease are warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose a proof of concept study using topical crisaborole 2%&#xD;
      ointment on the face for 4 weeks to evaluate the anti-inflammatory action of this agent and&#xD;
      its utility in the treatment of facial seborrheic dermatitis.&#xD;

    <description>• Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA) is a skin assessment tool utilized in clinical trials. The tool is based on a 5-point scale with 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) being the best score one could receive, while a score of 4 is the worst score available and indicates severe disease. ISGA will be collected via skin examination to evaluate efficacy of Crisaborole 2% topical ointment in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. A 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) on the ISGA would be considered a treatment success. Percent change in ISGA score from baseline to 4 weeks will be measured and reported.</description>

    <description>• The Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is a subject-administered, 11 point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, 0 representing &quot;no itch&quot; and 10 representing &quot;worst itch imaginable.&quot; Overall severity of a subject itching is indicated by circling the number that best describes the worst level of itching in the past 24 hours.&#xD;
The Itch NRS (A numeric measurement of itch) will be collected to assess the percentage of improvement of patient reported itching. This will be calculated as a percent changes from baseline in the Itch NRS scale.</description>

        <description>• The Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is a subject-administered, 11 point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, 0 representing &quot;no itch&quot; and 10 representing &quot;worst itch imaginable.&quot; Overall severity of a subject itching is indicated by circling the number that best describes the worst level of itching in the past 24 hours.&#xD;
The Itch NRS (A numeric measurement of itch) will be collected to assess the percentage of improvement of patient reported itching. This will be calculated as a percent changes from baseline in the Itch NRS scale.</description>
