  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of evening alcohol consumption on sympathetic activity and&#xD;
      baroreflex function in binge drinkers. Our central hypothesis is that evening binge alcohol&#xD;
      consumption will lead to sympathetic overactivity and blunted baroreflex function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will recruit male and female binge drinkers who will participate in a randomized,&#xD;
      cross-over, double-blind, placebo-based study to examine the impact of an evening of alcohol&#xD;
      vs. placebo/fluid-control on autonomic and cardiovascular control at night and the subsequent&#xD;
      morning. The study will utilize established techniques for assessing sleep (polysomnography)&#xD;
      and autonomic/cardiovascular control (microneurography, beat-to-beat finger plethysmography,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, etc.). All subjects will undergo a familiarization night in the sleep&#xD;
      laboratory prior to their first randomized test session with either alcohol or&#xD;
      placebo/fluid-control. Both men and women will be tested to address a secondary aim of&#xD;
      determining the impact of sex (male vs. female) and ovarian cycle (early follicular vs.&#xD;
      midluteal phase) on sympathetic neural responsiveness to evening alcohol in binge drinkers.&#xD;
      Finally, as a tertiary/exploratory aim, participants that have a respiratory disturbance&#xD;
      index of ≥5 episodes per hour during the alcohol treatment will be asked to consider one&#xD;
      additional overnight session where they will be randomly assigned to either continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) or sham-CPAP for one additional night of evening alcohol&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;

             menstruation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to abstain from exercise and caffeine at least 12 hours prior to any&#xD;
             autonomic and cardiovascular testing, and abstain from alcohol 24 hours prior to any&#xD;
             autonomic and cardiovascular testing (unless experimentally administered).&#xD;
