      Functional assessment of non-culprit lesions during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)&#xD;
      in patients with acute coronary syndrome could improve risk stratification and long-term&#xD;
      prognosis. It was previously demonstrated the diagnostic accuracy of instantaneous wave-free&#xD;
      ratio (iFR) in functional assessment of non-culprit lesions in multivessel patients with&#xD;
      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), also highlighting the intralesional&#xD;
      reproducibility of both fractional flow reserve (FFR) and iFR between baseline and staged. In&#xD;
      this study the investigators aimed to verify the clinical impact on long-term outcome of iFR&#xD;
      assessment in the acute multivessel setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background - Approximately 40-50% of patients undergoing primary PCI for STEMI have an&#xD;
      occasional finding of multivessel coronary artery disease on angiography. In this setting&#xD;
      there is a general consensus in the treatment of the culprit lesion (infarct related artery -&#xD;
      IRA), while the literature provides contrasting evidence on the preventive treatment of&#xD;
      non-culprit coronary lesions (not IRA). Four major randomized trials have, in fact, compared&#xD;
      a complete revascularization strategy versus culprit-only revascularization during primary&#xD;
      PCI: PRAMI trial, CULPRIT trial, DANAMI-3-PRIMULTI trial and Compare-Acute trial. Although&#xD;
      all of these studies demonstrated a benefit in the composite cardiovascular end point in&#xD;
      patients undergoing complete revascularization, no statistically significant difference in&#xD;
      mortality was found. Therefore, at present, there is no definite evidence on the efficacy of&#xD;
      non culprit lesion treatment on mortality and re-MI in patients with STEMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology 2017 suggest however to evaluate&#xD;
      the complete revascularization in multivessel patients before discharge (class IIa, level A).&#xD;
      Previous randomized trials such as Compare-Acute study and DANAMI-3-Primulti showed that a&#xD;
      complete revascularization strategy guided by FFR, during primary PCI, is associated with a&#xD;
      significantly lower risk of cardiovascular events in patients with multivessel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, other studies demonstrated that an iFR-guided coronary revascularization is not&#xD;
      inferior to FFR-guided revascularization in patients with stable coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      whereas, it significantly reduces the overall duration of the procedure. The WAVE study&#xD;
      recently demonstrated the diagnostic accuracy of iFR in functional assessment of non-culprit&#xD;
      lesions in multivessel patients with STEMI, also highlighting the intralesional&#xD;
      reproducibility of both FFR and iFR between baseline and staged. To date, however, there are&#xD;
      no studies in the literature that have verified the long-term clinical impact of an&#xD;
      iFR-guided revascularization during primary PCI for STEMI patients with multivessel coronary&#xD;
      artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study - Multicenter, observational registry to evaluate the long-term clinical&#xD;
      impact of an iFR assessment of the non-culprit lesions during primary PCI for STEMI patients&#xD;
      with multivessel coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods - patients undergoing primary PCI for STEMI and presenting multivessel disease (at&#xD;
      least another coronary stenosis ≥ 50% in addition to the culprit one on QCA analysis) will be&#xD;
      enrolled. At the end of the revascularization procedure of the culprit lesion, the functional&#xD;
      assessment of the non-culprit lesion will be performed through the use of iFR. In the case of&#xD;
      iFR ≤ 0.89, the functionally critical lesion treatment will be performed during the same PCI&#xD;
      procedure or staged (at the discretion of the operator and the center). On the other hand,&#xD;
      patients with iFR&gt; 0.89 will instead be directed towards a conservative approach with the&#xD;
      implementation of clinical-instrumental follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical follow-up will be performed in all patients by telephone interviews or outpatient&#xD;
      visits at 12, 24 and 36 months from the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is represented by the occurrence of Target Lesion Failure&#xD;
      (TLF), a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and&#xD;
      ischemia-driven revascularization of the vessel previously assessed with iFR.&#xD;
