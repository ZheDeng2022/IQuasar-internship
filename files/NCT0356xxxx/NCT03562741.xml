      The purpose of this study is to see if stool transplant performed by colonoscopy is effective&#xD;
      at treating recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection of the colon. During the&#xD;
      procedure a stool sample is taken from a healthy donor (usually family member or close&#xD;
      friend) and transplanted directly into the colon of the patient with C. diff infection. The&#xD;
      goal of this experimental procedure (called fecal microbiota transplantation) is to replenish&#xD;
      the good bacteria in the colon that can help prevent C. diff infection from coming back after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) involves administering fecal material from a healthy&#xD;
      individual into the gastrointestinal tract of the patient. This has been done in the past for&#xD;
      recurrent colitis secondary to Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) using different methods&#xD;
      such as through nasogastric tube, fecal retention enemas, and by colonoscopy. This method of&#xD;
      treatment was introduced over 50 years ago with high success rates, although it has not been&#xD;
      until recent that more case studies have been performed, with continued success rates of&#xD;
      approximately 90%. Studies have found this therapy to be effective with resolution of&#xD;
      symptoms in most patients, and have found it to be both cost effective and safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to use a standardized published protocol for fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplantation performed by colonoscopy and record the success rate and outcomes of FMT&#xD;
      therapy for patients with recurrent CDI at the UMassMemorial Medical Center. In addition, the&#xD;
      cost of this therapy will be compared to conventional antibiotic treatment. The reduction in&#xD;
      hospitalizations will also be monitored compared with historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that FMT therapy will show resolution of infection in most&#xD;
      patients with recurrent CDI, with an overall reduction in cost to the hospital for recurrent&#xD;
      admissions for Clostridium difficile colitis as compared to historical controls. Historical&#xD;
      controls will be defined as patients with recurrent positive Clostridium difficile stool&#xD;
      samples treated in the traditional fashion with antibiotics.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Two or more recurrences of C. difficile infection (CDI) with recurrence defined as a&#xD;
             positive test result, e.g. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test and with appropriate&#xD;
             symptoms within 2-8 weeks of last positive result, provided that symptoms from earlier&#xD;
             episode resolved with or without therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failed standard therapy with oral metronidazole and/or oral vancomycin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One or more episodes of severe CDI resulting in hospitalization and not responding to&#xD;
             standard antibiotic therapy. Hospitalization for CDI occurs in the setting of severe&#xD;
             diarrhea, abdominal pain and signs of systemic toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt;16 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with acute severe colonic dilation at risk for colonic perforation&#xD;
