  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Published trials on tranexamic acid (TxA) for prevention have used a variety of fixed (0.5gm&#xD;
      or 1gm) and body-weight adjusted (10mg/kg or 15mg/kg) doses of TxA. Given the wide range of&#xD;
      bodyweights of pregnant women in contemporary obstetric practice, it is critical to determine&#xD;
      the minimum effective dose of TxA, so as to avoid under- or over-dosing. The rationale of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the minimum effective dose of TxA that is required to attain&#xD;
      therapeutic plasma levels of TxA, established at 5-15mg/L, following administration of a&#xD;
      single dose of intravenous (IV) TxA after childbirth and the clamping the umbilical cord, and&#xD;
      before delivery of the placenta. Following birth of the infant, and upon clamping the&#xD;
      umbilical cord, the investigators will administer a single dose of IV TxA in 100ml of 0.9%&#xD;
      sodium chloride at 50mg/min according to the dose-escalation schedule described below. The&#xD;
      slow rate of infusion has been chosen to prevent untoward effects such as hypotension that&#xD;
      have been noted when the rate of infusion has exceeded 100mg/min. As part of the&#xD;
      dose-escalation design, the investigators will start with 5mg/kg, half the smallest described&#xD;
      dose, on a sample of up to 5 women. They will continue to administer TxA doses in increments&#xD;
      of 5mg/kg to each successive batch of 5 women. If the number of treatment successes cannot&#xD;
      statistically rule out a value &lt; 75% (&lt; 4 of 5 women are successes due to values in the low&#xD;
      range), the dose will be increased by 5mg/kg for the next set of 5 women, and so on, until a&#xD;
      maximum dose of 30mg/kg is reached, a dose deemed safe based on earlier studies in different&#xD;
      populations. Once treatment success is determined at a certain dose, i.e. 4/5 women have&#xD;
      levels in the therapeutic range), a total of 20 women will be administered that dose to&#xD;
      ensure that 75% i.e. 18/20 women are successes at that dose.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Research question: What is the minimum effective dose required for attainment of therapeutic&#xD;
      plasma levels of 5-15mg/L in postpartum women?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Pharmacokinetic study using a dose-escalation design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial treatment and dosage regimen: Following recruitment and prior to the caesarean&#xD;
      delivery, the anaesthesiologist will insert a large-bore cannula into the participant's&#xD;
      antecubital vein and draw blood for a complete blood count (CBC), which will be used in&#xD;
      tandem with 24-hour post-delivery CBC to estimate blood loss, and serum creatinine to rule&#xD;
      out elevated serum creatinine levels, a study exclusion criterion. Following birth of the&#xD;
      infant, and upon clamping the umbilical cord, the anaesthesiologist will administer a single&#xD;
      dose of IV TxA in 100ml of 0.9% sodium chloride at 50mg/min according to the dose-escalation&#xD;
      schedule described below. All participants will receive oxytocin 20 international units (IU)&#xD;
      IV in 1 litre of 0.9% sodium chloride at the rate of 125 ml/hour with placental delivery, as&#xD;
      part of active management of the third stage of labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints Primary endpoints - Plasma levels of TxA: These will be obtained via serial blood&#xD;
      draws at baseline (before TxA administration), and at 15, 30, 60 minutes and 120 minutes&#xD;
      after administration of TxA, (as its maximum effect is within the 60 minutes and therapeutic&#xD;
      plasma concentrations are maintained for 7-8 hours after administration). Blood will be drawn&#xD;
      at baseline (before administration of TxA) in order to confirm zero plasma levels of TxA, as&#xD;
      part of quality assurance. Blood will be collected in a standard citrate tube (Vacutainer,&#xD;
      NJ, USA), centrifuged soon after collection and the plasma (supernatant) stored at -80°C&#xD;
      before analysis. TxA will be extracted from plasma using solid phase microextraction, and&#xD;
      concentrations measured using tandem liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: (a) Total blood loss in 24 hours following childbirth will be determined&#xD;
      by the reference standard methods - direct measurement (blood collected in suction apparatus)&#xD;
      and gravimetric (weighing of linen) and by using formulae to determine blood loss using pre-&#xD;
      and post-delivery haemoglobin and haematocrit as we have previously described (b) Early&#xD;
      adverse events will be recorded prior to discharge and delayed events will be obtained at the&#xD;
      six-week postpartum visit or via phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected duration of subject participation, duration of all trial periods and follow up: The&#xD;
      intervention will only be administered once, and blood drawn at baseline and 15, 30, 60 and&#xD;
      120 minutes after administration, as described above. Again, as described above, data on&#xD;
      early adverse events will be collected prior to discharge from hospital and those on delayed&#xD;
      adverse events will be obtained at the time of the routine 6-week postpartum visit in person&#xD;
      or via a telephone interview. There will be no additional follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rules: As the drug will be administered as a slow infusion in the operating room, it&#xD;
      will be stopped immediately if any adverse events are noted. Thereafter, no further drug will&#xD;
      be administered, and therefore stopping rules do not apply. Participants will be allowed to&#xD;
      withdraw from the study at any point without affecting their clinical care.&#xD;
