      This research study is studying a combination of interventions as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      pancreatic tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FOLFIRINOX which is made up of 4 different drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Oxaliplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Irinotecan&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Leucovorin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Losartan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved FOLFIRINOX as a treatment option&#xD;
      for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved losartan or nivolumab for this specific disease but they have been&#xD;
      approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLFIRINOX is a combination of 4 chemotherapy agents that may help shrink your tumor before&#xD;
      surgery. Losartan is a drug that is used to lower blood pressure. Nivolumab is an antibody (a&#xD;
      cell that attaches to other cells to fight off infection) that may cause programmed cell&#xD;
      death of cancer cells. Radiation therapy is believed to increase the likelihood of response&#xD;
      of immunotherapy (the prevention/treatment of a disease through an immune response).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 8 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>R0 resection is defined as microscopically negative margins determined by histopathologic assessment of the resection specimen. The R0 resection rate will be analyzed among all eligible patients, including those not resected due to early progression, death or off-study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until the time of progression or death, up to approximately 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization (or registration on Arm 4) to first objective documentation of progressive disease (distant or local) or death. Disease status is evaluated using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). Disease progression is defined as having at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesion, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until the time of death, up to approximately 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or registration on Arm 4) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pathologic complete response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of participants that achieved a pathologic complete response. Pathologic complete response is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, as confirmed by a pathologist evaluating the tissue samples removed during surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with treatment related serious adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of treatment until 30 days after the end of treatment, up to approximately 14 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events are assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Adverse events are considered to be related to treatment if the Investigator deems them to be either possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment.</description>

             resectable or locally advanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Borderline resectable is defined by the NCCN as tumors with venous involvement of the&#xD;
             SMV/portal vein demonstrated tumor abutment with or without impingement and narrowing&#xD;
             of the lumen, either tumor thrombus or encasement but with suitable vessel proximal&#xD;
             and distal to the area of vessel involvement, allowing for safe resection or&#xD;
             reconstruction; gastroduodenal artery encasement up to the hepatic artery with either&#xD;
             short segment encasement or direct abutment of the hepatic artery, without extension&#xD;
             to the celiac axis; or tumor abutment of the SMA not to exceed greater than 180&#xD;
             degrees of the circumference of the vessel wall. Tumors involving retroperitoneal&#xD;
             structures that can be surgically removed (i.e. kidney), will also be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Localized is defined as no extrapancreatic disease, no evidence (on CT) of involvement&#xD;
             of the celiac axis or SMA, no evidence (CT or MRI) of occlusion of the SMV or SMPV&#xD;
             confluence, no evidence of gross peritoneal or distant metastases on staging&#xD;
             laparoscopy or laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Locally advanced unresectable disease is defined by the NCCN as: Tumors of the head&#xD;
             that have greater than 180 degrees of SMA encasement or any celiac abutment,&#xD;
             unreconstructable SMV or portal occlusion, or aortic invasion or encasement. Tumors of&#xD;
             the body with SMA or celiac encasement of greater than 180 degrees, unreconstructable&#xD;
             SMV or portal occlusion, or aortic invasion. Tumors of the tail with SMA or celiac&#xD;
             encasement of greater than 180 degrees. Irrespective of location, all tumors with&#xD;
             evidence of nodal metastasis outside of the resection field are deemed unresectable.&#xD;

             two values - separate seated, resting measurements taken five minutes apart. BP does&#xD;
             not need to be checked in both arms unless a reading is below 110 mm Hg, in which case&#xD;
             the other arm can be checked as well. If BP is checked in both arms, the higher value&#xD;
             is deemed accurate for calculating the average.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance for females = 0.85 x male value&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of&#xD;
