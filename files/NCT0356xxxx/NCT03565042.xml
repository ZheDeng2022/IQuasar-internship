  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the mechanism of action on target tissue level of&#xD;
      ustekinumab treatment in psoriatic arthritis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are planning to start treatment with anti-p40 therapy (ustekinumab) will be&#xD;
      included in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 0, 12 and 24 peripheral blood, synovial tissue and skin will be obtained and analysed&#xD;
      with different techniques to assess the effect of the therapy on inflammatory pathways.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the study is to determine which downstream cellular and molecular pathways&#xD;
      involved in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) pathogenesis are modulated by Interleukine&#xD;
      23/Interleukine12 P40 subunit (IL23/12 P40) blockade. As we have ample evidence that relevant&#xD;
      disease-specific pathways are found in the primary target tissues, in particular in synovial&#xD;
      tissue obtained from peripheral joints, but not in peripheral blood, we will strongly focus&#xD;
      on this compartment by obtaining paired biopsies before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the effect of IL23/12 P40 blockade on cellular en&#xD;
      molecular pathways involved in PsA disease in the synovium, in the synovial fluid and&#xD;
      peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to compare which cellular/molecular disease pathways are affected&#xD;
      by IL23/12 P40 blockade and not by tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockade and thereby identify&#xD;
      molecular biomarkers which may help to determine which patients may benefit from this&#xD;
      treatment in comparison with anti-TNF treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single centre, 24-week open-label study in subjects with clinically active peripheral&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis receiving treatment with ustekinumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synovial biopsies will be obtained from patients before and after 12 and 24 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment with ustekinumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis according to the Classification Criteria for&#xD;
      Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) criteria with at least one swollen knee or ankle joint who are&#xD;
      planning to receive treatment with ustekinumab at the outpatient clinic. In total 16 patients&#xD;
      will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Blood withdrawal and mini-arthroscopies at different timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Changes in the synovial cellular infiltrate and molecular pathways influenced between&#xD;
      baseline and week 12/ week24&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Comparison of the synovial molecular changes induced by anti-p40 with the changes induced&#xD;
      by anti-TNF (analysed in historical samples in a similar patient population and study&#xD;
      setting)&#xD;
