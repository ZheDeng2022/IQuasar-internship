    <textblock>
      This study has dose escalation (Part A, B, C) and dose expansion (Cohorts A-L) parts. Dose&#xD;
      escalation is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of MK-4830&#xD;
      monotherapy administration (Parts A and B) and in combination with pembrolizumab (Part C).&#xD;
      Dose expansion is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of MK-4830 in combination&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab and evaluate the safety, tolerability and ORR of MK-4830 administered in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. There is no formal hypothesis testing in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
