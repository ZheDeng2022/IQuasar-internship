    <textblock>
      A community-based, randomized control, assessor blinded trial in peri-urban settings of&#xD;
      Karachi, Pakistan to study the impact of Lipid-based Nutritional Supplement for Pregnant and&#xD;
      Lactating women which is balanced energy-protein (BEP) dietary supplement, a locally produced&#xD;
      ready-to-use nutritional product for lactating women (LW) and single prophylaxis dose of&#xD;
      Azithromycin for infants, on growth of infants over the period of six months since birth&#xD;
      compared to current standard of care. LW and her infant will be enrolled in the trial within&#xD;
      168 hours of the birth and LW will be randomized in either of the arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Arm A: 'Control Arm', LW will only receive standard of care which comprises of standard&#xD;
           nutritional counseling, key messages of exclusive breastfeeding, essential newborn and&#xD;
           infant care and immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Arm B: 'Nutritional supplement only', LW randomized will recieve nutrition supplement&#xD;
           product for next 6 months to be consumed in a dose of 2 sachets of 75 grams per day.&#xD;
           Further, LW will also receive standard of care which comprises of standard nutritional&#xD;
           counseling, key messages of exclusive breastfeeding, essential newborn and infant care&#xD;
           and immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Arm C: ''Nutritional supplement plus Azithromycin', LW randomized will receive&#xD;
           nutritional supplement product for next 6 months to be consumed in a dose of 2 sachets&#xD;
           of 75 grams per day. Further, the infant of LW will receive a single dose of&#xD;
           Azithromycin (20mg/kilogram) at day 42 of age. Further, LW will also receive standard of&#xD;
           care which comprises of standard nutritional counseling, key messages of exclusive&#xD;
           breastfeeding, essential newborn and infant care and immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aim is to assess the efficacy of nutritional product in a proposed dose to lactating&#xD;
      women for at least 6 months of lactation, alone or in combination of single dose of&#xD;
      Azithromycin as 20mg/kg to infants at 42 days of age on lenght velocity as primary, and&#xD;
      weight velocity as secondary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive nutrition counseling along with guidance related to exclusive&#xD;
      breastfeeding and further assessment will be done to assess breast milk composition,&#xD;
      Haemoglobin, Ferritin and Transferrin receptor, and inflammatory biomarkers, as secondary&#xD;
      outcomes. Further, this study will also look at the comparison of length-for-age,&#xD;
      weight-for-length, and weight-for-age Z scores as other secondary outcome at 6 months of age&#xD;
      among three arms.&#xD;
