  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3039294 has been developed to offer an orally available alternative to parenteral&#xD;
      GSK2315698 (miridesap) for plasma serum amyloid P component (SAP) depletion prior to and&#xD;
      following use of anti-SAP Monoclonal Antibody (mAb) in the treatment of systemic amyloidosis.&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the study are to assess the cardiac arrhythmic potential of&#xD;
      GSK3039294 and evaluate safety and tolerability of repeat doses of GSK3039294, in healthy&#xD;
      subjects relative to placebo for the same duration. This study will consist of two parts,&#xD;
      Part A and a conditional Part B. Part A is designed as a randomized double-blinded, 3 period,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, repeat-dose, crossover study. The decision to initiate Part B will be&#xD;
      based on an evaluation of data from Part A, which will include an overall assessment of&#xD;
      safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). In Part A, there will be three&#xD;
      treatment periods with 7 days of dosing in each and minimum 7-day washout period between each&#xD;
      treatment session. Each subject will receive two dose levels of GSK3039294 and placebo. In&#xD;
      Part B, there will be two treatment periods with 7 days of dosing in each and minimum 7-day&#xD;
      washout period. Each subject will receive one dose level of GSK3039294 and placebo. In Part&#xD;
      A, approximately 48 subjects will be recruited for an estimated total of 36 completers. In&#xD;
      Part B, approximately 32 subjects will be recruited for an estimated total of 24 completers.&#xD;
      The study will last up to approximately 10 weeks from screening to follow-up.&#xD;
