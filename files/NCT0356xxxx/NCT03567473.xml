  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that infants with bronchiolitis treated with inhaled epinephrine in the&#xD;
      Emergency Department (ED) and a 2-day course of oral dexamethasone will have fewer&#xD;
      hospitalizations over 7 days compared to infants treated with placebo. To examine this&#xD;
      hypothesis, we will conduct a phase III, multicentre, randomized, double-blind trial. Infants&#xD;
      presenting to one of twelve study EDs will be enrolled to one of two study groups: (1)&#xD;
      inhaled epinephrine and oral dexamethasone or (2) inhaled placebo and oral placebo. Our&#xD;
      primary outcome will be admission for bronchiolitis by day 7 following the enrolment. As a&#xD;
      planned secondary analysis, a between-group comparison of the primary outcome will be&#xD;
      performed in those patients presenting with a first episode of bronchiolitis.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Presenting to the ED with an episode of bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis will be defined&#xD;
             as an episode of wheezing or crackles in a child &lt; 12 month of age associated with&#xD;
             signs of an upper respiratory tract infection (e.g. cough, coryza, nasal congestion)&#xD;
             during the period deemed to be peak season for RSV bronchiolitis (approximately&#xD;
             December to April in Northern Hemisphere and June to October in Southern Hemisphere).&#xD;
             We have chosen not to define bronchiolitis as the first episode of wheezing or&#xD;
             crackles to better reflect the clinical guidelines and clinical practice&#xD;
             internationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 60 days to less than 12 months. Children younger than 60 days will not be enrolled&#xD;
             due to the risk of concomitant infection and other issues pertaining to glucocorticoid&#xD;
             use in the very young. Children older than 12 months will not be enrolled to minimize&#xD;
             the risk of enrolling children with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Respiratory distress assessment instrument (RDAI) score of less than or equal to 3.&#xD;
             This RDAI will ensure children with very mild respiratory diseases are not enrolled.&#xD;
             This is the lower limit of the RDAI range used in CanBEST.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previously known chronic disease that may affect cardiopulmonary status of the&#xD;
             patient, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia currently receiving oxygen, cystic&#xD;
             fibrosis, congenital heart disease and immune deficiency. These children may be at&#xD;
             higher risk for developing severe illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Severe respiratory distress evidenced by a sustained pulse rate &gt; 200 beats/min, a&#xD;
             sustained respiratory rate &gt; 80 breaths/min, profound lethargy (as deemed by the&#xD;
             treating physician), or requiring resuscitation room care. We will exclude these&#xD;
             children as they are likely to be admitted due to severity of illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presenting with symptoms of apnea prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Treatment with oral, inhaled, or IV corticosteroids within the last 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of adverse reaction to glucocorticoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Treatment with any beta-agonists (salbutamol/albuterol or epinephrine/adrenaline) in&#xD;
             the ED prior to study enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Presence of varicella or recent (less than 3 weeks) close contact (defined as any&#xD;
             household or daycare contact, or greater than 15 minutes of face to face contact, or&#xD;
             greater than 1 hour of being in the same dwelling with an individual) without a&#xD;
             history of prior infection. These patients are not enrolled to reduce any risk of&#xD;
             developing severe varicella with corticosteroid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Insurmountable language barrier (patient's parent/guardian is unable to understand&#xD;
             English or French to give informed consent and participate in follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any child born at less than 37weeks gestation who is younger than 60 days corrected&#xD;
             age. We will not enroll these children to lower any risk of exposing young infants to&#xD;
             corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Previous enrolment in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Unavailability for follow-up period.&#xD;
