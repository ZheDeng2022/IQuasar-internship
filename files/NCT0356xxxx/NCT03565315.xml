      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a serious disease. There is no cure or&#xD;
      vaccine to prevent infection. Using antibodies might be a good way to treat or prevent HIV.&#xD;
      Antibodies are naturally made by the body to fight germs. Researchers want to test if two&#xD;
      antibodies made artificially in a lab can help to prevent HIV infection. The antibodies are&#xD;
      10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS are safe and well-tolerated and how long they stay in the&#xD;
      blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18-60&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers were screened in another protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were enrolled in 1 of 4 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 participants were enrolled to receive 1 dose of 10E8VLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 participants were enrolled to receive 3 doses of 10E8VLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 participants were enrolled to receive 1 dose of both 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4 participants were enrolled to receive 3 doses of both 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Groups 1 and 3 were expected to be enrolled about 13 visits over 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Groups 2 and 4 were expected to be enrolled about 26 visits over 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were weighed before each dose. Women may have had a pregnancy test. Participants&#xD;
      had blood collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small needle injected each dose into fatty tissue of the belly, upper arm, or thigh.&#xD;
      Participants received between 1 and 8 injections per dose depending on their weight. Heavier&#xD;
      participants received more injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants received a ruler and thermometer. They checked their temperature for 3 days&#xD;
      after injection(s) and measured any redness, swelling, or bruising at the injection site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At non-injection visits, participants had blood drawn and were checked for health changes or&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;

      VRC 610:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase I Safety and Pharmacokinetics Study to Evaluate a Human Monoclonal Antibody (MAB)&#xD;
      VRC-HIVMAB095-00-AB (10E8VLS) Administered Alone or Concurrently with MAB VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB&#xD;
      (VRC07-523LS) Via Subcutaneous Injection in Healthy Adults&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This first-in-human, open-label study evaluated MAb 10E8VLS (VRC-HIVMAB095-00-AB)&#xD;
      administered alone or concurrently (i.e., at the same visit) with MAb VRC07-523LS&#xD;
      (VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB) in healthy adults ages 18 to 60. The primary hypothesis was that&#xD;
      administrations of 10E8VLS alone and concurrently with VRC07-523LS will be well-tolerated in&#xD;
      healthy adults. A secondary hypothesis was that both broadly neutralizing monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies (bNAbs) will be detectable in human sera with a definable half-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS bNAbs target the HIV-1 envelope at distinct epitopes: 10E8VLS&#xD;
      recognizes the membrane proximal external region (MPER) and proximal viral membrane lipid of&#xD;
      gp41, while VRC07-523LS recognizes the CD4 binding site of gp120. Both antibodies are human&#xD;
      in origin, contain two amino acid modifications within the C-terminus of the heavy chain&#xD;
      constant region designed to improve antibody half-life in vivo, and were developed by the&#xD;
      VRC/NIAID/NIH. The 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS bNAbs were manufactured under current Good&#xD;
      Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations at the VRC Pilot Plant operated under contract by&#xD;
      the Vaccine Clinical Materials Program (VCMP), Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick,&#xD;
      MD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 10E8VLS drug product was supplied at a concentration of 100 mg/mL in a sterile, aqueous,&#xD;
      buffered solution of 5.25 mL in single-use 10 mL glass vials. The VRC07-523LS drug product&#xD;
      was supplied at a concentration of 100 mg/mL in an isotonic, sterile solution of 6.25 mL in&#xD;
      single-use 10 mL glass vials. Each drug product was prepared for administration in separate&#xD;
      syringes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults, 18-60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label study included 4 dosing regimens of either 10E8VLS (5 mg/kg) administered&#xD;
      alone or 10E8VLS (5 mg/kg) and VRC07-523LS (5 mg/kg). All injections were administered by the&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) route. For Groups 1 and 2, 10E8VLS was to be administered once or&#xD;
      three-times at 12-week intervals. For Groups 3 and 4, 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS were to be&#xD;
      administered once or three-times at 12-week intervals, respectively. Enrollment began with&#xD;
      Groups 1 and 2, followed by Groups 3 and 4.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Total Actual Participants = 9 (c)&#xD;
&#xD;
      (*)Participants received only one product administration on Day 0 because of the voluntary&#xD;
      study pause and termination by Investigational New Drug (IND) Sponsor/Principal Investigator&#xD;
      (PI) decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enrollment into Group 3 and 4 commenced after positive protocol safety review team&#xD;
           (PSRT) review of safety data from Groups 1 and 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS were provided in separate syringes and administered at the same&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The expected enrollment was 16 participants; however, enrollment was voluntarily paused&#xD;
           by the IND Sponsor/PI and the study ultimately stopped after several Grade 2 and Grade 3&#xD;
           redness local reactogenicity reactions were observed at 10E8VLS injection sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation was expected to be approximately 24 weeks for participants in Groups 1&#xD;
      and 3, and 48 weeks for participants in Groups 2 and 4. Participants in the repeat-dose&#xD;
      groups (2 and 4) were converted to a modified schedule per protocol. Study participation for&#xD;
      all participants was approximately 24 weeks after Day 0 product administration.&#xD;

        <title>Number of Participants Reporting Local Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms Within 3 Days of Product Administration</title>
        <description>Local symptoms were recorded by participants using a 3-day diary. Solicited local symptoms include pain/tenderness, bruising, redness, swelling, and pruritus (itchiness) at the product administration site. Clinicians reviewed the diary with the participant and collected resolution information for any symptoms that were not resolved within 3 days. Participants were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they experienced the symptom at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Local Symptom&quot; is the number of participants reporting any local symptom at the worst severity. Reactogenicity grading was done by Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Corrected Version 2.1.</description>

        <population>Participants in Groups 1 and 2 (N=6) received 10E8VLS and Groups 3 and 4 (N=2) received 10E8VLS+VRC07-523LS. Participants in Groups 2 and 4 were assigned to receive 3 repeat product administrations but received only 1 due to the voluntary termination of study product administration by the IND sponsor. The 2nd and 3rd doses for the 3 Group 2 participants assigned to receive 10E8VLS, and the single Group 4 participant assigned to receive 10E8VLS+VRC07-523LS were not administered.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants Reporting Systemic Reactogenicity Signs and Symptoms Within 3 Days of Product Administration</title>
        <description>Participants recorded 3-day systemic symptoms in a diary after each study product administration. Solicited systemic symptoms include: unusually tired/feeling unwell, muscles aches, headache, chills, nausea, temperature and joint pain. Participants recorded highest measured temperature daily. Clinicians reviewed the diary with the participant and collected resolution information for any symptoms that were not resolved within 3 days. Participants were counted once for each symptom at the worst severity if they indicated experiencing the symptom at any severity during the reporting period. The number reported for &quot;Any Systemic Symptom&quot; is the number of participants reporting any systemic symptom at the worst severity. Reactogenicity grading was done by Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Corrected Version 2.1.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The study never resumed after the voluntary pause. Participants in the repeat-dose groups (2 and 4) were converted to a modified schedule per protocol. Study participation for all participants was approximately 24 weeks after Day 0 product administration. The overall population (N=8) was analyzed for the pharmacokinetic (PK) outcome measures as all study groups received only one 10E8VLS administration. Small group size has not allowed for meaningful PK analysis of each group separately.</limitations_and_caveats>
