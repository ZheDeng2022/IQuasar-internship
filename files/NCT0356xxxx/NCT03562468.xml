      The sponsor of this study is ChromaDex, Inc. This is a double-blind, randomized, crossover&#xD;
      study to investigate the effects of 300 mg/d and 1000 mg/d TRU NIAGEN (nicotinamide riboside)&#xD;
      compared to a placebo control on cognitive function, mood and sleep in men and women over 55&#xD;
      years of age. The trial is managed by Midwest Center for Metabolic and Cardiovascular&#xD;
