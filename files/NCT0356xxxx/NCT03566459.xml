  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) of Veterans with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) decreases&#xD;
      mortality and improves treatment follow-up. However, outside of large and/or urban VA medical&#xD;
      centers, there are shortages of providers with experience treating OUD and a license to&#xD;
      prescribe buprenorphine. This has resulted in decreased access to MAT (buprenorphine/naloxone&#xD;
      and injectable naltrexone) at rural CBOCs and increased overdose rates in rural areas. Some&#xD;
      individual prescribers have used clinical video teleconferencing (CVT) to overcome geographic&#xD;
      barriers and prescribe MAT to Veterans in CBOCs. However, while locally effective, these&#xD;
      arrangements are not standardized and are not parts of larger VISN-wide or national VHA&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal describes an effective program that the investigators propose to replicate and&#xD;
      expand. The program involves increasing prescribing rates of MAT for OUD in CBOCs using&#xD;
      telemedicine. The investigators propose to (A) develop materials and procedures for the&#xD;
      dissemination of telemedicine delivery of MAT to Veterans at CBOCs and (B) implement&#xD;
      telemedicine prescribing of MAT at rural CBOCs in Northern Maine that lack on-site MAT&#xD;
      providers. MAT will be prescribed by the VISN 1 Telemental Health Hub, which already provides&#xD;
      medication management, psychotherapy, and some MAT to sites in Northern Maine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In later years, the program will be expanded to other VISN 1 CBOCs, and to other TMH Regional&#xD;
      Hubs that provide services to wide catchment areas in other VISNs. By building on an existing&#xD;
      infrastructure connecting these TMH Regional Hubs to CBOCs and collaborating with other&#xD;
      national initiatives (e.g. SCAN ECHO, PDSI, and academic detailing), telemedicine MAT will be&#xD;
      rapidly disseminated to Veterans at CBOCs who are at high risk for illness, overdose, and&#xD;
      premature death from opioids.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The &quot;Replicating Existing Programs with Blended (External and Internal) Facilitation&quot;&#xD;
      approach will be the study's implementation strategy. Existing programs of telemedicine&#xD;
      MAT---including those by VA Maine and VISN 1 TMH Regional Hub prescribers---will be&#xD;
      replicated. External Facilitation, an approach that has been effective in increasing&#xD;
      intervention uptake in controlled trials, will be provided to rural CBOCs in Northern Maine&#xD;
      by expert study investigators. Internal Facilitation will be provided by VA Maine primary&#xD;
      care and pharmacy staff, who are already supporting programs in opioid prescribing safety in&#xD;
      the VA Maine Healthcare System. Supporting this project are consultants and collaborators&#xD;
      with expertise in implementation science, program evaluation, pain treatment, academic&#xD;
      detailing, and telemedicine MAT. Data collected during implementation will inform program&#xD;
      expansion. The primary measure of program outcomes will be the SAIL SUD16 measure of MAT use&#xD;
      for Veterans with OUD.&#xD;
