  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to examine whether a purchasing incentive for healthy foods has the same effect on&#xD;
      dietary intake in a community with and a community without a purchasing penalty for unhealthy&#xD;
      foods. We will perform a randomized non-inferiority trial in two locations, San Francisco&#xD;
      (SF) and Los Angeles (LA) to test whether a voucher for purchasing fresh fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables has a similar effect in LA and in SF, where the former does not but the latter&#xD;
      does have a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. Participants will be recruited from 4&#xD;
      neighborhoods (N=312) with 2 SF neighborhoods (exposed to the SSB tax) and 2 LA neighborhoods&#xD;
      (not exposed to the SSB tax).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We will test the hypothesis that a positive incentive for healthy foods (fresh fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables, F&amp;Vs) will be utilized as effectively in a community without a purchasing penalty&#xD;
      for unhealthy foods (a sugar-sweetened beverage [SSB] tax) as in a community with a&#xD;
      purchasing penalty for unhealthy foods (a SSB tax). Our experiment will test the&#xD;
      empirically-driven hypothesis in a real-world setting through a noninferiority design:&#xD;
      comparing the impact of F&amp;V vouchers in two counties, one without (Los Angeles) and one with&#xD;
      (San Francisco) a SSB tax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study participant will receive four paper vouchers per month for a total of six months.&#xD;
      Each of these vouchers can be redeemed for fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables at a number&#xD;
      of specified local corner stores, supermarkets, or farmer's markets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of these participants will receive and spend these vouchers in an environment which has&#xD;
      implemented a SSB tax (SF); the other half will receive and spend these same vouchers in a&#xD;
      non-tax environment (LA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each individual participant will be enrolled in the study for a total of seven months from&#xD;
      initial orientation and participant consent (M0) to final data collection during final month&#xD;
      of intervention (M6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are using a non-inferiority trial design. We are aiming to test whether there is a&#xD;
      significant difference in total cup-equivalents of F&amp;V intake in LA participants as compared&#xD;
      to SF participants when given F&amp;V vouchers. That is, we aim to test whether the F&amp;V voucher&#xD;
      is less effective in LA than in SF. This is important to test because it has been purported&#xD;
      that SF has a unique food environment with high accessibility to fresh F&amp;V through farmer's&#xD;
      markets and a plethora of corner stores, as well as a SSB tax that discourages less healthy&#xD;
      foods, potentially leaving more funds for healthier F&amp;Vs. Thus, we aim to determine the&#xD;
      change in consumption of F&amp;V in LA participants is non-inferiority to that of SF&#xD;
      participants, when both are given F&amp;V vouchers.&#xD;
