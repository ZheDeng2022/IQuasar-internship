      SPECIFIC AIM 1: To evaluate in a multi-center, randomized trial the effectiveness of PROs&#xD;
      elicited using PatientBuddy and EncephalApp on the prevention of avoidable 30 day&#xD;
      readmissions in patients with cirrhosis and their caregivers compared to standard of care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhosis affects more than 6 million US patients and is a major burden on patients,&#xD;
      caregivers and the healthcare system. Patients with cirrhosis are prone to clinical and&#xD;
      psycho-social issues that may predict hospitalization, re-hospitalizations and death.&#xD;
      Important patient-reported outcomes (PRO) such as impaired daily functioning, sleep,&#xD;
      cognition and pain are widely prevalent in patients with cirrhosis. These changes can&#xD;
      independently impact hospitalizations, re-hospitalizations and death in cirrhotic patients.&#xD;
      The investigators have studied the impact of these PRO using traditional and computerized&#xD;
      scales such as PROMIS (Patient-reported outcomes measurement information system). With the&#xD;
      increasing spread of health-related electronic devices, the relevance of health IT in the&#xD;
      management of chronic diseases such as cirrhosis is paramount. The team has already developed&#xD;
      and used several health IT advances to educate patients and their caregivers in inpatient and&#xD;
      outpatient settings. These tools are Patient Buddy to define patients regarding factor&#xD;
      preventing readmission, and EncephalApp Stroop to detect cognitive dysfunction in cirrhosis.&#xD;
      As part of a funded AHRQ R21, PatientBuddy, which has undergone multiple refinements in&#xD;
      response to feedback from patients, caregivers and administering staff, is being used by the&#xD;
      study team to prevent readmissions to Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center (VCU).&#xD;
      However the evaluation of these tools in a multi-center study that adapts to the status of&#xD;
      the patients and their caregivers is an important step towards improvement in&#xD;
      cirrhosis-related outcomes. In addition, PROs that are elicited and monitored when the&#xD;
      patients are outside the hospital will advance the field by making them integral parts of&#xD;
      clinical management.&#xD;
