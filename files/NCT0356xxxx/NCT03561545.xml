  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During weightlessness, the cardiovascular system is subject to rapid changes which has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in studies of short term (Space Shuttle) and long term missions to Skylab, MIR,&#xD;
      and the International Space Station (Nicogossian et al., 1989; Blomquist, 1994; Platts et&#xD;
      al., 2014). There is also evidence for changes in the blood vessel structure, the metabolism&#xD;
      and the responses to vasodilator and constrictor substances that might have long-term health&#xD;
      consequences resembling the effects of aging on the cardiovascular system (Hughson and&#xD;
      Shoemaker, 2004). Cardiovascular adaptations cause an increased incidence of postflight&#xD;
      orthostatic intolerance (fainting), decreased cardiac output and reduced exercise capacity.&#xD;
      Besides these postflight effects, weightlessness could also have harmful consequences during&#xD;
      the flight. For example, it has been shown that cardiac arrhythmia may occur during space&#xD;
      missions, even in healthy individuals (Convertino, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand the cardiovascular reactions of the human body to changing conditions of&#xD;
      gravity is thus an important aim of space science.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While non-invasive imaging of microcirculation is a very promising tool to evaluate&#xD;
      cardiovascular condition, knowledge on the involvement of the microcirculation in&#xD;
      cardiovascular alterations induced by weightlessness is very limited and further research in&#xD;
      this field seems promising. Before using a non-invasive technique for imaging the&#xD;
      microcirculation during space flights, it has to be evaluated on earth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different proven simulation models exist for investigating the effects of weightlessness on&#xD;
      the human body under terrestrial conditions: head down bed rest, dry and wet immersion, and&#xD;
      parabolic flights. Among these models, only parabolic flight recreates a real state of&#xD;
      weightlessness (see the participant document of information for a description of parabolic&#xD;
      flights). Cardiovascular studies have often been performed during parabolic flights. Within&#xD;
      the limitations inherent to the method (short duration of weightlessness - about 21 s -&#xD;
      following and followed by hypergravity 20 s periods at 1.8g), some remarkable results have&#xD;
      been published over the years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our research approach is to test feasibility of the in vivo evaluation of the&#xD;
      microcirculation in parabolic flight in order to be able to better describe cardiovascular&#xD;
      response mechanisms under these conditions. In this context, we expect alterations in the&#xD;
      microcirculatory flow during the weightlessness period of parabolic flight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our approach might help develop a diagnostic tool to more easily identify&#xD;
      weightlessness-induced cardiovascular diseases and improve strategies for adapting astronauts&#xD;
      to weightlessness prior to the space mission.&#xD;
