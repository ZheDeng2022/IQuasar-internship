      THE EFFECT OF LOCAL WOUND INFILTERATION VERSUS CAUDAL BLOCK ON WOUND INFECTION AND HEALING&#xD;
      AFTER INGUINAL HERNIOTOMY IN PAEDIATRICS&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION Since the introduction of cocaine in 1884, local anesthetics have been used as a&#xD;
      mainstay of pain management. However, numerous studies over the past several decades have&#xD;
      elucidated the supplemental role of local anesthetics as antimicrobial agents. In addition to&#xD;
      their anesthetic properties, medications, such as: bupivacaine and lidocaine have been shown&#xD;
      to exhibit bacteriostatic, bactericidal, fungistatic, and fungicidal properties against a&#xD;
      wide spectrum of microorganisms.(1) Johnson et al.(2)made a comprehensive literature search&#xD;
      using MEDLINE 1950-present for in vitro and in vivo studies pertaining to the antimicrobial&#xD;
      activity of various local anaesthetics on a broad range of bacterial and fungal pathogens.&#xD;
      Studies testing the effect on microbial growth inhibition of local anaesthetics alone and in&#xD;
      combination with other agents, such as: preservatives and other medications, as well as the&#xD;
      effect of conditions, such as: concentration and temperature were included for review.&#xD;
      Evidence suggests that local anesthetics as a class possess inherent antimicrobial properties&#xD;
      against a wide spectrum of human pathogens. Limited studies attribute the mechanism of action&#xD;
      of antimicrobial activity of local anesthetics to a disruption of microbial cell membrane&#xD;
      permeability, leading to leakage of cellular components and subsequent cell lysis.(2)&#xD;
      Multiple local anesthetics at concentrations typically used in the clinical setting (e.g.:-&#xD;
      bupivacaine 0.125%-0.75%; lidocaine 1%-3%) inhibit the growth of numerous bacteria and fungi&#xD;
      under various conditions. Different local anesthetics showed various degrees of antimicrobial&#xD;
      capacity; bupivacaine and lidocaine, for example, inhibit growth to a significantly greater&#xD;
      extent than does ropivacaine.(2) In 1943 Lofgren (3) developed lidocaine. This was an amide&#xD;
      and had a low risk of allergic reactions in comparison to ester local anesthetics. This was&#xD;
      followed by mepivacaine (1957), prilocaine (1960), bupivacaine (1963), ropivacaine (1997) and&#xD;
      levobupivacaine (2000).(3) Bupivacaine has been used in clinical practice for more than 40&#xD;
      years. It is remarkably stable in solution and is commercially available in 0.25% and 0.5%&#xD;
      solutions (with and without epinephrine). Spinal heavy bupivacaine (0.5% bupivacaine + 6%&#xD;
      glucose) is also manufactured. It is four times more potent than lidocaine. Therefore, 0.25%&#xD;
      bupivacaine is equipotent with 1% lidocaine. Bupivacaine is particularly cardiotoxic and&#xD;
      should never be used in Biers blocks. Bupivacaine binds tightly to tissues and thus has a&#xD;
      long duration of action (up to 24 hours in some cases). Adding epinephrine will decrease its&#xD;
      toxicity by delaying the drug absorption but, will have minimal effect on the duration of the&#xD;
      block.(3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended maximum safe doses of bupivacaine are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BUPIVACAINE WITHOUT EPINEPHRINE ------- 2.0 mg/kg BUPIVACAINE WITH EPINEPHRINE ------- 2.5&#xD;
      mg/kg.(3) Caudal anesthesia is one of the most used-popular regional blocks in children. This&#xD;
      technique is a useful adjunct during general anesthesia and for providing postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia after infraumbilical operations. The quality and level of the caudal blockade is&#xD;
      dependent on the dose, volume, and concentration of the injected drug.(4) Prophylactic&#xD;
      analgesia with local anesthetics is an attractive concept, especially in pediatric practice,&#xD;
      because the evaluation of pain can be very challenging in young children.(5) In contrast to&#xD;
      opioids, local anesthetics can be administered safely, and in recent guidelines regional&#xD;
      anaesthesia is accepted as the cornerstone of post-operative pain relief in the pediatric&#xD;
      patients.(6) Although regional anaesthesia holds a good safety record overall, the global&#xD;
      experience with pediatric regional anaesthesia is still quite low; even the most commonly&#xD;
      performed procedure, caudal block, represents only 2.5% of all central neuroaxial blocks&#xD;
      performed.(7,8) Determining the risk-benefit ratio is rather difficult for techniques that&#xD;
      are relatively rarely performed. Wound infiltration can produce reliable analgesia for&#xD;
      superficial skin surgery. Infiltration itself is extensively used by pediatricians, surgeons&#xD;
      and emergency physicians for skin laceration repair or minor superficial surgery.(5) Several&#xD;
      studies have compared the local anesthesia so far, including: ilio-inguinal and&#xD;
      iliohypogastric nerve block plus subcutaneous injection by the surgeon against the caudal&#xD;
      anesthesia.(9,10) But to our knowledge, there is still no study comparing the local wound&#xD;
      infiltration by itself and caudal anesthesia for postoperative analgesia as regard their&#xD;
      effect on wound infection and healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM OF THE WORK The aim of the present study is to assess effect of local wound infiltration&#xD;
      in comparison with caudal block by bupivacaine 0.25% after inguinal herniotomy in pediatrics&#xD;
      on: Wound infection and healing (primary outcome) and postoperative analgesia (secondary&#xD;
      outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS After approval of ethical committee faculty of medicine, University of Alexandria, a&#xD;
      prospective interventional concealed randomized clinical study which will include 50 children&#xD;
      (calculated by department of community medicine) aged 2 months-1 year admitted to the&#xD;
      Pediatrics Surgery Department of Alexandria University Hospitals for elective inguinal&#xD;
      herniotomy surgery, and an informed written consent will be taken from the parents or the&#xD;
      guardians.&#xD;

      patients each:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group L: 25 patients will receive 1mg/kg bupivacaine 0.25% (diluted as 1ml bupivacaine + 1ml&#xD;
      normal saline) by local infiltration in the wound before closure of the skin and&#xD;
      subcutaneous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: 25 patients will receive caudal block with 1mg/kg bupivacaine 0.25%.&#xD;

&#xD;
      B) Pre-medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paracetamol suppository 40mg/kg will be given half an hour before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Anaesthesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will be monitored for:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Heart rate (beats/minute) through continuous ECG tracing (lead II).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Non-invasive arterial blood pressure (mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arterial oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry (%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction of general anaesthesia will be achieved with 8% sevoflurane in 100% oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After securing an IV line with cannula, all patients will receive fentanyl 1mcg /kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laryngeal mask air way of proper size will be inserted under adequate depth of&#xD;
           anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anaesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane with concentration maintaining adequate&#xD;
           depth of anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of procedure and before application of stitches, bupivacaine 0.25% will be&#xD;
           infiltrated in the skin and subcutaneous layer in group L, and caudal block will be&#xD;
           performed in group C; at the end of surgery inhalational anaesthetics will be stopped;&#xD;
           laryngeal mask will be removed when patient is fully conscious.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative pain will be assessed using the Faces Legs Activity Cry Consolability tool&#xD;
           (FLACC, 0- 10) at 15 min, 1, and 3 h after operation.(11) Table (I): FLACC scale&#xD;
           (Behavioral observation pain rating scale) Categories Scoring 0 1 2 Face No particular&#xD;
