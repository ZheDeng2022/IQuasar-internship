  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor medication adherence is a major contributor to inadequate BP control, and is associated&#xD;
      with 125,000 deaths annually. Translation of adherence interventions to community-based&#xD;
      primary care practices where majority of Latino patients receive care is non-existent. Thus,&#xD;
      the development of tailored interventions targeted at improving medication adherence in the&#xD;
      Latino population is needed in order to address the racial disparities in BP control between&#xD;
      Latinos and whites. This proposal provides a unique opportunity to address this gap in the&#xD;
      literature. Using a randomized control design (RCT), the study will evaluate the effect of a&#xD;
      culturally tailored, practice-based intervention on medication adherence in 148 high-risk&#xD;
      Latino patients with uncontrolled HTN. To facilitate translation into routine practices, the&#xD;
      intervention will be integrated into the clinic's electronic medical record (EMR) system, and&#xD;
      will be delivered by trained, bilingual Health Coaches.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Latinos are the fastest growing ethnic group of the U.S. with a growth rate of 43% compared&#xD;
      to 23% among whites over the past decade. This increase is four times the nation's 9.7%&#xD;
      growth rate, and accounts for more than half of the total U.S. population increase of 27.3&#xD;
      million during this period. This growth is accompanied by a significant increase in&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related morbidity and mortality. Despite increasing trends in&#xD;
      the awareness and treatment of hypertension (HTN) among all groups, Latinos have the lowest&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP) control rates in the U.S. Although barriers to optimal HTN control such&#xD;
      as poor access, and low awareness have been used to explain the disparities in BP control&#xD;
      between Latinos and whites, BP control rates remain lower among Latinos who receive treatment&#xD;
      compared to whites. This enigma may be explained by the disproportionately poorer adherence&#xD;
      to prescribed antihypertensive medications among Latinos compared to whites. Poor medication&#xD;
      adherence is a major contributor to inadequate BP control, and is associated with 125,000&#xD;
      deaths annually. Despite over 30 years of research dedicated to understanding adherence&#xD;
      behaviors in hypertensive patients, data in Latino patients is scant. More importantly,&#xD;
      translation of adherence interventions to community-based primary care practices where&#xD;
      majority of Latino patients receive care is non-existent.&#xD;
