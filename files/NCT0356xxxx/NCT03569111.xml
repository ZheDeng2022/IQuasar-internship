  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to characterize the safety and performance of the&#xD;
      Emprint™ Ablation Catheter Kit with Thermosphere™ Technology in clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter, non-randomized study. Up to 3 sites in up to&#xD;
      3 countries will enroll up to 30 subjects in total. The study is designed to characterize the&#xD;
      safety and performance of the bronchoscopic ablation procedure using the Emprint™ Ablation&#xD;
      Catheter Kit with Thermosphere™ Technology.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this prospective, single-arm, multicenter, non-randomized study is&#xD;
      to characterize the safety of the Emprint™ Ablation Catheter Kit with Thermosphere™&#xD;
      Technology device in subjects undergoing lung ablation procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the composite rate of adverse events related to the Emprint™ Ablation&#xD;
      Catheter Kit with Thermosphere™ Technology through 1-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following secondary endpoints will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Composite rate of serious adverse events related to the Emprint™ Ablation Catheter Kit&#xD;
           with Thermosphere™ Technology through 1-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Composite rate of all adverse events related to the procedure or study devices through&#xD;
           1-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Composite rate of all serious adverse events related to the procedure or study devices&#xD;
           through 1-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction and pain (Bronchoscopic Ablation Patient Pain and Satisfaction&#xD;
           Survey)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life (EQ-5D Scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technical success&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technique efficacy&#xD;

    <measure>Technical Success</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Technical success: An evaluation of whether the lung nodule was treated according to the study protocol as determined at the immediate post-procedural timepoint. This is in contrast to procedures in which the protocol could not be executed completely, either for technical reasons or for reasons related to comorbid disease.</description>

    <measure>Technique Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>1-month</time_frame>
    <description>Technique efficacy: An evaluation of whether the lung nodule was effectively ablated. Evaluates whether complete ablation of the nodule was achieved as evidenced by imaging follow-up 1-month post-procedure (including a window of 20-40 days post-procedure).</description>
