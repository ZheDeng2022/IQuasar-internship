      This is a randomized, prospective study to determine if there is a difference in hospital&#xD;
      length of stay between patients receiving continuous hardwire cardiorespiratory monitoring&#xD;
      and those receiving intermittent vital signs measurements among pediatric patients admitted&#xD;
      for uncomplicated respiratory illness.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory illnesses are among the most common causes for inpatient pediatric&#xD;
      hospitalizations every year. The most common respiratory illnesses that make up these&#xD;
      hospitalizations include pneumonia, acute bronchiolitis, and asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumonia is one of the top three illnesses requiring pediatric hospitalization and is a&#xD;
      significant cause or morbidity and mortality. The incidence of pediatric pneumonia varies&#xD;
      depending on the country and age group, but worldwide the annual incidence in children&#xD;
      younger than five years of age is 150 million and approximately 2 million pediatric deaths,&#xD;
      per year, are attributed to pneumonia. Therefore, it is important to understand this disease&#xD;
      and how it impacts pediatric hospital admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumonia is defined as an acute infection of the lung parenchyma secondary to an infectious&#xD;
      etiology such as viruses or bacteria. When an infectious organism is present, the defense&#xD;
      mechanisms of the body, including the lungs, are disturbed and the resultant inflammation&#xD;
      gives rise to parenchymal damage. Symptoms can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.&#xD;
      Findings on imaging can demonstrate infiltrates in the lungs. Vital sign testing can show&#xD;
      elevations in a child's heart rate and decreases in the amount of oxygen present in the blood&#xD;
      (pulse oximetry) secondary to the infiltrative processes in the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumonia is the most common serious infection in the pediatric population and accounts for&#xD;
      up to 1-4% of all pediatric Emergency Department (ED) visits in the United States (US).&#xD;
      Furthermore, of the pediatric patients that present to the ED with pneumonia, 20-25% are&#xD;
      admitted to the inpatient pediatric unit for further management. This decision to admit a&#xD;
      child to the hospital depends on various underlying factors including age, medical&#xD;
      conditions, and severity of illness. One of the factors that is considered when deciding&#xD;
      whether to admit a child to the hospital for pneumonia is oxygen saturation, or the amount of&#xD;
      oxygen in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchiolitis is another common respiratory illness in the pediatric population and is&#xD;
      estimated to account for up to 100,000 US hospital admissions annually. There is a&#xD;
      seasonality with most infections occurring in the fall and winter months. It is the leading&#xD;
      cause of hospitalization in infants and young children with most cases involving children&#xD;
      less than two years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute bronchiolitis refers to lower airway inflammation and obstruction secondary to a viral&#xD;
      infection. When a virus infects the terminal bronchiolar epithelial cells of the lower&#xD;
      airways in the lungs, damage to these cells results and subsequently causes cellular&#xD;
      sloughing and inflammation. This inflammation, coupled with mucous build-up, accounts for the&#xD;
      obstruction that is seen in acute bronchiolitis. Symptoms include rhinitis, congestion,&#xD;
      cough, tachypnea, wheezing, and accessory muscle use. Like pneumonia, hypoxemia (decreased&#xD;
      oxygen content in the blood) can occur with acute bronchiolitis with the most severe&#xD;
      complication being acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third most common respiratory illness that accounts for pediatric hospital admissions is&#xD;
      asthma. Asthma affects 1 in 12 children in the US and is a leading cause of ED visits. It is&#xD;
      the most common chronic disease in childhood in developed countries and an estimated 8.3% of&#xD;
      children in the US had been diagnosed with asthma in 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is a complex, multifactorial, immune-mediated disease and is defined by episodic and&#xD;
      reversible airway constriction and inflammation. Triggers for asthma exacerbations can&#xD;
      include infections, environmental allergens, and other irritants. Smooth muscle constriction&#xD;
      in the airways and inflammation/edema result in intermittent and reversible lower airway&#xD;
      obstructions. Symptoms of asthma include cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest&#xD;
      tightness. Like the other respiratory illnesses mentioned, asthma can also result in&#xD;
      hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory illnesses, including pneumonia, acute bronchiolitis, and pneumonia pose a&#xD;
      significant threat to the pediatric population and are major causes of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality throughout the world. In the US, most pediatric hospital admissions are secondary&#xD;
      to these illnesses and determining how to best monitor and manage these patients while in the&#xD;
      hospital is important. Specifically, the most ideal technique to monitor for hypoxemia is one&#xD;
      of current debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are two main ways to monitor for hypoxemia in a hospital setting. The first&#xD;
      is to have a pediatric patient on continuous monitoring, which involves the child being&#xD;
      continuously connected to a monitor that displays various vital signs, one of which being&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (SpO2). This technique has been studied over the last several years and&#xD;
      many concerns have been raised regarding alarm fatigue, or the phenomenon that occurs when a&#xD;
      patient is continuously connected to a monitor and the monitor alarms an overwhelming amount.&#xD;
      One study found that this form of monitoring was used in up to 50% of children in non-ICU&#xD;
      settings and that up to 99% of the alarms did not require clinical action. In fact, this&#xD;
      study found that more than 10,000 alarms can occur in a pediatric unit in 1 week and that&#xD;
      greater than 150 alarms can occur on any one patient each day. Furthermore, while these&#xD;
      continuous monitors are meant to identify patients who are deteriorating, it has been&#xD;
      suggested that the efficacy is limited by alarm fatigue and that evidence has not shown them&#xD;
      to improve patient outcomes. Finally, a recent study also demonstrated that the second form&#xD;
      of monitoring, scheduled vital checks, may be superior to electronic measurements when&#xD;
      assessing patients for deterioration. Currently, there are no guidelines to recommend what&#xD;
      form of monitoring, continuous monitoring or scheduled vital checks, is superior and studies&#xD;
      evaluating the rationale behind widespread continuous monitoring techniques are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine if there is a difference in hospital length of stay between&#xD;
      pediatric patients admitted for uncomplicated respiratory illnesses receiving continuous&#xD;
      hardwire cardiorespiratory monitoring and those receiving intermittent vital signs&#xD;
      measurements. Patients will be randomized to two groups. One group will be comprised of&#xD;
      patients receiving continuous hardwire monitoring during the entire stay in the hospital. The&#xD;
      other group will be comprised of patients receiving intermittent vital signs measurements&#xD;
      (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature) every four&#xD;
      hours, per standard of care on the pediatric unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on supplemental oxygen use and patients' level of oxygen saturation&#xD;
      throughout the hospital stay. On day of hospital discharge, up to 14 days, parents or&#xD;
      guardians will be asked to complete the Parent Study Questionnaire, to assess parental rating&#xD;
      of the level of care their child received in hospitalization and parental comfort level with&#xD;
      continuing to care for their child at home.&#xD;
