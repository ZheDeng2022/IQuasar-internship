  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the ControlRad system device when installed&#xD;
      in Fluoroscopic (x-ray) machine reduces radiation dose to operators (Doctors and nurses) and&#xD;
      to the patient who is undergoing cardiac Catheterization and electrophysiology (EP) implant&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Prospective, randomized (like a &quot;flip of a coin&quot;) single center study evaluating&#xD;
      the ControlRad system device when installed - retrofitted on existing C-arms for fluoroscopy&#xD;
      (x-ray) will reduce radiation exposure without compromising image quality in the region of&#xD;
      interest and overall workflow during cardiac catheterization and electrophysiology (EP)&#xD;
      implant procedures. Enrollment will be limited to 40 cardiac catheterization, and 30&#xD;
      pacemaker and/or ICD procedures. All patients presenting to Beaumont Hospital Royal Oak who&#xD;
      are scheduled for cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography and electrophysiology&#xD;
      implant in Cath Lab 5 where device is installed will be considered for inclusion in the&#xD;
      study. Physicians and staff (20 fellows; 35 attending physicians; and 56 Cath-lab&#xD;
      staff,including Nurse/Anesthesia team) will be invited to participate in the study. For each&#xD;
      procedure, 3 staff members will be study subjects: a) the primary operator, b) the secondary&#xD;
      operator, c) the nurse/tech and or Anesthetist who circulates in the room. Different&#xD;
      operators and staff may participate in each case depending on cath-lab scheduling. The&#xD;
      Primary operator is the physician who usually stands nearest to the C-arm. In most cases in&#xD;
      Beaumont this is a Cardiology Fellow in cardiac catheterization cases and Attending Physician&#xD;
      for the EP cases. The Secondary operator is the physician who typically stands to the right&#xD;
      of the primary operator and in most cases is the attending cardiologist or scrub assistant&#xD;
      (nurse/technician). The Nurse or Anesthesia team typically circulates in the room and is&#xD;
      responsible for monitoring the patient, administering medications and obtaining equipment for&#xD;
      the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two methods will be used to measure radiation dose during the catheterization procedure. The&#xD;
      Real-time Dosimeter Badge (RaySafe) and the Landauer Luxel Aluminium Oxide Dosimeter Badges.&#xD;
      Cardiac Catheterization and electrophysiology implant procedures will be performed according&#xD;
      to standard guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either cardiac catheterization without ControlRad or&#xD;
      cardiac catheterization with the ControlRad system. The same 1:1 randomization process will&#xD;
      be applied to the EP patient population. Participants will be blinded to the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once procedure is done,participation also ended and the badges will be removed by the&#xD;
      Radiation Safety Officer or research coordinator.&#xD;
