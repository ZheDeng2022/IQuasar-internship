    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see how the combination of dostarlimab, niraparib, and&#xD;
      radiation therapy works in controlling metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This two-stage single arm phase II trial will evaluate the efficacy of niraparib with&#xD;
      dostarlimab and radiation therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the experimental interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dostarlimab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Niraparib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 25 people will take part in this research study. An initial 15&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled during the first stage and evaluated for treatment disease&#xD;
      control, if none of the initial 15 participants achieve disease control the study will be&#xD;
      terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected participants will be on the research study for as long as the experimental&#xD;
      interventions are safe, and their metastatic pancreatic cancer does not progress with up to 5&#xD;
      years of follow up after participants stop taking the experimental interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved dostarlimab as a treatment for&#xD;
      any disease. Dostarlimab is a type of antibody (a protein that attaches to other cells to&#xD;
      fight off infection) that is believed to work by attaching to a protein called PD-1 on&#xD;
      Tcells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This PD-1 protein controls parts of the immune system (the system in the body that fights off&#xD;
      infections and diseases) by shutting down certain immune responses responsible for&#xD;
      recognizing and destroying cancer cells. The investigators believe that dostarlimab will&#xD;
      inhibit the PD-1 protein, thus allowing the immune cells to recognize and destroy cancer&#xD;
      cells. The FDA has not approved niraparib for metastatic pancreatic cancer, but it has been&#xD;
      approved for other uses. Niraparib is a type of drug called a &quot;PARP inhibitor&quot;, which blocks&#xD;
      DNA (the genetic material of cells) damage from being repaired or may prevent damage from&#xD;
      occurring in the first place. In cancer treatment, inhibiting PARP may help kill cancer cells&#xD;
      by not allowing the cancer cells to repair its DNA damage or prevent DNA damage from&#xD;
      occurring. It is believed that the combination of dostarlimab, niraparib, and radiation&#xD;
      therapy may have a greater effect on metastatic pancreatic cancer cells than when these&#xD;
      interventions are used alone.&#xD;

                  contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 6&#xD;
                  months (30 days plus the time required for niraparib to undergo five&#xD;
                  half-lives/150 days) after the last dose of investigational drug.&#xD;

                  failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving protocol therapy and who are&#xD;
                  sexually active with WoCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a&#xD;
                  period of 6 months (150 days) after the last dose of investigational product.&#xD;
                  (Women who are not of childbearing potential, i.e. are postmenopausal as defined&#xD;
                  in the eligibility criteria or surgically sterile, as well as azoospermic men do&#xD;
                  not require contraception.) Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a&#xD;

                  and can meet dose constraints, and another unirradiated measurable lesion &gt; 1 cm&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients must have had at least one line of prior treatment. Any prior line of&#xD;
                  treatment is permitted, including adjuvant.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Participants who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic anticancer or biological therapy including prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy,&#xD;
             targeted small molecule therapy within 14 days prior to investigational agent, or&#xD;
             those who have not recovered (i.e., ≤ grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due&#xD;
             to agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier. Participants with ≤ grade 2&#xD;
             neuropathy are an exception to these criteria and may qualify for the study. If the&#xD;

             prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study&#xD;
             drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg&#xD;
             daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune&#xD;
             disease. Participants are permitted to use topical, ocular, intraarticular,&#xD;
             intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption).&#xD;
             Physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted, even if &gt; 10&#xD;
             mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis&#xD;
             (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g.,&#xD;
             delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known&#xD;
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). These participants are at increased risk of&#xD;

             required for eligibility purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known ≥ Grade 3 immune-related AE with prior immunotherapy, with the exception of&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, recent (within 90 days) myocardial infarction or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are&#xD;
        allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated&#xD;
        vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to niraparib and dostarlimab components or excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody&#xD;

             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
