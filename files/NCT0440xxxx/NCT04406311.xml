      BACKGROUND and RATIONALE Colorectal cancer, with 49,000 new diagnoses expected in 2019&#xD;
      (27,000 in men and 22,000 in women) represents, in Italy, the third neoplasm in men (14%) and&#xD;
      the second in women (12%). Increasing attention has been recently paid to the outcomes of&#xD;
      surgical treatment, in terms of patient's anorectal function and quality of life (QoL).&#xD;
      Currently, the majority of patients affected by rectal carcinoma undergo a sphincter-sparing&#xD;
      surgery, that is, a low anterior rectal resection (LAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that about 50% - 90% of patients undergoing LAR will develop at least some degree&#xD;
      of bowel dysfunction: for this reason, the definition of &quot;anterior low rectal resection&#xD;
      syndrome&quot; (LARS) has been coined to describe this complex functional condition; the LARS&#xD;
      usually includes incontinence to gas and/or liquid or solid stools, constipation, urgency,&#xD;
      fragmentation and frequent bowel movements; a worsening of QoL has been also observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the importance and high prevalence of this condition, but in the absence of a reliable&#xD;
      tool for assessing its severity, the so-called &quot;LARS score&quot; has been introduced. The score&#xD;
      has already been validated in several languages, even if this important tool has not been&#xD;
      validated in Italian language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS of the STUDY The primary aim of this study will be the validation in Italian language of&#xD;
      the LARS score in a population of Italian patients with a previous history of rectal cancer&#xD;
      and treated by anterior rectal resection surgery. Moreover, the convergent and discriminatory&#xD;
      validity, and the reliability of the score will be also assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN The study will be a prospective observational study on patients affected by&#xD;
      rectal cancer and treated by anterior rectal resection surgery with total or partial excision&#xD;
      of the mesorectum (TME, total mesorectal excision, or PME, partial mesorectal excision) in&#xD;
      the period January 2000 - April 2018. Any Unit of the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario&#xD;
      &quot;Agostino Gemelli&quot; - IRCCS of Rome that deals with rectal cancer surgery could join the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS The validated English version of the LARS questionnaire will be translated into&#xD;
      Italian. The translation will be performed by two independent professional translators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous validation studies conducted in other Countries, it has been calculated&#xD;
      that the sample size will be 200 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed by administration of the LARS score questionnaire, of a single&#xD;
      question on QoL, and of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each Unit could choose to assess the patients in the preferred way (clinical follow-up visit,&#xD;
      e-mail, ordinary mail); however, the method of administration of the questionnaire must be&#xD;
      specified in the final communication of data to the coordinating Group. Each Unit joining the&#xD;
      Study will be provided with an Excel data collection sheet which must then be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive analysis of the data will be conducted, and the convergent validity, that is&#xD;
      the concordance between the LARS score and the QoL, will be investigated. In addition,&#xD;
      discriminatory validity, i.e. the ability of the LARS score to distinguish between subgroups&#xD;
      of patients, which usually differ in the LARS score, will be assessed. Finally, the&#xD;
      test-retest reliability of the LARS score will be examined, so all patients will receive a&#xD;
      second LARS questionnaire 1-2 weeks after completing the first and the results of the two&#xD;
      tests will be compared.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND and RATIONALE Colorectal cancer, with 49,000 new diagnoses expected in 2019&#xD;
           (27,000 in men and 22,000 in women) represents, in Italy, the third neoplasm in men&#xD;
           (14%) and the second in women (12%). Among colorectal tumors, the rectum represents the&#xD;
           site most frequently involved (about 35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thanks to an earlier diagnosis and to the greater effectiveness of an implemented&#xD;
           multidisciplinary treatment, the locoregional control and the patients' overall survival&#xD;
           significantly improved over the last decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Increasing attention has been recently paid to the outcomes of surgical treatment, in&#xD;
           terms of patient's anorectal function and quality of life (QoL). Currently, the majority&#xD;
           of patients affected by rectal carcinoma undergo a sphincter-sparing surgery, that is, a&#xD;
           low anterior rectal resection (LAR), therefore avoiding a permanent colostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is known that about 50% - 90% of patients undergoing LAR will have at least some&#xD;
           degree of bowel dysfunction: for this reason, the definition of &quot;anterior low rectal&#xD;
           resection syndrome&quot; (LARS) has been coined to describe this complex functional&#xD;
           condition. The main symptoms included in this syndrome are: incontinence to gas and/or&#xD;
           liquid or solid stools, constipation, urgency, fragmentation and frequent bowel&#xD;
           movements. In addition, a worsening of QoL has been observed in patients with severe&#xD;
           LARS symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Due to the importance and high prevalence of this condition, in order to identify a&#xD;
           reliable tool for assessing its severity, the so-called &quot;LARS score&quot; has been&#xD;
           introduced. The score has already been validated in several languages, including&#xD;
           English, Chinese, Lithuanian, Swedish, Spanish, German, Danish (as consolidated&#xD;
           international validation), and finally Dutch.&#xD;
&#xD;
           However, this important tool has not been validated in Italian language.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AIMS The primary aim of this study will be the validation in Italian language of the&#xD;
           LARS score in a population of Italian patients with a previous history of rectal cancer,&#xD;
           and treated by anterior rectal resection surgery. Moreover, the study will give the&#xD;
           possibility to investigate the convergent and discriminatory validity, and to re-test&#xD;
           the reliability of the score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY DESIGN The study will be a prospective observational study on patients affected by&#xD;
           rectal cancer, and treated by anterior rectal resection surgery with total or partial&#xD;
           excision of the mesorectum (TME, total mesorectal excision, or PME, partial mesorectal&#xD;
           excision) in the period January 2000 - April 2018. Any Surgical Unit of the Fondazione&#xD;
           Policlinico Universitario &quot;Agostino Gemelli&quot; - IRCCS of Rome that deals with rectal&#xD;
           cancer surgery could join the study. Each Unit will identify a Study Manager, and&#xD;
           possibly a collaborator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will provide different phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  TRANSLATION OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE The validated English version of the LARS&#xD;
                questionnaire will be translated into Italian. The translation will be performed by&#xD;
                two independent professional translators. Translators will discuss any&#xD;
                discrepancies between their translations until an agreed version is reached. A&#xD;
                third native English translator will translate the Italian version into English.&#xD;
                Subsequently, the two English versions (the initial one and the new one) will be&#xD;
                compared and the final version in Italian will be elaborated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CONVERGENT VALIDITY To study the &quot;convergent validity&quot;, the LARS score will be&#xD;
                correlated with the single QoL question and with the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire,&#xD;
                in order to test how the LARS score correlates with the QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  DIVERGENT VALIDITY To study discriminative validity, we will evaluate the ability&#xD;
                of the LARS score to identify different patient subgroups, which generally differ&#xD;
                in the LARS score. Similar to previous validation studies, the clinically relevant&#xD;
                subgroups will be based on: preoperative radiotherapy, type of surgery (TME / PME),&#xD;
                age (cut-off at 69 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  TEST- RETEST RELIABILITY Test-retest reliability is one of the key measures of all&#xD;
                health measures. To examine the test-retest reliability of the LARS score, all&#xD;
                patients will receive a second LARS questionnaire 1-2 weeks after completing the&#xD;
                first one, and will be invited to reply to the questionnaire again.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each Unit could choose to assess the patients in the preferred way (clinical follow-up&#xD;
           visit, e-mail, ordinary mail); however, the method of administration of the&#xD;
           questionnaire must be specified in the final communication of data to the coordinating&#xD;
           Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each Unit will be responsible for the truthfulness of the data collected and provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. DATA COLLECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each Unit joining the Study will be provided with an Excel data collection sheet which&#xD;
           must then be completed. The collection of data and their transmission to the Study&#xD;
           Coordinator Group must occur within 3 months from the beginning of the Study. For each&#xD;
           patient we ask to provide:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2 LARS questionnaires, administered 1-2 weeks apart;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1 EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1 single QoL question.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS and DATA EVALUATION The quality control of the collected data and&#xD;
           the statistical analysis of the results will be conducted by a specialist in Medical&#xD;
           Statistics, who will be guaranteed co-authorship in the scientific publications derived&#xD;
           from the study. No financial compensation will be provided for this activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Concerning the &quot;convergent validity&quot;, the correspondence between the QoL categories (no&#xD;
           impact, minor or major impact of intestinal function on QoL) and the three LARS scoring&#xD;
           categories will be assessed. The correspondence between these two measures will be&#xD;
           considered perfect when: patients have not reported LARS and any impact on QoL; patients&#xD;
           have reported minor LARS and a minor impact on QoL; in case of major LARS and major&#xD;
           impact on QoL. Correspondence will be defined as moderate in case of a difference in one&#xD;
           category, for example no LARS but a minor impact on QoL. In case of difference in two&#xD;
           categories, the two measures will be considered not corresponding at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
           LARS score data will be presented as median (with interquartile range) and the&#xD;
           differences will be tested by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The same test will be used to&#xD;
           test the null hypothesis in the study of the association between the LARS score and the&#xD;
           five functional scales and the global QoL scale of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire.&#xD;
           Wilcoxon's rank test will be applied to investigate the &quot;discriminatory validity&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The correspondence between the two tests to measure the reliability of the LARS score&#xD;
           will be presented as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A Bland-Altman&#xD;
           diagram will be calculated with 95% agreement limits and intraclass correlation (ICC).&#xD;
           An ICC lower than 0.50 will indicate poor reliability, an ICC between 0.50 and 0.75 will&#xD;
           reflect moderate reliability, between 0.75-0.90 good reliability and an ICC greater than&#xD;
           0.90 will indicate excellent reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. PUBLICATION POLICY and AUTHORSHIP The results of the study will be the subject of a&#xD;
           group publication. The co-authorship of the manager and a collaborator will be&#xD;
           guaranteed to each Unit participating in the study. The first, second and last Author of&#xD;
           the publication will be respectively the principal investigator and the two&#xD;
           collaborators (junior and senior) of the promoter / coordinator Center.&#xD;

    <time_frame>June 2020- August 2020</time_frame>
    <description>The LARS score, originally developed in Denmark, aims to assess the intestinal dysfunction in a population of rectal cancer patients. The sum of the scores of the five subscales allows to calculate a total score ranging from 0 to 42 points. So, the total score is classified into three groups: 0-20 points: no LARS; 21-29 points: minor LARS; 30-42 points: major LARS.</description>

    <measure>EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>June 2020- August 2020</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire is a validated and specific tool to evaluate the QoL of cancer patients. It consists of 30 questions that provide a global QoL scale, five functional scales (i.e. physical, role-playing, emotional, cognitive, social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain) and six individual factors (dyspnea, insomnia, loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). The scores of each scale are calculated in a score ranging from 0 to 100. For the purpose of this study, only the functional scales and the global QoL scale will be used. A high score on a functional scale represents a good level of function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Single question on QoL</measure>
    <time_frame>June 2020- August 2020</time_frame>
    <description>A single question on QoL will be added to the LARS score for the purpose of investigating convergent validity. The question is: &quot;Overall, how does bowel function affect your quality of life?&quot;; it will be possible to give only one of the following answers: &quot;not at all&quot;, &quot;a little&quot;, &quot;enough&quot;, &quot;a lot&quot;. This question had previously been used for the development and validation of the LARS score in other countries. The score ranges from 0 to 4.</description>
