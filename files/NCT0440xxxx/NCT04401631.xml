  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, observational study to evaluate the analytical&#xD;
      performance of the Abionic IgE Multi-Allergen Test Panel on the abioSCOPE® device in a U.S.&#xD;
      point-of-care environment within a clinical laboratory operating under a CLIA certificate for&#xD;
      tests of moderate complexity. The study will assess point-of-care ('external') precision,&#xD;
      sample type comparison and correlation with a reference method (Phadia Laboratory System,&#xD;
      ThermoFisher Scientific).&#xD;

    <description>External Precision Study ('reproducibility study' 'site-to-site precision study'): Demonstrate that the imprecision of K3-EDTA venous plasma using the IVD CAPSULE Allergic Asthma panel on the abioSCOPE device (all 5 allergens/allergen mixes and total IgE) in the hands of trained Healthcare Professionals in a Physician Office Laboratory (POL) is within the expected range of the imprecision established in the clinical laboratory by Laboratory Scientists.&#xD;
Operator-to-Operator imprecision on whole blood: Demonstrate that the between-Operator reproducibility of the total IgE of the IVD CAPSULE Allergic Asthma panel on the abioSCOPE device test results is within the expected range of variability.&#xD;
Between-run reproducibility: Demonstrate that the between-run reproducibility of venous whole blood samples measured with the IVD CAPSULE Allergic Asthma panel on the abioSCOPE device (all 5 allergens/allergen mixes and total IgE) is within the expected range of variability.</description>
