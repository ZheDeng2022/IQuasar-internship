  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VT30-101 is a 2-part first-in-human trial of topically administered VT30 to subjects with&#xD;
      cutaneous venous malformations, lymphatic malformations, or mixed venolymphatic malformations&#xD;
      associated with PIK3CA or TEK mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is a 4-week treatment, open-label, 4-sequence, escalating repeat-application cohort&#xD;
      study, with intra-subject and inter-cohort dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is a 12-week treatment, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, safety and&#xD;
      exploratory efficacy study. Part 2 will be initiated only after the successful completion of&#xD;
      Part 1 with results that demonstrate the general safety and tolerability of topically applied&#xD;
      VT30. Up to 12 subjects who complete Part 1 may be enrolled into Part 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VT30. The study will also&#xD;
      determine the dose and regimen of VT30 to be carried into Part 2 of the protocol. Other aims&#xD;
      include documenting plasma drug levels of VT30 and VT10 and, on an exploratory basis,&#xD;
      examining pharmacologic target engagement and change in potential efficacy readouts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VT30-101 is designed as a Phase 1/2, first-in-human study of topically administered VT30 to&#xD;
      subjects with cutaneous venous malformations (VMs), lymphatic malformations (LMs), or mixed&#xD;
      venolymphatic malformations (VLMs) associated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic&#xD;
      alpha polypeptide (PIK3CA) or tyrosine receptor kinase (TEK) mutations. Capillary involvement&#xD;
      and/or extension of the lesion into subcutaneous tissues is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will occur in 2 parts, and in both study parts, subjects will participate in a&#xD;
      Screening Period (up to 6 weeks) before beginning the indicated Treatment Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will be an open-label, 4-sequence, escalating repeat-application study comprised of up&#xD;
      to 4 cohorts (3 subjects per cohort, with 3 up to 6 in Cohort 4, or the final Part 1 cohort).&#xD;
      In each cohort, subjects will be given topical VT30 for a 4-week Treatment Period. Subjects&#xD;
      will begin treatment with the designated dose on Day 1. After 2 weeks, the Investigator will&#xD;
      examine the treated surface area and determine if the formulation is tolerated such that the&#xD;
      subject may apply the next dose strength of VT30 gel for the remaining duration of the&#xD;
      Treatment Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the following gel dose strengths (concentrations) are planned for Cohorts 1&#xD;
      through 3 in Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: initiate dosing with 0.12% (w/w) gel and progress to 0.6% (w/w) gel for the&#xD;
           final 2 weeks of the Part 1 Treatment Period (if the lower dose is tolerated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: initiate dosing with 0.6% (w/w) gel and progress to 1.2% (w/w) gel for the&#xD;
           final 2 weeks of the Part 1 Treatment Period (if the lower dose is tolerated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: initiate dosing with 1.2% (w/w) gel and progress to 2.3% (w/w) gel for the&#xD;
           final 2 weeks of the Part 1 Treatment Period (if the lower dose is tolerated)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Safety Review Committee (SRC), with sponsor, investigator and independent medical&#xD;
      representation, will provide oversight and guidance for study conduct. After 3 subjects have&#xD;
      been dosed for at least 21 days in any of the first three Part 1 cohorts, the SRC may request&#xD;
      additional data, approve initiation of the subsequent cohort, or mandate that additional&#xD;
      subjects to be enrolled at either the higher or lower dose within the cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 9 subjects in Cohorts 1 through 3 (3 subjects per cohort) have completed the 4-week&#xD;
      Treatment Period, the SRC will determine if additional subjects should be assigned to Cohort&#xD;
      4 (or the final Part 1 cohort) to receive the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) or MFD (maximum&#xD;
      feasible dose) strength of VT30. Subjects in Cohort 4 will receive the designated dose&#xD;
      strength and regimen of VT30 for a full 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the completion of Cohort 4 in Part 1, the SRC will determine whether to authorize&#xD;
      initiation of Part 2 and will confirm the dose level and regimen to be administered in Part&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study containing 36 subjects&#xD;
      assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either VT30 or placebo. Up to 12 subjects who complete&#xD;
      Part 1 may enroll in Part 2, provided they meet all Part 2-specific inclusion criteria with&#xD;
      no applicable exclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first 12 subjects in Part 2 have completed 4 weeks of treatment, the SRC will&#xD;
      conduct a review of blinded safety data to confirm no revisions or changes are needed to the&#xD;
      protocol. Subsequent reviews may also be conducted to ensure continued acceptable safety and&#xD;
      tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After subjects complete their designated Treatment Period (in Part 1 or Part 2), they will&#xD;
      participate in a 4-week post treatment Follow-up Period.&#xD;

    <description>VT30 is a PI3K-inhibitor prodrug, formulated as a topical gel and dispensed from a metered dose pump; administration is once or twice daily, applied to target-treatment area(s) on the skin. One pump action dispenses 250 µL of gel, intended to treat an area of 140 cm2.</description>

    <description>VT30 gel is intended as a topical treatment of cutaneous VMs, LMs, or VLMs that driven by inappropriate PI3K activation. In the skin, VT30 is rapidly metabolized to VT10, an active drug form, and is intended to sufficiently permeate the stratum corneum and achieve target engagement. It is expected that VT30 will lead to amelioration of the signs and symptoms of cutaneous VMs, LMs and/or VLMs.</description>
