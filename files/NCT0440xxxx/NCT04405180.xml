  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2-site randomized double blinded controlled trial is to confirm and more definitively&#xD;
      clarify the impact of a 12-week course of nitrite versus placebo on mitochondrial&#xD;
      bioenergetics in older sedentary adults. This investigator will take an integrative&#xD;
      physiology approach to determine the effect of nitrite therapy on a comprehensive assessment&#xD;
      of mitochondrial energetics, skeletal muscle vascular function, and whole body physical&#xD;
      function (cardiorespiratory function, exercise endurance, strength, balance, and physical&#xD;
      activity) and fatigability.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Old age is associated with declining skeletal muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics with related&#xD;
      decrements in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and physical function that predispose to&#xD;
      frailty, disability, and diminished quality of life. While exercise training may moderate and&#xD;
      possibly even reverse declines in mitochondrial bioenergetics, potential for such benefit is&#xD;
      typically confounded by exercise intolerance with early fatigability that results from the&#xD;
      same age-related mitochondrial declines. Consequently, sedentariness is endemic and insidious&#xD;
      among the growing population of older adults. This trial is to study the utility of inorganic&#xD;
      nitrite salts as a novel means to modify this detrimental pattern. Classic studies&#xD;
      demonstrate that nitrite facilitates hypoxic vasodilation in muscle. This investigator's&#xD;
      preliminary data suggests that nitrite treatment also augments skeletal muscle mitochondrial&#xD;
      bioenergetics in older adults. This investigator proposes improving mitochondrial function&#xD;
      will also be reflected in clinical parameters, including CRF as well as broader functional&#xD;
      attributes (endurance, strength, and balance) that enable physical activity (PA) and&#xD;
      opportunity to mitigate frailty and disability. As such, this application is in line with the&#xD;
      National Institute on Aging's mission to develop targeted interventions to prevent and treat&#xD;
      age-associated conditions. This multi-disciplinary team has published seminal work indicating&#xD;
      that mitochondrial bioenergetics and CRF are significant determinants of physical function in&#xD;
      older adults. In parallel efforts, this investigative team showed efficacy of chronic nitrite&#xD;
      therapy to improve mitochondrial bioenergetics in older sedentary adults. Only one month of&#xD;
      nitrite therapy significantly improved ex vivo assessments of mitochondrial energetics in&#xD;
      skeletal muscle biopsies, concomitant with increased skeletal muscle sirtuin-3 expression, a&#xD;
      nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) dependent lysine deacetylase and key regulator of&#xD;
      mitochondrial metabolism. These key data reinforce the premise that nitrite enhances vital&#xD;
      mitochondrial metabolism in older adults. Moreover, improvement in muscle energetics in&#xD;
      nitrite-treated older adults was linked with increased exercise efficiency as evidenced by&#xD;
      reduced oxygen consumption (VO2) during submaximal steady-state walking. This data supports&#xD;
      the hypothesis that nitrite will make physical function easier such that physical activity&#xD;
      will increase.&#xD;
