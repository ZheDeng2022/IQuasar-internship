      Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the effect of Informational Manual Therapy&#xD;
      (IMT) on quiet standing and quality of life in healthy individuals. The IMT also is known as&#xD;
      the Poyet-Pialoux method, is a holistic, no orthopedic, and soft manual therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a one-group pretest-posttest design. It is a within-subjects experiment in&#xD;
      which each participant is tested first under the control condition and then under the&#xD;
      treatment condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: University laboratory. Intervention: One IMT session was performed on 57 healthy&#xD;
      individuals aged from 18 to 65 years. They were grouped into three age groups. The treatment&#xD;
      session was performed by 5 therapists on two days. The primary outcome was quite standing&#xD;
      assessed by the SATEL force platform. Secondary outcomes were bodily pain assessed by the&#xD;
      pain sections of the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) and quality of life by EQ-5D-3L&#xD;
      (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). The primary&#xD;
      outcome was evaluated before and immediately after treatment and after 7-10 days. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes were assessed after treatment and 3 weeks later.&#xD;

      Methods Study Design: The study has a one-group pretest-posttest design. The personal data of&#xD;
      individuals were kept confidential and the data were shared anonymously upon request from the&#xD;
      principal researcher. The TREND statement will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Fifty-seven participants will be recruited to participate in this study; the sample&#xD;
      was one of convenience. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows: age from 18 to&#xD;
      65 years old, not having a positive diagnosis for any disease which influences balance, no&#xD;
      participation in any other trial, not suffering from an injury in the 3 months before the&#xD;
      study or fractures in the previous 6 months, and no falls in the previous month. All&#xD;
      individuals provided informed consent before enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention All the participants received a single session of 30-45 min of IMT. All the&#xD;
      treatment sessions took place at the UIC laboratory. The IMT session was performed over two&#xD;
      days by four physiotherapists and a doctor. All have more than five years of experience in&#xD;
      IMT treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first level of IMT was treated in this study: the objective is to harmonize the&#xD;
      Cranio-sacral and sacro-pelvic systems, as this is fundamental for maintaining good posture.&#xD;
      The first therapeutic maneuvers should be focused on releasing of the sacrum and the pelvis.&#xD;
      The first is considered a key area for the correct transmission of forces and loads from the&#xD;
      lower limbs to the upper limbs and vice versa and shares the role of rigid elements for this&#xD;
      purpose (bones) and tensile elements (muscles, ligaments, fascia) in the whole body. At this&#xD;
      level. Compensatory injuries that the body has started after a primary injury are treated on&#xD;
      this level, through the Fluidic Chains. This also includes the treatment of some traumatic&#xD;
      injuries, such as cranial strains, the compression of spheno-basilar synchondrosis, injuries&#xD;
      of the pelvis and occipital bone, and damage to the flexion-extension and lateral&#xD;
      displacement of the vertebrae. The diagnosis of this level is performed by cranial somotopias&#xD;
      (reflex points on the skull and face). Practically all the treatment is carried out on the&#xD;
      sacrum. The first step is the &quot;fuses,&quot; which are vibration zones that act as a protection&#xD;
      system for the body (1). These points sometimes stop working, which interrupts the correct&#xD;
      movement of the PRM: 1st fuse: Inn-trang (on the forehead between the two eyebrows, the 4th&#xD;
      sacral vertebra is stimulated if it is not adjusted). A massage on the scalp in several very&#xD;
      soft circles that goes from the frontal to the occipital area is performed 6 times. 2nd fuse:&#xD;
      1st dorsal vertebra, 4th cervical, 4th dorsal, and 3rd lumbar. 3rd fuse: C0 (base of the&#xD;
      occipital), a zone of the 2nd sacral vertebra, and the space between the spines of the 2nd&#xD;
      and 3rd dorsal vertebrae and finally point R1 (between the 2nd and 3 rd metatarsal). If any&#xD;
      point is blocked it is treated and harmonized with a soft touch towards the occipital.&#xD;
