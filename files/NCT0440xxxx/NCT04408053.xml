  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, the annual incidence of hip fracture is about 80 000 with more than 75% of these&#xD;
      fractures occurring in patients aged 80 years old or more. About 10% percent of patients&#xD;
      presenting with a hip fracture will sustain a contralateral hip fracture, most within 3&#xD;
      years. The consequences of a hip fracture are dramatic: 20% of patients die in the first year&#xD;
      and less than half those who survive regain their previous level of function. Hip fractures&#xD;
      are invariably associated with chronic pain, reduced mobility, disability, and an increasing&#xD;
      degree of dependence. The efficacy of pharmacological treatments to prevent a contralateral&#xD;
      hip fracture is marginal and postponed and compliance is known to be poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoporosis is associated with cortical thinning and trabecular bone loss. Therefore, the&#xD;
      mini-invasive preventive fixation (MIPF) of the contralateral femoral neck is appealing. The&#xD;
      effect is immediate and compliance is certain. Morbidity is minimal because it is performed&#xD;
      during the same operation as the fixation of the femoral neck fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine whether the mini-invasive preventive&#xD;
      fixation (MIPF) of the contralateral femoral neck in patients having a femoral neck fracture&#xD;
      is superior to no fixation regarding the occurrence of a contralateral hip fracture within 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

    <description>Patient's autonomy will be assessed using the AGGIR scale. The AGGIR scale has 10 physical and mental variables and seven variables relating to domestic and social activities; the former are discriminative and the latter illustrative variables. The rating depends on the person doing the activity on her/his own; however, material and technical aids are allowed (glasses, wheelchair, etc). Each variable can take one of three modalities: A (perform alone), C (cannot perform alone), and B (can perform alone but on conditions).</description>
