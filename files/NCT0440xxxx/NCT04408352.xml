  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pivotal study is to collect data on the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the Hologic trigone RF ablation device to reduce urgency urinary&#xD;
      incontinence. Up to 325 subjects will be enrolled with 225 randomized (2:1) and treated at up&#xD;
      to 35 sites in the U.S. Additional sites in Canada, Australia, Europe, and other countries&#xD;
      may also be considered. Sites outside of the U.S. cannot randomize more than 25% of subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 325 subjects who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled&#xD;
      and up to 225 subjects will be randomized. Subjects will be randomized to either an active&#xD;
      arm that includes treatment with the Hologic trigone RF ablation device, or a control arm who&#xD;
      receive a sham procedure. With a 2:1 randomization, approximately 150 subjects will be&#xD;
      treated with the Hologic trigone RF ablation device (treatment group) and 75 sham subjects&#xD;
      treated with the sham procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be blinded to their randomized treatment; however, due to the nature of the&#xD;
      procedure, the treating investigator cannot be blinded to individual randomization&#xD;
      assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are randomized to the treatment arm will be followed at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3, 6,&#xD;
      and 12 months and every 6 months thereafter. Subjects randomized to the sham arm will be&#xD;
      followed through the 6-month visit. Follow up of all other subjects (cross-over and treatment&#xD;
      arm) will conclude when the last subject in randomized treatment arm reaches their 12-month&#xD;
      visit, is withdrawn, or is determined lost to follow-up.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be randomized to either the treatment with the Hologic trigone RF ablation device or a sham procedure. Randomization will occur in a 2:1 fashion (treatment: sham) meaning approximately 150 subjects will be treated with the Hologic trigone RF ablation device and 75 control subjects treated with the sham procedure.

    <masking_description>The device shall be assembled and maintained in a sterile environment outside the view of the subject during procedure preparation and treatment. The treating investigator, applicable nursing and site staff, and any representatives supporting the procedure should refrain from discussing the device or treatment assignment during the procedure and applicable follow-up visits. The sham procedure will mimic the Hologic trigone RF ablation device procedure to maintain subject blinding and provide the most accurate assessment of control data while minimizing risk to the subject. Energy will not be delivered to the tissue when each sham &quot;ablation&quot; is started.To be comparable to the Hologic trigone RF ablation device procedure, the simulated ablation procedure will need to be repeated as many times as necessary to cover the area of the trigone as is done in the treatment arm.</masking_description>

    <description>A compatible standard cystoscopy lens (30°) will be inserted into the Hologic trigone RF Device. The bladder will be emptied of urine and saline infused into the bladder to allow adequate visualization and working space. Ablations at the trigone will be created using the Hologic trigone RF ablation device together with the compatible standard commercially available RF cannula and generator. It is expected that a subject would receive between 4-6 ablations to completely treat the appropriate area of the trigone. At the completion of the procedure, 200 ml of saline is instilled into the bladder to allow for assessment of voiding function prior to discharge.</description>

    <description>The sham procedure will mimic the Hologic trigone RF ablation device procedure to maintain subject blinding and provide the most accurate assessment of control data while minimizing risk to the subject.&#xD;
The bladder will be emptied of urine and saline infused into the bladder to allow adequate visualization and working space. Suction will be applied to the bladder wall and the cannulas (needles) will be introduced into the bladder wall. Energy will not be delivered to the tissue when each sham &quot;ablation&quot; is started. In order to maintain blinding of the subject, the typical sounds that Hologic trigone RF ablation device makes during actual ablation/fulguration will be replicated. The simulated ablation procedure will be repeated as many times as necessary to cover the area of the trigone. 4 to 6 sham &quot;ablations&quot; would be required. At the completion of the procedure, 200ml of saline is instilled into the bladder to allow for assessment of voiding function prior to discharge.</description>
