  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare upper arm versus forearm Extended Dwell Catheter&#xD;
      (EDC) placement for blood sampling functionality. EDC is an alternative to peripheral&#xD;
      Intravenous (IVs) especially during prolonged hospital stays. EDCs are generally placed using&#xD;
      ultrasound for guidance and are commonly placed in any of 3 veins in the arm. They can be&#xD;
      inserted above or below the antecubital fossa (the bend of the elbow). These catheters can be&#xD;
      left for up to 30 days and don't fail as quickly when compared to peripheral IVs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients will require ongoing blood draws for laboratory testing while in the hospital&#xD;
      and hospitals generally avoid using peripheral IVs for laboratory testing as it is associated&#xD;
      with an increase in complications such as irritation and infiltration (where the IV&#xD;
      medication or fluid will leak out of the vein and into the surrounding tissue). Therefore,&#xD;
      patients are often required to have multiple needlesticks throughout their hospital stay&#xD;
      which can lead to patient dissatisfaction and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended dwell catheters (EDC) offer an alternative to peripheral IVs especially during&#xD;
      prolonged hospital stays. EDCs are generally placed using ultrasound for guidance and are&#xD;
      commonly placed in any of 3 veins in the arm. They can be inserted above or below the&#xD;
      antecubital fossa (the bend of the elbow). These catheters can be left for up to 30 days and&#xD;
      don't fail as quickly when compared to peripheral IVs. While there is not a lot of evidence&#xD;
      about how well these catheters will allow blood to be drawn, an EDC can be used to obtain&#xD;
      blood for routine blood draws and potentially eliminiate the need for additional needle&#xD;
      sticks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients in this study will be randomized to two groups based on placement site:&#xD;
      experimental group (forearm) or the control group (upper arm). If the patient is in the&#xD;
      control group the research staff will direct the inserter to place the catheter into the&#xD;
      upper arm vein at least 2 cm above the antecubital fossa. If the patient is randomized to the&#xD;
      experimental group (lower arm), the research staff will direct the insert to place the&#xD;
      catheter into the forearm at least 10 cm away from the antecubital fossa. The research team&#xD;
      will capture images on the ultrasound machine that is used for initial assessment of sites&#xD;
      per routine care. If the vein is appropriate for cannulation based on these assessments, the&#xD;
      Advance Practice Provider (APP) will insert the catheter. If the APP on the Vascular Access&#xD;
      Team (VAT) has no adequate target visualized in the randomly selected site, the inserter may&#xD;
      evaluate another site that is more suitable for cannulation. Functionality will be confirmed&#xD;
      with a blood sample of 5cc being drawn back into a syringe and then the catheter flushed with&#xD;
      5cc of normal saline without resistance. The site of insertion will be recorded and pertinent&#xD;
      information will be collected similar to other catheter placements. Securement of the placed&#xD;
      IV will be standardized between groups. Daily assessment of functionality (patency of the&#xD;
      catheter) will be performed by the research team for the life of the catheter while&#xD;
      hospitalized (up to 30 days).&#xD;
