      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase II clinical trial to evaluate to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of first line atezolizumab in combination with paclitaxel&#xD;
      and bevacizumab (Avastin®) in patients with advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast&#xD;
      cancer (mTNBC)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men and women age ≥ 18 years with previously untreated unresectable locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) that is not amenable to resection with&#xD;
      curative intent regardless of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients to be included is 100 patients. The primary objective is to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy -in terms of progression-free survival (PFS)- of first line atezolizumab in&#xD;
      combination with paclitaxel and bevacizumab (Avastin®) in patients with unresectable locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the ICF and confirmed eligibility, patients will begin treatment on 28 days&#xD;
      cycles: Atezolizumab (840 mg) intravenously on days 1 and 15; Paclitaxel (90 mg/m2) via IV&#xD;
      infusion on days 1, 8 and 15; Bevacizumab (Avastin® 10mg/kg) intravenously on days 1 and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or&#xD;
      discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients discontinuing the study treatment will enter a post- treatment follow-up period&#xD;
      until death, withdrawal of consent, patient is lost to follow-up, or study termination.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signed informed consent form (ICF) prior to participation in any study-related&#xD;
             activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female patients ≥ 18 years at the time of signing ICF.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ability to comply with the study protocol, in the investigator's judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Histologically confirmed TNBC -regardless of PD-L1 status- per American Society of&#xD;
             Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) criteria based on&#xD;
             local testing on the most recent analyzed biopsy. Triple-negative is defined as &lt;1%&#xD;
             expression for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) as determined by&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry (IHC) and negative for HER2 (0-1+ by immunohistochemistry [IHC]&#xD;
             or 2+ and negative by in situ hybridization [ISH] test).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease documented by computerized&#xD;
             tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that is not amenable to&#xD;
             resection with curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. No prior chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy and/or immunotherapy and/or&#xD;
             antiangiogenic agent for MBC. Patients who have received (neo)adjuvant taxane-based&#xD;
             chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy and/or an antiangiogenic agent are required to have&#xD;
             a disease-free interval (DFI) of at least 12 months after completion of each of these&#xD;
             treatments. For (neo)adjuvant non-taxane-based chemotherapy, a DFI of at least 6&#xD;
             months is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior anti-cancer therapy to grade ≤ 1 as&#xD;
             determined by the NCI-CTCAE v.5.0 (except for alopecia, grade ≤ 2 peripheral&#xD;
             neuropathy, or other toxicities not considered a safety risk for the patient at&#xD;
             investigator's discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Evidence of measurable disease or non-measurable disease as per RECIST v.1.1. Patients&#xD;
             with only bone lesions are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Willingness and ability to provide the most recent tumor biopsy since last progression&#xD;
             from either metastatic or primary tissues at the time of the inclusion to perform&#xD;
             exploratory studies. If not feasible, patient eligibility should be evaluated by a&#xD;
             Sponsor's qualified designee. An additional tumor biopsy from either metastatic or&#xD;
             primary (only if metastatic biopsies cannot be obtained for inaccessible lesion or&#xD;
             subject safety concern) tissues would be collected at disease progression or study&#xD;
             termination whenever it is feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Patients for whom tumor biopsies cannot be obtained (e.g., inaccessible tumor or&#xD;
             safety concern) may submit archived pathological material from either metastatic or&#xD;
             primary sites, but the most recent tumor biopsy from the patient should be obtained&#xD;
             when available.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  support within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day1); Lymphocyte count 3 0.5 x 109/L&#xD;
                  (500μL); Platelet count 3 75.0 x 109/L (without transfusion within 2 weeks prior&#xD;
                  to Cycle 1 Day 1); Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL (Patients may be transfused or receive&#xD;
                  erythropoietic treatment to meet this criterion).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Note: Patients cannot be transfused platelets within 14 days prior to C1D1 to&#xD;
