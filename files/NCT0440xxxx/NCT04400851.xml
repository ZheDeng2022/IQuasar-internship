    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, open-label and phase I clinical study. The standard 3 +&#xD;
      3 group design was performed. Patients were enrolled by the design of phase I study standard.&#xD;
      Sintilimab was divided into three dose levels: 1 mg / kg, 3 mg / kg, and 10 mg / kg. Dose&#xD;
      escalation was carried out from the first level of sintilimab. The study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, including dose limited toxicity (DLT) in the treatment of advanced, recurrent, and&#xD;
      refractory childhood cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Malignant tumors are the second leading cause of death in China after accidental casualties,&#xD;
      which is consistent with developed countries in Europe and America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sintilimab is a human monoclonal antibody against PD-1 receptor which was developed in China.&#xD;
      It can block the binding of PD-1 of T-lymphocyte and PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells,&#xD;
      release the immunosuppression of tumor cells on immune cells, making immune cells play the&#xD;
      role of anti-tumor cell immunity again and kill tumor cells. In the past, the development of&#xD;
      immunocheckpoint drugs mainly focused on adult cancer. Immunocheckpoint inhibition has&#xD;
      achieved many successes in the adult population, including metastatic melanoma, non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, bladder cancer and head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past, the development of immunocheckpoint drugs mainly focused on adult cancer.&#xD;
      Immunocheckpoint inhibition has achieved many successes in adult population. However, some&#xD;
      results of the clinical trials of immunocheckpoint inhibitors in children are also promising&#xD;
      especially in Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aimed to determine the maximum tolerable dose and effectiveness in&#xD;
      pediatric malignant tumors, so as to lay the foundation for the future phase II / III&#xD;
      clinical research.&#xD;
