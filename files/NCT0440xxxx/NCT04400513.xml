      The Eko CORE and DUO stethoscopes are FDA-approved electronic devices that have the capacity&#xD;
      to record heart sounds. The study seeks to expand murmur detection to include VHD&#xD;
      classification through the development of novel ML algorithms that are able to distinguish&#xD;
      between systolic vs. diastolic vs. continuous murmurs, as well as classify VHD type and&#xD;
      severity, using 4-point auscultation with Eko CORE and DUO electronic stethoscopes to record&#xD;
      heart sounds.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Valvular heart disease (VHD), a subclass of structural heart disease (SHD), is a major cause&#xD;
      of mortality and reduced quality of life for tens of millions of patients worldwide.&#xD;
      Detecting VHD early allows the disease to be carefully monitored so that surgery can be&#xD;
      considered as soon as the stenosis progresses to severe. Unfortunately, it is difficult for&#xD;
      many clinicians to accurately identify VHD in its early stages and assess its severity&#xD;
      through physical examination alone. This difficulty stems from both the subtlety of symptoms&#xD;
      associated with VHD, and from clinicians' inability to reliably detect the heart murmurs&#xD;
      indicative of VHD using a traditional stethoscope, particularly in the noisy and rushed&#xD;
      environments characteristic of many healthcare settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AS, mitral regurgitation (MR), and tricuspid regurgitation (TR) all result in reliably&#xD;
      reproducible auscultatory findings. Yet despite this, auscultation as a diagnostic procedure&#xD;
      is notoriously poor: its accuracy to detect AS, MR, and TR ranges only from 5-40%. In&#xD;
      addition, diastolic and continuous murmurs, which are rarer than the systolic murmurs caused&#xD;
      by AS, MR and TR, and almost always pathologic, are usually very difficult to detect by&#xD;
      frontline clinicians. Diastolic murmurs are typically caused by VHD such as aortic&#xD;
      regurgitation (AR), pulmonic regurgitation (PR), mitral stenosis (MS), or tricuspid stenosis&#xD;
      (TS), and continuous murmurs are typically caused by non-valvular forms of SHD, such as&#xD;
      congenital aortopulmonary window, shunts, and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Missing one of&#xD;
      these murmurs could lead to significantly delayed diagnosis and care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of how difficult it is for clinicians to reliably screen for SHD through history&#xD;
      taking and physical examination, the diagnosis of SHD relies heavily on echocardiography&#xD;
      (echos), which is accepted as the gold standard for diagnosis of SHD severity by the&#xD;
      cardiology community. The consequence of this is several-fold. First, many patients receive&#xD;
      echos that would not be necessary if better screening and assessment tools existed. Second,&#xD;
      echocardiography makes up a disproportionately large segment of healthcare expenditure.&#xD;
      Third, patients are burdened with the responsibility of getting repeated echos due to the&#xD;
      lack of better screening tools. The emotional, physical, and financial burden that&#xD;
      accompanies such excessive testing, especially for patients living in underserved&#xD;
      communities, cannot be overstated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, there is a growing need for better preliminary screening tools that would identify&#xD;
      these conditions, even when asymptomatic, early on and more consistently, to a degree of&#xD;
      accuracy comparable to gold standard echocardiography. Such a tool would improve clinicians'&#xD;
      confidence in their assessment during physical exams, which would enable them to help their&#xD;
      patients make informed care decisions, offer disease-altering therapies, and at the same time&#xD;
      reduce the reliance on, and frequency of, unnecessary and expensive auxiliary workups.&#xD;
      Lastly, by facilitating early detection of VHD, morbidity and mortality rates would be&#xD;
      expected to decrease due to earlier intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA-approved Eko CORE and Eko DUO electronic stethoscopes offer clinicians a familiar and&#xD;
      inexpensive tool that is widely accepted by patients, while at the same time offer sensors&#xD;
      and technology that can improve screening and detection of medical conditions such as valve&#xD;
      disease, as compared to auscultation with the traditional stethoscope. Both CORE and DUO&#xD;
      feature sound amplification during auscultation, which improves the ability for the clinician&#xD;
      to detect nuanced changes in heart sounds and patterns. The CORE allows recording of the&#xD;
      audio to produce a phonocardiogram (PCG), while the DUO is able to record audio to produce a&#xD;
      PCG as well as simultaneous recording of a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Both devices&#xD;
      use Bluetooth to wirelessly transmit PCG and ECG data to the Eko mobile application, which&#xD;
      allows clinicians to visualize PCG and ECG as they auscultate, as well as to playback heart&#xD;
      sound recordings, annotate notes on recorded audio, and save and share recordings. These&#xD;
      features uniquely situate Eko electronic stethoscopes to be highly effective as preliminary&#xD;
      screening tools in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eko Devices has developed and received 510(k) FDA approval for a machine-learning (ML)&#xD;
      algorithm that can detect the presence or absence of heart murmur in adult patients with VHD,&#xD;
      using either the Eko CORE or DUO electronic stethoscopes to record heart sounds. This&#xD;
      algorithm was built using a deep neural network model trained on 5,878 PCG recordings&#xD;
      collected on Eko CORE and Eko DUO from over 5,318 unique patients to classify heart sound&#xD;
      recordings as containing a heart murmur or containing no audible murmur, and to discriminate&#xD;
      good quality heart sound recordings from poor quality heart sound recordings. The trained&#xD;
      model has been independently validated in a multi-site clinical study that enrolled 681 VHD&#xD;
      patients with matched gold-standard echocardiograms. FDA approval was received in January&#xD;
      2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study seeks to expand murmur detection to include VHD classification through the&#xD;
      development of novel ML algorithms that are able to distinguish between systolic vs.&#xD;
      diastolic vs. continuous murmurs, as well as classify VHD type and severity, using 4-point&#xD;
      auscultation with Eko CORE and DUO electronic stethoscopes to record heart sounds. These new&#xD;
      algorithms will integrate the time-synchronized ECG streams from DUO to improve distinction&#xD;
      between S1 and S2 heart sounds and improve performance of identifying systolic vs. diastolic&#xD;
      time intervals. When combined with the FDA-approved algorithm for signal quality and murmur&#xD;
      detection, these new algorithms will enable clinicians to have a complete VHD decision&#xD;
      support system, as based on ACC/AHA Patient Management Guidelines, when using Eko&#xD;
      stethoscopes in their clinical practice.20 This will arm clinicians with information to help&#xD;
      them detect SHD early, make clinical care decisions with confidence and consistency, and&#xD;
      improve overall patient outcomes while decreasing cost and increasing efficiency.&#xD;
