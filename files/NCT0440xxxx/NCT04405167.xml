  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first study of tasquinimod, an inhibitor of S100A9, in patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tasquinimod has previously been studied as an anti-cancer agent in patients with other&#xD;
      cancers, including a phase 3 randomized trial in patients with metastatic prostate cancer&#xD;
      that showed an improvement in radiographic progression-free survival. The side effect profile&#xD;
      of tasquinimod is well-characterized based on this previous experience. This trial will&#xD;
      establish a maximum tolerated dose and optimal schedule for administration of tasquinimod in&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma and then investigate the maximum tolerated dose of tasquinimod&#xD;
      in combination with a standard myeloma regimen of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone&#xD;
      (IRd). For both single agent tasquinimod and the combination of tasquinimod with IRd,&#xD;
      exploratory expansion cohorts will be enrolled to preliminarily characterize the antimyeloma&#xD;
      activity of each regimen.&#xD;

Enrollment in arm B1 will not begin until enrollment in arm A1 has been completed and an MTD/optimal schedule has been established for single agent tasquinimod. Initial subjects in arm B1 will be enrolled at the lower of dose level 1 or one dose level below the single agent MTD . If this initial dose level is determined to exceed the combination MTD, further subjects will be enrolled at one dose level lower. Enrollment is not planned in arm B1 at doses higher than the single agent MTD. There are 9-12 planned subjects if all dose levels are explored.</description>
