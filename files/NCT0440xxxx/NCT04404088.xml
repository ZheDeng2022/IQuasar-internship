    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well acalabrutinib, lenalidomide, and rituximab work in&#xD;
      treating patients with CD20 positive stage III-IV, grade 1-3a follicular lymphoma.&#xD;
      Acalabrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving acalabrutinib, lenalidomide, and rituximab&#xD;
      may help to control the disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of acalabrutinib combined with rituximab and lenalidomide in&#xD;
      patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) (determined by complete remission&#xD;
      [CR] rate by the end of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of acalabrutinib combined with rituximab and lenalidomide in&#xD;
      subjects with FL as assessed by objective response rate (ORR) at the end of treatment,&#xD;
      duration of response (DOR), progression rate within 24 months from treatment initiation&#xD;
      (progression-free survival [PFS] 24), PFS and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of acalabrutinib combined with rituximab and&#xD;
      lenalidomide in previously untreated subjects with FL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the pharmacodynamic effects and investigate biomarkers of response and&#xD;
      resistance of the 3-drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Beginning cycle 2,&#xD;
      patients receive lenalidomide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and rituximab intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 2 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;
