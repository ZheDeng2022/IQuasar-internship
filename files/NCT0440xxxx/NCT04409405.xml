  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ebola virus is one of the most dangerous human pathogens and is an emerging public health&#xD;
      problem in sub-Saharan Africa. Ebola virus disease (EVD) first appeared in 1976. The current&#xD;
      epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is one of the largest and most complex&#xD;
      ever recorded, and is not yet under control: a new death has been reported on April 10th,&#xD;
      2020. The epidemic was declared a public health emergency of international scope by the World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) on July 17th, 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two studies are the &quot;standard&quot; in the assessment of the consequences of infection in&#xD;
      survivors, in Liberia (PREVAIL) and Guinea (PostEbogui), especially in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The observation of comparable mortality rates, even if over time there was an&#xD;
           improvement in survival, probably linked to the improvement in the quality of care and&#xD;
           symptomatic treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  And the study of the contacts of the survivors, between 4 to 10% of them had done&#xD;
           seroconversion with regard to EBOV in an asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic way and that&#xD;
           this rate varied according to the degree of exposure to the risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DRC's experience in this area and the enormous progress made in the fight against Viral&#xD;
      hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs), therapeutically and preventively (where much of which patients&#xD;
      have benefited from antiviral treatment or monoclonal antibodies), the technological&#xD;
      responses (real-time sequencing of Ebola strains in new cases, vaccination or the use of&#xD;
      individual isolation units), show the limits of their effectiveness. A large number of&#xD;
      questions therefore remain unanswered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The antibody profile of the survivors, in particular the repertoire of IgG specific to&#xD;
           these individuals and its correlation with survival and its evolution over time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The impact of treatments initiated during the acute phase on these immune abnormalities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finally, genetic factors linked to the host could play an important role in the response&#xD;
           to the Ebola virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to provide a better overall understanding of Ebola virus infection&#xD;
      and its clinical, virological, and immunological consequences, of cured people and their&#xD;
      contacts; strengthen multidisciplinary monitoring of patients after an acute phase of EVD.&#xD;
      The results will therefore have a direct impact on the clinical management of this population&#xD;
      and on the prevention of possible secondary contamination in the Democratic Republic of the&#xD;
      Congo.&#xD;
