  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of curative intended&#xD;
      irreversible electroporation (IRE) in the treatment of liver tumors neighboring major vessels&#xD;
      or bile ducts.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients can be included in the study if they have one or more malignant liver tumors&#xD;
      unsuitable for resection and thermal ablation (due to proximity of major vessels or bile&#xD;
      duct) or other established liver directed therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to inclusion all potential participant will be evaluated by the local multidisciplinary&#xD;
      team, to insure fulfillment of the above-mentioned criteria. In general, the included patient&#xD;
      will have tumors with &lt;1 cm of margin to major hepatic vessels or bile ducts, thereby not&#xD;
      allowing for conventional treatments because of risk of i.e. hemorrhage, biliary tract&#xD;
      damage, liver failure or ineffective ablation due to heat sink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IRE will be done under general anesthesia as an in-patient procedure. Patients will be&#xD;
      observed for at least 24 hours after IRE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will attend CT scans 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post-IRE according&#xD;
      to national guidelines (for follow-up after radiofrequency ablation (RFA)). Patients will&#xD;
      attend the out-patient clinic after 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months. During the follow-up&#xD;
      period, patients will be asked to fill out electronic forms monitoring pain, quality of life&#xD;
      and nutritional status. After 24 months the patients will only be followed with CT scans in&#xD;
      accordance with the mentioned schedule. Data collection for scientific purposes will stop&#xD;
      when the last included patient has been followed for at least 24 months or when the study&#xD;
      period concludes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of multiple liver tumors, where a conventional treatment approach is not possible due&#xD;
      to a single lesion being too close to major vessels or bile ducts, IRE may be used in&#xD;
      conjunction to conventional therapy.&#xD;
