    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, randomized, crossover pilot study of Voxx Human Performance&#xD;
      Technology Socks versus placebo socks for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy in patients with cancer. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to one of the following&#xD;
      regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: Continuous wear of Voxx Human Performance Technology Socks for 2 weeks, followed&#xD;
           by continuous wear of placebo socks for 2 weeks (separated by a 2-week washout period)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: Continuous wear of placebo socks for 2 weeks, followed by continuous wear of Voxx&#xD;
           Human Performance Technology Socks for 2 weeks (separated by a 2-week washout period)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated at three time points using an objective neuropathy assessment as&#xD;
      well as self-report questionnaires assessing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy,&#xD;
      quality of life, and cancer-related symptoms.&#xD;

    <description>Voxx Human Performance Technology Socks are commercially-available socks that are drug and electrical free. The Voxx Human Performance Technology proprietary pattern is woven into a sock that is made of 70% cotton, 25% polyester, 3% spandex, and 2% nylon.&#xD;
Prior to the 2-week treatment window, patients will be provided with 6 pairs of Voxx Human Performance Technology socks. Patients will be asked to wear the socks continuously during both waking and sleeping hours, except when showering, bathing, or swimming.</description>

             or tarsal tunnel syndrome, radiculopathy, spinal stenosis, brachial plexopathy,&#xD;
             leptomeningeal carcinomatosis), as assessed by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neuropathy related to abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone or cobalamin levels as&#xD;
             assessed by treating physician.&#xD;

             eating disorder, as assessed by the treating physician.&#xD;

             program or trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
