  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if low dose aspirin reduces the incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy&#xD;
      (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP syndrome) in pregnant women&#xD;
      with stage 1 hypertension and elevated blood pressure.&#xD;

      At the baseline visit, women will go through informed consent and review of study&#xD;
      eligibility. Objectives of the study, participation requirements, eligibility inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion will be reviewed in detail. If these are not met, the woman is excluded from the&#xD;
      study. If she meets inclusion criteria, a checklist of exclusion criteria will be reviewed.&#xD;
      If any exclusions are met, the woman is excluded from the study. The consent form will be&#xD;
      reviewed in detail. If the woman consents and signs all pages of the form, randomization&#xD;
      follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done in a 1:1 allocation ratio between the treatment and placebo arms,&#xD;
      stratified by blood pressure group (elevated blood pressure and stage 1 hypertension). A&#xD;
      computer algorithm will assign participant based on random permuted blocks design with block&#xD;
      size between 2-4 within each strata. Each participant will have an assigned Study ID number&#xD;
      that is linked to their random assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by telephone 1 week after randomization. The purpose of this&#xD;
      visit is to ensure the participant has received study medication and initiated the regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third encounter will be 6 weeks (+/- 1week) after randomization in person to coincide&#xD;
      with routine prenatal visit or via telephone. The purpose of this study visit is to review&#xD;
      their pregnancy course, use of study medications, any side effects, difficulties with the&#xD;
      study, and have opportunities to make comments and/or ask questions. The participants will be&#xD;
      asked to bring their study medication for pill count at the time of this encounter, if the&#xD;
      study visit is able to be performed in person. Study participants will continue their routine&#xD;
      prenatal care with pregnancy management performed routinely per their provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourth encounter will be 16 weeks (+/- 1week) after randomization in person to coincide&#xD;
      with routine prenatal visit or via telephone. If the participant is already delivered by this&#xD;
      time, the visit will be performed via telephone postpartum. The purpose of this study visit&#xD;
      is to review their pregnancy course, use of study medications, any side effects, difficulties&#xD;
      with the study, and have opportunities to make comments and/or ask questions. The&#xD;
      participants will be asked to bring their study medication for pill count at the time of this&#xD;
      encounter, if the study visit is able to be performed in person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rest of the study will be conducted via chart review. Each prenatal visit will be&#xD;
      reviewed for blood pressure, evaluation of symptoms, review of any laboratory and/or imaging&#xD;
      results. New diagnoses, medications, and hospital admissions will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery records will be abstracted for outcomes listed below. Neonatal records will be&#xD;
      reviewed from birth until 1 year of age. Neonatal and infant chart abstraction will include&#xD;
      birthweight, Apgar scores, hospital course, problem visit, diagnoses, medications, emergency&#xD;
      department visits, and hospitalizations. Participant's postpartum course will be reviewed for&#xD;
      1 year postpartum, including outpatient visits, emergency department visits, and any&#xD;
      hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed by an intent-to-treat analysis. Thus, even women who discontinue&#xD;
      study medication will be included in final analyses.&#xD;
