  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some solid tumors make a lot of a protein called glypican 3(GPC3), which helps it to grow.&#xD;
      Healthy cells and tissues do not make GPC3. TAK-102 is a medicine that sticks to GCP3 and&#xD;
      stops it from working. It is hoped that TAK-102 will eventually treat people with solid&#xD;
      tumors with the GPC3 protein. TAK-102 will be added to each person's white blood cells so is&#xD;
      custom-made for each person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, people with solid tumors with GPC3 will receive TAK-102 with their white blood&#xD;
      cells. The main aims of this study are to check if the participants get any side effects from&#xD;
      treatment with TAK-102 and to check how much TAK-102 they can receive without getting side&#xD;
      effects from it. Researchers can then work out the best dose of TAK-102 to give to&#xD;
      participants in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, the study doctor will check who can take part. For those who can take&#xD;
      part, the study doctors will collect white blood cells from each participant. These cells are&#xD;
      sent to the laboratory where TAK-102 is added to each participant's cells. This can take up&#xD;
      to 4 weeks. Participants will receive specific treatments while they are waiting for TAK-102.&#xD;
      Then, participants will receive TAK-102 with their cells slowly through a vein (infusion). 3&#xD;
      different small groups of participants will receive lower to higher doses of TAK-102. Each&#xD;
      participant will just receive 1 dose. The study doctors will check for side effects after&#xD;
      each different dose of TAK 102. In this way, researchers can work out the best dose of&#xD;
      TAK-102 to give to participants in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in hospital for 28 days or longer for their treatment. Then, they will&#xD;
      visit the clinic for regular check-ups for up to 36 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-102. TAK-102 is being tested to treat&#xD;
      people who have GPC3-expressing previously treated solid tumors. This study will look at the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of TAK-102 and will determine the RP2D of TAK-102.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 14 participants, with a maximum of 18 participants.&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment groups (dose cohorts) and dose&#xD;
      escalation will be conducted in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: 1 × 10^7 CAR (+) cells/body [starting dose].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: 1 × 10^8 CAR (+) cells/body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: 1 × 10^9 CAR (+) cells/body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case Cohort 1 is not tolerable, the dose level will be de-escalated to Cohort -1: 3 × 10^6&#xD;
      CAR (+) cells/body. Dose level(s) between planned cohorts and/or other dosing schedules may&#xD;
      also be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of the Screening, Pretreatment, and Treatment and Primary Follow-up&#xD;
      phases. In Treatment and Primary Follow-up phases, all participants will be asked to receive&#xD;
      a single intravenous infusion of TAK-102 and administration of TAK-102 will continue up to&#xD;
      Month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is 15 years as a maximum including planned long-term follow-up study (the 12-month&#xD;
      Treatment and Primary Follow-up and the 14-year Secondary Follow-up phases in another study).&#xD;
      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and be hospitalized for at least 28 days&#xD;
      to receive treatment with TAK-102 followed by a recovery period.&#xD;
