  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This placebo-controlled clinical study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of administration of PH94B nasal spray four times per day as a treatment of&#xD;
      Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety symptoms in adults. Subject participation in the Study will&#xD;
      last a total of 6 to 10 weeks, depending on the duration of the screening period and whether&#xD;
      they need a washout of concomitant anxiolytics. Upon signing an investigation review board&#xD;
      approved informed consent, all subjects will complete Visit 1 (Screening) and enter a&#xD;
      screening period lasting 7 to 35 days that could include taper of concomitant anxiolytics, if&#xD;
      necessary. Screening visit will consist of safety assessments (medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, laboratory samples, electrocardiogram, urine drug screen, and urine pregnancy&#xD;
      test [if appropriate]) and psychiatric assessments to determine eligibility. Subjects will&#xD;
      then return to complete Visit 2 (Baseline). If the subject continues to meet inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria, the subject will be randomized 1:1 to PH94B or placebo. Subjects will&#xD;
      then commence 4 weeks of double-blind treatment with randomized investigational product&#xD;
      (PH94B or placebo) four times per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return for weekly site visits (Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6), in which the subject&#xD;
      will return the vial dispensed at the previous visit and receive a new vial, except at Visit&#xD;
      6 in which no new vial will be dispensed. Changes in AEs and concomitant medications will be&#xD;
      collected. During these visits, psychiatric scales will be completed. When the subject&#xD;
      returns for Visit 6, besides the assessments completed at Visits 3 through 5, the subjects&#xD;
      will complete a brief physical examination, electrocardiogram, laboratory tests (chemistry&#xD;
      and blood), and urinalysis. Any remaining IP vials will be collected. The subject will then&#xD;
      come back after a one week washout period for Follow-up visit (Visit 7).&#xD;

             2), prior to investigational product (IP) administration. Effective methods of&#xD;
             contraception include: condoms with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptive agents (oral, transdermal, or injectable), or implantable contraceptive&#xD;
             devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Males whose sexual partners are women of childbearing potential must commit to the&#xD;
             consistent and correct use of an effective method of birth control throughout the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any history of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any other current Axis I disorder, including, but not limited to, major depressive&#xD;
             disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive&#xD;
             disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder, which is&#xD;
             in poor control and the primary focus of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A diagnosis of social anxiety disorder with a score &gt;60 on the Liebowitz Social&#xD;
             Anxiety Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who meet criteria for moderate or severe alcohol or substance use disorder&#xD;
             within the 1 year prior to Study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject has a significant risk for suicidal&#xD;
             behavior during the course of their participation in the study, or considered to be an&#xD;
             imminent danger to themselves or others.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Clinically significant nasal pathology or history of significant nasal trauma, nasal&#xD;
             surgery, anosmia, or nasal septum perforation that may have damaged the nasal&#xD;
             chemosensory epithelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. An acute or chronic condition, including an infectious illness, uncontrolled seasonal&#xD;
             allergies at the time of the study, or significant nasal congestion that potentially&#xD;
             could affect drug delivery to the nasal chemosensory epithelium. The Investigator may&#xD;
             allow concomitant use of over-the-counter nasal decongenstants as needed, since there&#xD;
             is no apparent drug interaction between these and PH94B.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Concomitant use of any anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines or buspirone, during the&#xD;
             Study and within 30 days of Baseline (Visit 2).&#xD;

             reuptake inhibitors, or other approved antidepressants are permitted as long as the&#xD;
             dose has been stable for 30 days prior to Baseline (Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Women who have a positive urine or serum pregnancy test at either Screening or&#xD;
             Baseline visit or are currently breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;

             urinalysis, electrocardiogram, or physical examination identified at the Screening&#xD;
             visit that in the clinical judgment of the Investigator, could place the subject at&#xD;
             undue risk, interfere with study participation, or confound the results of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects with a positive urine drug screen at either the Screening visit or Baseline&#xD;
             visit (not including tetrahydrocannabinol).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any current clinically significant and/or uncontrolled medical condition, based on&#xD;
             medical history or as evidenced in screening assessments, such as SARS-Cov-2, HIV,&#xD;
             cancer, stroke, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or any other&#xD;
             medical condition or disease that, in the clinical judgment of the Investigator, could&#xD;
             place the subject at undue risk, interfere with Study participation, or confound the&#xD;
             results of the Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Use of a concomitant medication that, in the clinical judgement of the Investigator,&#xD;
             could place the subject at undue risk, interfere with study participation, or confound&#xD;
             the results of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. History of cancer or malignant tumor not in remission for at least 2 years. Basal cell&#xD;
             skin cancers are not exclusionary.&#xD;
