  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic microangiopathy refers to the pathological changes of arterioles, capillaries and&#xD;
      venules in diabetic patients. Due to the impacts including glycol-metabolism disorder,&#xD;
      disturbance of lipid metabolism, cytokine, oxidative stress and hemodynamic changes, the&#xD;
      structure and function of microvessels are damaged accordingly. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is&#xD;
      one of the most common and serious chronic microvascular complications of diabetes, and&#xD;
      becomes a leading cause of end-stage renal failure(ESRF). Presently, urinary&#xD;
      albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) is a widely accepted and relatively reliable indicator for&#xD;
      early diagnosis of DN, however, there are 2/3 DN patients with normal albuminuria have&#xD;
      decreased glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate, GFR) and abnormal structure&#xD;
      of the kidney, one the other hand, the presence of albuminuria is associated with other&#xD;
      vascular dysfunction and kidney disease other than DN, therefore its accuracy is increasingly&#xD;
      being challenged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sidestream dark field(SDF) imagining technology, as an emerging way to visualize blood&#xD;
      vessels, is evaluated in a semi-quantitative manner and provides an effective means to study&#xD;
      structure and function of microcirculation. Different from biochemical markers like&#xD;
      albuminuria, SDF provides a visual information about vessel structure, density, and quality&#xD;
      of diffusion. At present the research of sublingual microcirculation by SDF technique is&#xD;
      mainly applied to microcirculation monitoring in patients in the intensive care unit or&#xD;
      laboratory animal models with acute hemorrhagic shock to assess the potential of being a tool&#xD;
      of diagnosis and treatment prognostic indicator, no relevant research has been carried out to&#xD;
      evaluate the predictive value of diabetic microangiopathy in literature so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herein, the investigators designed the study based on SDF imaging to collect scientific data,&#xD;
      thus providing strong support for the early assessment and diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy&#xD;
      and possibly guiding individual therapy in the future.&#xD;
