  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The potency of immune checkpoint blockade is limited in most solid malignancies, one possible&#xD;
      reason for which is tumor microenvironment. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) as a&#xD;
      epigenetic target for cancer therapy has attracted significant interest. The combination of&#xD;
      EZH2 inhibitors and programmed death-1 ligands/ transforming growth factor-β (PD-L1/TGFβ)&#xD;
      blockade may enhance the efficiency of immunotherapy.The primary objective of this study in&#xD;
      phase Ⅰstage is to assess the safety, feasibility of EZH2 inhibitor SHR2554 in combination&#xD;
      with anti-PD-L1/TGFβ antibody SHR1701 in advanced pretreated solid tumors and b-cell&#xD;
      lymphomas. The phase Ⅱ stage of this study is to primarily evaluate the efficacy of SHR2554&#xD;
      plus SHR1701 and the epigenetic modulating effect of SHR2554.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint blockade has led to great strides in the management of various cancers,&#xD;
      however, durable response could be seen in approximately 20% of treated patients with most&#xD;
      solid malignancies. Immunosuppressive entities such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)&#xD;
      in the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain a major impediment. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2&#xD;
      (EZH2) is the core component of the polycomb group complex, which play a major role in&#xD;
      cellular proliferation and differentiation. EZH2 aberration has been seen in a wide range of&#xD;
      solid tumors and hematological malignancies, affecting tumor progression and immune cells in&#xD;
      the tumor microenvironment, and it is associated with poor clinical prognosis and outcomes.&#xD;
      EZH2 is not only an activator of gene expression through different pathways, but also a&#xD;
      critical epigenetic repressor through histone methylation. Therefore, EZH2 has attracted&#xD;
      significant interest as a potential epigenetic target for cancer treatment. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the combination of EZH2 inhibitors and programmed death-1 ligands/&#xD;
      transforming growth factor-β (PD-L1/TGFβ) blockade could enhance the efficiency of&#xD;
      immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study in phase Ⅰstage is to assess the safety, feasibility of&#xD;
      EZH2 inhibitor SHR2554 in combination with anti-PD-L1/TGFβ antibody SHR1701 in advanced&#xD;
      pretreated solid tumors and b-cell lymphomas. The second objectives include characterizing&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of SHR2554 in combination with SHR1701, evaluating the preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of SHR2554 plus SHR1701 and the epigenetic modulating effect of SHR2554 in its&#xD;
      combination with anti-PD-L1/TGFβ antibody. The exploratory objectives are to evaluate the&#xD;
      pathological, immunological or clinical predictive factors for efficacy and toxicity. Based&#xD;
      on the data of safety, efficacy and recommended dose level obtained from phase Ⅰtrial, this&#xD;
      study moves into phase Ⅱ stage, in which enrolled subjects are randomized to SHR2554 plus SHR&#xD;
      1701 or SHR1701 monotherapy, to primarily evaluate the efficacy of SHR2554 plus SHR1701 and&#xD;
      the epigenetic modulating effect of SHR2554. The second objectives include evaluating safety&#xD;
      and other efficacy parameters, such as overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate&#xD;
      (DCR), duration of response (DOR) and overall survival (OS). The exploratory objectives are&#xD;
      to evaluate laboratory predicting biomarkers.&#xD;
