  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ropidoxuridine and how well it&#xD;
      works when added to the usual chemotherapy treatment (capecitabine) during radiation therapy&#xD;
      for the treatment of patients with stage II-III rectal cancer. Ropidoxuridine may help&#xD;
      radiation therapy work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to the radiation therapy.&#xD;
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping&#xD;
      them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink&#xD;
      tumors. This study is being done to find out whether ropidoxuridine in addition to&#xD;
      capecitabine and radiation therapy works better in treating patients with rectal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of twice daily (BID) oral (PO)&#xD;
      ropidoxuridine (IPdR) when administered with capecitabine (825 mg/m^2 BID) and radiation&#xD;
      therapy (RT) (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the toxicities Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)&#xD;
      version (v) 5 of the combined modality therapy, IPdR + capecitabine + RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BID IPdR when combined with capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) incorporation in circulating granulocytes and&#xD;
      correlate these levels with IPdR plasma PK and clinical/laboratory toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess IUdR incorporation in tumor cells obtained from the surgical resection&#xD;
      specimen and correlate IUdR incorporation in tumor cells with IPdR PK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess IUdR incorporation in tumor cells obtained from the surgical resection specimen&#xD;
      and correlate IUdR incorporation in tumor cells with tumor response as measured by&#xD;
      pathological complete response (pCR) rate and neoadjuvant rectal (NAR) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the pCR rate of IPdR + capecitabine + RT at the IPdR MTD as a measure of&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the NAR score of IPdR + capecitabine + RT at the IPdR MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase IA, dose-escalation study of ropidoxuridine followed by a phase IB&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ropidoxuridine PO BID over 7 days per week and capecitabine PO BID over 6&#xD;
      days per week for 6 weeks. Patients also undergo radiation therapy over 1 fraction per day&#xD;
      for 5 days per week (Monday-Friday) during weeks 1-5 and for 3 days during week 6 in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Approximately 8-12 weeks after&#xD;
      completion of treatment with ropidoxuridine, capecitabine, and radiation therapy, patients&#xD;
      undergo standard of care surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 8-12 weeks following&#xD;
      chemoradiation therapy.&#xD;

             because radiosensitizing agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial&#xD;
             are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP)* and men must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. WOCBP&#xD;
             must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. If urine pregnancy results are positive or cannot be confirmed as&#xD;
             negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this&#xD;
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of IPdR administration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has&#xD;
                  experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization&#xD;
                  (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause&#xD;
                  is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the&#xD;
                  absence of other biological or physiological causes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a&#xD;
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with impaired gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may&#xD;
             significantly alter the absorption of oral IPdR and capecitabine (e.g. ulcerative&#xD;
             disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small&#xD;
             bowel resection). Patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (i.e., patients&#xD;
             requiring current medical interventions or who are symptomatic) or have a history of&#xD;
             abdominal surgery or other medical condition that may, in the opinion of the treating&#xD;
             physician, interfere with GI motility or absorption. Patients with colostomies are&#xD;
             allowed unless colostomy is for one of the precluded reasons above&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with warfarin is not allowed. However, therapy with heparin, low molecular&#xD;
             weight heparin (LMWH), and DOACs (direct oral anticoagulating agent) such as&#xD;
             dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban, and apixaban (Eliquis) is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an active concurrent invasive malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prior invasive rectal malignancy, regardless of disease-free interval&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received pelvic RT for rectal cancer, or prior pelvic RT for any&#xD;
             other malignancy that would prevent the patient from receiving the required RT for&#xD;
             this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to IPdR or capecitabine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because IPdR may have the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with IPdR,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with IPdR. These&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that received live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial&#xD;
             treatment and while participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but&#xD;
             are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow&#xD;
             fever, rabies, bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal flu&#xD;
             vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known homozygous DPD (dihydro pyrimidine dehydrogenase) deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of, or any evidence of, active non-infectious pneumonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment within the past 2 years&#xD;
