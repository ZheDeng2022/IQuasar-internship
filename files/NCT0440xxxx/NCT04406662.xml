  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with incurable cancer often have complex individual needs, however there are several&#xD;
      common themes encountered when considering this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As cancer progresses there are series of interactions between the tumour and the patient,&#xD;
      producing both local and systemic effects. This altered state of illness can have multiple&#xD;
      ill effects including weight loss, fatigue, increased symptom burden and reduction in&#xD;
      physical function which all contribute to a reduced quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These areas are often studied in isolation, giving an incomplete picture. A detailed,&#xD;
      holistic characterisation of this group of people does not exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A robust characterisation of people with incurable cancer will allow identification and&#xD;
      prioritisation of future research and has the potential to inform new therapeutics and&#xD;
      provide justification for treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to collect information about symptoms and quality of life, weight loss and&#xD;
      body composition, physical activity and the body's immune response to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with incurable cancer will be recruited to the study from oncology and&#xD;
      palliative medicine services in the UK. Participants will answer questionnaires about quality&#xD;
      of life and symptoms, have bloods taken for inflammatory marker and cytokine analysis and&#xD;
      have their body composition measured by a variety of methods.&#xD;

      biopsy/surgical specimens) that are no longer required by the local pathologist for&#xD;

      studies, may be requested from patients in the course of establishing the biobank for further&#xD;
