  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients requiring long-term home parenteral nutrition (HPN) suffer from chronic intestinal&#xD;
      insufficiency. The causes of this syndrome can be either anatomical (extensive resection of&#xD;
      the small bowel) or functional (occlusion, pseudo-occlusion, malabsorption). Consequences&#xD;
      mean that patients are unable to cover their oral energy and / or hydroelectrolytic needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, these patients survive only through a nutritional support by the venous route&#xD;
      (parenteral nutrition). However, this lifesaving therapy requires complex technological&#xD;
      nutritional support issues at home, which will influence the personal life of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At home, HPN therapy is performed by nutrition pumps providing a constant flow and able to&#xD;
      detect anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the development of connected systems that allow informations transmission&#xD;
      could help patient's caregiving by the different persons involved in his follow-up&#xD;
      (prescribing physicians, home support nurses, patients and relatives, manufacturers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of an end-to-end data&#xD;
      transmission chain which integrates a nutrition pump connected to a medical IoT module&#xD;
      (developped by Maatel) able to send information to an applicative layer (software interface&#xD;
      PatHView2, developped by Orange Labs) via different transmission modes : LoRaWAN (Long Range&#xD;
      Wide-area network), BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), GSM LTE-M (Global System for Mobile&#xD;
      Communications, Long Term Evolution - Machine Type Communication).&#xD;

    <description>For the patient, it consists of the installation of the connected pump at his home for a duration of one month.&#xD;
Infusion data and events will be continuously collected and transmitted by the 4 different modes (LoRaAN, BLE , GSM and multimodality).Transmitted data won't be used to change the follow up of the patient.&#xD;
At the end of the month, patients will be solicited by an ergonomic engineer to complete a specific questionnaire in order to evaluate the future acceptability of the proposed solution.</description>
