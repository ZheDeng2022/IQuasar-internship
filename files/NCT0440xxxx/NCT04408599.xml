&#xD;
          -  Willingness to provide written informed consent for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Locally advanced or metastatic disease; locally advanced disease must not be amenable&#xD;
             to resection with curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have disease progression after treatment with available therapies that&#xD;
             are known to confer clinical benefit, or who are intolerant to treatment, or who&#xD;
             refuse standard treatment. Note: There is no limit to the number of prior treatment&#xD;
             regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of measurable disease based on RECIST v1.1. Tumor lesions situated in a&#xD;
             previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other locoregional therapy, are&#xD;
             not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the&#xD;
             lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  After dose escalation, subject must be willing to undergo pretreatment and&#xD;
             on-treatment tumor biopsies (core or excisional). Note: A baseline biopsy obtained for&#xD;
             other purposes (i.e., not an NC410-01 study procedure) before signing consent may be&#xD;
             utilized if the subject has not had any intervening systemic therapy from the time of&#xD;
             the biopsy to the start of treatment with the medical monitor's approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential (defined as women who have not undergone&#xD;
             surgical sterilization with a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy and are not&#xD;
             postmenopausal, defined as ≥ 12 months of amenorrhea) must have a negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test at screening. All female and male subjects of childbearing potential&#xD;
             must agree to take appropriate precautions to avoid pregnancy or fathering children&#xD;
             (with at least 99% certainty) from screening through 60 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comprehend or unwilling to sign the Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;

               6. Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 × ULN unless conjugated bilirubin ≤ ULN (conjugated&#xD;
                  bilirubin only needs to be tested if total bilirubin exceeds ULN). If there is no&#xD;
                  institutional ULN, then direct bilirubin must be &lt; 40% of total bilirubin.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. International normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) &gt; 1.5 × ULN&#xD;

             erythropoietin) within 14 days before the first administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of anticancer medications or investigational drugs within the following&#xD;
             intervals before the first administration of study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ≤ 14 days for chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation&#xD;
                  therapy. Subjects must also not require chronic use of corticosteroids and must&#xD;
                  not have had radiation pneumonitis because of a treatment. A 1-week washout is&#xD;
                  permitted for palliative radiation to non-central nervous system (CNS) disease&#xD;
                  with medical monitor approval. Note: Bisphosphonates and denosumab are permitted&#xD;
                  medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. ≤ 28 days for prior immunotherapy or persistence of active cellular therapy&#xD;
                  (e.g., chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy; other cellular therapies must be&#xD;
                  discussed with the medical monitor to determine eligibility).&#xD;

                  denosumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. ≤ 7 days for immune-suppressive-based treatment for any reason. Note: Use of&#xD;
                  inhaled or topical steroids or corticosteroid use for radiographic procedures is&#xD;
                  permitted. Note: The use of physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy may be&#xD;
                  approved after consultation with the medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. ≤ 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose for all&#xD;
                  other investigational study drugs or devices. For investigational agents with&#xD;
                  long half-lives (e.g., &gt; 5 days), enrollment before the fifth half-life requires&#xD;
                  medical monitor approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 from toxic effects of prior therapy (including prior&#xD;
             immunotherapy) and/or complications from prior surgical intervention before starting&#xD;
             therapy. Note: Subjects with stable chronic conditions (≤ Grade 2) not expected to&#xD;
             resolve (such as neuropathy and alopecia) are exceptions and may enroll. Note:&#xD;
             Subjects with a history of any grade immune-related ocular AE (e.g., episcleritis,&#xD;
             scleritis, uveitis) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,&#xD;
             mumps, rubella, chicken pox/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin,&#xD;
             and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed&#xD;
             virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g.,&#xD;
             FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment in the past (i.e., with use&#xD;
             of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Subjects&#xD;
             who have not required systemic treatment in the past 2 years may be eligible with&#xD;
             approval of the medical monitor. Note: Subjects with hyper/ hypothyroidism are&#xD;
             eligible to participate. Note: Replacement and symptomatic therapies (e.g.,&#xD;
             levothyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal&#xD;
             or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) are not considered a form of systemic immune&#xD;
             suppressive therapy and are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Note: Subjects with&#xD;
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without&#xD;
             evidence of progression by imaging for at least 28 days before the first dose of study&#xD;
             drug and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new&#xD;
             or enlarging brain metastases or CNS edema, and have not required steroids for at&#xD;
             least 7 days before the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment, or&#xD;
             history of other malignancy within 2 years of study entry apart from cured basal cell&#xD;
             or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer, prostate&#xD;
             intraepithelial neoplasm, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other noninvasive or&#xD;
             indolent malignancy, or cancers from which the subject has been disease-free for &gt; 1&#xD;
             year, after treatment with curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active, noninfectious pneumonitis or history of interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or presence of an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in the investigator's&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection or risk of&#xD;
             reactivation. HBV-DNA and HCV-RNA must be undetectable. Subjects cannot be positive&#xD;
             for HBV-DNA, HCV-RNA, hepatitis B surface antigen, or anti-hepatitis B core antibody.&#xD;
             Note: Subjects with no prior history of hepatitis B infection who have been vaccinated&#xD;
             against hepatitis B and who have a positive antibody against hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antigen test as the only evidence of prior exposure may participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of HIV (HIV 1 or HIV 2 antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy or reaction to any component of study drug or formulation components.&#xD;
