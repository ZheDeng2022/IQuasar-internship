      The purpose of the trial will be to test whether providing both a short summary PIS and a&#xD;
      link to a set of online video modules will improve patient understanding (those considering&#xD;
      early phase clinical trials) as measured on the Quality of Informed Consent questionnaire&#xD;
      (Part A), as compared to a control group who are provided only the normal PIS, and also to&#xD;
      assess user acceptability and feasibility of these interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      i. General background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early phase oncology clinical trials are becoming increasingly complex with a rapidly&#xD;
      increasing array of investigational agents, combinations of these agents and a variety of&#xD;
      trial designs which incorporate the importance of personalised approaches and the hope of&#xD;
      fast tracked drug discovery. Informed consent for early phase oncology trials has always been&#xD;
      a contentious area, and now it continues to be of relevance for the wider oncology community&#xD;
      and the Phase 1 trial community. A 2018 study demonstrated significant gaps in understanding&#xD;
      of patients regarding the nature and intent of early phase oncology trials. There has been a&#xD;
      longstanding debate in the medical oncology community about the nature of Phase 1 trials and&#xD;
      the ethics of allowing vulnerable patients to participate in clinical research where the&#xD;
      primary purpose is to establish the safe dose. Opponents of the argument point to the need to&#xD;
      understand both sides and that patients need to understand enough to consent, which is not&#xD;
      necessarily full comprehension. The fact that this group of patients is hopeful, optimistic&#xD;
      and desperate has been well characterized and no doubt plays a role in their ability to&#xD;
      process information presented to them by the clinical research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Empirical research showing patients misunderstand early phase clinical trials&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have shown that advanced cancer patients (ACP) misunderstand the nature and&#xD;
      purpose of Phase 1 oncology trials. Most recently, Hlubocky et al. demonstrated through&#xD;
      audiotaping clinical encounters between 101 ACPs, and 29 oncologists that ACPs had a poor&#xD;
      understanding. Only 26% were able to recall the primary purpose of the trial as safety and&#xD;
      only 7% were able to recall that there was a risk of major adverse effects such as organ&#xD;
      damage. The study also demonstrated deficiencies in clinician communication, with only 40% of&#xD;
      encounters containing a direct statement on the research purpose being to establish safety,&#xD;
      toxicity and dosage. In 2010, a similar study of 17 oncologists and 52 patients in the United&#xD;
      Kingdom showed that several key areas of information including prognosis were omitted from&#xD;
      the clinical encounter.Joffe and colleagues also conducted a survey of trial participants&#xD;
      (including phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials) and investigators and showed significant&#xD;
      deficits in understanding. Furthermore, in a survey of 95 patients on Phase 1 trials, Pentz&#xD;
      and colleagues demonstrated that 68.4% of patients had a therapeutic misconception by failing&#xD;
      to answer two core questions correctly (&quot;Is the research study mostly intending to help&#xD;
      research and gain knowledge or mostly intending to help you as a person?&quot; and &quot;Does the&#xD;
      research study or your doctor decide the treatments?&quot;). There was also a misunderstanding of&#xD;
      the risk associated with participating in an early phase clinical trial and that they do not&#xD;
      correctly grasp the key difference between individualized care and clinical research. There&#xD;
      was a correlation between lower education and lower family incomes with therapeutic&#xD;
      misconception. Overall there is extensive empirical evidence to suggest that a significant&#xD;
      proportion of advanced cancer patients considering early phase oncology clinical trials&#xD;
      harbour misconceptions about the nature and design of these trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Participant Information Sheets are too long, too complex and fail to meet the&#xD;
      information needs of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has long been recognised that Participant Information Sheets (PIS) or Informed Consent&#xD;
      Forms (ICF) are highly complex and lengthy across all the phases of oncology clinical trials.&#xD;
      In 2007, Beardsley and colleagues showed that PIS were increasing in length and that an&#xD;
      objective measure of informed consent (the QuIC-A), understanding decreased as PIS's&#xD;
      increased in length. There have been no published studies on the PIS used in Phase 1 studies&#xD;
      specifically. However, in the era of combination trials, Bayesian adaptive design, and&#xD;
      seamless Phase 1/2 designs, the PIS for Phase 1 trials can be particularly complex. There is&#xD;
      regulatory requirement for disclosure and there are certain regulatory requirements but these&#xD;
      documents have ultimately become unwieldy, disliked by investigators and anecdotally, not&#xD;
      read at all by participants. This further magnifies the issues on therapeutic misconception&#xD;
      that were highlighted earlier. We note that the Hastings Center has published a 3 page Phase&#xD;
      1 consent form, but to the best of our knowledge this is not in widespread practice. Overall,&#xD;
      in this era of increasingly sophisticated trial design, PIS are becoming lengthier and are&#xD;
      becoming less useful as adjuncts to the informed consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Paucity of interventional research to improve understanding&#xD;
&#xD;
      We performed a review of the literature looking at interventions that have been tested to&#xD;
      improve participant comprehension of Phase 1 trials which yielded two relevant studies. The&#xD;
      first, a simulated teaching intervention to improve clinician confidence by Fallowfield et&#xD;
      al. (2012) showed that an intensive 8 hour educational intervention on clinicians involved in&#xD;
      early phase trials improved their self-confidence along with patient simulator ratings of&#xD;
      understanding(7). Secondly, Kass et al. (2009) randomized 288 participants to receive either&#xD;
      a 20 minute educational computer based presentation or a standard pamphlet on clinical trials&#xD;
      and showed that they could improve patient understanding of trial purpose from 16% to 34%(8)&#xD;
      and also showed that there was no significant differences in likelihood of enrollment. We&#xD;
      note that there have been multiple efforts directed towards empowering cancer patients in&#xD;
      later phase trials including audiovisual techniques such as multimedia presentations(9),&#xD;
      question prompt lists(10), and decision aids (11). Promisingly, sponsors are already taking&#xD;
      steps towards improving their information sheets and there are already attempts to&#xD;
      incorporate audiovisual materials and electronic assessment of patient understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v. Justification for CONSENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT will be a randomised controlled trial examining the effect of both a short,&#xD;
      jargon-free, plain language participant information sheet and a suite of online educational&#xD;
      videos, on participants considering consenting to an investigator initiated trial within the&#xD;
      Drug Development Unit. Early phase trials have dramatically changed over the last decade and&#xD;
      there have been no interventional studies published in this area in this time and&#xD;
      consequently this is a significant area of unmet need for both patients and investigators.&#xD;
      This trial will use a validated measure of informed consent (Quality of Informed Consent -&#xD;
      Part A) and powered to test a statistical hypothesis, and will also examine the acceptability&#xD;
      of the two interventions for patients. While the trial will employ a randomised design, it&#xD;
      will ensure all participants are provided access to the enhanced consent materials prior to&#xD;
      their actual consent visit to ensure fairness. This trial will be conducted in compliance&#xD;
      with the protocol, standard operating procedures, policies, local R&amp;D management guidance,&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice including the UK Policy Framework for Health and Social Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Governance Framework 2005 (2nd edition)&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the ethical imperative to ensure patients understand the nature and conduct of clinical&#xD;
      trials, the clearly documented lack of understanding in the literature, we propose this trial&#xD;
      to examine whether a pragmatic and deliverable program of &quot;enhanced&quot; informed consent can&#xD;
      impact upon patient objective and subjective understanding. The first part of this enhanced&#xD;
      consent will be a summary PIS (example attached in appendix) which contains the absolutely&#xD;
      necessary information for patients - we have already conducted a qualitative study of patient&#xD;
      focus groups and have asked patients directly their priorities. The top three priorities&#xD;
      identified patients were&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will this trial work for me?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the side effects?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How often do I have to come? This will consist of an easy to understand flowchart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of this enhanced consent will be an online link to 10 video modules&#xD;
      (transcripts attached in appendix) covering key areas of the consent. During the development&#xD;
      process of these educational tools, we performed a qualitative analysis of transcripts of&#xD;
      interviews of consultants, study managers, clinical fellows, clinical research nurses and&#xD;
      patients of the DDU and identified the key areas that the various stakeholders wished to&#xD;
      communicate to patients. We asked about the key areas that need to be communicated, common&#xD;
      areas of misunderstanding and preferred ways forward of improving patient understanding.&#xD;
