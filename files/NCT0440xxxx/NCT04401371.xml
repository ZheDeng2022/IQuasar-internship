      To assess dental student opinion about distance educational learning environment during&#xD;
      COVID-19 Pandemic and to assess their satisfaction with Hybrid learning&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus crisis has caused disturbance in the provision of education all over the world.&#xD;
      In Egypt institutions of higher education has taken the decision to temporarily suspend&#xD;
      attendance in universities and to keep it closed for student during this pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cairo university overcome this problem by avoiding gathering and facilitating the continuity&#xD;
      of education for all through remote learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In faculty of dentistry Cairo university, pediatric dentistry course coordinators and&#xD;
      instructors made modifications in their course which is taught to 5th year dental student.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These modification included continuation of lectures and group sections through distance&#xD;
      learning, while postponing any clinical work to avoid direct contact with patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the next academic year the same course was taught in different way through hybrid learning&#xD;
&#xD;
      So the aim of the study was to compare education learning environment experiences among 5th&#xD;
      year dental students enrolled in pediatric dentistry course through hybrid learning versus&#xD;
      distance learning and to assess students satisfaction with hybrid learning , which will spot&#xD;
      the light on strong and weak points in order to provide better education and improve their&#xD;
      experiences.&#xD;
