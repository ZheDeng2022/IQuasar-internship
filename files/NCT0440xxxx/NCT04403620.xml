  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a strong radiobiological and economic rationale for hypofractionated radiation&#xD;
      therapy in head and neck cancer. Phase 1 of the trial aims to assess the acute toxicity and&#xD;
      tolerability of hypofractionated radiation therapy in the post-operative setting, and to&#xD;
      determine the dose/fractionation for Phase 2. Phase 2 aims to establish non-inferiority of&#xD;
      swallowing-related quality of life and to assess the toxicity and efficacy of&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiation therapy compared to conventionally fractionated radiation therapy&#xD;
      in the post-operative setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will assess the effects of aggressive hypofractionated radiation therapy in&#xD;
      patients with oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx cancer after surgical resection&#xD;
      with pathology showing intermediate risk factors requiring post-operative radiation therapy&#xD;
      without concurrent chemotherapy. During Phase 1, the maximum tolerated dose/fractionation and&#xD;
      tolerability will be determined. During Phase 2, patients will be randomized between&#xD;
      conventionally fractionated radiation therapy (6 weeks) vs. hypofractionated radiation&#xD;
      therapy (3-4 weeks depending on Phase 1 results) to establish non-inferiority of&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiation therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
             Medically acceptable birth control (contraceptives) includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  approved hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills, patch or ring;&#xD;
                  Depo-Provera, Implanon), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  barrier methods (such as condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks before registration for women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Distant metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Stage I and II glottic squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. High risk factors following surgical resection requiring concurrent chemotherapy:&#xD;
             positive margin(s) and/or extranodal extension&#xD;

          4. Feeding tube dependence at baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Synchronous non-skin cancer primaries outside of the oropharynx, oral cavity, larynx,&#xD;
             and hypopharynx except for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer and synchronous&#xD;
             well-differentiated thyroid cancer. For thyroid cancer, surgery may occur before or&#xD;
             after treatment, provided all other eligibility criteria are met. For prostate cancer,&#xD;
             patient should not be receiving active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Prior invasive malignancy with an expected disease-free interval of less than 3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of&#xD;
             radiation fields&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects may not be receiving any other investigational agents for the treatment of&#xD;
             the cancer under study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital&#xD;
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of severe immunosuppression, including HIV, and organ or autologous or&#xD;
             allogeneic stem cell transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The exclusion criteria will be the same as Phase I except for feeding tube dependence.&#xD;
        Patients who are feeding tube dependent are excluded from Phase I to accurately assess&#xD;
        treatment associated toxicity affecting swallowing and oral intake. During Phase II,&#xD;
        patients who are feeding tube dependent will be eligible to enroll and stratified at&#xD;
        randomization.&#xD;
