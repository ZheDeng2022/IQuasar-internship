  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HBV reactivation is common in HCV/HBV coinfected patients receiving DAA therapy for chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C. How to prevent HBV reactivation remains unclear. In this trial, we aim to&#xD;
      investigate whether prophylactic nucleos(t)ide analogue (NUC) at the start of DAA could&#xD;
      prevent HBV reactivation or not. And whether prolonged NUC prophylaxis (24 weeks) would be&#xD;
      better than 12-week prophylaxis. This will be a three-arm, open-label, randomized, active&#xD;
      controlled, study. Totally, 60 HBV/HCV co-infected treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced&#xD;
      patients without decompensated liver cirrhosis will be included in this study. Group 1&#xD;
      patients (n=20) will receive 12-week ETV from the start of DAA therapy. Group 2 patients&#xD;
      (n=20) will receive 24-week ETV from the start of DAA till 12 weeks after end of DAA. Group 3&#xD;
      patients (n=20) will not receive ETV during the period of DAA and will serve as controls. The&#xD;
      rate of HBV reactivation and clinical reactivation will be compared among 3 groups of&#xD;
      patients. Expected outcomes: The rate of HBV reactivation and clinical reactivation will be&#xD;
      lower in the ETV prophylaxis group, and will be the lowest in the group receiving 24-week ETV&#xD;
      prophylaxis.&#xD;

      We will determine the incidence of virologic and clinical reactivation of HBV during DAA&#xD;
      treatment for CHC, in two prophylactic groups versus control group. We will also examine&#xD;
      whether extending the duration of prophylactic NUC would be more beneficial than the 3-month&#xD;
      prophylaxis regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with the following criteria will be enrolled: age ≥20 years; anti-HCV positive and&#xD;
      HCV RNA &gt;1000 IU/ml; any HCV genotype; all received 12 weeks of DAA treatment; treatment&#xD;
      naïve or experienced of pegylated interferon/ribavirin; concurrent HBV infection which is&#xD;
      defined by positive HBsAg for at least 6 months. Patients with the following criteria will be&#xD;
      excluded: history of treatment regimen that included any kind of direct antiviral agents;&#xD;
      presence of other etiology of chronic hepatitis including HIV, autoimmune hepatitis, NASH,&#xD;
      etc; uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (Hba1c &gt;8.5); current evidence or suspicion of&#xD;
      malignancy; severe cardiovascular or other severe comorbid diseases; autoimmune disorders;&#xD;
      presence of liver cirrhosis clinically or pathologically; any one of following hematology or&#xD;
      biochemical or clinical abnormalities: AST/ALT &gt;10x ULN, Albumin &lt;3.5g/dL, Bilirubin&#xD;
      &gt;2.5mg/dL, eGFR &lt;30 ml/min/1.73m2, prothrombin time prolongation &gt;4 sec or INR &gt;1.7, platelet&#xD;
      count &lt;100 x 103 uL, and history or presence of ascites or hepatic encephalopathy;&#xD;
      child-bearing age women without the willing to contraceptive control; and pregnant women or&#xD;
      lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, 60 HCV/HBV coinfected patients will be enrolled and randomized to receive 12-week&#xD;
      DAA regimen for reimbursed for the the treatment of patients with CHC in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entecavir (0.5mg; ETV) 1 # daily will be used in the prophylactic group. Group 1 patients&#xD;
      (n=20) will receive 12-week ETV from the start of DAA therapy. Group 2 patients (n=20) will&#xD;
      receive 24-week ETV from the start of DAA till 12 weeks after end of DAA. Group 3 patients&#xD;
      (n=20) will not receive ETV during the period of DAA and serve as controls. The rate of HBV&#xD;
      reactivation and clinical reactivation will be compared among 3 groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the incidence of virologic and clinical reactivation of HBV&#xD;
      during DAA treatment for CHC. Secondary objectives include the rate of HBV virologic and&#xD;
      clinical reactivation between 12-week versus 24-week entecavir (ETV) prophylaxis during and&#xD;
      after DAA treatment; the profiles of serum HBV DNA/qHBsAg during and after DAA treatment; and&#xD;
      sustained virological response at post-DAA treatment 12 weeks (SVR12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be expressed as percentages for category variables and as mean +- standard&#xD;
      deviation for continuous variables. Category variables will be evaluated by Chi-square test&#xD;
      or Fisher exact test. Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test will be applied for comparison&#xD;
      of the continuous variables. Multivariate analysis will be used to identify factors that are&#xD;
      associated with HBV reactivation. A p value less than 0.05 is considered to be significant.&#xD;
