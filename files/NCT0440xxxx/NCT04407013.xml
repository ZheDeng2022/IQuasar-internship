    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the standardized care pathway which&#xD;
      provides enhanced supportive care for patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study (single arm pre-post test) will be conducted to evaluate feasibility of&#xD;
      applying standardized care pathway to provide enhanced supportive care. A Randomized&#xD;
      Controlled Trial will be conducted by randomly allocating participants in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      intervention arm (receiving enhanced supportive care according to the standardized care&#xD;
      pathway) or control arm (receiving usual care: symptom monitoring only). Participants in the&#xD;
      intervention arm will receive enhanced supportive care consisted of symptom management and&#xD;
      coping enhancement counseling for 5 times. Data from advanced cancer patients will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline (before start of chemotherapy), during chemotherapy (intervention arm),&#xD;
      at the visit for cycle 5 of chemotherapy, at 6 month, and at 12 month Data from caregivers&#xD;
      will be collected at baseline, 3 month, and 6 month. Primary outcomes will be measured as&#xD;
      advanced cancer patients' symptom, coping and quality of life.&#xD;
