      MAIN OBJECTIVE: Description of predicted markers of acute diverticulitis crisis, using&#xD;
      bivariate and multivariate analyses. Analysis of acute diverticulitis predictor swings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIDE OBJECTIVES: Descriptive analysis of HRQL in the different measurement periods to&#xD;
      establish the evolution of the disease. Correlate HRQL values of systemic and local&#xD;
      inflammatory markers in the diverticulitis group. Sub-analysis of patients with&#xD;
      immunosuppression to evaluate disease virulence compared to a group of patients without&#xD;
      immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY TYPE: Clinical, observational, prospective and multicenter study (8 hospitals) with&#xD;
      three study groups: patients diagnosed with acute diverticulitis attending emergencies,&#xD;
      diverticulosis patients and patients without diverticulums. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Age &gt; 18years&#xD;
      and radiological diagnosis by abdominal CT acute diverticulitis. EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
      Rejection of the patient -severe diverticulitis requiring urgent surgery -an inability to&#xD;
      understand HRQL questionnaire - IBD - pregnancy or breastfeeding - acute diverticulitis&#xD;
      within the prior year of the study - Roma IV criteria fulfilment. VARIABLES: Main variables:&#xD;
      local and systemic inflammatory markers- faecal calprotectin. Secondary variables: recurrence&#xD;
      of acute diverticulitis -the persistence of symptoms - SF 12 and GIQLI questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS: Sample size: alpha error 0.05; beta error 0.20; bilateral; proportion 0.9 in the&#xD;
      control group; 500 subjects group diverticulitis, 200 group diverticulosis and not&#xD;
      diverticulums.&#xD;

      GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROJECT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite being a benign pathology, colon diverticulitis represents the fifth most important&#xD;
      gastrointestinal pathology and has a great clinical impact on the quality of life of patients&#xD;
      and on health expenditure. Understanding a disease involves being able to make the correct&#xD;
      diagnosis of the patient and most importantly for the patient, an adequate treatment of his&#xD;
      symptoms. It is required to give accurate information to the patient and answer his doubts,&#xD;
      although the pathophysiology of the disease is unknown. As it is a benign disease with&#xD;
      heterogeneous behaviours and manifestations, it is difficult to make the decision related to&#xD;
      undergo surgery. This decision could be facilitated if it is based on extensive information&#xD;
      from the doctor. It is also important to be able to select those patients who have a higher&#xD;
      risk of relapse in order to prioritize them on the waiting list for surgery. As a benign&#xD;
      disease with occupational active patient involvement, acute diverticulitis has a major&#xD;
      economic impact by leading to repeat leaves in some patients, who are even on a waiting list&#xD;
      to operate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED IMPACT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that this project can respond to the management of a group of patients, in which&#xD;
      there is currently no consensus in the Scientific Community. Therefore, our results are&#xD;
      transferable, as we intend to establish the pathophysiology of the entity known as chronic&#xD;
      diverticulitis and detect the predictors of that entity. Currently, there is no consensus on&#xD;
      the therapeutic management of patients with recurrent episodes of diverticulitis or&#xD;
      persistent symptoms, so that they are treated differently at the discretion of the surgeon,&#xD;
      without any scientific basis. It is also unclear whether it is a maintained inflammatory&#xD;
      disorder or a functional disorder, which differentiation is basic in order to indicate a&#xD;
      correct treatment of the patients. In addition, there is an information gap, unable to&#xD;
      respond if a patient with acute diverticulitis will have a high or low probability of&#xD;
      recurrence and at what time. There are still no studies answering these questions, key to&#xD;
      choosing the best treatment and to give an answer to the huge population of diverticulitis&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish a therapeutic algorithm in patients diagnosed with acute diverticulitis who go&#xD;
           to the emergency department, whose initial management is not an urgent surgical&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is an inflammatory physiopathology underlying between acute episodes, which can&#xD;
           play a role in the apparition of the new episode of acute diverticulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of prognostic factors of new episodes of acute diverticulitis which can be&#xD;
           easy detected in the outpatient clinic, and creation of a therapeutic algorithm that&#xD;
           allows selecting patients who could benefit from early surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive analysis of symptoms with Health Related Quality of Life questionnaires&#xD;
           (HRQL), in order to establish the evolution of the disease and correlate symptoms with&#xD;
           systemic and local inflammatory markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-analysis of patients with immunosuppression to assess the virulence of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY RECRUITMENT. All patients who meet the inclusion criteria, do not present any&#xD;
      exclusion criteria and voluntarily agree to participate in the study after having been&#xD;
