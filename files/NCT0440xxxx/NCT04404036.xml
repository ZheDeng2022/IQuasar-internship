  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the safety, efficacy and potential mechanism of action of the&#xD;
      SinuSonic device on adults with eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) or facial pain/pressure.&#xD;
      SinuSonic is a medical device that utilizes sound and pressure combined with normal&#xD;
      breathing. The study will have 3 aims. Aim 1 will examine healthy controls with no signs of&#xD;
      upper respiratory infection, inflammation, or ETD to determine if exhaled nasal Nitric Oxide&#xD;
      is increased. Nitric Oxide is a compound in the body that acts as a blood vessel relaxant.&#xD;
      Acoustic energy (humming) has been shown to increase nasal Nitric Oxide dramatically, thus&#xD;
      equalization of gas pressures between the middle ear, the paranasal sinuses and the nasal&#xD;
      cavity may very well explain any efficacy noted. Aim 2 will be performed to examine&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy for ETD. Aim 3 will be performed to examine therapeutic efficacy for&#xD;
      sinus pain/pressure.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms severity will be assessed on Visual Analogue Scale (on the scale of 1-10). Visual Analogue Scale is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured.</description>

    <measure>McGill Pain Questionnaire - Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>2 to 4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MPQ-SF is a well-validated pain measure that permits separation of the sensory and affective components of pain, which are averaged to compute a total score. The scale ranges from 0-10 (0=no pain, 10=the most pain).</description>

    <time_frame>2 to 4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (m-BPI-sf): participant rated 11-point Likert rating scale ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Overall ETDQ-7 Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline to 6 weeks in the overall ETDQ-7 score. The 7-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7) is a validated patient-reported tool measuring ETD symptoms and severity. The 7 items are: pressure in the ears, pain in the ears, a feeling that the participant's ears are clogged or underwater, ear symptoms when the participants have a cold or sinusitis, cracking or popping sounds in the ear, ringing in the ears, and a feeling that the participant's hearing is muffled. Each item is rated from 1 (no problem) to 7 (severe problem) and a mean is calculated for the overall score (range from 1-7). Scores of 1-2 indicate no to mild symptoms, 3-5 moderate, and 6-7 severe symptoms.</description>
