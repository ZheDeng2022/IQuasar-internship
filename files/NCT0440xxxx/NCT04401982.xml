      Rhopressa effectively lowers intra-ocular pressure by improving conventional outflow and&#xD;
      decreasing episcleral venous pressure. While this may result in improved episcleral venous&#xD;
      flow, current methods to quantify episcleral blood flow in vivo are rudimentary and unable to&#xD;
      accurately and precisely determine flow. Proof that Rhopressa effectively increases&#xD;
      episcleral venous flow would differentiate it from other medications. Furthermore, this&#xD;
      evidence could galvanize interest in the use of Rhopressa after popular Minimally Invasive&#xD;
      Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS) procedures. In future studies, MIGS procedures could be used to&#xD;
      improve the proximal outflow pathway, and Rhopressa to enhance distal outflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of Rhopressa on episcleral venous outflow and retinal blood flow in a&#xD;
      cohort of treatment-na誰ve ocular hypertensive and glaucoma suspect patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rhopressa increases episcleral venous flow and retinal blood flow from baseline at both 1&#xD;
      hour and 1 week after initiation of therapy.&#xD;

      Need/Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rhopressa effectively lowers intra-ocular pressure by improving conventional outflow and&#xD;
      decreasing episcleral venous pressure. While this may result in improved episcleral venous&#xD;
      flow, current methods to quantify episcleral blood flow in vivo are rudimentary and unable to&#xD;
      accurately and precisely determine flow. Proof that Rhopressa effectively increases&#xD;
      episcleral venous flow would differentiate it from other medications. Furthermore, this&#xD;

      improve the proximal outflow pathway, and Rhopressa to enhance distal outflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose/Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a technology to accurately and precisely determine&#xD;
      episcleral and retinal blood flow in human subjects using ICG labeled erythrocytes via a&#xD;
      technique the investigators have coined as Erythrocyte Mediated Angiography (EMA). The&#xD;
      investigators propose conducting a pilot study to show the effect of Rhopressa on both&#xD;
      improving episcleral blood flow as well as studying its effect on retinal blood flow. With&#xD;
      lower intraocular pressure, and correspondingly higher ocular perfusion pressure, Rhopressa&#xD;
      may also improve retinal blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of Rhopressa on episcleral venous outflow and retinal blood flow in a&#xD;
      cohort of treatment-na誰ve ocular hypertensive and glaucoma suspect patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rhopressa increases episcleral venous flow and retinal blood flow from baseline at both 1&#xD;
      hour and 1 week after initiation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will measure and compare episcleral venous and&#xD;
      retinal blood flow at baseline, 1 hour after Rhopressa instillation and 1 week after&#xD;
      initiation of Rhopressa.&#xD;
