      This was a multicentric observational study with the aim to evaluate the effect of early&#xD;
      treatment with botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) on post-stroke spasticity in adult patients.&#xD;
      All patients enrolled (86 patients) after a baseline clinical assessment (modified Ashworth&#xD;
      scale, motricity index, Fughl Meyer assessment and modified Rankin' scale) undergoes to a&#xD;
      BoNT-A injection following the evidence-based clinical practice. Subsequently, at 4, 12 and&#xD;
      24 weeks they underwent the same clinical evaluation as a follow-up. Results are under&#xD;
      statistical evaluation.&#xD;

      This was a multicentric observational study with the aim to evaluate the effect of early&#xD;
      treatment with botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) on post-stroke spasticity in adult patients.&#xD;
      All centres involved are in Italy. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in&#xD;
      detail in the correspondent section. The main outcome measure was to assess how the time&#xD;
      elapsed from the acute event can influence the effectiveness of the focal treatment of&#xD;
      spasticity with BoNT-A in adult patients with cerebral stroke. Secondary outcomes were to&#xD;
      evaluate the spasticity' grade and the level of functioning using a clinical assessment&#xD;
      (modified Ashworth scale, motricity index, Fughl Meyer assessment, Modified Rankin' scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were enrolled from 10 centres that agreed to participate in this study (Azienda&#xD;
      Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona - coordinating centre; Azienda Ospedaliero&#xD;
      Universitaria Ospedali Riuniti of Foggia; Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria of Ferrara;&#xD;
      Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Pisana; Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria &quot;Maggiore della&#xD;
      Carità&quot; of Novara; Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria - Ospedali Riuniti of Ancona; Azienda&#xD;
      Ospedaliera &quot;Cardinale G. Panico&quot; of Tricase; Fondazione Santa Lucia IRCCS of Rome; Azienda&#xD;
      Ospedaliero-Universitaria Sant'Andrea of Rome; Ospedale &quot;Ca' Foncello&quot; of Treviso). No&#xD;
      patients were enrolled from the last two centers that have expressed their waiver to&#xD;
      participate when the study was already started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient (whether hospitalized or outpatient) included in the study underwent to a&#xD;
      baseline evaluation in which near and remote pathological history were recorded (main&#xD;
      concomitant pathologies, drug therapy in progress, previous major surgery, date of the&#xD;
      stroke) and the following evaluation scales were administered: modified Ashworth scale (MAS),&#xD;
      MI (motricity index), FMA (Fughl Meyer assessment) and Modified Rankin' scale (MRS). After&#xD;
      that received a BoNT-A injection to treat the spasticity focally following the evidence-based&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient subsequently performed a follow-up evaluation at 4, 12 and 24 weeks after the&#xD;
      date of inoculation through the execution of a specialist visit (physiatric/neurological) and&#xD;
      the administration of the following evaluation scales: MAS, MI, FMA and MRS. For the duration&#xD;
      of the study, each patient may undergo integrated rehabilitation treatment at the discretion&#xD;
      of each of the investigators of each centre involved in the study according to the guidelines&#xD;
      and common clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimation of the sample size was hypothesized with the aim to observe a frequency of 75%&#xD;
      in the number of patients who will show a reduction of one point at the MAS. If there is a&#xD;
      correlation between the time elapsed since the acute event and the reduction in the degree of&#xD;
      spastic hypertonia after the first administration of BoNT-A, to obtain an OR = 0.5, assuming&#xD;
      DS = 1 and R2 = 0, with α = 0.05 and β = 0.20 (study power = 80%), 90 patients will be&#xD;
      needed. Assuming a drop-out rate of 10%, a total of 100 patients will need to be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics were produced (frequency histograms; position or central trend&#xD;
      indices: average, median; variability or sample dispersion indices: standard deviation,&#xD;
      interquartile range; sample distribution profile estimate: Shapiro-Wilk test; construction of&#xD;
      the intervals of confidence) as regards demographic (age, gender, the time elapsed from a&#xD;
      stroke) and clinical (MAS, MI, FMA and MRS score at baseline, 4, 12 and 24 weeks after BoNT-A&#xD;
      injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the role of the time elapsed from the acute event on the therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy of the first administration of BoNT-A 4 weeks after the inoculation (primary&#xD;
      endpoint), a logistic regression analysis was performed in order to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      time since the acute event (independent variable) on the reduction of spastic hypertonia&#xD;
      defined in dichotomous terms (dependent variable): RESPONDER (patient who will have obtained&#xD;
      a reduction of at least 1 point in MAS of the degree of spastic hypertonia after 4 weeks from&#xD;
      the administration) and NON RESPONDER (patient who has not obtained a reduction of at least 1&#xD;
      point in MAS of the degree of spastic hypertonia 4 weeks after administration), considering&#xD;
      as possible any covariates the gender and age of the patient at the time of the acute event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As regards the evaluation of secondary endpoints, the analysis of correlation (Pearson&#xD;
      correlation index; Spearman correlation coefficient) was carried out in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      association between the effects of the time elapsed from the acute event and the change in&#xD;
      the score at MAS 4, 12 and 24 weeks after BoNT inoculation, as well as on the variation of&#xD;
      the score at MI, FMA and MRS at 4, 12 and 24 weeks from the administration of BoNT-A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis will be performed using the Statistical Package for Social Science&#xD;
      SPSS® version 20.0 software for Macintosh (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical&#xD;
      significance will set at P &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results are under statistical evaluation.&#xD;

    <description>Evaluation of the motricity using the MI at 4 - 12 - 24 weeks from the BoNT-A injection.&#xD;
Motricity Index is an ordinal scale that evaluates motor and functional capacity at the level of the limbs in patients with neurological pathologies. The movements evaluated are 6 in all (3 for each limb) and are:&#xD;
for the arm (pinch grip, elbow flexion, shoulder abduction)&#xD;
for the leg (ankle dorsiflexion, knee extension, hip flexion) To each movement assessed the points attributed may range from 0 &quot;no movement&quot; to 33 &quot;normal pinch grip&quot; or &quot;normal power&quot; for upper and lower extremities respectively.</description>

    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index. It is designed to assess motor functioning, balance, sensation and joint functioning in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. The scale is comprised of five domains (motor functioning in the upper and lower extremities; sensory functioning, evaluates light touch on two surfaces of the arm and leg, and position perception for 8 joints; balance, contains 7 tests, 3 seated and 4 standing; the joint range of motion, 8 joints; joint pain). Lowest is the total for each domain, worse is the correspondent function.</description>
