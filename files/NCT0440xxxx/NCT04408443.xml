  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this protocol is to evaluate, in a multicenter, randomized, double blind vs&#xD;
      placebo clinical trial the effects of a marketed food supplement containing Lactobacillus&#xD;
      reuteri DSM 17938 and vitamin D3 (ReuterinÂ® D3) in the prevention of recurrent respiratory&#xD;
      infections in pediatric patients suffered from Recurrent Respiratory Infection (RRI) in&#xD;
      previous years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several clinical trials documented the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention and treatment&#xD;
      of acute gastroenteritis, while there is little evidence on the efficacy of the probiotics in&#xD;
      the prevention of children respiratory infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biological activity of probiotics is linked, partly, to their capacity to adhere to&#xD;
      enterocytes. This would avoid the binding of pathogenic bacteria through a competitive&#xD;
      exclusion mechanism. This inhibition toward pathogen bacteria on epithelial and mucosal level&#xD;
      (substrate), thanks also to the production of antimicrobial substances, can have a beneficial&#xD;
      effect on the balance of the intestinal microflora of the host and improve its immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adhesion of probiotic bacteria to the enterocyte membrane receptors influences the&#xD;
      activation of second messengers that induces the production of cytokines. The presence of&#xD;
      probiotic bacteria influences the commensal microorganisms in the production of lactic acid&#xD;
      and bacteriocins. These substances inhibit the growth of pathogens and modify the balance of&#xD;
      commensal bacteria of the intestinal bacterial flora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous controlled clinical trials show that L. reuteri DSM 17938 colonizes the human&#xD;
      gastric and intestinal epithelium and modulates the immune response, particularly through CD4&#xD;
      + T-helper cells in the ileum. These data confirm the pre-clinical evidence obtained in&#xD;
      animal models; furthermore these immunomodulatory effects may explain some clinical&#xD;
      properties of L. reuteri DSM 17938 such as the prevention of diarrhea, inhibition of pathogen&#xD;
      infectionand the following immune system response of the host to these pathogens, as well as&#xD;
      the potential modulation of the immune response by the Th1/Th2 balance in the human&#xD;
      intestinal epithelium, an answer that has been linked to the prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      allergy. In a recent, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, L. reuteri&#xD;
      DSM 17938, supplemented for three months to healthy children aged 6-36 months attending&#xD;
      nursery schools, demonstrated not only a significant reduction of episodes and duration of&#xD;
      diarrhea but also of respiratory tract infections with consequent reduction of costs for&#xD;
      society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the prevalence of food with vitamin D and multivitamin products, reports regarding&#xD;
      non-optimal vitamin D levels in adults and children in the world have increased, in&#xD;
      particular among those subjects overweight and with dark pigmentation of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to its well-known effects on bone health, vitamin D is indeed an important immune&#xD;
      regulator, because it stimulates innate immunity and modulates inflammation. An analysis of&#xD;
      data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1988 and 1994&#xD;
      showed an inverse relationship between vitamin D levels and the incidence of upper&#xD;
      respiratory tract infections (URTI). These results were supported by other studies showing an&#xD;
      increased risk of acute lower respiratory tract infections in subjects with low levels of&#xD;
      vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, the association between rickets and the risk of serious respiratory infections&#xD;
      is well known and vitamin D deficiency has been associated with an increased risk to contract&#xD;
      the flu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These considerations have led to the hypothesis that supplementation with a probiotic added&#xD;
      with vitamin D3 may influence the composition of intestinal flora by improving the immune&#xD;
      system and therefore reducing episodes of respiratory infections, particularly frequent&#xD;
      during preschool age.&#xD;
