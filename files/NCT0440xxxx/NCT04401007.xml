  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although erector spinae plane (ESP) block reportedly provides postoperative pain relieve,&#xD;
      controversy remains regarding the accuracy and consistency of analgesic success following ESP&#xD;
      block. The goal of this study is to determine the extent and duration of clinical neural&#xD;
      blockade following an ESP injection with different local anesthetic doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Twenty four healthy volunteers will be recruited, and each subject will make 2&#xD;
      separate visits to the study centre to undergo intervention and assessment. The 2 study&#xD;
      visits will be separated by an interval of at least 2 weeks to ensure complete washout of any&#xD;
      residual effects and a return to baseline status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit, the subject will receive a unilateral ESP block with 1.5% lidocaine and&#xD;
      5 mcg/mL epinephrine. Two different local anesthetic volumes will be investigated: 20 mL (300&#xD;
      mg lidocaine) at one study visit and 30 mL (450 mg lidocaine) at the other study visit.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be randomized to one of two intervention groups: (1) Group 20/30: A&#xD;
      unilateral ESP block with 20 mL of local anesthetic at the first visit, and 30 mL of local&#xD;
      anesthetic at the second visit; or (2) Group 30/20: a unilateral ESP block with 30 mL of 1.5%&#xD;
      lidocaine with 1/200,000 epinephrine at the first visit, and 20 mL of the same local&#xD;
      anesthetic solution at the second visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 2 study subgroups based on the vertebral level at which the ESP block is&#xD;
      administered: (1) Volunteer subjects in subgroup TP4 will receive the ESP block injection at&#xD;
      the T4 transverse process (TP4) level in order to evaluate the anesthetic effect on the chest&#xD;
      wall. (2) Volunteers in subgroup TP8 will receive the ESP block injection at the T8&#xD;
      transverse process (TP8) level in order to evaluate the anesthetic effect on the abdominal&#xD;
      wall. The first 10 volunteer subjects recruited will receive ESP blocks at the TP4 level and&#xD;
      the subsequent 10 subjects will receive ESP blocks at the TP8 level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Erector spinae plane (ESP) block is a new regional nerve block technique that involves a&#xD;
      percutaneous injection of local anesthetic as a bolus through a needle or catheter into the&#xD;
      fascial plane between the erector spinae muscle and the transverse processes in the upper or&#xD;
      mid back. Injection at the level of the T4-5 transverse process is indicated for chest wall&#xD;
      pain relief while injection at the T8-9 level is for abdominal wall pain control. This block&#xD;
      aims to relieve postoperative pain but is not intended to provide anesthetic blockade for&#xD;
      surgery. Preliminary case reports and some randomized controlled trials show encouraging&#xD;
      analgesic effect of ESP block for breast surgery, rib fracture, thoracotomy, sternotomy,&#xD;
      epigastric hernia repair, open abdominal surgery, laparoscopic abdominal surgery, radical&#xD;
      retropubic prostatectomy and hip arthroplasty. Although effective, controversy remains&#xD;
      regarding the accuracy and consistency of analgesic success following ESP block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, it is unclear whether block inconsistency is due to improper injection technique&#xD;
      or the mechanism of action. Presumably, local anesthetic following an ESP block injection&#xD;
      will find its way antero-medially through the costotransverse foramen and / or inter&#xD;
      transverse ligaments to enter the thoracic paravertebral space or epidural space to block the&#xD;
      ventral rami of the thoracic spinal nerves. It may also spread laterally to reach the&#xD;
      neighbouring intercostal nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this time, it is unclear whether cadaver injection studies showing dye spread to these&#xD;
      anatomical spaces can fully explain the observed clinical neural blockade. Also a number of&#xD;
      cadaver studies show inconsistent and conflicting dye spread results, i.e., failure to reach&#xD;
      the thoracic paravertebral space. Although some suggest that an ESP block also provides&#xD;
      sympathetic blockade thus may provide visceral pain relief, no study has evaluated the&#xD;
      validity of such a claim or the extent of sympathetic blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms of action for an ESP block are currently unclear. Although most case reports&#xD;
      describe analgesic effects of ESP block for anterior chest and abdominal surgery presumably&#xD;
      as a result of blockade of the ventral rami of the spinal nerves in the thoracic&#xD;
      paravertebral spaces, it is more likely that local anesthetic injected in the ESP will&#xD;
      reliably anesthetize the dorsal rami traversing the erector spinae muscle in the back. This&#xD;
      is supported by preliminary clinical analgesic success of ESP block for thoracic spine&#xD;
      surgery and lumbar spine surgery. The consistency of blocking the ventral and dorsal rami&#xD;
      following an ESP block injection is unknown at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators' clinical experience further confirms that an ESP injection provides variable&#xD;
      analgesic results and an objective sign of sensory anesthesia to pinprick or ice is not&#xD;
      consistently evident. Currently no study has examined the optimal technique of ESP block&#xD;
      injection, peak blood local anesthetic level after injection, the effect of spine movement&#xD;
      (i.e., gliding movement of erector spinae muscle on the transverse processes) on neural&#xD;
      blockade, and the consistency of this block technique. Also, most case reports on surgical&#xD;
      patients did not report the onset, progression or resolution of ESP blockade or the extent of&#xD;
      sensory and sympathetic blockade. From a clinical perspective, it would be very helpful to&#xD;
      determine the extent and duration of clinical neural blockade following an ESP injection with&#xD;
      different local anesthetic doses and such detailed examination is possible only in a&#xD;
      carefully conducted volunteer study.&#xD;
