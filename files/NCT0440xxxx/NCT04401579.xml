  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ACTT-2 will evaluate the combination of baricitinib and remdesivir compared to remdesivir&#xD;
      alone. Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are discharged&#xD;
      from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29. For discharged&#xD;
      subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain safety&#xD;
      laboratory tests and oropharyngeal (OP) swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary&#xD;
      research as well as clinical outcome data. However, infection control or other restrictions&#xD;
      may limit the ability of the subject to return to the clinic. In this case, these visits may&#xD;
      be conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not&#xD;
      have laboratory tests or collection of samples and is conducted by phone. The primary outcome&#xD;
      is time to recovery by Day 29.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an adaptive randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with&#xD;
      COVID-19. The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 100&#xD;
      sites globally. The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a&#xD;
      control arm. New arms can be introduced according to scientific and public health needs.&#xD;
      There will be interim monitoring to allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety.&#xD;
      If one therapy proves to be efficacious, then this treatment may become the control arm for&#xD;
      comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s). Any such change would be accompanied by an&#xD;
      updated sample size. This adaptive platform is used to rapidly evaluate different&#xD;
      therapeutics in a population of those hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19. The&#xD;
      platform will provide a common framework sharing a similar population, design, endpoints, and&#xD;
      safety oversight. New stages with new therapeutics can be introduced. One independent Data&#xD;
      and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data in all stages to make&#xD;
      recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTT-2 will evaluate the combination of baricitinib and remdesivir compared to remdesivir&#xD;
      alone. Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are discharged&#xD;
      from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29. For discharged&#xD;
      subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain safety&#xD;
      laboratory tests and oropharyngeal (OP) swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary&#xD;
      research as well as clinical outcome data. However, infection control or other restrictions&#xD;
      may limit the ability of the subject to return to the clinic. In this case, these visits may&#xD;
      be conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not&#xD;
      have laboratory tests or collection of samples and is conducted by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. Safety&#xD;
      laboratory tests and blood (serum and plasma) research samples and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs&#xD;
      will be obtained on Days 1 (prior to infusion) and Days 3, 5, 8, and 11 (while hospitalized).&#xD;
      OP swabs and blood (serum only) plus safety laboratory tests will be collected on Day 15 and&#xD;
      29 (if the subject attends an in-person visit or are still hospitalized).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is time to recovery by Day 29. A key secondary outcome evaluates&#xD;
      treatment-related improvements in the 8-point ordinal scale at Day 15. Each stage may&#xD;
      prioritize different secondary endpoints for the purpose of multiple comparison analyses.&#xD;

        <description>The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given study day. The scale is as follows: 8) Death; 7) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 6) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 5) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 4) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 3) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care; 2) Not hospitalized, limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen; 1) Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities. A positive change indicates a worsening and a negative change is an improvement.</description>

          <description>The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given study day. The scale is as follows: 8) Death; 7) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 6) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 5) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 4) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 3) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care; 2) Not hospitalized, limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen; 1) Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities. Data was imputed using last observation carried forward or worst possible score based on hospitalization status (2 if not hospitalized, 7 if hospitalized) when there was a change in hospitalization status since last score. Deaths were imputed as an 8.</description>

        <description>The NEW score has demonstrated an ability to discriminate patients at risk of poor outcomes. This score is based on 7 clinical parameters (respiration rate, oxygen saturation, any supplemental oxygen, temperature, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, level of consciousness). The NEW Score is being used as an efficacy measure. The minimum score is 0, representing the better outcome, and the maximum value is 19, representing the worse outcome. The time to discharge or a NEWS of less than or equal to 2 was determined for each participant.</description>

      <time_frame>Serious and Grade 3 and 4 non-serious adverse events were collected for 29 days after the first dose. Laboratory values were systematically assessed at Days 1, 3, 5, 8, and 11 while participants were inpatient, and at Days 15 and 29. Treatment emergent and fatal AEs are reported.</time_frame>
      <desc>Given the severity of underlying illness, participants were expected to have many symptoms and abnormalities in vital signs and laboratory values. All Grade 3 and 4 AEs were captured as AEs in this trial. Grade 2 or higher, suspected drug-related hypersensitivity reaction or deep vein thrombosis of any grade was reported as an AE in this trial. All cause mortality was calculated for the ITT population, while SAEs and AEs reflect the as treated population.</desc>
