  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to evaluate if an online fatigue intervention program will&#xD;
      decrease fatigue, pain and increase confidence managing fatigue and being able to do daily&#xD;
      tasks. This study involves competing a series of questionnaires before and after the&#xD;
      intervention , and attending and participating in the online videoconference fatigue program&#xD;
      for 1 1/2 hour meetings each week over a 6-week period of time.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If eligible and give consent, participants will be asked to complete 2 online questionnaires.&#xD;
      The first questionnaire asks basic information such as your age, gender, educational level,&#xD;
      and amount of time diagnosed with systemic sclerosis. The second questionnaire asks about&#xD;
      your disease symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also be asked to complete questionnaires about your fatigue, pain, mood, confidence&#xD;
      in managing your disease and performing daily tasks, and knowledge and use of energy saving&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you compete the questionnaires, you will be asked to compete a survey about times and&#xD;
      days you would be available to attend the online videoconference fatigue program meeting over&#xD;
      a 6 week period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the time and dates for the fatigue program are scheduled, you will be expected to attend&#xD;
      and take part (using visual and audio) in each 1 Â½ hour meeting for 6 weeks online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fatigue program includes information on causes of fatigue, ways to protect joint and save&#xD;
      energy, ways to manage stress, pain, good eating habits, and exercise. Outside of meetings,&#xD;
      you will also be expected to do any &quot;homework&quot; assignments in between the group meetings such&#xD;
      as setting goals and doing activities to reach your goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 6 weeks, you will be asked to complete the same questionnaires you did at&#xD;
      the beginning of the study regarding, fatigue, pain, and ability to perform daily tasks. You&#xD;
      will also be asked to complete an evaluation of the course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 months later, you will be asked to take part in a 45 minute telephone interview to talk&#xD;
      about your fatigue and how you are using the ideas from the program.&#xD;
