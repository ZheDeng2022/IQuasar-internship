  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to better understand how blood flow and metabolism&#xD;
      change can influence brain development in the early decades of life. SCA participants and&#xD;
      healthy controls are age and sex-matched for comparison. Within the SCA cohort, children with&#xD;
      infarcts may have thinner cortices than those without, reflecting a greater loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will examine brain blood flow and metabolism using magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI). The brain's blood vessels expand and constrict to regulate blood flow based on&#xD;
      the brain's needs. The amount of expanding and contracting the blood vessels may vary by age.&#xD;
      The brain's blood flow changes in small ways during everyday activities, such exercise, deep&#xD;
      concentration, or normal brain growth. Significant illness or psychological stress may&#xD;
      increase the brain's metabolic demand or cause other bigger changes in blood flow. If blood&#xD;
      vessels are not able to expand to give more blood flow when metabolic demand is high, the&#xD;
      brain may not get all of the oxygen it needs. In extreme circumstances, if the brain is&#xD;
      unable to get enough oxygen for a long time, a stroke may occur. Sometimes small strokes&#xD;
      occur without other noticeable changes and are only detectable on an MRI. These are sometimes&#xD;
      called &quot;silent strokes.&quot; In less extreme circumstances, not having a full oxygen supply may&#xD;
      cause the brain to grow and develop more slowly than when it has a full supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One way to test the ability of blood vessels to expand is by measuring blood flow while&#xD;
      breathing in carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide causes blood vessels in the brain to dilate&#xD;
      without increasing brain metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study participants may be asked to undergo a blood draw, MRI, cognitive&#xD;
      assessments, and brief questionnaires. The study team will use a special mask to control the&#xD;
      amount of carbon dioxide the participants breathe in.&#xD;
