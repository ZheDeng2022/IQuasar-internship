      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 virus infection differs among people. Some people have no or mild symptoms. For&#xD;
      others, COVID-19 is life threatening and causes damage to the body s organs. Researchers want&#xD;
      to better understand the virus to learn how to kill it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand how the COVID-19 virus causes wide differences in how sick one can become from&#xD;
      the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18-80 with COVID-19 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who enter the study at the beginning of their COVID-19 infection will stay in&#xD;
      the hospital until they are healthy enough to go home. Those who enter after they have&#xD;
      recovered may need to stay in the hospital 1-2 nights to perform the study tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have MRI and CT scans of the brain, heart, and lungs. They will lie in a&#xD;
      machine that takes pictures of the body. For the MRI, soft padding or a coil will be placed&#xD;
      around their head and chest. They may receive a dye injected into a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an ultrasound of the kidneys and heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide blood and urine samples. They will provide nasal swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a bronchoscopy. A thin tube will be placed through the nose or mouth&#xD;
      into the airway. Saltwater will be squirted into the lungs and removed by suction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may provide a spinal fluid sample. A needle injected into the spinal canal will&#xD;
      obtain fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have lung and heart function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At various points after recovery, participants will repeat many of these tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is little sequential, methodically collected data on patients with COVID-19 that can be&#xD;
      correlated with the severity of disease or the long-term sequelae. Such information is&#xD;
      necessary to understand how to most logically intervene with directly acting antiviral agents&#xD;
      and immunologic response modifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variability of the clinical course of patients who may be asymptomatic throughout their&#xD;
      clinical course to those patients who develop progressive multisystem organ failure&#xD;
      represents a challenge to understand the host and viral factors that result in these&#xD;
      dramatically different outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will enroll patients to the Clinical Center in a longitudinal study using&#xD;
      granular clinical, laboratory, and imaging data including extensive pulmonary and cardiac&#xD;
      functional assessments, neurologic evaluation, comprehensive immunologic evaluations, and&#xD;
      innovative imaging. In patients with COVID-19 infection, linking sequential analysis of&#xD;
      blood, urine and bronchoalveolar lavage with simultaneous cardiopulmonary imaging can provide&#xD;
      novel insights into mechanisms associated with the initiation, progression and resolution of&#xD;
      lung, cardiac and systemic inflammation. These mechanisms are presumed to be essential in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis and survival from this infection. This information will help guide diagnostic&#xD;
      and therapeutic innovation and assess long-term consequences of this infection.&#xD;

        Subjects 18-80 years old, male or female will be enrolled within 1 - 28 days of documented&#xD;
        COVID-19 infection for acute care OR during recovery and convalescent phase of the acute&#xD;
        illness (day 28 and beyond) if care has been received at a facility outside of NIH.&#xD;
        Subjects will be from the DMV metropolitan area.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects within 1-28 days of documented COVID-19 infection for acute care:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the&#xD;
             duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, aged 18 to 80 years&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Only a minority of children and adolescents have been described as developing&#xD;
                  serious illness with COVID-19 infection. As such, this is not an age group at&#xD;
                  significant risk from complications due to this infection. Adults older than 80&#xD;
                  years of age represent a group with the greatest risk of mortality from COVID-19&#xD;
                  infection. The presence of significant co-morbidities requiring care that cannot&#xD;
                  be&#xD;
&#xD;
        provided at the CC would present a disadvantage to them to have their acute care provided&#xD;
        for in the CC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documentation of positive SARSCoV-19 test by nucleic acid detection (COVID-19&#xD;
             infection , RT-PCR)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects during recovery phase of the acute illness (day 28 +/- 7 days to 12 weeks) and&#xD;
        convalescent phase (Week 13 up to 12 months after recovery if care has been received at a&#xD;
        facility outside of NIH:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Male or female, aged 18 to 80 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation&#xD;
        in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious mental illness (e.g. schizophrenia, manic depression) that would limit the&#xD;
             ability of the participant to participate willingly into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -- The conduct of the study requires participation in studies that may be unduly&#xD;
             stressful (e.g. MRI, bronchoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe claustrophobia that would prohibit the conduct of imaging by MRI even if&#xD;
             sedation is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac pacemaker or implantable defibrillator unless it is safe for MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cerebral aneurysm clip unless it is safe for MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Brain stimulator (e.g. TENS-Unit) unless it is safe for MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any type of ear implant unless it is safe for MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Foreign body in the eye (e.g. metal shavings)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metal shrapnel or bullet&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any implanted device (e.g. insulin pump, drug infusion device&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring mechanical ventilation at an outside hospital prior to transfer.&#xD;
             Transporting these patients adds risk to their care.&#xD;
