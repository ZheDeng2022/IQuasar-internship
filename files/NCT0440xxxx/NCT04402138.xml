  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study to evaluate efficacy of Acalabrutinib as a maintenance therapy&#xD;
      following blood or marrow transplant (BMT) in patients who have been diagnosed with mantle&#xD;
      cell lymphoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is one of approximately 100 different types of non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphoma (NHL). Due to the aggressive and heterogeneous nature of MCL, majority of patients&#xD;
      are diagnosed with advanced stage disease that requires immediate, diverse and aggressive&#xD;
      courses of therapy to improve the outcome of the disease. The addition of blood or bone&#xD;
      marrow transplantation (BMT) to the chemotherapy regimens is a critical factor to prolong&#xD;
      duration of response in patients, however, the benefit of combination chemotherapy followed&#xD;
      by BMT is often temporary as patients experience disease progression and mortality and this&#xD;
      underscores the need for novel therapies as well as additional maintenance therapy strategies&#xD;
      to prevent relapse post-BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acalabrutinib, a selective, irreversible small molecule inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      (BTK) is approved for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least 1&#xD;
      prior therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single arm, multi-center, phase 2 study of subjects who will receive&#xD;
      acalabrutinib as maintenance therapy post-BMT. Subjects will undergo a standard of care BMT&#xD;
      with conditioning regimen determined by the treating physician per institutional&#xD;
      guidelines.The BMT is not considered part of this study. Following completion of the BMT,&#xD;
      Maintenance therapy with acalabrutinib will begin on Day 100 in 28-day cycles. Subjects will&#xD;
      self-administer 100 mg acalabrutinib BID until they reach 2 years post-BMT (approximately 22&#xD;
      cycles).Subjects will be followed for up to 5 years post-BMT for Progression Free Survival.&#xD;

For small lymph nodes measuring &lt;15 mm post therapy, a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm and the longest diameter should exceed 15mm.&#xD;
