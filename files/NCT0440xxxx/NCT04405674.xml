    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-label, multicenter, single-arm, prospective clinical study designed&#xD;
      to investigate the efficacy and safety of Tislelizumab (anti-PD1 antibody) combined with&#xD;
      carboplatin plus Nab-paclitaxel in Non-squamous NSCLC patients with EGFR sensitizing mutation&#xD;
      who failed EGFR TKI therapy. The primary endpoint of the study is measured by 1-year PFS rate&#xD;
      in efficacy analysis population.&#xD;
