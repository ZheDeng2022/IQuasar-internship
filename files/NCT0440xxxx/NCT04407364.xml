  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective enrollment study is to collect data confirming safety,&#xD;
      performance and clinical benefits of the CoMatryx Surgical Collagen powder at a minimum&#xD;
      1-year follow-up and compare it to a historical control group who did not receive the product&#xD;
      at the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to confirm safety and clinical benefits of the product. This will be&#xD;
      assessed by recording the rate of wound healing and incidence and frequency of wound care&#xD;
      related complications. Relationship of complications to the product should be specified.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CoMatryx Surgical Collagen powder is a soft tissue repair product made of 100% Type I&#xD;
      Bovine collagen. It is non-hydrolyzed and not cross-linked chemically. It is biocompatible,&#xD;
      biodegradable and free of synthetics. The product does not have any specific storage&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CoMatryx Surgical Collagen powder provides a physiologically favorable environment to&#xD;
      promote healing at the wound site. When administered, the powder conforms to the wound site&#xD;
      and forms a gelatinous occlusive barrier. Along with providing 19 amino acids directly to the&#xD;
      wound site it also occludes live nerve endings reducing pain. Treating the wound with the&#xD;
      CoMatryx Surgical Collagen powder provides the non-hydrolyzed collagen wound surface&#xD;
      promoting autolytic debridement. The powder is effective in all phases of wound healing and&#xD;
      can be delivered with antibiotics in areas where there may be a cavity. This product has FDA&#xD;
      510(k) clearance for surgical wounds, full thickness wounds, traumatic wounds and skin tears.&#xD;
