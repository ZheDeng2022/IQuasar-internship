  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of instructional technical surgical videos is common in orthopaedic education. Many&#xD;
      residents have used instructional technical surgical training videos prior to medical school,&#xD;
      as well as during their residency program, and at instructional courses. The use of&#xD;
      instructional technical surgical videos and multimedia is considered an adjunctive training&#xD;
      method for orthopaedic residents to learn operative procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immersive virtual reality (iVR) is increasingly used in surgical education. Recently, iVR has&#xD;
      shown transfer of skill training in orthopaedics. The continued study of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      iVR training in orthopaedic education could benefit new competency based orthopaedics&#xD;
      residency programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of instructional technical surgical&#xD;
      video training to immersive iVR training for teaching technical skills of reverse total&#xD;
      shoulder arthroplasty. Our hypothesis was that iVR improved learning effectiveness compared&#xD;
      to standard technical surgical video. Secondary objectives include validating a virtual&#xD;
      reality ratings scale through correlation to real-world performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We proposed a randomized, blinded intervention-control trial directly comparing immersive iVR&#xD;
      versus technical surgical instructional video training in the teaching of reverse shoulder&#xD;
      arthroplasty in senior residents, learning at the 2020 annual Canadian Shoulder and Elbow&#xD;
      Society meeting.&#xD;

      Immersive virtual reality (iVR) is increasingly used in surgical education. Recently, iVR has&#xD;
      shown transfer of skill training in orthopaedics. The continued study of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      iVR training in orthopaedic education could benefit new competency based orthopaedics&#xD;

&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of instructional technical surgical&#xD;
      video training to immersive iVR training for teaching technical skills of reverse total&#xD;
      shoulder arthroplasty. Our hypothesis was that iVR improved learning effectiveness compared&#xD;
      to standard technical surgical video. Secondary objectives include validating a virtual&#xD;
      reality ratings scale through correlation to real-world performance, and to determine&#xD;
      efficiency of learning in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, technical surgical instructional videos are pervasive in orthopaedic teaching&#xD;
      education. Immersive VR, another form of teaching, is increasingly being used in surgical&#xD;
      education. The production of an immersive VR suite with tactile and user metric feedback may&#xD;
      be an advance over current bench top simulator technology, allowing for greater immersion and&#xD;
      interaction, leading to better understanding of surgical planning and implementation. The&#xD;
      development of this technology could provide trainees with immersive levels of training not&#xD;
      previously seen, with improved learning of technical skills over media such as manufacturer&#xD;
      technical documents. The effectiveness of training and efficiency of training of the novel&#xD;
      immersive VR training systems need to be evaluated as they are increasingly incorporated into&#xD;
      competency based, contemporary residency education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We proposed a randomized, blinded intervention-control trial directly comparing immersive iVR&#xD;
      versus technical surgical instructional video training in the teaching of reverse shoulder&#xD;
      arthroplasty in senior (fourth and fifth year) residents, learning at the 2020 annual&#xD;
      Canadian Shoulder and Elbow Society meeting.&#xD;

    <description>The Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) outcome measure is a validated assessment tool used for grading overall technical ability during surgery. This checklist contains 27 items, in which an assessor will mark off whether the task was completed successfully or not. For each item done correctly, it is worth 1 point. For each item done incorrectly, no point is awarded. All points are totalled for a maximum possible score of 27 points (minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 27). A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Ratings Scale (GRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>During surgery up until immediately after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Ratings Scale (GRS) is a validated assessment tool used for grading operative performance. The GRS contains 7 categories: respect for tissue, time and motion, instrument handling, knowledge of instruments, flow of operation, use of assistants, and knowledge of specific procedure. Each category is graded using a 5-point Likert type scale, a higher number indicates a better outcome, with a maximum of 5 points per category. Each categorical score is totalled for a maximum overall score of 35 points (minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 35). A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Transfer of Training (ToT)</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Transfer of Training (ToT) outcome informs how much skill is gained in the iVR group compared to the control performance. This is measured using an equation. ToT equals the average time to complete surgical procedure (for those in instructional video group) minus the average time to complete the surgical procedure (for those in the iVR training group), divided by the average time to complete surgical procedure (for those in instructional video group). The outcome is presented as a cumulative ratio, and a numerical value is provided. A higher number indicates a better outcome. For the purpose of this project, there is not a spread of data for a single instance of training as we did not complete multiple repetitions, otherwise we would have incremental values for each.</description>

    <description>Transfer Effectiveness Ratio (TER) outcomes informs on the skill comparison relative to the control, on real world training reduction times. TER equals the average time to complete surgical procedure (for those in instructional video group) minus the average time to complete the surgical procedure (for those in the iVR training group), divided by the average time to complete the iVR training. The outcome is presented as a cumulative ratio, and a numerical value is provided. A higher number, indicates a better outcome.

        <description>Transfer of Training (ToT) outcome informs how much skill is gained in the iVR group compared to the control performance. This is measured using an equation. ToT equals the average time to complete surgical procedure (for those in instructional video group) minus the average time to complete the surgical procedure (for those in the iVR training group), divided by the average time to complete surgical procedure (for those in instructional video group). The outcome is presented as a cumulative ratio, and a numerical value is provided. A higher number indicates a better outcome. For the purpose of this project, there is not a spread of data for a single instance of training as we did not complete multiple repetitions, otherwise we would have incremental values for each.</description>

Therefore, the single numerical value of ToT is 0.594 or 59.4%.
