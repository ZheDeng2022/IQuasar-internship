  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to examine the feasibility and acceptability of an online, two arm&#xD;
      intervention ([self-compassion intervention + ideal care] versus [health information + ideal&#xD;
      care]) designed to increase physical activity among individuals at risk of type two diabetes.&#xD;
      The aim of the self-compassion intervention is to teach people at risk of type two diabetes&#xD;
      how to use self-compassion (orientation to care for oneself during difficult situations) in&#xD;
      order to help them self-manage and increase their physical activity. In a group, online&#xD;
      format people at risk for type 2 diabetes will learn about their type 2 diabetes risk and&#xD;
      strategies to increase their physical activity, which represents the recommended information&#xD;
      that people at risk for type two diabetes should receive (i.e. ideal care). In addition to&#xD;
      this, some participants, but not all, will be taught to be self-compassionate in relation to&#xD;
      their type two diabetes risk and their efforts to increase their physical activity (i.e.&#xD;
      intervention group). The other participants (i.e. control group) will instead receive general&#xD;
      health information in addition to ideal care. Feasibility outcomes will be assessed using&#xD;
      Thabane and colleagues (2010) model including the study's process, resources, management and&#xD;
      scientific outcomes. In addition, qualitative exit-interviews with participants and research&#xD;
      personnel will be conducted to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention.&#xD;
      Lastly, investigators will explore whether the intervention leads to changes from pre- to&#xD;
      post-intervention in the secondary outcomes. This study is important as it will help inform&#xD;
      and ensure the larger efficacy trial is of high quality.&#xD;

      The primary research objective of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      an online, two arm ([self-compassion intervention + ideal care] versus [health information +&#xD;
      ideal care]) intervention designed to increase physical activity among individuals at risk&#xD;
      for type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary research question: Is an online, two-arm intervention ([self-compassion intervention&#xD;
      + ideal care] versus [health information + ideal care]) focused on increasing physical&#xD;
      activity levels among individuals at risk of type two diabetes feasible using Thabane and&#xD;
      colleagues model of feasibility (2010)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research question: Is an online, two-arm intervention ([self-compassion&#xD;
      intervention + ideal care] versus [health information + ideal care]) focused on increasing&#xD;
      physical activity levels among individuals at risk of type two diabetes acceptable to both&#xD;
      participants and research personnel?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary research objective is to explore whether an online, two-arm intervention&#xD;
      ([self-compassion intervention + ideal care] versus [health information + ideal care])&#xD;
      focused on increasing physical activity levels among individuals at risk of type two diabetes&#xD;
      leads to changes from pre- to post-intervention in self-compassion, physical activity levels,&#xD;
      nutrition, self-regulatory skill use, experience of exercise barriers, personal growth&#xD;
      initiative, negative affect, and engagement in other health behaviours (e.g. stress&#xD;
      management).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot and feasibility study is a single centre, randomized, active controlled, six week&#xD;
      intervention with baseline and follow-up assessment at intervention-end, 6- and 12-weeks&#xD;
      post-intervention. It follows a quantitative-dominant, mixed-methods design. They will&#xD;
      supplement this trial with interviews after follow-up testing with participants and study&#xD;
      personnel. These interviews will provide feasibility and acceptability information.&#xD;

Session 3: Action-Coping Planning and Monitoring Physical Activity Session 4: Goal re-visitation and adjustment and building self-efficacy. Session 5: Physical Activity Enjoyment and Barriers/Solutions. Session 6: Relapse prevention and commitment to exercise. The last 30 minutes of sessions 2-6, control participants will receive 30-minutes of non-self-compassion or physical activity related health education (i.e., sleep, screen time, antibiotic use, oral health, osteoporosis and vitamin D).</description>

    <description>Session 1: Participants will meet individually with a research assistant to discuss their type 2 risk and discuss benefits of engaging in 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week. First 30 minutes of each subsequent session will be ideal care (as described above in the control group). Last 30 minutes of sessions 2-6, self-compassion condition participants will learn to apply self-compassion to their prediabetes experience and physical activity. Session 2: Learn about fear of self-compassion and the benefits of self-compassion. Session 3: Yin and Yang of self-compassion. Session 4: Mindfulness. Session 5: Dealing with difficult emotions, loving Kindness and Self-Compassionate motivation. Session 6: Living deeply, self-appreciation and stages of progress.</description>
