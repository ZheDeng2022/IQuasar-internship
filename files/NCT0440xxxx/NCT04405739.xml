        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has COVID-19 disease, defined by having one or more of the following new symptoms and&#xD;
             signs (within 7 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fevers OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least one of the following symptoms: cough, shortness of breath, respiratory&#xD;
                  rate ≥ 20, radiographic evidence of pneumonia OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Anosmia OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  other clinical symptoms or signs of COVID-19 that are not otherwise explained by&#xD;
                  comorbidities or co-diagnoses&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. PCR+ test for SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has new signs or symptoms of COVID-19 that began ≤7 days of anticipated first dose of&#xD;
             study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Persons ≥18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Is admitted and is anticipated to remain in the hospital for ≥ 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Is willing and able to comply with all study procedures including providing informed&#xD;
             consent, collection of virology samples, and any safety tests that are not included as&#xD;
             part of standard of care (SOC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Is willing and able to take oral medications, and is anticipated to be able to take&#xD;
             the full course of 5 days of study agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Pregnancy and Contraception: Treatment with EIDD-2801 is contraindicated in women who&#xD;
             are pregnant or nursing and in the male partners of women who are pregnant. Extreme&#xD;
             care must be taken to avoid pregnancy during the study and for 4 days after completion&#xD;
             of EIDD 2801 dosing in female participants and for 4 days after completion of&#xD;
             EIDD-2801 dosing in female partners of male participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or&#xD;
             breastfeeding and at least one of the following conditions applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (a low user&#xD;
                  dependency method OR a user-dependent method in combination with a barrier&#xD;
                  method), or be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and&#xD;
                  usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long-term and persistent basis), as described in&#xD;
                  Appendix 2 during the intervention period and for at least 4 days after the last&#xD;
                  dose of study intervention. The investigator should evaluate the potential for&#xD;
                  contraceptive method failure (ie, noncompliance, recently initiated) in&#xD;
                  relationship to the first dose of study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test (serum test is&#xD;
                  required) within 24 hours before the first dose of study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history,&#xD;
                  and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an&#xD;
                  early undetected pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Contraceptive use by women should be consistent with local regulations regarding&#xD;
                  the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Given the elevated risk of venous thrombotic events in patients hospitalized with&#xD;
                  COVID 19 (Benson et al 2020; Spratt et al 2020), estrogen-containing&#xD;
                  contraceptives must not be started to fulfill the contraceptive requirement of&#xD;
                  this study at any time during participant's hospitalization. If contraceptives&#xD;
                  are interrupted as standard of care management of COVID-19 patients and resumed&#xD;
                  at a later time point, such as at hospital discharge, then abstinence must be&#xD;
                  practiced for the defined period of back-up contraception per the contraceptive&#xD;
                  product labeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during&#xD;
             the intervention period and for at least 4 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
                  (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must agree to use contraception unless confirmed to be azoospermic (vasectomized&#xD;
                  or secondary to medical cause) as detailed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Agree to use a male condom plus partner use of an additional contraceptive method when&#xD;
        having penile-vaginal intercourse with a WOCBP who is not currently pregnant. Note: Men&#xD;
        with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from penile-vaginal&#xD;
        intercourse or use a male condom during each episode of penile-vaginal penetration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Contraceptive use by men should be consistent with local regulations regarding the&#xD;
        methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies&#xD;
&#xD;
