    <textblock>
      Blood that can be detected in stool via faecal immunochemical testing is a recognised risk&#xD;
      factor for the presence of colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of point of care faecal immunochemical testing devices available. This&#xD;
      study is to trial one of these machines into the clinical setting to see if the results are&#xD;
      safe and accurate as a 'rule out' test for colorectal cancer. We will be investigating&#xD;
      patients that present with symptoms or anaemia to their GP and are referred on the two-week&#xD;
      rule pathway to our hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has also been advocated that digital rectal examination (which is part of the routine&#xD;
      assessment for a patient presenting to colorectal clinic) provides an opportunity to use a&#xD;
      small sample of stool from a gloved finger to perform faecal immunochemical testing. We will&#xD;
      be comparing a patient provided sample with a DRE sample on a standard laboratory-based&#xD;
      machine.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demand for early diagnosis of bowel cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the United Kingdom, there are an estimated 41,700 new cases of bowel cancer diagnosed each&#xD;
      year and it is the fourth most common cancer. Over 90% of patients that are diagnosed with&#xD;
      the earliest stage of bowel cancer will survive at least five years. In 2016 NHS England made&#xD;
      £200 million available to ensure we diagnose cancer earlier and faster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bowel cancer in symptomatic patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who present to their GPs that are anaemic or with symptoms of change in bowel habit,&#xD;
      rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, bloating or weight loss are often referred to a colorectal&#xD;
      clinic under the two-week rule (TWR) scheme. This is designed to enable patients to be seen&#xD;
      within two weeks from primary care referral by a specialist clinician to enable quicker&#xD;
      diagnosis of a cancer should it be present. Many of these patients will be referred by the&#xD;
      colorectal clinician to have a colonoscopy or other form of endoscopy as part of their&#xD;
      investigation and work up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has set out guidelines for&#xD;
      patients to be referred via the TWR, these are known as NG12 criteria. The number of patients&#xD;
      referred for this service is increasing nationally and this in turn is creating significant&#xD;
      burden on endoscopy services. In 2015, 1.7 million endoscopies cases were estimated for that&#xD;
      year across England and this is expected to increase to over 2.4 million per year by 2020. Of&#xD;
      the TWR colorectal referrals, only 3-4% will end up with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (CRC) and only 27% of all colorectal cancers are picked up from these referrals nationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient is on the pathway, not only do they have to be seen within two weeks, but also&#xD;
      a diagnosis must be made by 28 days. This leaves no realistic opportunity for any reasonable&#xD;
      form of watch and wait approach for those that a clinician may have a low suspicion of CRC or&#xD;
      other significant colorectal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy is currently seen as the gold standard for investigating symptomatic patients to&#xD;
      rule out bowel cancer. CT colonography is also widely used, yet both require bowel&#xD;
      preparation to be taken the day before. This is inconvenient for patients and can cause&#xD;
      dehydration and possible kidney injury to the frailer patients. In particular, colonoscopy is&#xD;
      unpleasant and can be painful. There is also a small risk of perforation (up to 1 in 500),&#xD;
      the consequences of which can be very serious. The cost of each diagnostic colonoscopy&#xD;
      procedure to the NHS is approximately £372.9&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Royal Surrey County Hospital (RSCH) has been particularly impacted by the increased&#xD;
      referrals of TWR patients to colorectal clinic. Recent analysis from our cancer database&#xD;
      shows that in the last financial year, we received 1414 referrals, of whom 51 patients were&#xD;
      found to have colorectal or anal cancer. The average for the years 2009-2015 was 709&#xD;
      referrals for 53 cancers per year. This shows that the number of referrals has doubled, yet&#xD;
      we do not pick up any extra cancers. Of these referrals it was noted that 80.6% were&#xD;
      primarily investigated by endoscopy, this has increased from 75% found in previous years. An&#xD;
      initial and less invasive &quot;rule out&quot; test with near instant results could enable a decision&#xD;
      to be made regarding triage and onward referral to endoscopy. Such a test with a high&#xD;
      sensitivity and high negative predictive value will safely reduce referrals to a more&#xD;
      manageable number without adverse risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Background to Faecal Immunochemical Testing (FIT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bowel Cancer and Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      For some in the UK there is an opportunity for 'bowel scope screening' via flexible&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy as a one-off test from the age of 55 to 60 depending on local availability.&#xD;
      Bowel cancer screening is uniformly available in the UK to all those aged 60-74.&#xD;
      Traditionally, a guaiac-based Faecal Occult Blood test (gFOBT) has been carried out, which&#xD;
      determines the presence of haemoglobin (Hb) in stool. A positive result warrants a&#xD;
      colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening is changing across the UK with the enrolment of Faecal Immunochemical Testing&#xD;
      (FIT). This is also a test from a stool sample, but offers a quantitative concentration&#xD;
      result as opposed to a qualitative positive/negative result. Concentration of haemoglobin in&#xD;
      stool has been showed to correlate with severity of colorectal neoplasia and other&#xD;
      significant colorectal disease (SCD) such as high risk adenomas and colitis. Unlike the&#xD;
      gFOBT, FIT is a more sensitive testing model and the quantitative cut off concentration can&#xD;
      be set to determine the number sent for colonoscopy according to resource availability and&#xD;
      likelihood of missing a cancer or SCD. It is only sensitive to human haemoglobin and&#xD;
      therefore it is not affected by diet. FIT also only requires one sample compared to two sets&#xD;
      of three that are required for gFOBT. It is therefore easier for the patient personally and&#xD;
      produces better compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of FIT in Symptomatic Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIT is a potential first line investigation for symptomatic patients as a &quot;rule out&quot; test,&#xD;
      thus reducing the demand for colonoscopy. The advantage of the quantitative result is that&#xD;
      the concentration (micrograms Hb/g faeces) has been shown to directly corelate with the&#xD;
      presence of significant colorectal disease including high risk adenomas and colitis, with&#xD;
      malignant neoplasia having the highest concentrations. In 2017, NICE published a diagnostic&#xD;
      guideline (DG30), which recommend the use of FIT for the detection of FOB in the NG12&#xD;
      criteria and a value of &gt;10micrograms Hb/g faeces is seen as positive and warrants further&#xD;
      investigation. There are many forms of FIT analysis, but only four laboratory-based machines&#xD;
      are endorsed in the criteria. This can act as guidance for patients under investigation in&#xD;
      primary care with symptoms. However, once a patient is referred on the TWR pathway, the NG12&#xD;
      criteria state that patients be referred for further investigation without further recourse&#xD;
      to FIT12. The majority of FIT studies relate to those amongst the screening population and so&#xD;
      the evidence cannot be used in symptomatic patients. There are 10 small studies pertaining to&#xD;
      FIT in the symptomatic regarding the DG30 guidance, these total approximately 8,000 patients.&#xD;
      Other larger national studies are currently underway that aim to address this issue as well&#xD;
      as encourage its use further in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems that FIT may be valuable for all referrals to the TWR colorectal pathway. However,&#xD;
      the NG12 criteria also includes patients that may not have symptoms as it also incorporates&#xD;
      patients that are shown to be anaemic with or without iron deficiency. Patients that do not&#xD;
      have a recognised cause of anaemia come on to the pathway as the low serum Hb could be&#xD;
      related to a tumour that is bleeding in a subclinical fashion, particularly if the tumour is&#xD;
      on the right side of the colon. Extra caution for use of FIT should be given to these&#xD;
      patients as blood in the stool from the right side of the colon is older and the haemoglobin&#xD;
      may have been subjected to degradation and therefore not detectable using FIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Opportunity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Point of Care FIT&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIT has been developed as a point of care (POC) investigation by a number of manufacturers&#xD;
      and test kits are readily available for use by purchase online or over the counter. Some are&#xD;
      designed for home use and some for professional use in a clinical setting. Home FIT kits only&#xD;
      offer a qualitative result, which avoids the delay and cost of a laboratory test, however&#xD;
      generally have a higher cut off concentration than 10micrograms Hb/g faeces for positive or&#xD;
      negative and are also open to user interpretation errors. The cost ranges from £2.50 to&#xD;
      £34.99 (median £4.09), which is competitive with the average £9.42 for a laboratory-based&#xD;
      FIT. The POC professional kits differ, with some offering qualitative results and some work&#xD;
      to give a quantitative result via a portable machine or even mobile phone app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identified Requirement&#xD;
&#xD;
      An instant quantitative result in the clinical setting has the potential advantage over the&#xD;
      laboratory test in terms of triaging and referring patients for ongoing investigations&#xD;
      immediately. This is because the decision can be made in the one clinic setting rather than&#xD;
      the extra step of waiting a few days for the laboratory-based result to be determined.&#xD;
      Consequently, it is those machines that are designed for POC professional use that we are&#xD;
      interested in taking forward into trial. However, there is no scientific study that has been&#xD;
      done on these test kits to prove that they are accurate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The POC FIT kits that are designed for professional use do not all detect the very low&#xD;
      haemoglobin concentrations that the laboratory-based machines can pick up, but the&#xD;
      manufacturers do report the ability to pick up positive results as low as 10microgram Hb/g.&#xD;
      This would be useful for primary care practitioners as that is in keeping with the DG30&#xD;
      guidance. Many of the available POC FIT kits have a &quot;Conformite Europeene&quot; (CE) approval but&#xD;
      have not had Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other approval. The potential for harm is&#xD;
      high if either an inaccurate reading falsely indicates a high faecal Hb resulting in an&#xD;
      unnecessary colonoscopy, or more seriously a false negative result reassures the patient and&#xD;
      clinician that they do not have CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Southern Bowel Cancer Screening Hub (that is affiliated with RSCH) uses all the&#xD;
      laboratory-based machines that are recognised by NICE for FIT from the DG30 update and they&#xD;
      are internationally validated. The Hub has identified the need to assess the professional use&#xD;
      POC FIT kits against the standard set of baselines used by the laboratory machines. This will&#xD;
      help determine key criteria such as accuracy, effectiveness and safety for their use in the&#xD;
      decision-making process for onward investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol describes a study for a POC FIT machine that aligns with key criteria set out&#xD;
      by the Hub for use in the TWR colorectal clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital Rectal Examination Sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although FIT only requires a single sample, we recognise that not all patients will comply&#xD;
      with being able to perform this at home. It has been advocated that the digital rectal&#xD;
      examination (DRE), which is part of routine assessment in the TWR clinic provides enough&#xD;
      stool on the glove to wipe on to a sample stick. It would therefore be useful to assess which&#xD;
      of the two sampling methods provide the best compliance and most accurate results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The referral rate to the TWR clinic via NG12 guidelines is dramatically increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This has not only increased our patients that are needed to be seen in clinic, but also&#xD;
           had a large effect on our endoscopy burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If proven to be of value in secondary care clinic, then these results will be&#xD;
           transferable to the primary care clinic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study needs to be performed in secondary care to obtain the colonoscopy result for&#xD;
           comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The NG12 criteria for these patients once referred into secondary care does not&#xD;
           currently advocate occult blood testing as an investigative tool due to lack of&#xD;
           evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  POC testing over laboratory testing offers a one-stop investigation that can give the&#xD;
           clinician an instant result to help make a decision in the clinic regarding need for&#xD;
           endoscopic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A close correlation between POC FIT tests and endoscopy results for CRC will add to the&#xD;
           body of evidence regarding FIT as a triage and referral tool in symptomatic patients for&#xD;
           primary and secondary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This will be safer and more convenient for patients in terms of reducing the need for&#xD;
           endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The burden on NHS funding and resources will be significantly reduced if the demand for&#xD;
           clinic time and colonoscopy is reduced.&#xD;
