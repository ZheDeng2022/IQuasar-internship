      The aim of the present study is to evaluate Clinical &amp; radiographic evaluation of split-crest&#xD;

      alveolar Ridge.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to evaluate ridge width gain in patients with narrow alveolar ridges&#xD;
      followingc osseodensification as compared to ridge splitting with simultaneous implant&#xD;
      placement using CBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: I. Pre-operative phase: Clinical Examination: 1. Visual examination, palpation&#xD;
      and inspection of the entire oral and Para-oral tissues. 2. Preoperative alginate impressions&#xD;
      for both the maxillary and the mandibular Ridges. 3. Full mouth scaling and root planing,&#xD;
      followed by oral hygiene instructions. 4. The Bucco-Lingual/Palatal alveolar ridge width&#xD;
      measurement at site of interest using a bone caliper. 5. Study casts will be made in order to&#xD;
      properly evaluate the inter-arch space, occlusion type and direction of forces in regard to&#xD;
      the site of the future implant. Radiographic Examination: 1. A panoramic radiograph for&#xD;
      screening purposes: - estimating the residual bone height. - Verify the absence of any&#xD;
      pathology in the bone. 2. Cone beam computed Tomography (CBCT) for Diagnostic purposes: -&#xD;
      Detect the Bucco-lingual/palatal alveolar ridge width and height at the site of interest. -&#xD;
      Detect approximation to any anatomical boundaries (e.g.mental foramen, maxillary sinus&#xD;
      floor.) -Detect bone type. II. Surgical phase: All procedures will be done under strictly&#xD;
      aseptic conditions 1. Patients will be anesthetized at the surgical site by the appropriate&#xD;
      method using Articaine Hydrochloride 4%. 2. At the site a horizontal incision will be&#xD;
      created, extending the entire length of the edentulous area, extending one tooth mesial and&#xD;
      distal. Anterior and/or posterior vertical releasing incision will be made as needed. 3. Full&#xD;
      thickness mucoperiosteal ~ap will be raised with complete exposure of the alveolar bone. 4.&#xD;
      Bone width will be recon}rmed intrasurgically using a bone caliper. Measurements will be&#xD;
      taken at around 1 mm below the crestal margin, to the nearest 0.5mm. Alveolar ridge width&#xD;
      measurements will be repeated at second stage surgery. 5. A.For the intervention: 1. Drilling&#xD;
      f bone will commence using the Pilot Drill to the desired depth (Drill speed 800-1500 rpm&#xD;
      with copious irrigation). 2. Osseodensification drilling will begin with the narrowest Densah&#xD;
      Bur. (Counterclockwise drill speed 800-1500 rpm with copious irrigation). If when running the&#xD;
      bur into the osteotomy a feeling of haptic feedback of pushing up and out of the osteotomy,&#xD;
      repetitively lifting off and reapplying pressure with a pumping motion will be applied until&#xD;
      the desired depth is reached. 3. Densah Burs will be used sequentially in small increments.&#xD;
      As the bur diameter increases, the bone will slowly expand to the final diameter. 4. The&#xD;
      osteotomy final preparation diameter would be an average diameter that measures 0.5-0.8 mm&#xD;
      smaller than the implant average diameter in soft bone, and In hard bone, diameter that&#xD;
      measures 0.2-0.5 mm smaller than the implant average diameter. 5. Implant placement using the&#xD;
      drill motor initially, then Finishing placement of the implant to depth with a&#xD;
      torque-indicating wrench. 6. If &lt; 1mm of buccal bone thickness has resulted after&#xD;
      osseodensification, bone grafting post implant placement and complete implant coverage will&#xD;
      be considered 5.B.For the control: 1. A bone crestal incision will be created, using the&#xD;
      piezo-electric surgical tips. The cut will be done through the cortical bone to reach the&#xD;
      trabecular bone. 2. One/two vertical cuts will be created by piezo-drill as needed&#xD;
      connecting, to the crestal cut. 3. Conventional Drills will be used for osteotomy preparation&#xD;
      by wedging it between the two plates of bone. 4. The implant with the proper length and&#xD;
      diameter will be gradually engaged to separate the buccal and Lingual/palatal bone until full&#xD;
      seating is achieved. 6. Cover screws will be placed on the implants. 7.Closure of the ~ap&#xD;
      will be done by interrupted sutures using 4-0 resorbable suture materials. III.&#xD;
      Post-operative phase: Post-operative instructions and medication: Patient is recommended to:&#xD;
      1. Maintain a soft diet to avoid trauma to the surgical site. 2. Place a cold compress&#xD;
      super}cially on the skin overlying the surgical site immediately. Apply for 30 minutes, then&#xD;
      off for 20-30 minutes. This should be done on a near continuous basis (or as much as&#xD;
      possible) for the }first 48 hours. 3. Maintain Oral hygiene but avoid surgical site for the&#xD;
      }rst 4 days after surgery. 4. Medications (Ferrigno et al. 2005)( Garcez-Filho et al.2015) •&#xD;
      Augmentin* (1g tablets) will be prescribed twice daily for 5 days to avoid possibility of&#xD;
      infection. • Ibuprofen** 600mg four times daily for one week. • Voltarene*** (75 mg injection&#xD;
      I.M.) will be used in case of severe pain, as a rescue. • Hexitol**** 0.12% chlorhexidine&#xD;
      mouth rinse for 2 weeks. 5. Sutures will be removed after 2 weeks 6. Final restoration will&#xD;
      be completed after 6 months - Augmentin 1g. Medical union pharmaceuticals co. Abu Sultan,&#xD;
