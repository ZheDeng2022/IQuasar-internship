  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates different ways to educate rural residents living in New Hampshire and&#xD;
      Vermont about cancer research studies and clinical trials to increase knowledge of, increase&#xD;
      positive attitudes toward, and encourage enrollment in cancer research studies and clinical&#xD;
      trials. The information learned from this study will contribute to a nation-wide initiative&#xD;
      to educate the public about clinical trials, including a nation-wide evaluation of that&#xD;
      initiative. The results of this study may also help researchers understand how education&#xD;
      about clinical trials/research affects knowledge of and attitudes toward cancer research and&#xD;
      clinical trials, as well as behavioral intentions and actual behaviors related to enrolling&#xD;
      in cancer research studies and clinical trials.&#xD;

      The study team will implement and evaluate the research study and clinical trials education&#xD;
      in two experimental arms-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. group education (Aim 1a) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. an online format (Aim 1b) The education in both formats will be based on a set of key&#xD;
           messages that cover information about research studies and clinical trials, including&#xD;
           what research studies are, the benefits, the risks, and connection to available research&#xD;
           studies and clinical trials&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Arm 1 (Aim 1a) Implement group education regarding what clinical trials and&#xD;
      cancer research are and evaluate the effect on knowledge of, attitudes and behavioral&#xD;
      intentions toward, and actual enrollment into clinical trials and cancer research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study team will evaluate group educational sessions regarding what clinical trials and cancer&#xD;
      research studies are. The learning objectives focus on improving participants' knowledge&#xD;
      about what clinical trials and cancer research studies are and how to access trials and&#xD;
      studies, increase positive attitudes toward participating in trials and studies, and increase&#xD;
      their intent to enroll in trials and studies. Eligible attendees of the class will be&#xD;
      optionally invited to participate in the research evaluation of the class, using pre- and&#xD;
      post- surveys to assess achievement of the learning objectives. Study participants will also&#xD;
      be asked a series of questions to assess study participants' eligibility for existing&#xD;
      clinical trials and research studies and, as appropriate, referred to those&#xD;
      trial/study/clinical teams for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Arm 2 (Aim 1b):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implement online education regarding what clinical trials and cancer research are and&#xD;
      evaluate the effect on knowledge of, attitudes and behavioral intentions toward, and actual&#xD;
      enrollment into clinical trials and cancer research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will watch a video and view website materials ('online module') about clinical&#xD;
      trials and cancer research. The online module's learning objectives focus on improving&#xD;
      participants' knowledge about what clinical trials and cancer research studies are and how to&#xD;
      access trials and studies, increase positive attitudes toward participating in trials and&#xD;
      studies, and increase their intent to enroll in trials and studies. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will complete pre- and post- surveys to assess achievement of the learning objectives. Study&#xD;
      participants will also be asked a series of questions to assess study participants'&#xD;
      eligibility for existing clinical trials and research studies and, as appropriate, referred&#xD;
      to those trial/study/clinical teams for follow-up.&#xD;
