      This proof-of-concept study will evaluate the feasibility of the Eko DUO to measure signals&#xD;
      relevant to heart failure (HF) decompensation, as well as the feasibility to develop an&#xD;
      algorithm to model hemodynamic filling pressures in HF patients under active decompensation&#xD;
      in a cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) or coronary care unit (CCU). To also assess the&#xD;
      performance of the Eko CORE to detect signals of an HF event, this study will also take heart&#xD;
      and lung sound measurements with the Eko CORE.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) affects an estimated 6.2 million Americans over the age of 20 and has a&#xD;
      high cost burden worldwide. Many health plans, including CMS, have focused on interventions&#xD;
      that monitor patients for early detection of HF decompensation. Earlier interventions can&#xD;
      help care teams prevent avoidable hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health systems have developed outpatient at-home monitoring solutions to predict and prevent&#xD;
      HF readmissions with mixed results. Despite equivocal results, telephone monitoring with&#xD;
      vital sign and weight scale monitors are the de facto standard for outpatient HF remote&#xD;
      monitoring. Invasive hemodynamic sensors have enabled HF care teams to better predict and&#xD;
      prevent HF decompensation events and thus rehospitalizations based on fluid status&#xD;
      assessment. Unfortunately, these solutions are invasive, costly, typically indicated for late&#xD;
      stage heart failure, and have limited availability due to equivocal cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      projections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, researchers have investigated non-invasive sensors that may correlate with&#xD;
      fluid status in HF patients. A study in Taiwan demonstrated that outpatient therapy guided by&#xD;
      an inpatient device with ECG and sound sensors reduced post-discharge HF utilization by 31%&#xD;
      when compared to a control group using symptoms to guide therapy. The LINK-HF study&#xD;
      demonstrated that a wearable patch with ECG and sound sensors could predict HF readmissions&#xD;
      with sensitivity of 76% to 88%, specificity of 85%, and a median lead time of 6.5 days.&#xD;
      Despite promising results, these devices have significant disadvantages. The inpatient device&#xD;
      used in the Taiwanese study was not able to be adapted into a portable form factor for&#xD;
      outpatient use, which would make it a poor candidate for at-home remote monitoring.&#xD;
      Conventional wearable devices also face usability challenges; they can be rigid,&#xD;
      uncomfortable, and highly visible, which can interfere with patient functional living and&#xD;
      decrease monitoring compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an unmet clinical need for a non-invasive, affordable device that can estimate a HF&#xD;
      patient's hemodynamic fluid status and potentially guide a remote care team to decrease risk&#xD;
      for readmission from the comfort of the patient's home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eko has developed the DUO, an FDA-approved portable, hand-held, connected medical device with&#xD;
      ECG and sound sensors. Data from this device can be wirelessly streamed to a mobile phone or&#xD;
      tablet, which is transmitted to a HIPAA-compliant internet cloud infrastructure. This data&#xD;
      can then be analyzed by algorithms to detect disease states. Because patients in active HF&#xD;
      decompensation are known to have an audible third heart sound, characteristic ECG findings,&#xD;
      and adverse time interval durations between sound and ECG signals, the Eko DUO device may be&#xD;
      uniquely positioned to detect these types of changing signals, and predict if patients are&#xD;
      at-risk for a HF event, well in advance of the event itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eko has also developed the Eko CORE, an FDA-approved electronic stethoscope with sound&#xD;
      sensors only. The CORE has otherwise identical functionality to the DUO in regard to data&#xD;
      streaming and transmission. The Eko CORE may be able to detect an audible third heart sound&#xD;
      as well, and therefore has the potential to aid clinicians in predicting future HF events. In&#xD;
      addition, because heart failure and fluid overload are reflected in the lungs as crackles&#xD;
      (and occasionally effusions), the lung examination is and has always been a cornerstone of&#xD;
      the overall physical examination of the patient in decompensated HF. By using the CORE to&#xD;
      capture lung sounds in patients with decompensated HF, and comparing not only the presence or&#xD;
      absence of crackles, but also how they change in correlation with the patient's response to&#xD;
      treatment, we will be able to explore the utility of the Eko CORE in helping treat these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a proof-of-concept study to evaluate the feasibility of the Eko DUO to measure&#xD;
      signals relevant to HF decompensation, as well as the feasibility to develop an algorithm to&#xD;
      model hemodynamic filling pressures in HF patients under active decompensation in a cardiac&#xD;
      intensive care unit (CICU) or coronary care unit (CCU). To also assess the performance of the&#xD;
      Eko CORE to detect signals of an HF event, this study will also take heart and lung sound&#xD;
      measurements with the Eko CORE.&#xD;
