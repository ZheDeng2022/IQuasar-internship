  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Richmond Research Institute (RRI) is applying existing and new COVID-19 PCR and antibody&#xD;
      tests to help develop methodologies which provide fast and accurate results. Infection with&#xD;
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a worldwide pandemic and reliable testing for COVID-19&#xD;
      is crucial to understand who is infected and therefore a risk to others by spreading the&#xD;
      infection. RRI are currently carrying out the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Using a membrane-based immunoassay to detect IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in whole&#xD;
      blood, serum or plasma specimens helps to assess whether an individual has previously had the&#xD;
      virus and is potentially immune&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing using an established method to check for active&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies in whole blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above tests are being used by RRI to follow infections (PCR) and immunity (IgG) in their&#xD;
      workforce, as well as their families (including children) and visitors to their site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collecting this data allows the gathering of epidemiological data on SARS-CoV-2 including&#xD;
      incidence, prevalence, information on asymptomatic carriers and efficacy of vaccination.&#xD;
      Furthermore, identifying individuals that are infected with SARS-CoV-2 has great potential to&#xD;
      improve health outcomes by allowing infected individuals to seek the correct medical&#xD;
      treatment as well as self-isolate and reduce transmission.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a screening study to measure symptomatic and asymptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2 in&#xD;
      trial participants to help facilitate early detection of a second wave of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infections. Specifically, this study aims to determine ; to assess the duration of immunity&#xD;
      by assessing the number and speed at which trial participants were infected and cleared the&#xD;
      virus with or without symptoms; and to determine the length of symptom onset in those with an&#xD;
      active infection; levels of IgG antibodies by demographics (sex, age, ethnicity, and&#xD;
      intensity of symptoms). Longitudinal assessment of antibody levels will additionally allow&#xD;
      for assessment of the efficacy of any vaccines adminstered. This study also seeks to explore&#xD;
      how many people are asymptomatic carriers. In addition, this study aims to help facilitate&#xD;
      the development a quantitative laboratory reference test for antibodies (IgG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using multiple different tests, it can be determined if a person is currently infected&#xD;
      with SARS-CoV-2 or whether they previously have been infected. This allows for the scanning&#xD;
      of people with asymptomatic carriage of the virus, which is important to help reduce the&#xD;
      spread of SARS-CoV-2 through contact with people unaware of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing is routinely used to check for active SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infections. It measures whether viral RNA is present in an individual's system. All in-house&#xD;
      PCR tests are verified by an independent laboratory to check for false positives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a membrane-based immunoassay to detect IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in whole&#xD;
      blood, serum or plasma specimens helps to assess whether an individual has previously had the&#xD;
      virus and is potentially immune. IgG and IgM detection components are separate allowing for&#xD;
      differential detection of each antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this date, 20904 PCR tests and 6848 antibody tests have been carried out in 2328&#xD;
      individuals, providing some interim data. Of the 20904 PCR tests, 17635 (84%) were negative&#xD;
      and 132 (1%) were negative. Of the 6848 antibody tests, 706 (10%) were positive for IgG only,&#xD;
      64 (1%) were positive for IgM only, and 351 (5%) were positive for both IgG and IgM. 5710&#xD;
      (83%) tests were negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of those individuals with a positive PCR test, 53% reported fever during the previous two&#xD;
      months and 75% reported a loss of taste during the previous two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim results are shown in the medRxiv papers below:&#xD;
