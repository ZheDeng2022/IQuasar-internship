  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) is associated with unnecessary use of heath care&#xD;
      resources including prolonged hospitalization and increased hospital readmission.&#xD;
      Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is one of the most important strategies for prevention&#xD;
      of SSI. If there is a beta-lactam allergy, second tier antibiotics (vancomycin and&#xD;
      clindamycin) are recommended alternatives to first- and second-generation cephalosporins&#xD;
      because of fears of possible allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized, and single-blinded clinical trial is designed to examine&#xD;
      causality between second tier antibiotics use and surgical site infections in the subjects&#xD;
      with a documented unverified penicillin allergy. Unverified beta-lactam allergy could be&#xD;
      associated with antimicrobial treatment failure with second tires antibiotics during&#xD;
      postoperative period.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomized, single-blinded clinical trial, eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      identified based on scheduled elective hysterectomy. Subjects with documented beta-lactam&#xD;
      allergy in their chart will be evaluated to differentiate true allergy and allergy-like&#xD;
      events. Subjects with history of allergy-like event to beta-lactam antibiotics will be&#xD;
      randomized to either receive first tier antibiotic or second tier antibiotics before&#xD;
      anesthesia induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Screening of Allergy The potential subjects' history of allergy will be reviewed&#xD;
      according to described criteria of allergy like events. Subjects with documented anaphylaxis&#xD;
      to first tier and second tier antibiotics will be excluded. Only subjects with a history of&#xD;
      previous allergic-like event after beta-lactam antibiotic will be enrolled to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An allergy self-screening questionnaires will be reviewed before the surgery to identify true&#xD;
      allergy or allergy-like event to beta-lactam (penicillin). Allergic-like events include&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, feeling dizziness, dermatitis seen after beta-lactam antibiotic, or any&#xD;
      other description of hypersensitivity reactions other than anaphylactic shock, angioedema,&#xD;
      laryngeal spasm, and shock. Administration of the potential confounding drugs such as&#xD;
      antihistamines, systemic and topical corticosteroids and potential confounding diagnosis such&#xD;
      as autoimmune disease will be also reviewed together with allergy history of the subjects to&#xD;
      differentiate true hypersensitivity and allergy-like events to penicillin and other&#xD;
      beta-lactam antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Follow-up for SSI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed postoperatively for post-discharge SSIs or clostridium infection by&#xD;
      reviewing medical records and contacting via phone and survey. If the subject received care&#xD;
      outside the clinic, their provider will be contacted to obtain outside clinic record with&#xD;
      subject permission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-discharge SSIs will be followed according to the SSI surveillance survey protocol&#xD;
      (Harrington et al. 2013). A combination of methods listed below will be used to detect&#xD;
      post-discharge SSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of subject readmitted with SSI (medical record review)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Detection of SSI at outpatient clinic, other return visit to hospital or review by&#xD;
           healthcare staff (direct observation of the wound by health professional)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Telephone interviews or questionnaire (self-reported SSI)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Early post-operative follow-up (30-days) Subjects will be contacted via phone at 30&#xD;
                days (±3 days) post-operatively to determine if they have been told by a physician&#xD;
                they have a wound infection or if their post-operative antibiotics will extend due&#xD;
                to concern for wound infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Late post-operative follow-up (90-days) A redcap survey will be sent at&#xD;
                postoperative 90 days to review any possible wound infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Site infection (Wound) Classification Based on standard definitions from the US&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for SSI, the wound infections will be classified&#xD;
      as&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. superficial incisional (infection occurred within 30 days after any operative procedure&#xD;
           and involved only skin and subcutaneous tissue of the incision),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. deep incisional primary/secondary (infection occurred within 31-90 days after the&#xD;
           operative procedure and involved deep soft tissues of the incision), or organ/space&#xD;
           (infection occurred within 31-90 days after the operative procedure and involved any&#xD;
           part of the body deeper than the fascia/muscle layers that was opened or manipulated&#xD;
           during the operative procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria of the SSI decision for the female reproductive tract infection (excluding&#xD;
      endometritis or vaginal cuff infections) must meet at least one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Criterion 1: Organisms are cultured from tissue or fluid from affected site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Criterion 2: There is an abscess or other evidence of infection of affected site seen&#xD;
           during a surgical operation or histopathological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Criterion 3: The subjects have two of the following signs or symptoms with no other&#xD;
           recognized cause: fever (&gt;38°C), nausea, vomiting, pain, tenderness, or dysuria, and at&#xD;
           least one of the following: (a) organisms cultured from blood (b) diagnosis by&#xD;
           physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SSI criteria listed above will be applied to the self-reported SSI. Type of SSI will not&#xD;
      be recorded in self-reported SSI. Wound type will be decided according to documentation of&#xD;
      clinician who evaluates the wound. If a superficial SSI progresses into a deep SSI, it will&#xD;
      be reported as the deep SSI only. It may be possible for a subject to have an organ/space SSI&#xD;
      in addition to a SSI affecting the incision (superficial or deep) but if more than one SSI is&#xD;
      reported each must meet the case definition.&#xD;
