      To determine the differences in the placement of the glenoid implant of the inverted&#xD;
      prostheses when they are implanted using a superior approach and using an anterior approach.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inverted prostheses have proven to be effective in the treatment of all those pathologies&#xD;
      that involve a deterioration of the rotator cuff (secondary arthropathy, acute fractures,&#xD;
      sequelae of fractures, tumor surgery and revision surgery). Despite this, numerous&#xD;
      complications have been described after the use of inverted prostheses, such as glenoid&#xD;
      erosion, infections, dislocation, or aseptic loosening. The most frequent complication&#xD;
      related to the use of inverted prostheses is glenoid erosion that can occur in up to 96% of&#xD;
      cases. This complication appears early in the evolution, usually before 2 years after&#xD;
      surgery. Its clinical significance is not yet clear, but it seems that it may be a cause of&#xD;
      long-term prosthetic loosening. To avoid the development of glenoid erosion, the best option&#xD;
      is to place the glenoid component low, so that if the glenoid component is flush with the&#xD;
      lower margin of the glena, the chances of developing glenoid erosion are significantly&#xD;
      reduced. Two types of approaches have been used to implant these prostheses, the&#xD;
      deltopectoral and the superior anterior approach. Each of them has its advantages and&#xD;
      disadvantages, so that deltopectoral seems to improve surgical exposure and therefore favors&#xD;
      the best placement of the glenoid component, but sacrifices the subscapularis tendon,&#xD;
      increasing the risk of dislocation of the components. On the contrary, the superior anterior&#xD;
      approach respects the subscapularis tendon, reducing the risk of dislocation of the&#xD;
      components but gives worse surgical exposure.&#xD;
