    <textblock>
      The implementation of screening and intervention for substance use disorders, such as&#xD;
      Screening Brief Intervention Referral to Treatment (SBIRT), in the primary care setting has&#xD;
      faced several challenges. In the past, physicians have cited barriers such as lack of time,&#xD;
      lack of access to treatment, and lack of financial resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome some of the barriers to screening and prevention of substance use disorders, many&#xD;
      researchers have begun to explore novel approaches using web-based and mobile technology.&#xD;
      While the quality of evidence is often inconsistent, there is promising research to show that&#xD;
      interventions utilizing web-based or mobile technology for alcohol and other substance abuse&#xD;
      can be effective. Features such as tailored feedback have shown to be more effective than&#xD;
      similar programs without feedback, and interventions that combine self-administered therapy&#xD;
      in conjunction with therapist-direction interventions show greater reductions in addictive&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators proposed to enhance the Screening Brief Intervention&#xD;
      Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) with a digital tool that aims to save physician time and&#xD;
      improve patient adherence to treatment goals, through extensive use of shared decision&#xD;
      making, patient self-monitoring and goal tracking, and real-time tailored patient feedback&#xD;
      and text follow-up for patients. Increase the screening and referral of those patients at&#xD;
      risk for substance use disorder (SUD) thereby increasing the number of patients receiving&#xD;
      higher level substance use treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 500 patients will be screened and randomized into two groups. 250 in the&#xD;
      Technology Augmented Treatment group (intervention group) and 250 in the control group. The&#xD;
      Washington State University research team, lead by Dr. McPherson, will screen and recruit&#xD;
      subjects at CHAS Valley Clinic in Spokane, WA. Subjects in both groups will be followed up&#xD;
      for 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial study enrollment visit, the intervention group will be asked questions on an&#xD;
      iPad about their eligibility. After the initial visit, subjects in the intervention group&#xD;
      will receive up to 4 texts/day on his/her phone that will ask questions about their health&#xD;
      after the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will be asked questions on an iPad and will be given a call 30 days after&#xD;
      to ask questions about their health.&#xD;

      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enhance the Screening Brief Intervention Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) with a digital&#xD;
           tool that aims to save physicians time and improve patient adherence to treatment goals,&#xD;
           through extensive use of shared decision making, patient self-monitoring, and goal&#xD;
           tracking, and real-time tailored patient feedback via texting and phone follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increase the screening and referral of patients at risk for substance use disorder&#xD;
           (SUD), thereby increasing the number of patients receiving higher levels of substance&#xD;
           use treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Randomized Controlled Trial will recruit a total of 500 patients with SUD from a primary&#xD;
      care clinic. The patients will be randomized into one of two groups of 250 patients each. The&#xD;
      Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medication, and other Substance use (TAPS) screen will be the&#xD;
      risk stratification screen, as defined below in the inclusion criteria. The control group&#xD;
      will receive the usual SBIRT care and the intervention group will receive the&#xD;
      technology-enhanced SBIRT care. The high-risk SUD patients will be referred to Washington&#xD;
      State University (WSU) affiliated specialty providers in the area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' primary hypotheses are that compared with the control group, participants&#xD;
      at 30 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. significantly more intervention group patients will receive specialty SUD care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. intervention group patients will report a greater reduction in substance use and a&#xD;
           greater drop in SUD risk scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' secondary hypotheses include that the intervention group patients will&#xD;
      receive more referrals at the primary care clinic and during the 30-day follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators estimate that the SBIRT intervention could result in 10% to 30% of patients&#xD;
      receiving specialty care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants age 21 and older who provide any answer except &quot;Never&quot; on a brief assessment&#xD;
      tool, the TAPS-1 (indicating that they may be misusing or abusing prescribed or illicit&#xD;
      substances). The investigators will enroll 500 eligible adults; 250 into the control group,&#xD;
      250 into the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Treatment, as usual, will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Clinic (~30 minutes):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Washington State University (WSU) Research Coordinator (RC) will provide the clinician&#xD;
      with TAPS-1 scores if requested by a clinician trained in SBIRT. This is the only additional&#xD;
      measure for this study beyond what patients routinely fill out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the AUDIT and PHQ-9 is collected to inform the clinician during the visit after&#xD;
      check-in in the control process. This is a fundamental aspect of SBIRT (Screening, Brief&#xD;
      Intervention, Referral Treatment) implementation. This data is collected in the exam room by&#xD;
      either a paper form or iPad (this will be based on CHAS' discretion). The RA/RC will not be&#xD;
      present during the clinician visit as the Brief Intervention is designed to allow the&#xD;
      Clinician to utilize motivational interviewing and other techniques to establish the correct&#xD;
      recommendations for the patient. The clinicians have been specifically trained in the SBIRT&#xD;
      process regarding skills to utilize and a third party is not present under normal care.&#xD;
      Having the RA/RC would alter the control process and interfere with the clinician duties&#xD;
      under SBIRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinician will deliver a brief intervention to participants who are scored moderate to&#xD;
      high risk in any substance and will refer them accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then complete a survey about their experience with the process and their&#xD;
      knowledge about substance use disorders (SUDs; i.e., Patient satisfaction, Short Inventory of&#xD;
      Problems-Revised (SIP-R), and the 30-day Timeline follow-back instrument (TLFB)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be thanked and receive a $50 Walmart gift card (that is not good for&#xD;
      tobacco, alcohol, or firearms) after completion of the surveys. The control arm participants&#xD;
      will receive no additional follow-up beyond usual care until the 30 days' end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 Day Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 30-day follow-up is based on a duration that is likely to generate a response from the&#xD;
      mobile interactions, and it allows adequate time for any referral and follow-up clinical&#xD;
      visits to take place. It has also been identified as a standard window in several similar&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 30-day follow-up period, participants will be asked to answer the screening&#xD;
      questionnaires, the SIP-R, and the TLFB. They will also be asked to report any healthcare&#xD;
      service(s) they received during the 30 days, including any emergency department visits,&#xD;
      inpatient hospitalization, and specialty SUD services. This can be completed in person or&#xD;
      over the phone. Participants will be thanked and receive a $50 Walmart gift card (that is not&#xD;
      good for tobacco, alcohol, or firearms) after completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also follow-up with SUD treatment providers for an independent check&#xD;
      of SUD treatment receipt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technology-Augmented Treatment (TAT) group (intervention group): Technology-augmented&#xD;
      treatment, as usual, will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Clinic (~30 minutes):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WSU (RC) will load data from the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) which will include&#xD;
      patient demographics and TAPS-1 scores, like the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will complete additional screening questions (My Own Health Record (MOHR), Patient&#xD;
      Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and TAPS-2 including questions related to readiness to&#xD;
      change).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the substance he or she is most likely to quit, the iPad application conducts a&#xD;
      computerized brief intervention that consists of watching a brief 2-3 minutes video about the&#xD;
      substance and its risks, and completing an exercise to name the pros and cons of quitting&#xD;
      this substance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the clinician will enter, request the iPad, and after entering a password, will review&#xD;
      1) screening results, 2) readiness to change, and 3) participant's personal pros and cons.&#xD;
      The clinician will conduct a brief intervention in person. The clinician will then ask the&#xD;
      participant to rate readiness for change again. They will work together to set up&#xD;
      quitting/reducing use goals for at least one at-risk substance. In the end, the participant&#xD;
      will sign and commit to the goal(s). (Readiness to change is a key component in intentional&#xD;
      behavior change theories: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15204662)&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant is screened at high risk of any substance and the clinician and&#xD;
      participant mutually agreed to specialty follow-up treatment, the clinician will refer the&#xD;
      participant to a specialty treatment program from the iPad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete the following surveys: Computer System Usability&#xD;
      Questionnaire, Unified Theory of Acceptance, and Use of Technology (UTAUT), Patient&#xD;
      Satisfaction, SIP-R, and TLFB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be thanked and receive a $50 gift card after completion of the surveys and&#xD;
      returning them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Clinic Visit (~10 minutes, up to four times per day for 30 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive messages via text or email (pending their preference), up to four&#xD;
      times a day, to answer daily follow-up questions for 30 days. The questionnaire will collect&#xD;
      participant responses to goal setting questions and associated Ecological Momentary&#xD;
      Assessment (EMA) data. A risk score will be computed for participants every day based on&#xD;
      these responses. If a participant's risk is high, he or she may be offered to watch the&#xD;
      &quot;computer brief intervention&quot; video again or may receive a phone call to follow up or suggest&#xD;
      an in-person visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk score and individual participant summaries will be made available via a web-based&#xD;
      dashboard to the participant's clinicians, including a primary care physician and RC. If the&#xD;
      clinicians determine that the participant's follow-up pattern or answers show high-risk&#xD;
      substance use behavior, they may make additional referrals, and they would normally through a&#xD;
      non-augmented SBIRT experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The messaging provides feedback on patient progress toward meeting the goal of getting&#xD;
      higher-level care. Once-daily, a statement regarding goals of getting to treatment and other&#xD;
      Shared Decision Making (SDM) established goals is sent to the patient. Additional messages&#xD;
      may be sent 2 to 4 times per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The status of the survey responses in a) through c) above is summarized in two web-based&#xD;
      dashboards: one for the patient to access via their follow-up mobile app to track their own&#xD;
      progress and learn about personal risk factors; the other one for the clinician to review all&#xD;
      patients in the study cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinician dashboard is also designed to notify the clinician regarding patient progress&#xD;
      and triggering additional interventions. The investigators will automatically send the&#xD;
      designated clinician a weekly email identifying any non-adherent intervention arm patients.&#xD;
      Clinicians will contact any intervention patients with risk scores that indicate substance&#xD;
      use within the prior week. The medical assistant or clinician will be notified of patients&#xD;
      with continued substance use weekly for days 1 through 15 and daily for days 16 through 30&#xD;
      during the 30-day follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30-Day Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires on an iPad and potentially also on&#xD;
      paper, depending on the treatment arm. They will complete these at 2 appointments with the&#xD;
      research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGULATORY ISSUES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the International Council for&#xD;
      Harmonization (ICH), the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and applicable regulatory&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators estimate that SBIRT intervention (Glass et al 2015) could result in 10% to 30% of patients receiving specialty care. The investigators computed power using the following assumptions:&#xD;
Control arm with 20% participants receiving specialty care.&#xD;
Intervention arm with 35% participants receiving specialty care.&#xD;
Same number of participants in control and intervention.&#xD;
A sample of 197 participants in each of arms will be sufficiently powered to detect such differences between control and intervention arms.</description>

    <description>The investigators assume that both arms start with the same levels of substance use. Therefore, to test the hypothesis, they will test the mean (self-reported) substance use levels at 30 days for both arms. The investigators computed power for the simple t-test of the mean using the following assumptions:&#xD;
Medium Cohen's effect size (or roughly 0.50 standard deviations)&#xD;
Same number of participants in control and intervention.&#xD;
