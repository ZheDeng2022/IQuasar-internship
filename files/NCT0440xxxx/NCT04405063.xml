  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Paclitaxel-coated balloon&#xD;
      (Genoss® DCB) by demonstrating non-inferiority to in-segment late lumen loss at 6 months&#xD;
      after the procedure in patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR) compared with a product of the&#xD;
      same category (Sequent® Please)&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized controlled trials to compare with the same-category medical device (Sequent®&#xD;
      Please), 82 patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR) were recruited from a total of 7&#xD;
      institutions, and the enrolled subjects were 1: 1 through randomization. The ratio was&#xD;
      assigned to the test group and the control group, and each of the test or control devices was&#xD;
      assigned to receive the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug release &quot;stents&quot; for PCI usually follow 9 months or 12 months, but the medical device&#xD;
      for this clinical trial has a drug coated &quot;balloon catheter&quot; and the mechanism of action is&#xD;
      different from the stent and the duration of follow up was set to 6 months.&#xD;
