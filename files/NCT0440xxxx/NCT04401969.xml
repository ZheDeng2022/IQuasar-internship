  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mycetoma is the most neglected of the neglected tropical diseases. It is caused by certain&#xD;
      fungi or bacteria. It is endemic in many tropical and subtropical regions and Sudan seems to&#xD;
      be the mycetoma homeland. This chronic subcutaneous destructive and disabling inflammatory&#xD;
      disease has many serious medical and socio-economic impacts on patients, community and health&#xD;
      authorities. This work may suggest new therapeutic options for mycetoma that target the&#xD;
      inflammatory pathogenic pathway and hence help in designing universal treatment options for&#xD;
      mycetoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two overlapping aims were investigated in this project to advance our overall goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Profiling the immune/inflammatory signatures in the tissue microenvironment of&#xD;
           fungus-induced mycetoma lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Profiling the immune/inflammatory signatures in the tissue microenvironment of&#xD;
           bacteria-induced mycetoma lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mycetoma is a chronic, specific, subcutaneous granulomatous, progressive and disfiguring&#xD;
      inflammatory disease. It is caused by true fungi or by certain bacteria and hence it is&#xD;
      usually classified into eumycetoma and actinomycetoma respectively. Madurella mycetomatis is&#xD;
      the commonest eumycetoma causative agent, while Streptomyces somaliensis and Nocardia&#xD;
      brasiliensis are the common causative organisms for actinomycetoma. The triad of a painless&#xD;
      subcutaneous mass, sinuses formation and purulent or sero-purulent discharge that contains&#xD;
      grains is pathognomonic of mycetoma. The inflammatory subcutaneous granuloma usually spreads&#xD;
      to involve the skin and the deep structures, resulting in destruction, deformity and loss of&#xD;
      function, occasionally it can be fatal. The foot and hand are the most frequently affected&#xD;
      sites seen in 82% of cases. In endemic areas, other parts of the body may be involved such as&#xD;
      the knee, arm, leg, head and neck, thigh and perineum. No age is exempted in mycetoma;&#xD;
      however, it occurs more frequently in young adult men in the age range 20-40 years and almost&#xD;
      30% of reported patients were young students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The true incidence and prevalence of mycetoma world-wide is not precisely known. It is&#xD;
      interesting to note that most of the reported mycetoma data are related to hospital patients&#xD;
      with advanced disease. This is attributed to the nature of mycetoma which is usually&#xD;
      painless, slowly progressive and the late presentation of the majority of patients due to the&#xD;
      poor health education, lack of health facilities and financial constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The worldwide distribution of mycetoma varies widely. It is endemic in many tropical and&#xD;
      subtropical regions and prevails in the mycetoma belt, which includes the countries of Sudan,&#xD;
      Somalia, Senegal, India, Yemen, Mexico, Venezuela, Columbia, Argentina, and a few others. The&#xD;
      African continent seems to have the highest burden and prevalence of the disease. It has also&#xD;
      been extensively reported from India. However, mycetoma has been reported in many temperate&#xD;
      regions as well. There are a few reports on mycetoma from the USA, Sri Lanka, Germany, Egypt,&#xD;
      Turkey, Philippines, Japan, Lebanon, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Iran.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proper treatment of mycetoma depends mainly on accurate diagnosis. It is essential to&#xD;
      identify the causative organism to the species level and the current tests for that are the&#xD;
      classical grains culture, surgical biopsy histopathological examination and various molecular&#xD;
      techniques such as PCR. Various imaging techniques such as conventional radiology,&#xD;
      ultrasonography, CT scan and MRI are in use to determine the disease extend. Most of these&#xD;
      tests and techniques are invasive, expensive and of low sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
      Furthermore, they are not available in the mycetoma endemic regions and hence there is a&#xD;
      desperate need forth easy to use, field-friendly test to identify the causative agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of this distressing and devastating disease is disappointing. The treatment&#xD;
      depends mainly on the aetiological agent, the site and extend of the disease. Until recently,&#xD;
      the only available treatment for mycetoma was amputation or multiple mutilating disfiguring&#xD;
      surgical excisions. Combined medical treatment in the form of antifungals for the eumycetoma&#xD;
      and antibiotics and antimicrobial agents for actinomycetoma and various surgical excisions is&#xD;
      the gold standard in mycetoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reports on medical treatment in eumycetoma are scarce and inadequate. Over the years and till&#xD;
      now, the treatment of eumycetoma was based on personal clinical experience and on the results&#xD;
      of sporadic case reports, rather than controlled clinical trials. In general, massive&#xD;
      surgical excisions or amputation of affected part is the treatment of choice for eumycetoma.&#xD;
      Various antifungal agents have been tried with little success. This is perhaps surprising, as&#xD;
      the eumycetoma causative agents are low-grade infective organisms and their eradication&#xD;
      should be readily achieved by the administration of antifungal drugs. Generally,&#xD;
      actinomycetoma is amenable to medical treatment with antibiotics and other chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents. Combined drug therapy is always preferred to a single drug to avoid drug resistance&#xD;
      and for disease eradication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical treatment for both types of mycetoma must continue until the patient is clinically,&#xD;
      radiologically, ultrasonically and cytologically cured. Recurrence is more common after an&#xD;
      incomplete or irregular course of medical treatment. With patient non-compliance, there is a&#xD;
      good chance for the organism to develop drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted at the Mycetoma clinic at the Mycetoma Research Centre (MRC),&#xD;
      Khartoum Sudan. Patients were enrolled into the study after written informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained in line with the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were categorized into three groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with eumycetoma lesions (n=10)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with actinomycetoma lesions (n=12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with lesions of unknown causality (n=6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formalin fixation and paraffin embedding was performed at the MRC according to standard&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fine needle aspirates (FNA) was collected for flow cytometry at the same time and at the same&#xD;
      location of the lesion in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirates were frozen at -80C for future analysis. Concurrently, 15 ml of blood was taken&#xD;
      from each patient for immunological function assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared using standard protocols and stored in&#xD;
      liquid nitrogen till required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 ml of blood was collected in Paxgene tubes for transcriptomics analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry was performed at University of York, UK. Formalin&#xD;
      fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections were analysed using the 700 gene Nanostring PanCancer&#xD;
      Immune Cell profiling panel to obtain a high level view of the immune/inflammatory signature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial sections were subjected to highly multiplexed antibody staining using the Nanostring&#xD;
      Digital Spatial Profiling system to obtain a comprehensive and spatially resolved insights&#xD;
      into lesion microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidate pan-mycetoma targets identified by these approaches were confirmed using&#xD;
      immunofluorescent antibodies and RNA-fluorescent in situ hybridisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data was recorded as digitised whole slide images for publication and archiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antigen specific T cell responses T cells responses analysis were performed at Institute for&#xD;
      Endemic Diseases, University of Khartoum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients and age and sex matched healthy&#xD;
      control from endemic area were stimulated for 7 days with fungus and bacterial lysates. IFN,&#xD;
      IL-17, IL-4 and IL-10 responses were determined by ELISPOT assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow cytometry on FNBs were performed with panels of antibodies to evaluate T cell and&#xD;
      myeloid cell phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood transcriptomics Blood were collected into Paxgene and stored at - 80c. RNA were&#xD;
      extracted from stored samples Full whole blood transcriptomic data was obtained by RNA-Seq.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokine measurements in mycetoma aspirates were undertaken using commercially available&#xD;
      ELISA kits.&#xD;
