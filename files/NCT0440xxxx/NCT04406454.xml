      ApolloVue® S100 Image System is a medical device class II. The objective of this protocol is&#xD;
      to image skin of healthy volunteers and to evaluate the performance of full-field optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (FF-OCT) device - the ApolloVue® S100 Image System in imaging skin&#xD;
      microstructures of healthy skin at different anatomical locations and nevi for different skin&#xD;
      types and different age and to evaluate usability of the ApolloVue® S100 Image System.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The OCT can provide cellular resolution (~1μm in lateral and axial directions) images. A&#xD;
      cellular resolution OCT has the characteristics of non-invasive, non-radioactive, labelfree,&#xD;
      real-time and high tissue penetration depth that are highly valuable for clinical use. This&#xD;
      technology allows visualization of important structural features such as the epidermis and&#xD;
      dermis and the epidermal-dermal junction. OCT has the advantage of generating cross-sectional&#xD;
      images, like the orientation of pathology slides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ApolloVue® S100 Image System is intended to be used as a non-invasive imaging tool in the&#xD;
      evaluation of external human skin tissue microstructure by providing two-dimensional,&#xD;
      crosssectional (B-scan) and en face (E-scan) real-time visualization for assessment by&#xD;
      physicians to support in forming a clinical judgment. For the ApolloVue® S100 Image System&#xD;
      image, both cross-sectional view and en face view can be obtained to assist physicians'&#xD;
      diagnosis. With both views, physicians can obtain important spatial information in regards to&#xD;
      the skin. Besides, the ApolloVue® S100 Image System is equipped with an image guiding system&#xD;
      which provides a high-resolution dermatoscope like image, for the positioning of skin sites&#xD;
      for optical biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, it is proposed to study the optical imaging features of healthy human skin&#xD;
      and nevi and the evaluation of usability. We propose to recruit 60 subjects for such a trial.&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will be approached and consented to this protocol. The volunteers will be&#xD;
      imaged.&#xD;

    <description>The purpose of this evaluation is to validate that the ApolloVue® S100 Image System delivers non-invasive skin image features.&#xD;
Required features will be analyzed for each group, including age, skin type and anatomical location.&#xD;
The features need to meet the following requirement in each 500 x 400 µm2 image for B-scan and in each 500 x 500 μm2 image for E-scan.&#xD;
A. Identification of keratinocyte in ≧ 80% of images (B-scan only)&#xD;
B. Identification of stratum corneum in ≧ 80% of images&#xD;
C. Identification of epidermis in ≧ 80% of images&#xD;
