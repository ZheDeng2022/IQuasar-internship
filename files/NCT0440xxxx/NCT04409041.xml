  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral naltrexone was initially FDA approved to treat opioid use disorder and alcohol&#xD;
      dependence at doses from 50-100mg/day. At lower doses of 1-5mg/day, naltrexone has been used&#xD;
      off-label with success in treatment of several dermatologic conditions including the scarring&#xD;
      hair loss disease lichen planopilaris. A recent case series of four patients with lichen&#xD;
      planopilaris and a subtype, frontal fibrosing alopecia, treated with oral low-dose naltrexone&#xD;
      at 3mg daily showed reduction of itch, clinical evidence of inflammation of the scalp, and of&#xD;
      disease progression. There were no reported adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the promising evidence, we propose using low-dose naltrexone at a daily dose of 3mg&#xD;
      to treat lichen planopilaris and frontal fibrosing alopecia. The patients would be continued&#xD;
      on their other medications for these conditions. The study would be open-label, so all&#xD;
      participants would receive the low-dose naltrexone. Patients would be seen at 0,3,6 and 9&#xD;
      months to monitor their progress.&#xD;
