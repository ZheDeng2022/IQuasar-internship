  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating mental disorder with a&#xD;
      high lifetime prevalence of 16-20%. Particularly for people with low socio-economic status,&#xD;
      the existing and effective treatment options are hard to reach and show weaker effectivities.&#xD;
      There is a potential to ameliorate depressive symptoms and improve quality of life in persons&#xD;
      with mild-to-moderate depression by providing access to stimulating computerized trainings.&#xD;
      Single computerized trainings that target depressive symptoms have been tested in laboratory&#xD;
      and clinical settings so far. To date, innovative market access and confirmatory studies are&#xD;
      missing for a large-scale implementation of such trainings. Thereby, the present work will&#xD;
      foster a digitalized training paradigm (Paced-Auditory Serial Addition Task; PASAT) which was&#xD;
      previously shown to reduce depressive symptoms, but in a novel innovative and gamified form&#xD;
      on a tablet-PC handed out to participants. Different versions of the same training paradigm&#xD;
      that comprise additional game elements will be compared. The feasibility study will gather&#xD;
      data on effect size estimates of symptom severity reduction, user experience and usage in an&#xD;
      ecological valid setting.&#xD;
