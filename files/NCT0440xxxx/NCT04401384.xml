  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) is one of the most common symptoms of pregnancy&#xD;
      affecting 50-85% of women during the first half of pregnancy. Maternal morbidity is common&#xD;
      and includes psychological effects, financial burden, clinical complications from nutritional&#xD;
      deficiencies, gastrointestinal trauma, and in rare cases, neurological damage. As the main&#xD;
      means of alternative treatment, economical and easy to obtain; the clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      acupuncture treatment of this disease has low level of evidence and needs to be reconfirmed.&#xD;
      Doxylamine vitamin B6 sustained release tablets (Diclectin, combination of doxylamine&#xD;
      succinate (10mg) and pyridoxine hydrochloride (10mg) are The American College of&#xD;
      Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends with Level A evidence the use of vitamin B6 in&#xD;
      combination with doxylamine as first-line pharmacotherapy for treatment of NVP. The efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Diclectin has been confirmed in many years of research, but there is no&#xD;
      evidence of high-level evidence-based medicine for the Chinese population. The purpose of&#xD;
      this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of acupuncture versus Diclectin in the treatment of NVP. We hypothesis&#xD;
      that: (1) Sham acupuncture and Diclectin (Arm B) is more effective than sham acupuncture and&#xD;
      placebo (Arm D); (2) Active acupuncture and placebo (Arm C) is more effective than sham&#xD;
      acupuncture and placebo (Arm D); (3) Sham acupuncture and diclectin (Arm B) have similar&#xD;
      treatment effects with active acupuncture and placebo (Arm C); (4) There is no interaction&#xD;
      (either synergistic or antagonistic effects) between the two interventions of active&#xD;
      acupuncture and Diclectin in patients with NVP.&#xD;

      Subjects will be randomized into one of the four treatment arms: A) active acupuncture (30&#xD;
      min /every day) + Diclectin (combination of doxylamine succinate (10 mg) and pyridoxine&#xD;
      hydrochloride (10 mg) , 2-4 tablets/day); B) sham acupuncture (30 min /every day) + Diclectin&#xD;
      (2-4 tablets/day); C) active acupuncture (30 min / every day) + Diclectin placebo (2-4&#xD;
      tablets/day); D) sham acupuncture (30 min /every day) + Diclectin placebo (2-4 tablets/day).&#xD;
      Participants will receive active acupuncture or sham acupuncture treatment daily, 14 times in&#xD;
      total, and receive Diclectin or placebo treatment every day (2 tablets at bedtime for the&#xD;
      first two days, if the symptoms are unrelieved, add one tablet in the morning, if the&#xD;
      symptoms are still unrelieved, add another one tablet at three o 'clock in the afternoon) for&#xD;
      2 consecutive weeks, 28-56 tablets in total. Daily measurement PUQE score, Visual analog&#xD;
      scale (VAS), Adverse events and concomitant medications. Weekly visits will include global&#xD;
      assessment of well being, adverse events and concomitant medications. The visit after&#xD;
      treatment will assess NVP quality of life (NVPQoL), SAS, SDS and so on. Participants will be&#xD;
      followed up 30 days after treatment. Primary outcomes is difference of the mean change in&#xD;
      PUQE score from baseline to the last visit. Secondary outcomes were some core outcome set for&#xD;
      hyperemesis gravidarum, including weight difference, quality of life (change in Global&#xD;
      assessment of well-being, NVPQOL, VAS, SDS and SAS), pregnancy complication, treatment&#xD;
      compliance, neonatal outcomes; area under the curve of PUQE score, effect of intervention on&#xD;
      PUQE score reduction over treatment period and adverse events.&#xD;
