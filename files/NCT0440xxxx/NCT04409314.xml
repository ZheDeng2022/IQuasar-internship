    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether tumors present in patients with cancer who are planned to get&#xD;
      CAR T-cells have low amounts of oxygen (hypoxia). PET scans may be used to check the amounts&#xD;
      of oxygen within areas of cancer with a special radioactive tracer called FAZA that&#xD;
      specifically looks for areas of low oxygen. This study is being done to help researchers&#xD;
      determine how the amount of oxygen within areas of cancer affect how well CAR T-cells kill&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the incidence of intratumoral hypoxia in patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      (R/R) malignancies before treatment with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the association between intratumoral hypoxia and clinical responses to CAR&#xD;
      T-cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate intratumoral hypoxia with markers of CAR T-cell activity and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. To correlate pre-therapy fluorine F 18-fluoroazomycin arabinoside (18F-FAZA) uptake with&#xD;
      pre-therapy 18Ffluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to CAR T-cell therapy, patients receive 18F-FAZA intravenously (IV). Beginning 2 hours&#xD;
      after injection, patients undergo PET scan over 30-45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up for up to 6 months after CAR T-cell&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
