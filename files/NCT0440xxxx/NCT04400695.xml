      This study is a multi-center, randomized, open, parallel control to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of Phase III clinical trials of the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      recombinant humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody-Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugate&#xD;
      for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer the study.The low&#xD;
      expression of HER2 is defined as: the immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmed by the central&#xD;
      laboratory detects the expression of HER2 protein as IHC 2+ and the fluorescence in situ&#xD;
      hybridization (FISH) detection has no amplification.&#xD;
