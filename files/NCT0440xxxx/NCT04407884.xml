      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Soovu Labs pain Relief System in a group of&#xD;
      users that represent people most likely to purchase and use the units. This study is called&#xD;
      an In Home Users Trial (IHUT). The device is called Soovu and was determined by the FDA to be&#xD;
      Class II 510(k) except (C190061 November 2019). Relevant endpoints include ease of use, pain&#xD;
      relief, quality of life, and long-term effectiveness.&#xD;

      Soovu device description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the FDA document (C190061) &quot;The system is indicated to provide topical heating for the&#xD;
      purpose of elevating tissue temperature for the temporary relief of minor muscle and joint&#xD;
      pain and stiffness; the temporary relief of joint pain associated with arthritis; the&#xD;
      temporary relief of muscle spasms, minor sprains and strains, and minor muscular back pain;&#xD;
      the temporary relief of menstrual discomfort; the relaxation of muscles; and the temporary&#xD;
      increase of local circulation where applied.&quot; The devices are constructed following&#xD;
      documented ANSI/AAMI ES60601-1, ANSI/AAMI HA60601-1-11, IEC 60601-1-2, IEC 60529, ISO&#xD;
      10993-5, and 10993-10 safety standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device consists of two separate heating units pods that are attached to the body via a&#xD;
      ring coated with medical grade adhesive. The units are easily removed from the body. The&#xD;
      units are controlled by a phone app that the user downloads to his or her phone and pairs&#xD;
      with the units via Bluetooth. The app contains instructional material on how to use the&#xD;
      device and general information related to pain management. The user may start and end heat&#xD;
      cycles via the app, may adjust the temperature of the unit, and select from one of three&#xD;
      heating profiles. The maximum temperature of the unit is 113° F well within accepted safety&#xD;
      limits. The three heating algorithms are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Waves of heat up 113F that occur about 2 times per minute for up to 30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Waves of heat up 113F that occur about 4 times per minute for up to 30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Waves of heat up 113 F that occur about 2-3 times per minute for up to 30 minutes. These&#xD;
           waves of heat are synchronized with instructions in the app that guide users through&#xD;
           relaxed breathing exercises sometimes called box breathing. This option lasts up to 30&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The user can freely select any of the options, can end the session before the 30 minute time&#xD;
      out, and can reduce the maximum temperature of the heat wave from 113° F all via the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective(s) To assess the consumer experience of Soovu Labs wearable thermal pulsed-heat&#xD;
      device with Blue-tooth connected app among patients with recurring lower back. Assessment&#xD;
      will include a) whether the device is perceived to work in managing their pain, b) if the&#xD;
      device is comfortable to wear and use, c) if the app is easy to use, and d) if patients would&#xD;
      purchase the product and replacement adhesive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Single arm. home-use study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Participants will be provided with a Soovu Labs device. Back pain sufferers will&#xD;
      apply the product to their pain site as needed following label instructions during an&#xD;
      approximate 60 day usage period. Participants will download the app to their personal mobile&#xD;
      phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients A total of 40 participants will be recruited for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience that is associated with&#xD;
      actual or potential tissue damage or is described associated with such damage. It causes&#xD;
      significant disability and dramatically decreases the patients' quality of life especially if&#xD;
      it lasts for a long time and becomes chronic. Many key opinion leaders and experts in&#xD;
      orthopedics and rheumatology accept that the pain is considered chronic if it lasts more than&#xD;
      six months. Chronic neck, back, and shoulder pain are among the most common and disabling&#xD;
      conditions accompanying different musculoskeletal disorders. As many other chronic painful&#xD;
      conditions, they are very disabling and lead to considerable stress on healthcare systems.&#xD;
      Several treatment modalities and their combinations have been proposed with different success&#xD;
      rates, including exercises, physical therapy, oral medication, injections and even surgery.&#xD;
      However, many products have low satisfaction rates given poor design, poor aesthetics, and&#xD;
      limited effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study suggests a new therapeutic option (pulsed heat) for patients with recurring&#xD;
      lower back or cervical pain. The new wearable device delivers pulsed heat that automatically&#xD;
      raises and lowers the heat intensity over wear time may provide a better patient experience.&#xD;
      This study will assess opinions of likely users about the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures The IHUT study will be run by Soovu Labs Inc. Seattle, WA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may be recruited via an internal database of those who have participated in previous&#xD;
      studies and focus groups as well as new recruits. Subjects will be given the device for home&#xD;
      use for up to 60 days. Prior to entering the study all subjects will be screened for&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria (Attachment 1). If subjects are eligible and wish to enter the&#xD;
      study, they will complete an intake form (Attachment 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be mailed the devices, adhesive rings (three different types), charger and&#xD;
      instructional materials including Owner's Manual with appropriate indications, warnings and&#xD;
      cautions, and Quick Start Guide to unbox at home. The attachment rings contain adhesives that&#xD;
      are commercially available, are biocompatible, and approved for human use. Questions related&#xD;
      to the unboxing are listed in attachment 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once entered into the study users will be free to use the Soovu device as needed, with a&#xD;
      recommendation to use daily. The phone app that controls the device automatically tracks the&#xD;
      use of the device. Specifically, location of pain, which treatment profile (1-3) the subject&#xD;
      used, relief post use, the time and number of uses per day, duration of each treatment, and&#xD;
      whether the user viewed any of the supportive instructions contained on the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will periodically be contacted via telephone or internet and asked a set of&#xD;
      questions and opinions . At the conclusion of the study subjects will be contacted via&#xD;
      telephone or internet and asked a set of exit questions as well as to return the study&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a social media site with participation limited to study participants will be&#xD;
      made available for participants to share comments amongst themselves, and for the company to&#xD;
      provide clarifications on product usage as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Evaluation of Safety Any adverse event related or unrelated to the tested&#xD;
      products will be documented and reported as required (occurrence date, site, outcome and&#xD;
      assessment of causality and severity etc.) following approved operating procedures. All&#xD;
      adverse events will be recorded in the final study report. Adverse event instructions will be&#xD;
      included in the participant's Informed Consent Statement and in the study materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods Data will be analyzed using analysis of variance with pain site, past&#xD;
      treatments, and gender as discrete factors, and age as a covariate. Purchase interested will&#xD;
      be assessed using frequency analysis.&#xD;
