    <textblock>
      Patients and methods: It is a prospective double blind study done on total 300 patients.&#xD;
      Admitted with respiratory failure ARDS due to severe lung contusion. All of them selected to&#xD;
      be ventilated for one week or more. Patients were randomly allocated in one of three groups&#xD;
      each group contain 100 patients. Group A considered control extubated and follow our routine&#xD;
      protocol, patients of group B reconnected to mechanical ventilation before extubation for one&#xD;
      hour. patients of Group C extubated and immediately connected to NIV with BIPAP mode for 1&#xD;
      hour every 12 hours for 24 hours. Results: There was significant reduction in the number of&#xD;
      patients had deterioration in conscious level in all the duration of the study in patients of&#xD;
      both groups B and C compared to group A. Also significant reduction in the number of patients&#xD;
      had deterioration in clinical parameters of respiration in all the duration of the study in&#xD;
      patients of both groups B and C compared to group A as regards high respiratory rate,&#xD;
      desaturation and development of hyperdynamic circulation (tachycardia and hypertension).&#xD;
      significant reduction in the number of patients had multiple quadrant parenchymatous&#xD;
      infiltration in all the duration of the study in patients of both groups B and C compared to&#xD;
      group A. significant reduction in the number of patients had marked limitation to FEV1, FVC&#xD;
      and MVV in all the duration of the study in patients of both groups B and C compared to group&#xD;
      A. Conclusion: Use of either NIV every 12 hours for 24 hours or MV for one hour after&#xD;
      fulfillment of weaning criteria reduces reintubation and post-extubation respiratory failure&#xD;
      and decrease the ICU stay in critically ill patients with resolving ARDS due to severe lung&#xD;
      trauma.&#xD;

      It is a prospective double-blind study done on total 300 patients. Admitted to King Abdulaziz&#xD;
      specialist hospital in Taif, KSA. Between April 2019 and April 2020 with respiratory failure&#xD;
      ARDS due to severe lung contusion with these criteria: hypoxic index less than 200, bilateral&#xD;
      parenchymatous lung infiltrate, no any acute cardiac insult, failed to maintain SPO2 more&#xD;
      than 90% with Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) or need of continuous NIV to maintain the&#xD;
      previous saturation. This selected ARDS was due to lung contusion which diagnosed by&#xD;
      Computerized tomography of the chest following chest trauma. All of them selected to be&#xD;
      ventilated for one week or more and only those who showed full criteria of weaning from the&#xD;
      ventilator enrolled in our study. Our criteria of weaning include fully conscious patients,&#xD;
      hemodynamically stable without any inotropic support, hypoxic index(PAO2/FIO2) more than 200&#xD;
      calculated from the arterial blood gases (ABG), bicarbonate level in arterial blood more than&#xD;
      20 mmol/l, hemoglobin level more than 10 gm%, chest X ray less than one quadrant&#xD;
      parenchymatous infiltration in each lung on Murray score of chest Xray, rapid shallow&#xD;
      breathing index &lt;105. Patients were randomly allocated in one of three groups each group&#xD;
      contain 100 patients. Randomization sequence was created using Excel 2007 (Microsoft,&#xD;
      Redmond, WA, USA) with a 1:1 allocation using random block sizes of 2 and 4 by an independent&#xD;
      doctor. In this way, sequence generation and type of randomization can be expressed at the&#xD;
      same time. Patients of group A extubated and followed our routine protocol of management post&#xD;
      extubation which include Nebulization with Ventolin and epinephrine racemic every 8 hours for&#xD;
      48 hours, chest physical therapy (CPT) every 6 hours for 48 hours include clapping percussion&#xD;
      with mechanical vibration and suction plus huffing or coughing and postural drainage if there&#xD;
      was atelectasis seen by our routine chest X ray. Patients of group B reconnected to&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation before extubation for one hour with sedation with midazolam 3-5&#xD;
      milligram/hour intravenous infusion to achieve score 0 or -1on Richmond Agitation - Sedation&#xD;
      Scale (RASS). 20 minutes before the end of this hour midazolam infusion discontinued and&#xD;
      patients awaked. Patient put on mechanical ventilation (MV) with the following parameters,&#xD;
      FIO2 40%, pressure SIMV mode, PEEP 8 cmH2O, Pressure support 15 cmH2O, Respiratory rate&#xD;
      14/min, Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 35 cmH2O. Then patients extubated and followed our&#xD;
      previous protocol without the use of NIV.&#xD;
