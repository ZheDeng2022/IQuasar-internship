  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Buqitongluo Granule&#xD;
      in treating qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome, and explore the effect of the&#xD;
      improvement of qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome on the prognosis of diseases.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BOSS study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis of this trial is that Buqitongluo Granule will improve the syndrome&#xD;
      score of Qi Deficiency and Blood Stasis in convalescence of ischemic stroke, stable angina&#xD;
      pectoris of coronary artery disease and diabetic peripheral neuropathy with qi deficiency and&#xD;
      blood stasis syndrome. Buqitongluo Granule will be compared to placebo, combined with&#xD;
      guidelines-based standard care in patients. During the trial, it is forbidden to use&#xD;
      acupuncture, Traditional Chinese Medicine decoction (compound granule), Traditional Chinese&#xD;
      Medicine injection, Chinese patent medicine (including external use), external washing of&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese Medicine and health product (composition or efficacy similar to the study&#xD;
      drug).&#xD;
