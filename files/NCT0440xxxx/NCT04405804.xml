  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a monocentric, prospective, single arm, not for profit study. It is designed to study&#xD;
      the early use of ivabradine in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and Ejection Fraction&#xD;
      (EF) &lt; 45%.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is divided into a screening and enrollment visit (V1) where eligibility for&#xD;
      treatment will be confirmed. Ivabradine will be administered to eligible patients with&#xD;
      increasing dosage during the titration period (TP) which will last from a minimum of 3 days&#xD;
      to a maximum of 15 days. This will be followed by a maintenance period (MP) of the drug for a&#xD;
      further 14 days. The follow-up period (FU) will last 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of ACE inhibitors will be introduced after 72 hours of clinical stability after the&#xD;
      introduction of titrated ivabradine at maximum dose according to protocol. The&#xD;
      anti-aldosterone will be introduced 24 hours after the introduction of ivabradine. The&#xD;
      diuretic will not be modified during the titration phase of the drug, unless there is&#xD;
      clinical necessity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the FU ivabradine will be continued at stable dosage, in order to maintain the target&#xD;
      heart rate (HR) reached during the maintenance phase (HR &gt; 80 bpm, in the group of patients&#xD;
      older than 6-12 months, or HR &gt; 70 bpm in patients aged 1-3 years or HR &gt; 50 bpm between 3-18&#xD;
      years). In all patients, the drug dose will be decreased or discontinued in case of&#xD;
      bradycardia (HR&lt; 80 bpm in patients 6-12 months, HR&lt; 70 bpm in patients 1-3 years of age or&#xD;
      HR&lt; 60 bpm in patients 3-18 years of age) and/or symptoms related to bradycardia or for other&#xD;
      safety reasons.&#xD;
