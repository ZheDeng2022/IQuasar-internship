      This project aims to verify the hypothesis that spelt products are more tolerable than bread&#xD;
      wheat products in a target group of individuals with self-diagnosed wheat sensitivity. In&#xD;
      addition, the influence of different manufacturing processes will be considered.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Wheat cereals are known to be capable of triggering wheat allergy and celiac disease. The&#xD;
      prevalence of both diseases is about 1%. Recently, another clinical entity was described, the&#xD;
      non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS). The origin and mechanisms of NCWS are unclear at&#xD;
      present, but the existence of this new disease entity has been proven by double-blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled challenge tests. Three different grain components have been proposed as&#xD;
      triggers of NCWS, gluten, α-amylase trypsin inhibitors or fermentable carbohydrates&#xD;
      (FODMAPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is reported that individuals with self-diagnosed NCWS quite often tolerate spelt products&#xD;
      much better, even though spelt shows a higher gluten content than bread wheat products.&#xD;
      Therefore, the question arises whether this putative spelt tolerance can be confirmed on an&#xD;
      objective basis and whether the underlying molecular mechanisms can be elucidated. So far,&#xD;
      human study addressing such questions are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to verify the hypothesis that spelt products are more tolerable than bread&#xD;
      wheat products in a target group of individuals with self-diagnosed wheat sensitivity. In&#xD;
      addition, the influence of different manufacturing processes on wheat sensitivity will be&#xD;
      revealed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, the trial involves individuals with self-diagnosed wheat sensitivity and&#xD;
      spelt tolerance. Six different kinds of bread will be tested, including 4 wheat and spelt&#xD;
      breads, each of them produced following a traditional or a conventional way. Aim of this part&#xD;
      is to objective bread wheat and spelt intolerance in a defined population. To find out&#xD;
      whether FODMAPs or gluten affect the tolerance of bread, two additional breads will be&#xD;
      tested, a gluten-free bread with added gluten and a gluten-free bread with added FODMAPs.&#xD;
