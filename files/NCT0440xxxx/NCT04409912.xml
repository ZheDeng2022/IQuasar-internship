      A functioning dialysis access is critical to the delivery of hemodialysis therapy in patients&#xD;
      with End Stage Renal Disease. Stenosis secondary to neo-intimal hyperplasia frequently occur&#xD;
      within the dialysis access, resulting in dysfunction. Conventional balloon angioplasty is the&#xD;
      current standard of care for treatment of stenosis but is associated with high rate of&#xD;
      recurrence. Paclitaxel coated balloon has been shown to be superior to conventional balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty in dialysis access interventions but recent meta-analysis has shown an increase&#xD;
      in mortality when paclitaxel coated balloon and stents are used in lower limb angioplasty.&#xD;
      Sirolimus coated angioplasty balloon are second generation drug coated balloon that have been&#xD;
      shown to be effective in coronary artery interventions. Sirolimus is cytostatic in nature&#xD;
      with good safety profile. In our pilot study, sirolimus coated balloon has been shown to be&#xD;
      safe and effective in the salvaged of thrombosed arteriovenous graft. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators are conducting a double-blinded, multi-center randomised control trial to&#xD;
      compare the 6 month patency of arteriovenous fistula after intervention with sirolimus coated&#xD;
      balloon versus conventional balloon angioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that the addition of SCB after successful balloon angioplasty&#xD;
      with conventional plain balloon is superior to conventional plain balloon angioplasty alone&#xD;
      with decreased restenosis of the treated lesion, improved access circuit and treated lesion&#xD;
      patency, and decreased number of interventions needed to maintain patency.&#xD;

      Dialysis vascular accesses such as Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF) and Arteriovenous Grafts (AVG)&#xD;
      are surgically created vasculatures used for hemodialysis in patients with End-Stage Renal&#xD;
      Disease (ESRD). A functioning dialysis vascular access is critical to the delivery of&#xD;
      life-saving hemodialysis (HD) treatment to these patients. Unfortunately, neointimal&#xD;
      hyperplasia frequently occurs within the dialysis vascular access, resulting in stenosis,&#xD;
      poor flow and thrombosis with loss of function. The durability of both AVF and AVG are poor,&#xD;
      with an almost 50% failure rate after a median lifetime of 3 to 7 years for AVF and 12 to 18&#xD;
      months for AVG. Vascular access failure is the most common reason for hospitalization among&#xD;
      HD patients. The global healthcare costs for treating vascular access-related complications&#xD;
      amount to USD 18 billion, and in USD 1 billion in the US alone. These figures are set to&#xD;
      increase, due to the increase in the prevalence of access interventions and hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients globally. Singapore has one of the highest ESRD rates in the world and the&#xD;
      investigators are facing an increasing number of patients with ESRD and the majority of the&#xD;
      patients opting for hemodialysis as their treatment modality. As such, vascular&#xD;
      access-related complication is set to be a major contribution of healthcare cost in our&#xD;
      nation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current gold standard therapy for the treatment of stenosis in dialysis access is plain&#xD;
      balloon angioplasty (BA). Despite its widespread availability and minimally invasive nature,&#xD;
      the mid- and long-term patency with BA in patients with ESRD is poor. The reported average&#xD;
      primary patency after BA is around 40-50% at 1 year. Multiple repeated angioplasty is&#xD;
      required to maintain the patency of the vascular access. Hence, there is an urgent clinical&#xD;
      need to improve the patency of dialysis vascular access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the use of stents, in particular stent graft, has been shown to be superior to&#xD;
      angioplasty for stenosis occurring at the site of venous anastomoses of an AVG. The incidence&#xD;
      of patency of the treatment area was significantly greater in the stent-graft group than in&#xD;
      the balloon-angioplasty group (51% vs. 23%, P&lt;0.001), as was the incidence of patency of the&#xD;
      access circuit (38% vs. 20%, P=0.008) at 6 months. For cephalic arch stenosis in AVF, the use&#xD;
      of stent graft has also been shown to be superior to bare metal stent. The 6 month primary&#xD;
      patency for stent graft and bare stent was 81.8 and 39.1%, respectively. One-year primary&#xD;
      patency for stent graft and bare stent was 31.8 and 0.00%, respectively (P = 0.002). However,&#xD;
      the use of stent graft for the management of dialysis vascular access is not without any&#xD;
      concern. In particular, re-stenosis can occur within the stented segment (post stent 12-month&#xD;
      primary patency is 46%), resulting in the need for repeat angioplasty. Future stent&#xD;
      deployment in the re-stenotic segment may also not be feasible due to the presence of the&#xD;
      stent. Moreover, the presence of a stent can impede future surgical revision or new access&#xD;
      creation within the same vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty (PCBA) has also been shown recently to be superior to&#xD;
      plain BA in the treatment of stenosis in dialysis vascular access. This is because the very&#xD;
      intervention used to treat the underlying stenosis by plain BA can induce vascular injury and&#xD;
      accelerate intimal hyperplasia, resulting in rapid restenosis and the need for repeated&#xD;
      procedures to maintain vessel patency. By releasing Paclitaxel, which is an&#xD;
      anti-proliferative drug, locally into the vessel wall during balloon contact, it will blunt&#xD;
      the acceleration of intimal hyperplasia response, resulting in improved primary patency after&#xD;
      angioplasty. Additionally, unlike stents, PCBA does not leave a permanent structure that may&#xD;
      impede future surgical revision. In a small 40 patient pilot study, the primary unassisted&#xD;
      patency in the PCBA group was significantly better than the plain BA group at 6 (70 % versus&#xD;
      25 %) and 12 months (35 % versus 5 %, p &lt;0.001) respectively. Recent randomized control&#xD;
      trials have also shown the superiority of PCBA over plain balloon angioplasty in the&#xD;
      treatment of stenosis in dialysis vascular access. However, concerns had also arisen recently&#xD;
      in the use of PCBA. In large lower limb studies involving the use of PCBA, meta-analysis had&#xD;
      revealed an increased risk of death in patients that are treated with PCBA or&#xD;
      paclitaxel-coated stent. This had led to warning from the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) and the issue of guidelines from the interventional societies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sirolimus coated balloon (SCB) is the new generation of drug-eluting balloons available in&#xD;
      the market. Compared to Paclitaxel, sirolimus is cytostatic in its mode of action with a high&#xD;
      margin of safety. It has a high transfer rate to the vessel wall and effectively inhibits&#xD;
      neointimal hyperplasia in the porcine coronary model. In the coronary artery interventions,&#xD;
      preliminary clinical studies using SCB have also shown excellent procedural and 6-month&#xD;
      patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of SCB in patients with dialysis access dysfunction has been shown in a&#xD;
      small pilot study in the salvage of thrombosed AVG and investigators postulate that SCB will&#xD;
      be a viable option in patients who requires treatment with drug-coated balloon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to conduct a multicenter double-blinded randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      compare the 6 month unassisted patency rate of SCB angioplasty versus plain balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty in the management of stenosis in arteriovenous fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with matured AVF (in use for more than 1 month) that are dysfunctional and are&#xD;
      already scheduled to undergo balloon angioplasty will be considered for the trial. Patients&#xD;
      will be consented if they fulfill the preliminary eligibility criteria and are agreeable to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Once all the eligibility criteria are fulfilled, including&#xD;
      angiographic criteria assessed on the day of the procedure, the patient is entered into the&#xD;
      trial and randomised. Patients who are unsuitable for the trial will be treated in the&#xD;
      conventional way with PB and considered as screen failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AVF will be assessed with ultrasound for possible access sites. All patients will undergo&#xD;
      a fistulogram which is obtained by injection of contrast. The access site will be left to the&#xD;
      discretion of the procedurist. The fistulogram should include the entire dialysis circuit&#xD;
      from the arteriovenous anastomosis to the central veins. The suggested approach would include&#xD;
      a fistulogram via an 18 Gauge cannula inserted into the arterialised vein. When there is no&#xD;
      spontaneous reflux of contrast into the artery, reflux opacification of the arteriovenous&#xD;
      (AV) anastomosis is achieved by injecting contrast during inflation of a blood pressure cuff&#xD;
      or a tourniquet around the arm. Alternatively, a trans-radial or arterial approach may be&#xD;
      used to obtain the fistulogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on fistulogram findings, the access site will be placed up to the discretion of the&#xD;
      procedurist. If an 18G cannula is used, it may be exchanged for a vascular sheath that is&#xD;
      sized appropriately based on the planned balloon sizes). Alternatively, the 18G cannula may&#xD;
      be removed and a new access site for intervention may be chosen. A new puncture will be&#xD;
      performed with the insertion of a vascular sheath (sized appropriately according to planned&#xD;
      balloon sizes). Two access sites (both antegrade and retrograde) may be needed in certain&#xD;
      cases. A trans-radial or arterial approach may also be considered if necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that opacification of the anastomosis was not earlier achieved even with&#xD;
      inflation of a blood pressure cuff around the arm, it will be performed via contrast&#xD;
      injection through a catheter in the feeding artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When there is more than 1 stenosis, all the lesions will be labelled and treated with&#xD;
      conventional balloon angioplasty (from the AV anastomosis up to, but not including, the&#xD;
      subclavian vein). Lesions are considered separate if they are separated by a gap of at least&#xD;
      2 cm. The lesion or lesions will be dilated with standard angioplasty that is sized similar&#xD;
      to the adjacent reference vessel. Inflation time will be at least 1 minute per inflation. The&#xD;
      balloon will be inflated to an appropriate inflation pressure as per institution standardised&#xD;
      practice to achieve &lt;30% residual stenosis and satisfactory thrill. If there is significant&#xD;
      residual stenosis after angioplasty (defined as &gt; 30% stenosis), repeat angioplasty with the&#xD;
      same standard angioplasty balloon or a larger standard angioplasty balloon may be used at&#xD;
      operator's discretion. High-pressure angioplasty balloon or cutting balloon may also be used,&#xD;
      if necessary, in the event of resistant stenosis. In stenotic segment adjacent to aneurysmal&#xD;
      segment, where the percentage of stenosis is difficult to determine, the treated segment&#xD;
      should reach at least reach 6mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation occurs when all the lesions are treated adequately, defined as less than 30%&#xD;
      residual stenosis after standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to receive either the sirolimus coated balloon or plain balloon.&#xD;
      Repeated angioplasty of the stenotic segments that were successfully treated (defined as less&#xD;
      than 30% residual stenosis) will be performed using sirolimus coated balloon (for patient&#xD;
      randomised into the sirolimus balloon arm) or plain/placebo balloon (for patients randomised&#xD;
      into the placebo arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST-PROCEDURE ULTRASOUND SCAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive an ultrasound scan of their AVF after their procedure before&#xD;
      discharge. The diameter of the vessel at the treated sites will be measured and documented.&#xD;
      Brachial artery flow and flow within the outflow vein will also be measured and documented&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Patency definitions are defined based on SIR reporting standards (Gray et al., 2003):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention target lesion patency:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interval after intervention until the next re-intervention at or adjacent to the original&#xD;
      treatment site or until the access is abandoned. Percutaneous or surgical treatments of a new&#xD;
      arterial or venous outflow stenosis/occlusion (including access thrombosis) that do not&#xD;
      involve or exclude the original lesion from the access circuit are compatible with lesion&#xD;
      patency. The creation of new access that incorporates the target lesion into the new access&#xD;
      circuit is also compatible with target lesion patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention access circuit primary patency:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interval following intervention until the next access thrombosis or repeated intervention. It&#xD;
      ends with the treatment of a lesion anywhere within the access circuit, from the arterial&#xD;
      inflow to the superior vena cava-right atrial junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention access circuit assisted primary patency:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interval after intervention until access thrombosis or surgical intervention that excludes&#xD;
      the treated lesion from the access circuit. Percutaneous treatments of either&#xD;
      restenosis/occlusion of the previously treated lesion or a new arterial or venous outflow&#xD;
      stenosis/occlusion (excluding access thrombosis) are compatible with assisted primary&#xD;
      patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention access circuit secondary patency:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interval after intervention until the access is surgically declotted, revised or abandoned.&#xD;
      Thrombolysis and percutaneous thrombectomy are compatible with secondary patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ^Complications will be categorised according to SIR definitions of minor or major&#xD;
      complications (Aruny et al., 2003):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major complication is defined as one that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. require therapy, minor hospitalisation (&lt; 48 hours),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. require major therapy, unplanned increase in the level of care, prolonged&#xD;
           hospitalisation (&gt;48 hours),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. leads to permanent adverse sequelae, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. death&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minor complication is one that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. requires no therapy with no consequence,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. requires nominal therapy with no consequence; includes overnight admission for&#xD;
           observation only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST-PROCEDURE FOLLOW-UP ULTRASOUND SCAN OF AVF:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed-up at:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 months (± 1 weeks): assessment of primary outcome 6 months (± 4 weeks): assess the target&#xD;
      lesion and access circuit. 12 months (± 4 weeks): assess AVF patency and study closure&#xD;
