      This is an open-label, nonrandomized phase 2 trial to assess the efficacy of cobimetinib in&#xD;
      RAS pathway activated CMML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients will be treated daily with cobimetinib in 28-day cycles. Cobimetinib&#xD;
      will be administered for three weeks followed by a one week break prior to the start of the&#xD;
      following cycle. Patients will remain on study therapy until treatment discontinuation&#xD;

      This is an open-label, nonrandomized phase 2 trial to assess the efficacy of cobimetinib in&#xD;
      RAS pathway activated CMML. Two cohorts of patients will be accrued using Simon's two-stage&#xD;
      design (Simon, 1989) for both cohorts. Cohort 1 will enroll nine newly diagnosed patients in&#xD;
      the first stage and if four or more responses are observed five additional patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the second stage. Cohort 2 will enroll six HMA refractory patients in the first&#xD;
      stage and if one or more responses are observed then nine additional patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the second stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients will be treated daily with cobimetinib in 28-day cycles. Cobimetinib&#xD;
      will be administered consecutively for three weeks followed by a one week break prior to the&#xD;
      start of the following cycle. Patients will remain on study therapy until treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation criteria is met.&#xD;
