        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Aged ≥ 40 years at the date of COPD diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of COPD confirmed by the investigator. A spirometry confirming the diagnosis&#xD;
             (FEV1/forced vital capacity [FVC] ratio &lt;0.7) and performed within the three years&#xD;
             prior to the inclusion visit must be available in the patient's medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prescription of a new maintenance COPD treatment with TIO/OLO or ICS-containing&#xD;
             regimens (not including TIO/OLO) 3 months (-7/+30 days) prior to the inclusion visit.&#xD;
             The COPD treatment may have been prescribed at primary care sites or at the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Written informed consent prior to participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Respiratory disorders other than COPD, such as asthma-COPD overlap or asthma (prior to&#xD;
        or at the index date).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2a. For treatment naïve patients (i.e., those who have never started a maintenance therapy&#xD;
        for COPD [with either short- or long-acting bronchodilators or ICS]) - no data on the GOLD&#xD;
        2019 group at the index date is available in the medical records. Patients may still be&#xD;
        included if the determination of the GOLD 2019 group is possible based on the medical&#xD;
        records' data and/or patient interviews (e.g. by using information on exacerbation history&#xD;
        in the 12 months prior to the index date, and data on mMRC and COPD Assessment Test (CAT)&#xD;
        at the index date).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2b. For treatment experienced patients - no data on the predominant treatable trait to&#xD;
        target at the index date (dyspnea, exacerbation or both) is available in the medical&#xD;
        records. Patients may still be included if this information is obtained based on patient&#xD;
        interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participation in a clinical trial within the 3 months prior to the inclusion visit.&#xD;
