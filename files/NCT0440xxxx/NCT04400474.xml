    <textblock>
      CABATEN is a multicohort phase II study of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab in advanced and&#xD;
      progressive tumors from endocrine system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab combination&#xD;
      by means of radiological objective response rate (ORR) evaluated following RECIST v1.1&#xD;
      criteria in advanced endocrine tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endocrine tumors from different origins (thyroid, lung, pancreas and digestive tract, adrenal&#xD;
      gland and paraganglia) are characterized by being remarkably vascular and expressing several&#xD;
      growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth&#xD;
      factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF),&#xD;
      and transforming growth factor (TGF)-α and -β. The (over) expression of some of these factors&#xD;
      has been linked to poor prognosis. Cabozaninib, a VEGF inhibitor, in combination with&#xD;
      atezolizumab, an inhibitor of PD-L1, may be active in endocrine tumors by overcoming the&#xD;
      resistance to prior antiangiogenic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include patients with advanced and refractory tumors of endocrine system and&#xD;
      patients would be allocated to six different cohorts according to the following tumor types.&#xD;

      CABATEN is a multicohort phase II study of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab in advanced and&#xD;
      progressive tumors from endocrine system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that the administration of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab will improve&#xD;
      the probability of expected objective response rate in advanced and refractory tumors of the&#xD;
      endocrine system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab combination&#xD;
      by means of radiological objective response rate (ORR) evaluated following RECIST v1.1&#xD;
      criteria in advanced endocrine tumors. Secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety profile of cabozantinib and atezolizumab combination, according&#xD;
           to NCI-CTCAE V5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of response (DoR) as per RECIST V1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression-free survival (PFS): median PFS as per RECIST V1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall Survival (OS): median OS as per RECIST V1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biomarkers: translational sub-study (optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the subjects will be treated with the combination until disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, or patient consent withdrawal (whichever occurs first):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cabozantinib 40 mg or 20 mg tablets, oral administration once daily continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atezolizumab 1200 mg administered intravenously (IV) every three weeks (cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endocrine tumors from different origins (thyroid, lung, pancreas and digestive tract, adrenal&#xD;
      gland and paraganglia) are characterized by being remarkably vascular and expressing several&#xD;
      growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth&#xD;
      factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF),&#xD;
      and transforming growth factor (TGF)-α and -β. The (over) expression of some of these factors&#xD;
      has been linked to poor prognosis. Cabozaninib, a VEGF inhibitor, in combination with&#xD;
      atezolizumab, an inhibitor of PD-L1, may be active in endocrine tumors by overcoming the&#xD;
      resistance to prior antiangiogenic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include patients with advanced and refractory tumors of endocrine system and&#xD;
      patients would be allocated to six different cohorts according to the following tumor types:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of the lung and thymus (grades 1 and 2)&#xD;
      after progression to somatostatin analogs, targeted agents, PRRT, and/or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: Anaplastic thyroid cancer in first-line or after progression to chemotherapy or&#xD;
      investigational drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3: Adrenocortical carcinoma after progression to chemotherapy and/or mitotane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 4: Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma after progression to peptide receptor&#xD;
      radionuclide therapy (PRRT) if indicated, prior chemotherapy and biological therapy, such as&#xD;
      somatostatin analogs, are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 5: Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of digestive system after progression to&#xD;
      somatostatin analogs, targeted agents, PRRT, and/or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 6: Grade 3 neuroendocrine neoplasm of any origin, excluding small cell lung cancer,&#xD;
      after progression to chemotherapy or targeted agents/PRRT.&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Major surgery (e.g, GI surgery and removal or biopsy of brain metastasis) within 8&#xD;
             weeks before inclusion. Complete wound healing from major surgery must have occurred 4&#xD;
             weeks before study treatment and from minor surgery (e.g, simple excision, tooth&#xD;
             extraction) at least 10 days before study treatment. Subjects with clinically relevant&#xD;
             ongoing complications from prior surgery are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcf) &gt; 500 ms within 28&#xD;
             days before study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: if a single ECG shows a QTCf with an absolute value &gt; 500 ms, two additional&#xD;
             ECGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30 min after the&#xD;
             initial ECG, and the average of these 3 consecutive results for qtcf will be used to&#xD;
             determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Pregnant or lactating females.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Inability to swallow tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Previously identified allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the study treatment&#xD;
             formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Diagnosis of another malignancy within 3 years before study treatment, except for&#xD;
             superficial skin cancers, or localized, low grade tumors deemed cured and not treated&#xD;
             with systemic therapy.&#xD;
