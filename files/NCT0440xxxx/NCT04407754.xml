  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, double-blind randomized clinical trial of letrozole and placebo&#xD;
      versus letrozole and inositols for up to 5 treatment cycles of ovulation induction or until&#xD;
      pregnancy is achieved. All participants and members of the research team will be blinded to&#xD;
      the treatment arms. Placebo and inositol supplement will be packaged to appear the same,&#xD;
      tested, and packaged by a commercial supply company. The inositols will be a 40:1 blend of&#xD;
      myo-inositol and D-chiro inositol.&#xD;

      At the screening visit, blood pressure and heart rate will be measured, weight and height&#xD;
      obtained and body mass index calculated (kg/m2). If not already completed at their new&#xD;
      patient visit, transvaginal ultrasound will be performed to assess uterine anatomy and obtain&#xD;
      antral follicle count, TSH, prolactin, and testosterone will be drawn, and serum samples will&#xD;
      be obtained and analyzed for metabolic parameters (fasting lipids, insulin, and complete&#xD;
      metabolic panel). One additional tube of blood will be drawn to store for potential future&#xD;
      analysis. Once enrolled, randomization will occur and subjects will start either inositols or&#xD;
      placebo. 84 women will be stratified by BMI and randomized 1:1 into two treatment arms, A)&#xD;
      &quot;Control Arm&quot; = twice daily placebo powder and B) &quot;Inositol Arm&quot; = twice daily myo-inositol&#xD;
      (2,000mg) plus d-chiro-inositol (50mg) supplement powder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with either placebo or inositol will begin upon randomization. Participants will&#xD;
      complete a validated quality of life in PCOS questionnaire (PCOSQ) at this visit and again&#xD;
      upon study completion (11). Treatment with letrozole will begin after the baseline visit,&#xD;
      which will occur after spontaneous menses or withdrawal bleeding induced by progestin&#xD;
      administration. Because of this timing, participants will undergo pretreatment with inositol&#xD;
      or placebo for a variable amount of time up to 6 weeks, with an anticipated average of 2-3&#xD;
      weeks. Metabolic parameters will be repeated after approximately 6 (7-9) and approximately 12&#xD;
      (11-13) weeks of inositol or placebo, at whichever study visit is most proximal in time to&#xD;
      this goal timeframe. Both groups will receive letrozole 5mg every day for 5 days on days 3-7&#xD;
      of their menstrual cycle and instructed on timing intercourse with anticipated ovulation&#xD;
      dates. Blood will be drawn for a serum progesterone each cycle between cycle days 20-22 to&#xD;
      confirm ovulation, and repeated 1 week later if the initial progesterone level is below the&#xD;
      threshold to confirm ovulation. Once ovulation is confirmed, they patient will expect a&#xD;
      period 7-10 days later. They will call with cycle day 1 of bleeding if it occurs to start&#xD;
      their next cycle of treatment, up to 5 cycles. If no bleeding occurs within the expected&#xD;
      timeframe, they will check a home pregnancy test and call with results. Patients will&#xD;
      complete medication side effect questionnaires at the first blood draw for progesterone of&#xD;
      each cycle. This will be reviewed same-day and in person with the research nurse coordinator.&#xD;
      Each patient will complete up to 5 cycles. Dose of letrozole will be increased in subsequent&#xD;
      cycles for non-response or late ovulatory response (ovulation later than the progesterone&#xD;
      blood draw) up to 10mg of letrozole a day. For patients with a second progesterone level&#xD;
      below the threshold to confirm ovulation (day 21 and day 28), the higher dose of letrozole&#xD;
      will be initiated following the receipt of the second low progesterone result. For patients&#xD;
      who do not ovulate on the maximum dose of letrozole, their study participation will be&#xD;
      considered complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected will include: demographic information and medical history [age,&#xD;
      race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), antral follicle count, length of infertility, prior&#xD;
      infertility treatment (yes or no), obstetrical history, medical history, surgical history,&#xD;
      current medication and allergy lists], partner information [age, race/ethnicity, BMI, general&#xD;
      medical health assessment, prior paternity history], transvaginal ultrasound results, and&#xD;
      serum studies [TSH, prolactin, progesterone, hCG levels, androgen levels (total and free&#xD;
      testosterone, SHBG), and metabolic factors (fasting lipid panel, fasting glucose, fasting&#xD;
      insulin, glucose:insulin ratio, HOMA-IR index)]. Questionnaires to be completed include:&#xD;
      PCOSQ validated questionnaire for PCOS-related quality of life, and a side effect&#xD;
      questionnaire about known side effects of letrozole and inositols. In addition to the&#xD;
      baseline transvaginal ultrasound, additional ultrasounds may be performed as indicated&#xD;
      clinically (including for establishing clinical pregnancy). Pertinent demographic and&#xD;
      clinical information on patients who are participating in the study will be entered into a&#xD;
      study database REDCap secure software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the reported clinical pregnancy rate for infertile PCOS patients treated with letrozole&#xD;
      of 31.3% (12) as the control group proportion (0.31) with a goal of 10% effect size (and&#xD;
      therefore treatment group proportion 0.41), an alpha of 0.05, and power of 0.8, our sample&#xD;
      size is estimated (for a full clinical trial) at ~361 in each arm. In considering the&#xD;
      previously observed drop-out rate of ~20% in a similar patient population (3), we estimate&#xD;
      that for a full clinical trial, we would need 452 participants randomized in each arm. Based&#xD;
      on previously published literature regarding estimation of pilot randomized trial sample&#xD;
      sizes, we will target 9% of this sample size for our pilot study to suggest or identify a&#xD;
      significant difference (13). In conclusion, our planned study size will be 42 participants in&#xD;
      each study arm.&#xD;
