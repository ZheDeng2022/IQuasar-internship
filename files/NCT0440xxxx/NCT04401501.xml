  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervicogenic headache is defined as unilateral headache associated with neck pain. Effect of&#xD;
      manual translatoric therapy of the upper cervical spine associated with cervical exercises in&#xD;
      these patients is currently unknown. Our aim was to determine if adding manual therapy to an&#xD;
      exercise and home-exercise program improved effects on symptoms and function in short- and&#xD;
      mid-term in patients with cervicogenic headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled study will be conducted with 40 subjects with cervicogenic headache.&#xD;
      Each group will receive four 20-minute sessions weekly and a home-exercise program. Upper&#xD;
      cervical flexion, flexion-rotation test, Impact Headache Test-6 (HIT-6), headache intensity,&#xD;
      craniocervical flexion test, pain pressure thresholds and Global Rating of Change&#xD;
      (GROC)-Scale will be assessed at end of the intervention, at 3- and at 6-month follow-ups.&#xD;

    <measure>Headache Intensity (HIT-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and post intervention (1 month), after 3 months and after 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Test-6 questionnaire (HIT-6) will be used to describe the degree of pain and disability caused by the headache, with a reliability higher than 0.70. The results are classified into four categories that score daily life impact of headache (little or none, some, substantial and severe.</description>

    <measure>Flexion-rotation test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and post intervention (1 month), after 3 months and after 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This test is used to see the amount of movement of the upper cervical spine and is the test most used in the literature. It is positive when there is a decrease of 10 degrees or more in the cervical rotation with maximum flexion, in a sense with respect to the contralateral or presents hypomobility of segment C1 with a mobility less than 32ยบ</description>

    <description>Active flexion of the upper cervical spine will be measured in standing position using a CROM device</description>

    <measure>Headache Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and post intervention (1 month), after 3 months and after 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Headache intensity will be assessed on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10 cm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Craniocervical flexion test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and post intervention (1 month), after 3 months and after 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This test will be used to measure the strength of the deep flexor muscles. The activation and resistance of the deep flexor muscles will be evaluated in five progressive pressure increases of 2 mmHg up to a maximum of 30 mmHg. The patient will pass to the next level after reaching one certain level three times.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Pressure Thresholds</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and post intervention (1 month), after 3 months and after 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain pressure thresholds will be measured using a digital algometer (Somedic AB Farsta, Somedic SenseLab AB, Sweden) with a round surface area of 1 cm2. Pressure will be applied at a rate of 1 kg/cm2/s, perpendicular to the skin. Pressure pain thresholds will be assessed over six points bilaterally with the subject in supine position: suboccipital region, C2-3, C5-6, elevator of scapula, trapezius and first metacarpal joint.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Raiting of Scale (GROC-Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and post intervention (1 month), after 3 months and after 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>GROC-Scale will be used to measure the personal evolution that the patient had experienced. This scale is considered to be an efficient way to score patients' perceived clinical change and test-reliability has shown to be excellent (ICC=0.90).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to self-treatment scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and post intervention (1 month), after 3 months and after 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale will be used in order to measure the adherence to self-treatment at home. Patients will be asked to choose between the following answers: &quot;I have done the exercises every day&quot;; &quot;I have performed the exercises 4-6 days a week&quot;; &quot;I have performed the exercises 1-3 days a week&quot;; &quot;I have performed the exercises less than 1 day a week&quot;; or &quot;I have not performed them&quot;.</description>
