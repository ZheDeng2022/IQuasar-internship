    <textblock>
      This study examines heart rate monitoring variability for the early detection of pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. Pancreatic cancer is a very difficult disease to detect early. This study is being&#xD;
      done to observe the heart rate variability in patients with pancreatic cancer compared to&#xD;
      undiagnosed individuals with increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer. This may help&#xD;
      researchers determine if pancreatic occurrences/recurrences (chance of coming back) can be&#xD;
      detected sooner through monitoring heart rate and activity.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether heart rate variability (HRV) is reduced in patients with pancreatic&#xD;
      ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) compared with individuals at increased risk of developing PDAC.&#xD;
      (Stage I) II. To assess the feasibility of long-term compliance using a wearable device.&#xD;
      (Stage II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess compliance with using a wearable device. (Stage I and II) II. To validate&#xD;
      effectiveness of virtual device training. (Stage I and II) III. To determine whether HRV is&#xD;
      reduced in participants at high-risk of developing PDAC. (Stage II) IV. To characterize&#xD;
      timing and occurrence of PDAC among high-risk without disease. (Stage II) V. To characterize&#xD;
      timing and occurrence of PDAC among participants at high-risk of developing PDAC. (Stage II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the relationship between changes in HRV relative to sarcopenia-related body&#xD;
      composition characteristics in PDAC patients. (Stage I) II. To investigate the relationship&#xD;
      between the pNN50 HRV measure and PDAC diagnosis. (Stage I and II) III. To compare changes in&#xD;
      sleep biometrics among all participants. (Stage I and II) IV. To evaluate changes in&#xD;
      health-related quality of life assessments among all participants. (Stage I and II) V. To&#xD;
      evaluate participant satisfaction with virtual device instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo HRV monitoring using an activity monitor (WHOOP) for a minimum of 5 days&#xD;
      weekly for up to 1 year in patients with newly-diagnosed PDAC and up to 5 years for patients&#xD;
      in high risk group.&#xD;
