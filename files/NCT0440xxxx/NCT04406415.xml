  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral nafamostat solution&#xD;
      administered t.i.d.. for up to 5 days in healthy volunteer adult subjects&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo a medical screening (Days -1 to -10) and, if eligible, informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained prior to 6 days of confinement at the clinic site. Up to 20 subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized. Subjects will be stratified to include an equal number of male and female&#xD;
      subjects who will receive active drug within each dose cohort, and an equal number of male&#xD;
      and female subjects in the combined placebo group. Separate groups of volunteers will be used&#xD;
      for each dose cohort. There will be 4 dose cohorts in this study with active drug doses of&#xD;
      10, 50, 100, and 200 mg nafamostat in succeeding cohorts. Each cohort of 5 subjects will&#xD;
      enroll 2 male and 2 female to receive active drug and 1 subject (male or female) to receive&#xD;
      placebo for a total of 20 subjects. The placebo subject from each cohort will be combined&#xD;
      into a placebo cohort that will have 4 subjects to compare to 4 subjects in each of the&#xD;
      active dose groups.&#xD;
