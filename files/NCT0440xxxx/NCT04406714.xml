  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death in the United States. In North&#xD;
      Carolina, as in many parts of the United States, CRC screening is substantially underused in&#xD;
      vulnerable and marginalized populations. Uninsured, underinsured, and medically underserved&#xD;
      populations rely on federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) for their healthcare and thus&#xD;
      patients served by North Carolina's FQHCs are particularly likely to benefit from efforts and&#xD;
      resources to improve CRC screening. The United States Preventive Services Task Force&#xD;
      recommends several tests to screen for CRC, including annual screening with a fecal&#xD;
      immunochemical test (FIT), for patients ages 50-75 years. Programs that include mailing FITs&#xD;
      to patients have shown promise as an effective means of increasing CRC screening, including&#xD;
      for vulnerable populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial is designed to assess the effectiveness, feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of mailing FITs from a central location to patients&#xD;
      served by FQHCs. This study also assesses the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      costs of delivering patient navigation from a central location to facilitate follow-up&#xD;
      colonoscopy for patients with a positive (abnormal) FIT result. To assess adherence to the&#xD;
      United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for annual screening with FIT,&#xD;
      we will mail eligible participants one FIT per year for up to two years.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effectiveness and feasibility: As part of this randomized controlled trial, our study team&#xD;
      will work with two FQHCs in North Carolina to identify patients who are eligible and due for&#xD;
      CRC screening according to the clinics' electronic health records. We will randomly select&#xD;
      and assign eligible patients to receive either the mailed FIT intervention or usual care in&#xD;
      waves, rather than defining the patient cohort at the beginning of the study, to more closely&#xD;
      align with a pragmatic approach that would occur in clinical practice. Among patients who&#xD;
      return a completed FIT and have a positive (abnormal) FIT result, a patient navigator will&#xD;
      call the patient to assess and resolve barriers to follow-up (diagnostic) colonoscopy. The&#xD;
      study team will conduct another round of mailings the following year. Participants will&#xD;
      remain in their originally assigned study arms. Participants in the intervention arm who&#xD;
      remain eligible for the study will be mailed another FIT and, if the FIT result is positive&#xD;
      (abnormal), will be offered navigation to follow-up (diagnostic) colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation assessment: We will survey FQHC providers to assess their perceptions of the&#xD;
      appropriateness, feasibility, and fit of the program. We also will administer a brief survey&#xD;
      to representatives of each FQHC to assess organizational climate, culture, and communication&#xD;
      patterns that may affect the implementation of the project. Following the survey, we will&#xD;
      conduct interviews with providers to better understand contextual factors that may affect&#xD;
      adoption, maintenance, and scalability of the SCORE CRC screening program. Also, we will&#xD;
      interview patients in the Mailed FIT (intervention) arm patients to better understand factors&#xD;
      that affect completion of a follow-up colonoscopy following a positive (abnormal) FIT result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost and cost-effectiveness: We will assess total cost (sum of fixed and variable costs) and&#xD;
      the incremental cost-effectiveness of the Mailed FIT (intervention) arm versus the usual care&#xD;
      arm, measured in cost per person screened for CRC. We will document all fixed and variable&#xD;
      costs associated with implementing the intervention, based upon personnel time tracking,&#xD;
      invoices, receipts paid, test kit and processing costs, postage and other mailing costs, and&#xD;
      other means.&#xD;
