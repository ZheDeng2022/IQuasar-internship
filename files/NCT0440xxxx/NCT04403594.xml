      Investigators will use muscular dry needling in the calf of one lower extremity, followed by&#xD;
      treadmill training with functional electrical stimulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first to combine a novel two-pronged approach to the management of&#xD;
      spasticity (tightness of the muscle) in the calf muscles. First, investigators will decrease&#xD;
      spasticity in an innovative way through dry needling. Second, investigators will follow this&#xD;
      spasticity reduction technique using external electrical stimulation applied to the calf,&#xD;
      while the participant walks on a harnessed treadmill (for safety). The investigators believe&#xD;
      modulating tone in the calf with dry needling will allow for improved strength with&#xD;
      electrical stimulation, while simultaneously improving the efficiency of the muscles during&#xD;
      walking. The investigators hypothesize that decreasing spasticity will result in enhanced&#xD;
      gait efficiency, and lower fatigue, all while allowing the participant to meet their personal&#xD;
      mobility goals.10 The investigators are proposing an innovative study design. Assessing&#xD;
      changes in muscle spasticity using electromyography and the Modified Ashworth scale before&#xD;
      and after each portion of our two-pronged intervention will enable them to understand the&#xD;
      immediate effects of dry needling, as well as the combined effects of function electrical&#xD;
      stimulation with with treadmill training. Following the intervention assessments with&#xD;
      pre-post functional tests will allow us to determine long term changes. This proposal offers&#xD;
      a unique approach to management of spasticity in people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), with&#xD;
      the advantage of being minimally invasive and inexpensive. Results of this pilot study will&#xD;
      inform the potential use in MS, and will allow for a larger study examining optimal&#xD;
      intervention parameters for future use.&#xD;

    <description>Electromyography (EMG) will be conducted at the start of the study and after 6 weeks. EMG is an electrodiagnostic technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. This is completed using electrodes that are placed on the skin, which detects the electric potential generated by muscle cells when these cells are electrically or neurologically activated. These action potentials are measured and recorded on a computer.</description>
