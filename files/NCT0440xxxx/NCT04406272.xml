  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a new viral cancer therapy, ofranergene obadenovec (VB-111),&#xD;
      for recurrent or progressive glioblastoma (GBM), a brain tumor that is growing or progressing&#xD;
      despite earlier treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, blinded, phase II, surgical trial. Phase II clinical trials&#xD;
      test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether it works in&#xD;
      treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied. It also&#xD;
      means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet approved this&#xD;
      intervention for recurrent or progressive glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, ofranergene obadenovec (VB-111) is the investigational drug being&#xD;
      studied. VB-111 has been studied in lab experiments and in other types of cancer, and&#xD;
      information from these studies suggest that it may be beneficial for recurrent or progressive&#xD;
      glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VB-111 works by targeting and damaging the blood vessels that grow and nourish cancerous&#xD;
      tumors leading to tumor starvation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits. After enrollment, participants will be randomized into one&#xD;
      of three study groups. Randomization means that participants are put into a group by chance.&#xD;
      Neither the participant nor the research doctor will choose what group a participant will be&#xD;
      in.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In group A participants receive VB-111 before and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In group B participants receive VB-111 after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In group C participants won't receive VB-111 but would receive standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be provided blindly, meaning participants do not know (are blinded as to) what&#xD;
      treatment they are receiving to ensure that the results are not affected by a placebo effect&#xD;
      (the power of suggestion). Participants will be given a study medication and it will contain&#xD;
      either VB-111 or placebo (IV solution with no medicine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VBL Therapeutics is supporting this research study by providing funding for the research&#xD;
      study and the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in this research study for as long as they do not have serious side&#xD;
      effects and their disease does not get worse. It is expected that about 45 people will take&#xD;
      part in this research study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor infiltrating T cell (TIL) density is defined as the number of T lymphocytes per nucleated cell, and calculated by detailed sequencing of recombined T cell receptor sequences obtained from the tumor specimen gDNA.&#xD;
A two-sample t-test with tumor size stratification will be used to test the difference of tumor infiltrating T cell density between the two groups (Group A vs combined Group B+C). Data distribution will be examined prior to analysis. Data transformations will be performed as deemed appropriate.</description>

    <measure>Rate of Dose Limiting Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>AEs graded using CTCAE version 5.0 criteria. Safety will be assessed by quantifying the toxicities and grades experienced by participants who have received VB-111, including serious adverse events (SAEs) All participants who receive at least one dose of VB-111/placebo will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment.</description>

    <measure>6-month progression-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the percentage of participants with progression-free survival at 6 months from surgery as defined by RANO. Recurrent/progressive GBM participants treated with VB-111 (Group A and Group B) compared to control (Group C), using RANO criteria</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>time from randomization until death from any cause up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS, analyses will be conducted using historical comparison data which are available from a pooled analysis of Phase II experience in recurrent Grade IV gliomas who have undergone surgery either just prior to starting treatment or as part of. Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves and median estimates from the KM curves will be provided as appropriate. Participants without efficacy evaluation data or without survival data will be censored at Day 1. For evaluation of the expansion of TCR clones, a two-sample T-test with Bonferroni adjustment will be used to compare the increase number of expanded TCR clones after VB-111 in Group A+B vs Group C.</description>
