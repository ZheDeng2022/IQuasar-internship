  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since its recent marketizing in France, the cannabidiol (CBD), a major component of cannabis,&#xD;
      is used in many over-the-counter products in France. Some painful patients or patients&#xD;
      suffering from addiction seem to use the CBD in search of therapeutic effects. Yet, there are&#xD;
      no data available for patients in algology and addictology, particularly with regard to the&#xD;
      prevalence of the use of CBD, the effects sought and felt. Faced with the emergence of the&#xD;
      use of a substance with a therapeutic purpose but outside a medical framework and without&#xD;
      monitoring of adverse effects, it becomes essential to characterize the use of CBD. The main&#xD;
      objective of the study is therefore to assess the prevalence of CBD users in algology and&#xD;
      addictology departments. Secondary objectives are to characterize the use of CBD as well as&#xD;
      the users of CBD, and to evaluate the impact of the use of CBD on other psychoactive&#xD;
      substances use or current drug treatments and the drug liking of CBD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physicians from algology and addictology departments will propose the study to all patients&#xD;
      who meet the inclusion criteria during a medical consultation (in hospitalization or&#xD;
      ambulatory care). If the patient agrees to participate, the non-opposition will be collected&#xD;
      and the physician will complete a short form with sociodemographic data, medical history and&#xD;
      contact details of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The form will be transmitted securely to the research staff that will perform a unique&#xD;
      research evaluation face to face (when the patient is still hospitalized and available) or by&#xD;
      phone (when the patient is not available during hospitalization or no longer hospitalized or&#xD;
      in case of ambulatory care). The research evaluation includes data about the frequency and&#xD;
      the duration of the use of all substances (CBD included) in the last 12 months and the&#xD;
      frequency of current drug treatments. For patients with CBD use in the last 12 months,&#xD;
      additional data regarding the use of CBD will be collected: the form, the route of&#xD;
      administration, the effects sought and felt, the method of obtaining, the impact on other&#xD;
      drugs and/or substances use and the drug liking of CBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive analysis will be carried out. The CBD user group and the CBD non-user group&#xD;
      will be compared on all the variables collected. A multivariate analysis will be carried out&#xD;
      in order to identify factors associated to CBD use in algology and addictology patients.&#xD;
