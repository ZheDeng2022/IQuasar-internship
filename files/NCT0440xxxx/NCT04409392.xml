  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus belonging to the human&#xD;
      commensal cutaneous flora, and has been little studied in the field of prosthetic joint&#xD;
      infections. However, it shares many virulence traits with Staphylococcus aureus, including&#xD;
      many adhesins and its ability to form biofilm, and the few series of cases reports a&#xD;
      significant failure rate.&#xD;
