    <textblock>
      As a single center, retrospective observation study in Guangdong Institute of Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Diseases, this study included the main study population of patients who underwent coronary&#xD;
      angiography and / or coronary intervention from January 2007 to Decemeber 2018. The&#xD;
      hospitalization information was collected in the form of direct derivation of the case, and&#xD;
      cardiac and renal adverse events were collected through outpatient recorder system. All-cause&#xD;
      death information was obtained from the Public Security and matched to the electronic&#xD;
      Clinical Management System of the Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital records.&#xD;

      This is a single center, retrospective observation study collecting data on 88938 coronary&#xD;
      angiography and / or coronary intervention patients from January 2007 to Decemeber 2018. Data&#xD;
      regarding demographic information, admission diagnoses and history of present illness,&#xD;
      biomarkers and details on preventive hydration and medications will be collected. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint of this study is All-cause mortality, and secondary endpoints are Adverse&#xD;
      Cardiovascular and Kidney Events.&#xD;
