    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is one of the most common infertility-related gynecologic disorder that affect&#xD;
      approximately 10-15% of women in reproductive age. The main symptoms are chronic pelvic pain,&#xD;
      infertility, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. There exists an average diagnostic delay of 7 year&#xD;
      but data widely varies between different countries. The current &quot;gold standard&quot; in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of endometriosis remains a laparoscopy. Since laparoscopy is an invasive surgical&#xD;
      procedure with its potential risk, the development of a non-invasive laboratory test would be&#xD;
      of great benefit in the early, clinical management of this diseaseIn the past few years,&#xD;
      lectins have become the focus of reproductive immunology, inflammation and autoimmunity.&#xD;
      Galectins (Gal) are beta-galactoside binding lectins that play a key role in the regulation&#xD;
      of the immune system, cell growth, adhesion, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Until now 13&#xD;
      different types of galectins have been found in humans, among them Gal-1-4, 7-9 and 12 were&#xD;
      detected in the normal endometrium. So far only Gal-1 and Gal-3 have been studied in relation&#xD;
      to endometriosis. In a recent pilot study, the investigators have shown that Gal-9 levels are&#xD;
      significantly elevated in the serum of endometriosis patients compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
      Gal-9 had a high sensitivity (94%) and specificity (93,75%), indicating better diagnostic&#xD;
      potential than that of other endometriosis biomarkers and of surgery as the current gold&#xD;
      standard.&#xD;

      Endometriosis is one of the most common infertility-related gynecologic disorder that affect&#xD;
      approximately 10-15% of women in reproductive age. The main symptoms are chronic pelvic pain,&#xD;
      infertility, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. The etiology and pathogenesis of endometriosis has&#xD;
      been widely investigated over the past 30 years. Although there are several concepts trying&#xD;
      to explain its development, but none of them can be applied for all types of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peak incidence of the diagnosis of endometriosis lies between the ages of 25 to 34,&#xD;
      although symptoms mostly develop much earlier. There exists an average diagnostic delay of 7&#xD;
      year but data widely varies between different countries: in the is UK 7.9 years, in the US&#xD;
      11.7 years, in Germany and Austria 7 years, in Spain 8 years, in Norway 6.7 years, in Ireland&#xD;
      and Belgium 5 years and in Hungary 3.9 years. Such a diagnostic delay is multifactorial, but&#xD;
      most importantly due to the lack of non-invasive diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current &quot;gold standard&quot; in the diagnosis of endometriosis remains a laparoscopy with a&#xD;
      sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 94%. Since laparoscopy is an invasive surgical&#xD;
      procedure with its potential risk, the development of a non-invasive laboratory test would be&#xD;
      of great benefit in the early, clinical management of this disease. Such a biomarker has the&#xD;
      enormous potential to improve quality of life, reduce the risks to the patient and the&#xD;
      enormous costs to society related to endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, several molecules involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis were investigated&#xD;
      as a potential biomarker, however the majority of them have proven inadequate for the&#xD;
      diagnosis. In the past few years, lectins have become the focus of reproductive immunology,&#xD;
      inflammation and autoimmunity. Galectins (Gal) are beta-galactoside binding lectins that play&#xD;
      a key role in the regulation of the immune system, cell growth, adhesion, apoptosis, and&#xD;
      angiogenesis. Until now 13 different types of galectins have been found in humans, among them&#xD;
      Gal-1-4, 7-9 and 12 were detected in the normal endometrium. So far only Gal-1 and Gal-3 have&#xD;
      been studied in relation to endometriosis. It was reported that Gal-1 had a cycle-dependent&#xD;
      expression in normal endometrial stromal cells, and its production was significantly elevated&#xD;
      in the early pregnancy decidua. In relation to endometriosis, Gal-1 was found to be more&#xD;
      abundantly expressed in ectopic endometriotic lesions when compared with the eutopic tissues.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the eutopic endometrium of the affected patients showed higher Gal-1 expression&#xD;
      than its normal counterparts. In addition to this, similar to Gal-1, Gal-3 was overexpressed&#xD;
      in various forms of endometriosis as well as in the eutopic endometrium of diseased women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously shown that Gal-9 mRNA was markedly overexpressed in the&#xD;
      eutopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis in comparison with healthy controls. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators results showed that besides the eutopic endometrium, Gal-9 was&#xD;
      also expressed in ectopic implants regardless of the localization of the lesions. The&#xD;
      investigators have determined that Gal-9 levels are significantly elevated in the serum of&#xD;
      endometriosis patients compared to healthy controls. Gal-9 has a high sensitivity (94%) and&#xD;
      specificity (93,75%), indicating better diagnostic potential than that of other endometriosis&#xD;
      biomarkers. The optimal cutoff point estimated from the Youden's index was 132 pg/mL, with a&#xD;
      sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 93.75%. Using this threshold, the positive predictive&#xD;
      value was 97.92% and the negative predictive value was 83.33%, with a prevalence of 75.76%.&#xD;
      The diagnostic accuracy of this test was 93.94%, indicating better diagnostic potential than&#xD;
      that other already published serum biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this previous results, the investigators suggest that Gal-9 is produced by ectopic&#xD;
      endometriotic implants, the investigators would like to determine the serum Gal-9 levels one&#xD;
      day before and after the surgery and at least 1-6 months later. The investigators aim is to&#xD;
      examine the serum Gal-1 and Gal-3 levels in endometriosis patients.&#xD;
