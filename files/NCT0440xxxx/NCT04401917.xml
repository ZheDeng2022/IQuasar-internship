  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to measure the extent of inflammation in the brain between&#xD;
      different groups of participants using a radioactive tracer called [18F]NOS. A radioactive&#xD;
      tracer is a type of imaging drug that is labeled with a radioactive tag and injected into the&#xD;
      body. This study will see how the tracer is taken up in the brain using an imaging scan&#xD;
      called Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo approximately 60 minutes of dynamic scanning of the brain starting&#xD;
      at approximately the time of injection of [18F]NOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are required to have a brain MRI performed within 1 year prior to study&#xD;
      enrollment, or if the subject has not had a brain MRI that is deemed acceptable for use for&#xD;
      this study they will be asked to undergo a research brain MRI after they have consented for&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
