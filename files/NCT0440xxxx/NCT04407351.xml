      Investigators aim to collaborate with the division of neurology, ophthalmology and&#xD;
      dermatology at the Kaohsiung Medical University, and make a new phototherapy for participants&#xD;
      suffering from dementia, sleep disorder, mild cognitive dysfunction by using IoT and data&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Solar light is an important environmental factor for all living organisms. With the&#xD;
      advancement of the lighting technology, artificial light, such as light emitting diode (LED),&#xD;
      has become another major lighting source. The influence of blue light and color temperature&#xD;
      emitted from LED light source in most of the commercial 3C electronics on human health has&#xD;
      been increasingly paid attention. Light exposure has been reported to be associated with&#xD;
      different physiological mechanisms and pathologic events, including sleeping, metabolism and&#xD;
      brain dysfunctions. However, lights are also applied in many therapeutic processes. Hence, it&#xD;
      is a critical issue to develop a next-generation lighting environment for health promotion&#xD;
      and improve the competitiveness of green-technology industries in Taiwan by integrating&#xD;
      biomedical researches and cutting-edge lighting technology. For developing next-generation&#xD;
      LED industry, the inspection technology and product standard on photobiology safety has been&#xD;
      established in Taiwan. Inspiringly, Researchers in Taiwan have made a LED structure that can&#xD;
      emit all the hues of sunlight by changing its terminal voltage, which may further facilitate&#xD;
      the use of future lighting device on health promotion. Based on these technical advancement,&#xD;
      in this project, investigators aim to integrate multidisciplinary investigations on animal&#xD;
      experiments, translational applications, and clinical trials to establish an good lighting&#xD;
      environment for participants with dementia and mild cognitive dysfunction, and bring benefits&#xD;
      to Taiwan's green technologies. To meet this goal, this project aims to integrate lighting&#xD;
      and information technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT) and data science analytics,&#xD;
      to investigate the lighting effects on human health by conducting animal and translational&#xD;
      experiments, and further promote the health in multiple testing groups across different&#xD;
      patients. In this project, investigators incorporate the research strengths in light&#xD;
      bioscience, environmental bioscience and medical engineering developed at National Health&#xD;
      Research Institutes (NHRI) and the lighting, IoT and data science technologies developed at&#xD;
      National Applied Research Laboratories (NARL). Additionally, investigators aim to collaborate&#xD;
      with the division of neurology, ophthalmology and dermatology at the Kaohsiung Medical&#xD;
      University, and make a new phototherapy for participants suffering from dementia, sleep&#xD;
      disorder, cognitive dysfunction by using IoT and data science on big health and environmental&#xD;
      data. By integrating multi-disciplinary technologies, investigators aim to promote health on&#xD;
      brain, mind and body for elderly people and susceptible population by providing a health home&#xD;
      lighting environment, which would be potentially beneficial to resolve the emerging issues of&#xD;
      aging, sub-health population, psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the&#xD;
      safety and molecular mechanism of phototherapy will be validated using animal models.&#xD;
      Industrially, this project will build a strong linkage between LED, information and health&#xD;
      promotion industries and upgrade the traditional LED industry by adding the novel application&#xD;
      on health promotion.&#xD;
