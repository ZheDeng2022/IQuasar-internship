      Parental Smartphone Use Management Scale (PSUMS) was originally developed in English language&#xD;
      to parents to educate adolescents and communicate with them about online behavior and safety,&#xD;
      as well as to conduct plans to manage adolescents' internet and smartphone use. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the PSUMS.&#xD;

      Parental Smartphone Use Management Scale (PSUMS) was originally developed in English language&#xD;
      to parents to educate adolescents and communicate with them about online behavior and safety,&#xD;
      as well as to conduct plans to manage adolescents' internet and smartphone use. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the PSUMS. The study will include&#xD;
      adults who have been using smartphones for at least the past month and have children aged&#xD;
      11-18. For cross-cultural adaptation, two bi-lingual translators used the back-translation&#xD;
      procedure. Within a 5-to-7 day period after first assessment, the participants completed the&#xD;
      Turkish version of the Parental Smartphone Use Management Scale (PSUMS) to evaluate&#xD;
      test-retest reliability. Cronbach's alpha (α) was used to assess internal consistency. The&#xD;
      correlations with the Turkish version of The Smart Phone Addiction Scale-Short Form for&#xD;
      Adolescent and the Turkish version of PedsQL in Adolescents 13-18 years old will determine to&#xD;
      check the validity.&#xD;

    <description>Prior to developing the PSUMS, an item pool was established by conducting a literature review and a focus group. The item pool contained 18 items. A 7-point Likert scale was used to rate the level of agreement with items, ranging from 0 (no efficacy at all) to 6 (very strong efficacy).</description>

    <measure>Smartphone Addiction Scale -Short form for adolescent Version (SAS-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (First assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>Smartphone Addiction Scale -Short form for adolescent Version (SAS-SF) is a self-report scale with 10 items rated on a 6-point Likert scale (1= largely untrue, 6= largely true). Higher scores from the scale indicate higher level of the smartphone addiction. . The validity and reliability study of the questionnaire was done in Turkish.</description>

    <measure>PedsQL in Adolescents</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (First assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>It is a general quality of life scale that evaluates the physical and psychosocial lives of children between the ages of 11-18. The scale prepared for the 13-18 age group has a parent and child form. The parent form is filled out by the caregiver and the adolescent form by the child included in the study separately and simultaneously. The most important features are that &quot;PedsQL in adolescents&quot; is short, it can be filled in about 5-10 minutes, and it is easy to apply and score by the researcher.</description>
