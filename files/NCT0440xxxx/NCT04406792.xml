  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obese mothers are vulnerable to pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (GDM). This ultimately elevates her risk of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) which increases&#xD;
      her cardiovascular risk. The post-partum period or &quot;fourth trimester&quot; may be an ideal time to&#xD;
      employ preventative strategies to alter her lifetime health-course. Unfortunately, black&#xD;
      mothers are less likely to follow up post-partum, less likely to be screened for T2DM and&#xD;
      less likely to be informed of the connection between pregnancy complications and&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is the &quot;gold standard&quot; for lifestyle intervention to&#xD;
      prevent T2DM in at risk patients. However, the DPP underperformed in Black women and can be&#xD;
      improved upon. The investigators propose a randomized controlled double blind trial entitled:&#xD;
      Alternative Lifestyle Interventions for the Prevention of Vulnerable Ethnic groups or ALIVE.&#xD;
      The ALIVE program will follow the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) curriculum as outlined by&#xD;
      the CDC using an online platform. However, this program will expand on the DPP's educational&#xD;
      program and provide trained community-based health care workers i.e doulas to administer&#xD;
      post-partum support via telehealth for the first 12 weeks post-partum. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to (1. Doula only x 12 weeks. 2. DPP only x 1 year or 3. ALIVE=doula+DPP). In&#xD;
      order to understand the biology that accompanies GDMtoT2DM transition, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct concomitant, longitudinal assessment of DNA methylation patterns to identify&#xD;
      differentially methylated genes important in the pathogenesis of T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that for Black participants with GDM, ALIVE will reduce&#xD;
      incidence of T2DM at two years and give biological insight into the susceptibility of&#xD;
      developing Type 2 DM using genome wide epigenomic profiling&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose this randomized double blind controlled clinical trial utilizing&#xD;
      institution and community partnerships to increase the rates of post-partum screening of T2DM&#xD;
      in Black women with a pregnancy complicated with GDM. The investigators also will implement&#xD;
      the ALIVE, a precision based approach to reduce and T2DM in Black women. The investigators&#xD;
      will gain biologic insights by linking the epigenome to the clinical phenotypes. Our&#xD;
      discoveries will be a forward leap in the quest to reduce cardiovascular risk contributed by&#xD;
      GDM and T2DM that lead to maternal morbidity and mortality.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      SPECIFIC AIMS Black and White mothers have similar prevalence of Gestational Diabetes&#xD;
      Mellitus (GDM). However, Black mothers are more likely to progress to Type 2 Diabetes&#xD;
      Mellitus (T2DM) and are less likely to be screened post-partum. Since GDM is a significant&#xD;
      risk factor for T2DM, the post-partum period is a window of opportunity to change a mother's&#xD;
      health course using preventative lifestyle medicine. Unfortunately, traditional post-partum&#xD;
      care has failed to engage, screen, and employ prevention measures against the development of&#xD;
      T2DM in Black mothers. Moreover, the fact that prevalence of GDM is similar in Blacks and&#xD;
      Whites but differs in progression to T2DM raises the question about the epigenetic&#xD;
      underpinnings as a biologic basis for GDM progressing to T2DM in Black women. GDM has been&#xD;
      linked to epigenetic modifications in obesity genes such as low-density lipoprotein&#xD;
      receptor-related protein 1B and leptin of infants and is a causal link to metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      in her offspring. In our preliminary data, maternal hyperglycemia in mice led to an increase&#xD;
      in placental mRNA expression of Angpt1 (endothelial gene) and Nr4a3 (pancreatic beta cell&#xD;
      gene). While it is well established that GDM leads to abnormal metabolic programming in her&#xD;
      offspring, the investigators do not know how the epigenome forecasts cardio-metabolic risks&#xD;
      to her.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the disparities in screening and prevention of T2DM in at risk Black mothers while&#xD;
      understanding the biologic basis for GDM to T2DM progression, the investigators propose&#xD;
      Mobilizing doulas to empower women in post-partum diabetes prevention: A randomized&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial that compares our precision-based lifestyle intervention to that of&#xD;
      the traditional Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in post-partum Black mothers with a history&#xD;
      of GDM. This study will expand on the DPP by providing specially trained community-based&#xD;
      health care workers (i.e doulas) to administer post-partum tele-health support for 12 weeks&#xD;
      before the start of the DPP. In order to understand the biology that accompanies GDMtoT2DM&#xD;
      transition, the investigators will conduct concomitant, longitudinal assessment of DNA&#xD;
      methylation patterns to identify differentially methylated genes important in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of T2DM. The investigators hypothesize that for Black participants with GDM,&#xD;
      ALIVE will increase screening adherence, reduce incidence of T2DM and give biological insight&#xD;
      into the susceptibility of developing T2DM using DNA methylation profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Increase adherence to post-partum screening recommendations for T2DM in individuals&#xD;
      with pregnancies complicated by GDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that deployment of doulas using telehealth visits in at risk&#xD;
      participants post-partum will result in adherence to post-partum screening for T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Using evidenced based community engagement stakeholder strategies, the investigators will&#xD;
      recruit recently post-partum women who experienced GDM during their pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Using telehealth, the investigators will deploy specially trained community doulas from&#xD;
      Homeland Heart Nashville Birth Collective to perform post-partum assessments, build healthy&#xD;
      habits, and ensure completion of screening for T2DM with a 2-hour 75gram GTT by 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Reduce incidence of T2DM at two years in participants with history of GDM The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that this program will be superior to the CDC DPP (online) in&#xD;
      reducing the incidence of T2DM at two years in participants with history of GDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. The investigators will execute this randomized controlled double masked trial comparing&#xD;
      three interventions: Doula only x 12 weeks, DPP online only x 1 year, or (doula x 12 weeks&#xD;
      +DPP online x 1 year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. The investigators will determine the prevalence of T2 DM in each group at two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Determine the epigenetic modifications that are associated with the progression of GDM&#xD;
      to T2DM after two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize the GDMtoT2DM progression has an epigenetic signature that is&#xD;
      distinct from GDM that does not progress to T2DM at two years and will give biological&#xD;
      insights regarding susceptibility to T2DM in black mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Blood drawn at the beginning and end of study will be banked at Vanderbilt. The phenotypes&#xD;
      of interest are:(GDM progressing to T2DM) and (GDM not progressing to T2DM). The&#xD;
      investigators will perform bisulphite sequencing to identify metabolic genes that are&#xD;
      differentially methylated between phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: This trial is a precision based intervention with the goal of reducing T2DM in at&#xD;
      risk black mothers with a history of GDM. It uses a novel, team-work approach to deliver&#xD;
      post-partum care to a vulnerable population by empowering the mother to implement practices&#xD;
      that will decrease her risk of T2DM. The investigators believe this study will also uncover&#xD;
      epigenetic modifications that predispose some women such as Black with a history of GDM to&#xD;
      develop T2DM.&#xD;
