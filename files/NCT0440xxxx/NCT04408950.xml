      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune system defends the body against disease. It has many different parts spread out in&#xD;
&#xD;
      the body, including in the blood and skin. To learn more about it, researchers want to study&#xD;
      samples from people with healthy immune systems and people with conditions that affect how&#xD;
      the immune system works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn about how the different parts of the immune system come together to make a whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 2 and older who have a condition that affects the immune system or have a family&#xD;
      member with such a condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical and medicine review. Other lab tests may also be&#xD;
      reviewed. Some participants will take a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give blood samples. They may also give saliva, stool, and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sterile cotton swab may be rubbed over their skin or inside the cheek or nose to collect&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants have samples collected as part of their regular medical care, their doctor&#xD;
      may be asked to send parts of the samples that otherwise would be thrown away. These samples&#xD;
      may be from biopsies, endoscopies, or other procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants may have optional skin punch biopsies. For this, their skin is numbed. Then&#xD;
      a tool removes 1 or 2 small pieces of skin from the forearm or thigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants medical records will be checked to see if they have any changes in their health&#xD;
      over time. If they have a study visit, they may talk about their medical history and have a&#xD;
      physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation lasts 5 years....&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Immunological disorders predispose affected individuals to a myriad of complications,&#xD;
      including infection, immune dysregulation with autoimmune disease and aberrant inflammatory&#xD;
      responses, and malignancy. Advances in genetic testing have propelled the discovery of the&#xD;
      genetic underpinnings of numerous immunodeficiencies. However, a more complete picture of the&#xD;
      immune system is needed to better characterize patients that present with the signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of immunodeficiency or immune dysregulation in whom there is no identifiable genetic&#xD;
      diagnosis. Many of our diagnostic tools, such as characterization of cell subset frequencies,&#xD;
      look at only one parameter in the immune system, which is typically insufficient to capture&#xD;
      the system s complexity. Systems immunology is a field of research aimed to identify and&#xD;
      understand how the different components of the immune system work together in a coordinated&#xD;
      manner to achieve its functions, such as protecting against pathogens and mounting effective&#xD;
      responses after vaccination. The goal of this study is to collect patient samples to more&#xD;
      deeply phenotype these individuals at the molecular and cellular levels using novel&#xD;
      technologies in order to generate hypotheses regarding disease etiologies and mechanisms in&#xD;
      subjects with an immune disorder without complete characterization or clear genetic etiology.&#xD;
      We also aim to validate a specific observation seen in a previous study of patients with&#xD;
      known monogenic immunological disorders. In the long-term, hypotheses generated in this study&#xD;
      that address clinically significant, actionable questions will be pursued as separate&#xD;
      investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hypothesis-generating sample collection study will recruit patients with unknown or&#xD;
      incompletely characterized immune defects and their unaffected relatives. Under this&#xD;
      protocol, samples will be collected at the NIH Clinical Center or mailed in for analysis&#xD;
      using systems biology approaches to generate hypotheses regarding the potential etiologies&#xD;
      and mechanisms of these immune defects. Initially, all subjects will give a blood sample and&#xD;
      may give additional samples including saliva, stool, and skin punch biopsies. Subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled for 5 years and may be asked to give additional samples based on scientific need&#xD;
      or changes in clinical status. Findings relevant to subjects health and medical care will be&#xD;
      returned to them and referring healthcare providers.&#xD;
