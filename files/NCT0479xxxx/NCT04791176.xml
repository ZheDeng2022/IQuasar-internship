      This is a single-arm, open-label study performed at our hospital, patients with progression&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) met inclusion criteria will be enrolled. Patients received&#xD;
      oral lenvatinib 12mg/day (for patients≥60 kg) or 8 mg/day (for patients&lt;60kg ) before local&#xD;
      radiotherapy 8 weeks, large lesions were treated with IMRT for 40-60gy / 20-30f. Combined&#xD;
      therapy will be taken until unacceptable treatment-related toxicities occurred or disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

(Note: Levatinib can be given to patients in four weeks before Radiotherapy is applied, so that it can control disease during waiting for Radiotherapy).
