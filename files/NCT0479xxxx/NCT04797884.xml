      The primary goal of this study is to gather efficacy data concerning overall survival with&#xD;
      electromagnetic fields when compared to a placebo amplitude-modulated radiofrequency&#xD;
      electromagnetic field device in subjects who have failed or are intolerant to at least two&#xD;
      previous systemic therapies.&#xD;

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The co-primary objectives of this study are to compare overall survival (OS) and quality of life between patients receiving active vs. placebo treatment with the TheraBionic device. Overall survival will be assessed on an intention to treat basis using a 2-sided log rank test to compare hazard rates between groups. Kaplan-Meier survival curves will also be generated and median survival and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be estimated for each group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Survey - EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary fixed effects of interest are treatment (TheraBionic device vs Placebo) and time (baseline and every 6 week) and the time by treatment interaction. The five dimensions of the survey include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The answers given to ED-5D permit to find 243 unique health states or can be converted into EQ-5D index an utility scores anchored at 0 for death and 1 for perfect health. The EQ-5D questionnaire also includes a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), by which respondents can report their perceived health status with a grade ranging from 0 (the worst possible health status) to 100 (the best possible health status).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) will be compared between groups using a 2-sided log rank test. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for PFS will also be generated and median progression free survival and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be estimated for each group</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Patients With Disease Control</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 months and 6 months and up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of patients who respond and the corresponding 95% Clopper Pearson exact confidence intervals. Patients who are removed from study before the 6-month time point will be considered to not have disease control at that time point.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Participants That Are Progression Free</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 weeks, 4 months and 6 months and up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>we will determine the proportion of patients who are progression free after 12 weeks (after 2nd 6-week visit) and compare this between groups using a Fisher's exact test. In addition, the corresponding 95% Clopper Pearson exact confidence intervals will be calculated for the 4 month and 6 month progression free survival rates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days after study treatment administration or until death</time_frame>
    <description>Using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], version 5.0, timing, seriousness, and relatedness of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities. These adverse events will be compared for each cytotoxic T Lymphocyte type between the two groups using the Fisher's exact test (two-sided) at level 0.05. These comparisons will be made to compare events of grade greater than or equal to 3 between each group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Alfa-Fetoprotein Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will examine whether these is any association between the AFP levels (potential biomarker for response) and the objective response observed for each participant. Average alfa-fetoprotein levels will be examined over time, and these changes in alfa-fetoprotein rates after 6 months will be examined for each Response category (complete response/ partial response/ stable disease/ progressive disease) and tested using a 1-way ANOVA to see if the change in AFP level differs by response category.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Survey - FACT Hepatobiliary</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and every 6 weeks up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary fixed effects of interest are treatment (TheraBionic device vs Placebo) and time (baseline and every 6 week) and the time by treatment interaction. Self-administered 45-item questionnaire on a 5 point Likert-type scale (0 not at all to 4 very much). Scoring range 0-180. Some items are reverse scored. Subscales are physical, social/family, emotional and functional well-being and hepatobiliary cancer subscale. Higher score indicates better quality of life.</description>
