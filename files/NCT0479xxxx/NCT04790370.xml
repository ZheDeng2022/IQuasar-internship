  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are many available treatments for pulmonary embolism (PE), but the best treatment for&#xD;
      this condition is not known. The HI-PEITHO study will compare two treatment options that are&#xD;
      both available on the market for the treatment of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either blood thinners (anticoagulation) or blood&#xD;
      thinners (anticoagulation) in combination with a device called the EkoSonicTM Endovascular&#xD;
      device to dissolve blood clots. Patients will be followed for 12 months after randomization&#xD;
      and have assessments while in the hospital as well as at 7 days, 30 days, 6 months and 12&#xD;
      months after randomization. The study will try to find out if one of these treatments is&#xD;
      better than the other at reducing the risk of death and other serious problems.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether ultrasound-facilitated, catheter-directed thrombolysis and&#xD;
      standard anticoagulation are associated with a significant reduction in the composite outcome&#xD;
      of pulmonary embolism (PE)-related mortality, cardiorespiratory decompensation or collapse,&#xD;
      or nonfatal symptomatic and objectively confirmed recurrence of PE compared to&#xD;
      anticoagulation alone within seven days of randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HI-PEITHO study has been designed to address the important gaps in clinical evidence by&#xD;
      comparing the clinical benefit of the ultrasound-facilitated local delivery of a low dose&#xD;
      thrombolytic agent and anticoagulation with those of anticoagulation alone in patients with&#xD;
      intermediate-high risk PE at a higher estimated risk of early decompensation based on&#xD;
      clinical parameters at presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has a focus on improving the safety of thrombolysis and advancing the concept of&#xD;
      intermediate-high risk and the PE severity criteria, to better identify patients who may&#xD;
      clinically benefit from thrombolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will contribute further evidence to the existing data on the&#xD;
      treatment and outcomes of acute, intermediate-high risk PE and provide controlled data&#xD;
      related to catheter-based interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered by the site into an electronic database. The database will include data&#xD;
      checks to compare data entered into the database against predefined rules for ranges and&#xD;
      consistency with other data fields in the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site monitoring will take place with source data verification to assess the accuracy and&#xD;
      completeness of registry data by comparing the data to medical records and study assessments.&#xD;

In contrast, the scale has been developed to help users become aware of current functional limitations in patients who have suffered a VTE, whether or not as a result of the specific VTE, and to objectively determine the degree of disability,</description>
