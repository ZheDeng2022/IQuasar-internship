  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dextrose prolotherapy is a form of treatment in which hypertonic dextrose solution is used as&#xD;
      a stimulant solution and regeneration is increased by stimulating the body's natural healing&#xD;
      mechanisms after injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the dextrose prolotherapy applied with home exercise&#xD;
      program and saline injections as a control group in patients who applied to our clinic with&#xD;
      knee pain and diagnosed with chondromalacia patella, and to investigate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      dextrose and saline on the job to determine the superiority of the injections to each other.&#xD;

      The study was designed as prospective, randomized, controlled trial. 48 people who met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria were randomized into two groups of 24 people. The first group will be&#xD;
      designated as Dextrose Prolotherapy Group and dextrose prolotherapy and exercise program will&#xD;
      be applied to these patients. Patients in the second group will be designated as the Serum&#xD;
      Physiological Group, and injections with saline and home exercise program will be applied in&#xD;
      accordance with the prolotherapy protocol.Participants were evaluated with Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scale (VAS), Patello Femoral Pain Severity Scale (PFPSS), Kuala Patellofemoral Scoring System&#xD;
      (KPSS) and Short Form 36 (SF-36).Knee cartilage thickness measurements and the presence of&#xD;
      suprapatellar effusion of the participants whose evaluations are completed will be evaluated&#xD;
      bilaterally by ultrasonography and the findings will be recorded.&#xD;

    <time_frame>initial, 4th week 7th week 24th week changes</time_frame>
    <description>Kuala Patellofemoral Scoring System was used to determine the functional levels of the patients. Participants were evaluated over a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100 points.</description>

    <measure>Short Form-36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>initial, 4th week 7th week 24th week changes</time_frame>
    <description>Short Form (SF-36) was used to investigate the quality of life of the patients.The reliability and validity of the Turkish version of SF-36 has been demonstrated. SF-36 consists of 36 questions on eight different subscales including physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health perceptions, energy and fatigue, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and general mental health. Each subscale of SF-36 is scored between 0 and 100, and higher scores show better QoL.</description>
