    <textblock>
      Taking pulse as a disease diagnosis process has a long history in traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine (TCM). Ancient physicians used the common attributes of pulse conditions and&#xD;
      finger-feeling characteristics as a basis for pulse classification, which &quot; position, rate,&#xD;
      shape and tendency &quot; is the principle for pulse differentiation. However, it is not easy to&#xD;
      express feelings of hands in a scientific way and not easy for clinical teaching and&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develope a new direction of pulse diagnosis in TCM by deep learning and integrative&#xD;
      time-frequency domain analysis maybe can be solved the problem.&#xD;

      Taking pulse as a disease diagnosis process has a long history in traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine (TCM). Ancient physicians used the common attributes of pulse conditions and&#xD;
      finger-feeling characteristics as a basis for pulse classification, which &quot; position, rate,&#xD;
      shape and tendency &quot; is the principle for pulse differentiation. However, it is not easy to&#xD;
      express feelings of hands in a scientific way and not easy for clinical teaching and&#xD;
      practice. The modernization of pulse diagnosis in Taiwan originated in the 1970s. By using&#xD;
      pressure waves of the radial artery, two methods were developed : time-domain analysis and&#xD;
      frequency domain analysis. Dr. Huang used time-domain analysis combined with frequency-domain&#xD;
      analysis of 6-sec pulse waves, to quantify 28 pulse patterns in TCM. Professor Wang measured&#xD;
      a single pulse wave and performed Fourier transformation to obtain the corresponding 12&#xD;
      meridian frequency spectrum, but it is very different from the clinical practice of pulse&#xD;
      diagnosis. Our team found that the frequency-domain and the tim-domain analysis can be&#xD;
      integrated if Fourier transformation integral formula is applied. Because the extracted data&#xD;
      is big, the characteristic values of time and frequency domain analysis are calculated and&#xD;
      judged by deep learning method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to use the &quot; Integration analysis of time-domain&quot; method to&#xD;
      extract the characteristic values of the radial pulse, and then use deep learning for model&#xD;
      training. That is, after measuring the pulse waves at different positions and depths of the&#xD;
      bilateral radial arteries, by using the pulse diagnostic instrument, to initial signal&#xD;
      processing and to get a single pulse. Then Fourier transformation is performed to obtain the&#xD;
      magnitude and phase parameters of the 12 harmonics (24 variables in total), and then extract&#xD;
      7 time-domain characteristic parameters of a single pulse. The next step to perform Fourier&#xD;
      transformation again using the 6-second pulse waves to obtain high and low frequency spectrum&#xD;
      by using above parameters. The feature parameters obtained by the above two analysis methods&#xD;
      are simultaneously sent to the deep learning-convolution neuron network (CNN) training. Since&#xD;
      the pulse wave changes of the radial artery are related to time, CNN combined with&#xD;
      long-short-term memory work (LSTM) is also used to do the above-mentioned model training. It&#xD;
      is set to compare the differences between the pulse waves of healthy subjects and subjects&#xD;
      with the suboptimal health status. It is also proved whether the frequency-domain analysis&#xD;
      analysis method by Professor Wang and the time-domain analysis method by Dr. Huang is the&#xD;
      same through the deep learning training process. It is possible to develope a new direction&#xD;
      of pulse diagnosis in TCM by deep learning and integrative time-frequency domain analysis.&#xD;

        &quot;Sub-healthy state&quot; is defined as a condition where there is no illness but unhealthy. It&#xD;
        causes abnormal psychological and physiological changes under internal and external&#xD;
        environmental stimulation, but it has not yet reached the level of obvious pathological&#xD;
        response.&#xD;
