  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial. Alongside, a health economic&#xD;
      study and a process evaluation study will be conducted. Participating patients will be&#xD;
      allocated to either progressive exercise therapy and patient education or usual care at a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio. The primary outcome is change in self-reported pain measured with Copenhagen Hip and&#xD;
      Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) from baseline to 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of progressive exercise therapy and patient education compared with usual&#xD;
      care will be reported in the primary trial paper, including the primary outcome and the&#xD;
      following secondary outcomes: HAGOS symptoms, HAGOS function in daily living (ADL), HAGOS&#xD;
      function in sport and recreation (sport/recreation), participation in physical activity&#xD;
      (participation), quality of life (QOL), impact of hip disease with the Short Version of the&#xD;
      international Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-12), lower limb reach length (anterior, posteromedial,&#xD;
      posterolateral), single-leg hip for distance (SLHD) test and hip muscle strength (flexion,&#xD;
      extension and abduction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this trial is to investigate the effectiveness of randomisation to&#xD;
      progressive exercise therapy and patient education compared with randomisation to usual care&#xD;
      on changes in self-reported pain measured with HAGOS over a 6-month follow-up in patients&#xD;
      with hip dysplasia, who are not candidates for PAO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis: Patients randomised to progressive exercise therapy and patient&#xD;
      education will improve at least 10 points more in HAGOS pain compared with those randomised&#xD;
      to usual care over a 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effectiveness of randomisation to progressive exercise therapy and&#xD;
           patient education compared with randomisation to usual care on changes in HAGOS&#xD;
           symptoms, HAGOS ADL, HAGOS sport/recreation, HAGOS participation, HAGOS QOL and iHOT-12&#xD;
           over a 6-month follow-up in patients with hip dysplasia, who are not candidates for PAO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effectiveness of randomisation to progressive exercise therapy and&#xD;
           patient education compared with randomisation to usual care on changes in functional&#xD;
           performance over a 6-month follow-up in patients with hip dysplasia, who are not&#xD;
           candidates for PAO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effectiveness of randomisation to progressive exercise therapy and&#xD;
           patient education compared with randomisation to usual care on changes in hip flexion,&#xD;
           extension and abduction strength over a 6-month follow-up in patients with hip&#xD;
           dysplasia, who are not candidates for PAO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A full trial protocol will be published and made publicly available. In continuous outcomes,&#xD;
      between-group comparison from baseline to 6-month follow-up will be analysed with either an&#xD;
      unpaired t-test or a mixed effect model with patient as a random factor and time and&#xD;
      allocation group as fixed factors. In dichotomous outcomes, between-group comparison from&#xD;
      baseline to 6-month follow-up will be analysed with the pseudo-observation method using&#xD;
      cumulative risk difference as measure of association. Outcomes for the primary trial paper&#xD;
      will be measured at baseline, 3- and 6-month follow-up and analysed using intention-to-treat&#xD;
      analyses. In this paper, all collected outcomes will be listed, and it will be described that&#xD;
      the below listed will be reported in other papers (i.e. health economic study and process&#xD;
      evaluation study) and secondary papers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the health economic study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the cost-utility and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of randomisation to progressive exercise therapy and patient education&#xD;
      compared with randomisation to usual care over a 12-month follow-up in patients with hip&#xD;
      dysplasia, who are not candidates for PAO. Outcomes for this paper wil be measured at&#xD;
      baseline, 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratio (ICER) will be calculated by dividing the difference&#xD;
      in costs by the difference in effects (quality-adjusted life years and HAGOS pain). The&#xD;
      investigators will use the method of bootstrapping to estimate the 95% confidence intervals&#xD;
      around cost differences and the uncertainty surrounding the ICERs. Uncertainty will be shown&#xD;
      in cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Sensitivity&#xD;
      analyses will be performed to test the robustness of the study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the process evaluation study, the investigators aimed to evaluate progressive exercise&#xD;
      therapy and patient education in a process evaluation in terms of implementation, mechanics&#xD;
      of impact and contextual factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery of the exercise therapy intervention and patient education will be evaluated in&#xD;
      terms of implementation covering fidelity (i.e. quantify if intervention is delivered as&#xD;
      intended), dose (quantify numbers of and time in supervised sessions and numbers of&#xD;
      home-bases sessions), and reach (quantify pattern in uptake and adherence by baseline patient&#xD;
      characteristics). Mechanics of impact will be evaluated in terms of experiences of&#xD;
      interactions between the intervention providers, patients in the intervention group and the&#xD;
      intervention, evaluated by interviewing 15-20 patients at baseline and at 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
      Context will be evaluated in terms of any external influences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The below listed will be reported in secondary papers with a clear reference to the primary&#xD;
      trial paper and trial registration, and it will hold &quot;secondary analyses from a randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial&quot; in the title.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1: By using instrumental-variable analysis with adherence as exposure and randomisation as an&#xD;
      instrument, the investigators aimed to investigate the efficacy of progressive exercise&#xD;
      therapy and patient education compared with usual care on changes in HAGOS subscales, changes&#xD;
      in functional performance and changes in hip muscle strength over a 6-month follow-up in&#xD;
      patients with hip dysplasia, who are not candidates for PAO. 2: The investigators aimed to&#xD;
      investigate if muscle-tendon pain and pain sensitisation (temporal summation of pain and&#xD;
      pressure pain threshold) modify the relationship between randomisation to exercise therapy&#xD;
      and patient education compared with randomisation to usual care on changes in HAGOS&#xD;
      subscales, functional performance and hip muscle strength over a 6-month follow-up in&#xD;
      patients with hip dysplasia, who are not candidates for PAO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators plan to evaluate the psychometric properties of HAGOS and&#xD;
      iHOT-12 in patients with hip dysplasia, who are not candidates for PAO, and finally, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to describe if hip osteoarthritis progresses over 5 and 10 years using the&#xD;
      Tönnis osteoarthritis classification in patients with hip dysplasia, who are not candidates&#xD;
      for PAO.&#xD;

    <description>Over a period of 6-month, patients will be offered eight individual physiotherapist-supervised training sessions. In these sessions, patients will be instructed in a home-based progressive exercise therapy programme and given patient education. The programme includes four exercises covering strength and stability training. The exercises will be performed in sets of three with a minimum of 5 repetitions, and patients will be instructed to perform a minimum of three training sessions each week. Each of the exercises can be progressed through three levels of difficulty levels, allowing for individualised treatment with regard to exercise quality and perceived exertion according to Borg CR10 scale. Exercises will be performed on a perceived exertion level from somewhat hard (level 5) to very hard (level 7). Patient education includes pain management, focus on exercise adherence and progression, and advice on physical activity.</description>
