  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter Phase Ib/II registration clinical study, consisting of two&#xD;
      parts: the Phase Ib dose-climbing study and the Phase II efficacy exploration study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib is a multicenter, single-arm study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of SCC244 combined with Toripalimab in patients with advanced relapsed&#xD;
      or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have failed standard therapy.At the start of the&#xD;
      study, MTPI2 was used to guide toxicity monitoring and dose climbing in combination with&#xD;
      Toripalimab (240mg intravenous every 3 weeks), with 5 subjects planned to be enrolled in each&#xD;
      dose group.The SMC will decide whether to add the new dose level and sample size based on the&#xD;
      latest study data available.The MTD or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) will be determined&#xD;
      during the phase Ib study on the basis of the latest availablestudy data, and the phase II&#xD;
      study will commence once the MTD or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study evaluating the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      a recommended dose of glumetinib combined with Toripalimab in patients with relapsed,&#xD;
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have failed standard therapy.The SMC determined the&#xD;
      dose group for the Phase II study based on the safety and initial efficacy data of the Phase&#xD;
      Ib subjects.Approximately 62 evaluable subjects will be enrolled, with the recommended dose&#xD;
      of glutmetinib once daily and Toripalimab 240mg every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 21 days is a treatment cycle until the subject develops disease progression,intolerable&#xD;
      toxicity, has used JS001 for 2 years, the informed consent is withdrawn, the investigator&#xD;
      considers that the subject should not continue the medication, lost to follow-up, death&#xD;
      occurs, or the study is terminated, whichever comes first.&#xD;
