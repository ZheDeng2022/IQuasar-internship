  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will test the hypothesis that immune system disequilibrium / dysfunction&#xD;
      explains why preoperative cognitive impairment is a strong predictor of postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity in older surgical patients. The investigators propose that cognitive impairment&#xD;
      influences surgical morbidity because of underlying immune disequilibrium / dysfunction (risk&#xD;
      marker) and that this shapes the immune response to surgery and defines immunological&#xD;
      hallmarks of postoperative morbidity (disease marker). The overarching goal of this&#xD;
      application therefore is to define and better understand the clinical immunology underlying&#xD;
      the relationship between cognition and geriatric surgical morbidity.&#xD;

      This project is designed as a prospective, single-center observational study. The cohort will&#xD;
      consist of 600 consenting subjects ≥ 65 years of age that agree to have a study investigator&#xD;
      speak with them during their preoperative evaluation prior to elective spine surgery. These&#xD;
      ages are chosen as significant clinical data demonstrate increased cognitive impairment in&#xD;
      community dwelling elders. Eligibility criteria include: patients ≥ 65 years of age with an&#xD;
      American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification of I-III&#xD;
      presenting for elective spinal surgery. Exclusion criteria will include history of stroke&#xD;
      (not including transient ischemic attacks, or TIAs) or brain tumor, a history of autoimmune&#xD;
      disorders, medications likely to significantly impact inflammation (e.g. steroids), current&#xD;
      infection, uncorrected vision or hearing impairment (unable to see pictures or read or hear&#xD;
      instructions); limited use of the dominant hand (limited ability to draw); and or inability&#xD;
      to speak, read, or understand English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be introduced to the study through a flyer provided to them as part of a packet&#xD;
      from their surgeon's office. A study team member will speak with those who have agreed during&#xD;
      their preoperative evaluation to discuss studies from the department of Anesthesiology and&#xD;
      satisfy eligibility criteria. After obtaining informed verbal consent over the telephone,&#xD;
      study staff will gain information about the patient's age and years of education. Study staff&#xD;
      will conduct the following preoperative measures over the telephone: the Geriatric Depression&#xD;
      Scale-Short (GDS), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS),&#xD;
      the Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illness, and Loss of Weight scale (FRAIL), Instrumental&#xD;
      Activities of daily living (IADLs), the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), the World Health&#xD;
      Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS). In addition, all patients will be asked&#xD;
      if they've had a fall within the last 6 months, whether they've been evaluated for a change&#xD;
      in memory or thinking, who accompanied them to their appointment, their employment status and&#xD;
      their living situation (alone, institutionalized, living with family members), and whether&#xD;
      they have ever tested positive for COVID-19 in a patient survey. The study staff will&#xD;
      administer the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) simple cognitive screening tool that&#xD;
      takes less than 10 minutes to complete and has little or no education, language, or race&#xD;
      bias. Frailty will be measured using the Frail Scale. Other measures of cognitive impairment&#xD;
      will be obtained by study staff through: documentation on the patient's standard preoperative&#xD;
      form, patient or informant report of diagnosis or evaluation for cognitive impairment or&#xD;
      memory concerns, and systematic medical record review. Each enrolled patient will be advised&#xD;
      to expect a follow up telephone up to 3, 6, and 12- months after surgery to verify data&#xD;
      elements and reassess functional outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium will be assessed prospectively once per day on postoperative days 1, 2, and/or 3 by&#xD;
      a trained study team member using the Confusion Assessment Method [CAM] if the patient&#xD;
      remains in the hospital and agrees to the evaluation. Delirium by chart review and CAM-ICU&#xD;
      scores from the nursing staff will also be documented. Delirium is most common on&#xD;
      postoperative days 1-3 and the CAM is a well-validated measure of delirium in surgical&#xD;
      patients. To evaluate cognition and functional status, the MOCA and the WHODAS will be&#xD;
      administered 3, 6, and 12- months postoperatively by study staff over the telephone if the&#xD;
      patient can be contacted and continue to agree to participate. The investigators will also&#xD;
      collect information on secondary outcomes including whether they had a surgical procedure,&#xD;
      time to postoperative anesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge, discharge to place other than&#xD;
      home (rehabilitation, skilled nursing facility), hospital length of stay (LOS), 30-day&#xD;
      reoperation or readmission rate, and 30-day, 6-month, and 1-year mortality when available.&#xD;
      These outcomes are recorded in the medical record, the BWH Balanced Scorecard, an electronic&#xD;
      database of all hospitalized patients that tabulates 31 elements of the hospital event, or&#xD;
      the Brigham and Women's Hospital BWH Research Patient Database Enhanced Query. Data will also&#xD;
      be confirmed by a follow up telephone interview.&#xD;
