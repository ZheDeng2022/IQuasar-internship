  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the effects of the external electrical stimulation (EES) added to pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscle training (PFMT) on stress urinary incontinence (SUI) were investigated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty one women with mild and moderate SUI symptoms were included in the study. The patients&#xD;
      were divided into three groups of PFMT (n:17), EES (n:17) and PFMT+ EES (n:17) by block&#xD;
      randomization. The PFMT was applied every day of the week, and EES was applied 3 days a week&#xD;
      for 8 weeks. Pelvic floor muscle strength (PFMS), pelvic floor muscle endurance, subjective&#xD;
      perception of improvement, severity of incontinence, quality of life, pelvic floor&#xD;
      dysfunction (PTD) and urinary parameters were assessed as outcome variables. All&#xD;
      measurements, except subjective perception of improvement were investigated before and after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be treated with the Innovo device using eight external electrodes with a combined stimulator. Electrodes will be applied to the buttocks, outer hips and anterior and posterior proximal thighs 3 days a week for 30 minutes each session.&#xD;
While explaining the exercise to the patients, it was stated that 1 set of exercise consisted of 10 fast contractions and 10 slow contractions. For the first 2 weeks, they were asked to exercise 2 sets a day, every day. Thus, in the first 2 weeks, 20 fast contractions and 20 slow contractions were performed. Then, 2 sets were increased every two weeks and the exercise was ended as 8 sets (80 fast and 80 slow contractions) at the end of the 8th week.</description>
