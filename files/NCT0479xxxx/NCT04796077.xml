  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluated an educational pop-up book about general anesthesia induction as an&#xD;
      interactive, child-focused preoperative education resource for pediatric patients undergoing&#xD;
      outpatient surgery. The study's objectives were to evaluate the book as an educational tool&#xD;
      and to understand the book's effects on patient and caregiver perceptions of the surgical&#xD;
      experience. The study's hypotheses were that preoperative education from the pop-up book,&#xD;
      compared to standard care, would more effectively reduce children's fear and expected pain,&#xD;
      facilitate more positive views of the procedure and preoperative explanations, encourage&#xD;
      adaptive coping strategies, reduce behavioral anxiety at anesthesia induction, and increase&#xD;
      caregiver satisfaction with the surgical experience.&#xD;

    <masking_description>An observer-rated behavioral anxiety outcome was masked (raters were blinded to patient group assignments). Other measures were patient self-report (unmasked).</masking_description>
  </study_design_info>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Observer-Rated Behavioral Anxiety at Anesthesia Induction as assessed by the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale-Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline anxiety was rated upon initial entry into the preoperative holding area; anxiety at induction was rated while patients received inhalational induction via an anesthesia mask.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' behavioral anxiety at anesthesia induction was assessed relative to baseline using the observer-rated modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale-Short Form. The scale ranges from 22.92-100; higher scores indicate greater anxiety (worse outcomes). Raters were preoperative nurses and circulating nurses blinded to group assignments.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear of Anesthesia Induction as assessed by the Children's Fear Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Fear was rated after education and before premedication was administered.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients self-reported their fear of anesthesia induction using the Children's Fear Scale. The scale ranges from 0-4; higher scores indicate greater fear (worse outcomes).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Expected Pain from the Anesthesia Mask and During Surgery as assessed by the Faces Pain Scale-Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>Expected pain was rated after education and before premedication was administered.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients self-reported how much pain they expected (1) from the anesthesia mask and (2) while asleep for the surgical procedure using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised. The scale ranges from 0-5; higher scores indicate greater expected pain (worse outcomes).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Expectations about the Procedure, Attitudes about Anesthesia, and Views of Preoperative Explanations as assessed by a Likert-Scale Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>The outcomes were rated after education and before premedication was administered.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients self-reported their perceptions of the procedure and preoperative explanations (the pop-up book or provider consultation) using a 9-item Likert-scale questionnaire. The questionnaire was scored from 1-5; higher scores indicated more positive views (better outcomes).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Reported Coping Strategies for Managing the Stress of Anesthesia Induction</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients were interviewed after education and before premedication was administered.</time_frame>
    <description>In a prospective interview, patients reported coping strategies for managing the stress of anesthesia induction. Greater frequencies of adaptive coping strategies indicated better outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Satisfaction with the Surgical Experience as assessed by a Likert-Scale Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>The questionnaire was administered after the patient underwent anesthesia induction.</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers reported their satisfaction with the surgical experience using a 10-item Likert-scale questionnaire. The questionnaire was scored from 1-5; higher scores indicated more positive views (better outcomes).</description>
