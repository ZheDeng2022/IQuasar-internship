  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical obstruction of the small intestine is an interruption of intestinal transit due to&#xD;
      an organic obstacle in the digestive tract that results in a shutdown of materials and gas.&#xD;
      Without medical care, it can lead to perforation of the intestinal wall and acute&#xD;
      peritonitis. It accounts for 4% of emergency department admissions and 20% of emergency&#xD;
      surgeries&#xD;

      The abdominopelvic tomodensitometric examination is the gold standard for making a diagnosis&#xD;
      and identifying the cause, the level of the lesion and looking for signs of severity related&#xD;
      to the risk of ischemia of the intestinal tissue. Well characterized, these signs remain&#xD;
      difficult to identify for a non-expert radiologist. The evaluation of the detection&#xD;
      performance of these signs shows a sensitivity between 63 and 100% and a specificity between&#xD;
      61 and 96% with a great variation according to the signs studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research project aims to develop a tool for the detection of the three main signs of&#xD;
      severity of mechanical intestinal obstruction to raise and standardize the level of detection&#xD;
      of the risk of ischemia on abdominal CT images.&#xD;
