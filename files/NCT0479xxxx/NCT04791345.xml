  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucocorticoids (GC) were included in the list of banned substances in sports in 1986,&#xD;
      because of evidences of positive effects on physical performance and the important health&#xD;
      risks associated with its consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the fact that GC are commercialized in a variety of pharmaceutical forms and are&#xD;
      administered in different ways, it is necessary to establish discrimination criteria to&#xD;
      guarantee the therapeutic use of these drugs and to prevent doping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discrimination criteria between allowed and prohibited administrations of GC must be specific&#xD;
      for each of the compounds. Further studies are needed to provide discrimination criteria&#xD;
      related to oral administration of GC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conduct excretion studies with dexamethasone, methylprednisolone and deflazacort in order&#xD;
      to define notification levels and wash-out periods after the administration of a single dose&#xD;
      (DEX, MP and DEF) or repeated doses (DEX and MP) of these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-randomized, open-label, pharmacokinetics clinical trial where a single dose of DEF, MP&#xD;
      and DEX and also a multi-dose of DEX and MP will be administered orally to healthy volunteers&#xD;
      (total n=50).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has established a general notification level of 30 ng/mL&#xD;
      for GC to discriminate allowed and not allowed administrations. However, recent studies have&#xD;
      proven that the use of a unique criteria is not adequate given the diversity of&#xD;
      administration routes, doses and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties of each&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to conduct additional studies using dexamethasone (DEX),&#xD;
      methylprednisolone (MP) and deflazacort (DEF) in order to generate additional data of urinary&#xD;
      concentrations and wash-out periods after single and repeated oral doses of these drugs.&#xD;
