    <textblock>
      Single-center, prospective pilot study on patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis fitted&#xD;
      with noninvasive ventilation. The objective is to assess the satisfaction of remote&#xD;
      monitoring of patients on non-invasive ventilation after 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The non invasive ventilation is one of treatments used during the amyotrophic lateral&#xD;
      sclerosis when patients have a chronic respiratory failure with alveolar hypoventilation&#xD;
      signs. It is demonstrated to improve quality of life and prognosis of the disease. These&#xD;
      patients, often severely disabled, generally have a negative experience of repeated&#xD;
      hospitalizations. Despite everything, medical and paramedical monitoring is necessary,&#xD;
      especially when they are fitted with non invasive ventilation (NIV). A quarterly reassessment&#xD;
      is recommended . The possibilities of telemonitoring at home have grown considerably in&#xD;
      recent years. In addition, the fans are currently able to remotely transfer a certain amount&#xD;
      of data to the service provider, making remote monitoring feasible.Our project therefore aims&#xD;
      to assess the feasibility of remote monitoring of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis&#xD;
      (ALS) fitted with non invasive ventilation (NIV) through the assessment of their&#xD;
      satisfaction, using both medical data and data provided by the ventilator. It is a&#xD;
      single-center, prospective pilot study on 30 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&#xD;
      fitted with noninvasive ventilation. Patients will benefit from a quarterly teleconsultation&#xD;
      to assess the study criteria through questionnaires during 12 months. Ventilation machines&#xD;
      make it possible to carry out remote monitoring, with the help of healthcare providers.&#xD;
