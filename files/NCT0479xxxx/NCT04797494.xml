  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). The aim of the study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      necessity to test the desired increased Vertical Dimension of Occlusion (VDO) prior to&#xD;
      restorative treatment of generalized tooth wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tooth wear is a physiological phenomenon, that when becoming pathological, can result in&#xD;
      functional problems such as pain, reduced quality of life and esthetic impairment.&#xD;
      Restorative treatment should be discussed with patients with severe or pathological tooth&#xD;
      wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The restorative treatment of generalized tooth wear includes restoration of teeth,&#xD;
      separately, in increased VDO. The increment of VDO is based upon clinical parameters such as&#xD;
      the amount of natural tooth tissue, the possibility to lengthen the anterior teeth in regard&#xD;
      to an acceptable esthetics outcome, and the Free Way Space (FWS). The FWS is the&#xD;
      intermaxillary space when the masticatory-muscles-complex is relaxed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, it is believed that adapting to a new VDO results in clinical difficulties&#xD;
      such as different speech, pain of the Temporo Mandibular Joint (TMJ), masticatory muscle&#xD;
      pain, and increased masticatory muscles activity. The latter could result in an increased&#xD;
      bite force and (possibly) an increased failure rate of restorations. Some operators, then,&#xD;
      prefer to test the increment of VDO prior to restorative treatment to check if patients can&#xD;
      adjust to the new VDO. This raises the question if the needed increment of VDO to restore&#xD;
      worn dentitions should be checked prior to restorative treatment. The hypothesis in this&#xD;
      study is that testing the needed increment of VDO prior to restorative treatment does not&#xD;
      improve the restorative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with generalized severe tooth wear were included and restoratively treated with&#xD;
      composite restorations. Prior to restorative treatment, patients were randomized to either&#xD;
      receiving an acrylic Removable Appliance (RA) or no RA. The RA was worn for 3 weeks prior to&#xD;
      restorative treatment and included the intended increment of VDO. These patients were asked&#xD;
      to wear the RA during the whole day, except when eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After restorative treatment, patients revisited our dental clinic after 1 month and after 1&#xD;
      year. Quality of life was assessed with questionnaires. FWS was assessed clinically.&#xD;
      Restorations were checked for clinical acceptability, including small materials fractures.&#xD;

      This study is a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). The aim of the study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      necessity to test the increased Vertical Dimension of Occlusion (VDO) prior to restorative&#xD;
      treatment of generalized tooth wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tooth wear is a physiological phenomenon, that when becoming pathological, can result in&#xD;
      functional problems such as pain, reduced quality of life and esthetic impairment.&#xD;
      Restorative treatment should be discussed in with patients with severe or pathological tooth&#xD;
      wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The restorative treatment includes restoration of all teeth, separately, in increased VDO.&#xD;
      The increment of VDO is based upon clinical parameters as the amount of loss of natural tooth&#xD;
      tissue, the possibility to lengthen the maxillary anterior teeth in regard to an acceptable&#xD;
      esthetic outcome, and the Free Way Space (FWS). The FWS is the intermaxillary space when the&#xD;
      masticatory-muscles-complex is relaxed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, it is believed that adapting to a new VDO results in clinical difficulties&#xD;
      such as different speech, pain of the Temporo Mandibular Joint (TMJ), masticatory muscle&#xD;
      pain, and increased masticatory muscles activity. The latter could result in an increased&#xD;
      bite force and an increased failure rate of restorations. Some operators, then, prefer to&#xD;
      test the increment of VDO prior to restorative treatment to check if patients can adjust to&#xD;
      the new VDO. This raises the question if the needed increment of VDO to restore worn&#xD;
      dentitions should be checked prior to restorative treatment. The hypothesis in this study is&#xD;
      that testing the needed increment of VDO prior to restorative treatment does not improve the&#xD;
      adaptation to the restorative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research was registered in the ClinicalTrial.gov register after the study had been&#xD;
      completed. This RCT is part of RCT with a 2x2 design. The first branch was used to randomize&#xD;
      patients to certain restorative protocol, which was enlisted in ClinicalTrials.gov&#xD;
      (NCT04326816). The second branch was designed to test the VDO prior to restorative treatment&#xD;
      of generalized severe tooth wear. Approval of the local Medical-Ethics-committee (METC) for&#xD;
      the 2x2 RCT was sought and granted in 2010. Approval was granted to a protocol in which no&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Board was appointed as research standards were different in 2010. The&#xD;
      study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and in&#xD;
      accordance with the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation base done by a biostatistician. Calculations were completed based&#xD;
      upon the first branch of the 2x2 RCT. A group size of 75 patients was established. Anonymized&#xD;
      paper case report forms were completed at each moment and stored. A separate digital database&#xD;
      was made and used for data analysis. Data analysis consisted of descriptive analysis of&#xD;
      failed restorations and paired t-Test with a significance level of 5%. Serious Adverse Events&#xD;
      (SAE) report files and Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) report files&#xD;
      were present and could be, when necessary, filled in and applied to the local METC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were recruited as General Dental Practitioners (GDP) referred patients with&#xD;
      generalized tooth wear to the academic clinic. Patients were seen by 1 operator and were&#xD;
      assessed for eligibility. Patients received a written informed consent and were included if&#xD;
      the informed consent was signed. Patients received an identification number C1 to C49. A&#xD;
      randomization was performed on the use of a removable appliance to test the VDO prior to&#xD;
      restorative treatment. Randomization with a block size of eight was performed. The random&#xD;
      sequence was put into envelopes. The investigator opened the envelope in their numbered order&#xD;
      and assigned the patient to the corresponding group immediately after the consent was&#xD;
      acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A laboratory-made acrylic Removable Appliance (RA) was evaluated to test the adaptation of&#xD;
      the patient to the increment of VDO. In the control group, no RA was prescribed prior to&#xD;
      restorative treatment. In the test group, a RA was prescribed prior to restorative treatment.&#xD;
      Patients were asked to wear the RA for 24h per day, with the exception for when eating,&#xD;
      during a period of 3 weeks. Thereafter, the acceptance was checked using a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection was done at predetermined moments i.e., baseline, immediately after&#xD;
      treatment, 1 month after treatment, 1 year after treatment. During the recall moments, Oral&#xD;
      Health-related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) was assessed using questionnaires, as was the FWS. In&#xD;
      addition, restorations were checked based on clinical acceptability and all failures were&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No specific Quality assurance plan to address data validation and registry procedures,&#xD;
      including site monitoring and auditing was made prior to the onset of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data checks were completed by 1 researcher. Source data verification to assess the accuracy,&#xD;
      completeness, and representativeness was completed by 1 researcher. Medical records&#xD;
      (Electronic patient files), digital photos made at recall appointments, and paper case report&#xD;
      forms were inspected. No specific source data verification plan was made prior to the onset&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
