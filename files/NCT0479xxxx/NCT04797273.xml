  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress-related mental illness is common and one of the main causes of sick leave in Sweden.&#xD;
      Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a promising treatment, but access to treatment is low. In&#xD;
      a previously conducted study, we found that internet-based CBT in comparison to a waitlist&#xD;
      control group was effective in reducing symptoms of stress. The aim of the present study is&#xD;
      to take the next step and compare Internet-based CBT for stress-related disorders to an&#xD;
      active control condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non traumatic stress-related mental illness, in this study operationalized as adjustment&#xD;
      disorder or exhaustion disorder, is highly prevalent in the general population and associated&#xD;
      with high societal costs relating to productivity loss. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is&#xD;
      the most well-studied psychological treatment and has demonstrated promising effects in terms&#xD;
      of symptom reduction. The overall evidence-base for CBT for these disorders is however fairly&#xD;
      week and access to treatment is low. In a previously published randomized controlled trial we&#xD;
      found that internet-based CBT can yield large effects on core symptoms of stress for these&#xD;
      disorders. Delivering CBT via the internet has the large advantage of enabling increased&#xD;
      accessibility as each therapist can have up to 80 patients in ongoing treatment. In the&#xD;
      previously conducted trial we compared the treatment to a waitlist control and between-group&#xD;
      comparisons of treatment effects were only done at post-treatment as the waitlist condition&#xD;
      was crossed over to treatment after this time point. It is now therefore important to take&#xD;
      the next step and investigate the effects of internet-based CBT in comparison to an active&#xD;
      control condition. The primary aim of this study was to compare two internet-based&#xD;
      treatments, CBT vs. structured treatment-as-usual, for adjustment disorder and exhaustion&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;

    <description>This is a 12-week treatment, delivered via an online treatment platform. The treatment components in this treatment are designed to be similar to what is typically provided in primary care to these patients and includes information about stress and how different factors such as eating habits, physical exercise, and alcohol can contribute to stress problems. The treatment content is provided through written texts, images and audiofiles in the treatment platform.
