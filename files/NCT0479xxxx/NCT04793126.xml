  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a prevalent problem that affects women's quality of life women&#xD;
      with POP may present with a variety of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For POP patients with concomitant urinary symptoms, urodynamic (UDN) testing is proposed for&#xD;
      proper evaluation of cases and identification of the pathophysiologic events in each case&#xD;
      individually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective study, the investigators aim to describe the urinary symptoms and&#xD;
      urodynamic findings concomitant with POP before and after surgical treatment of POP. We also&#xD;
      aimed at defining the role of UDN in decision-making regarding the treatment of POP when&#xD;
      associated with LUTS.&#xD;
