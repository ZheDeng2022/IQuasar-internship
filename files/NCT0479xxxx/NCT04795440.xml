  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with oligospermia in the ejaculate or previous ICSI failures if it concurs with&#xD;
      high DNA fragmentation, it has been hypothesized that the use of sperm obtained from the&#xD;
      testicle would improve the clinical results, since a source of damage to the spermatic DNA is&#xD;
      post-testicular in its storage in the epididymis and thus could be avoided. The clinical&#xD;
      information available so far is low, of low quality and all the studies present certain&#xD;
      limitations susceptible to improvements in further investigations before giving a definitive&#xD;
      answer to patients in these circumstances, about whether they should opt for testicular&#xD;
      biopsy or for the use of semen in the ejaculate.The intention proposed in our project, is to&#xD;
      demonstrate whether using testicular sperm, compared to those available in an ejaculate in&#xD;
      these cases, offers a clinically and statistically significant increase in chromosomally&#xD;
      normal embryos available that may lead to better reproductive performance of the cycles, in a&#xD;
      design never before done, where half of a patient's oocytes are inseminated from ejaculated&#xD;
      sperm and the other half from sperm obtained in the testicular biopsy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Since its first description in 1992, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has been widely&#xD;
      used to overcome all forms of severe male factor infertility. Despite achieving acceptable&#xD;
      success rates with the use of abnormal sperm, studies suggest that poor sperm quality can be&#xD;
      detrimental to ICSI outcomes. Sperm DNA plays a critical role in normal embryonic development&#xD;
      because the genetic information passed on to the next generation depends on its integrity&#xD;
      (6-8). Deterioration of sperm DNA content has been associated with several conditions,&#xD;
      including lifestyle and exposure to gonadotoxins, varicocele, infections in the male&#xD;
      accessory glands and advanced paternal age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) tests measure the proportion of sperm with damaged chromatin,&#xD;
      using probes or stains to identify DNA breaks with the aid of fluorescence microscopy, light&#xD;
      microscopy or flow cytometry depending on the type of method. Regardless of the analytical&#xD;
      method, DNA fragmentation is more common in the sperm of infertile men than fertile men.&#xD;
      Among couples undergoing ICSI, high SDF in the ejaculate is found in 30% of men and is&#xD;
      generally associated with abnormal conventional semen parameters. But this high SDF is also a&#xD;
      relatively common finding in infertile men with normal semen parameters, up to 20% - 40%&#xD;
      according to some authors. Aside from the questionable need to routinely use SDF test during&#xD;
      the evaluation of male infertility, recent evidence indicates that knowing the FAE can be&#xD;
      clinically informative in estimating the results to be obtained with assisted reproductive&#xD;
      techniques (ART). Although sperm with fragmented DNA can fertilize an oocyte with apparently&#xD;
      similar efficacy to sperm without DNA fragmentation, the negative impact of damaged paternal&#xD;
      chromatin is generally manifested during the development of the embryos produced, leading to&#xD;
      developmental blockage, implantation failure or early embryo loss, thus decreasing the&#xD;
      success of ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the many strategies proposed to overcome SDF in couples undergoing ART, the use of&#xD;
      testicular sperm instead of ejaculate in males without azoospermia has gained increased&#xD;
      attention, due to recent results published by various groups. The biological plausibility of&#xD;
      using testicular sperm for ICSI in men with high SDF in the ejaculate is based on&#xD;
      observations of less DNA fragmentation in sperm from the testis compared with sperm from the&#xD;
      ejaculate. The alteration of sperm chromatin integrity in ejaculated sperm from infertile men&#xD;
      may be explained, first, because chromatin compaction is still ongoing during epididymal&#xD;
      transit. Secondly, because excessive ROS can be generated in epididymal epithelial cells&#xD;
      under stress factors such as high temperatures and environmental conditions. Finally, certain&#xD;
      endonucleases can cleave the DNA of mature live sperm and, as a result, sperm DNA damage can&#xD;
      occur by different pathways, including hydroxyl radical, nitric oxide, and activation of&#xD;
      sperm caspases and endonucleases, thus explaining the positivity for SDF in ejaculated sperm&#xD;
      or sperm from infertile men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the concept that oxidation-induced sperm chromatin damage can occur in the&#xD;
      post-testicular environment or in epididymal transit and storage, and that sperm recovery&#xD;
      with improved chromatin integrity can be achieved if the epididymis is bypassed, has led&#xD;
      researchers to explore the use of testicular sperm for assisted reproductive treatments.&#xD;
      Because of the relevance of the clinical decision to resort to the use of testicular sperm&#xD;
      for ICSI, especially because of the inherent risks and clinical implications of such an&#xD;
      intervention, the potential benefit of testicular sperm for ICSI needs to be clarified in&#xD;
      these cases and, thus, to determine the potential improvement that it could allow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our most recent work led us to examine the available evidence regarding ICSI outcomes with&#xD;
      testicular sperm (Testi-ICSI) and ejaculated sperm (Ejac-ICSI) among non-azoospermic&#xD;
      infertile men with confirmed post-testicular damage through a systematic review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis of the available information, where we compared: 1) ICSI outcomes of Testi-ICSI&#xD;
      and Ejac-ICSI among infertile men with high SDF (as defined in each study) in the ejaculate;&#xD;
      and 2) SDF rates among testicular sperm and ejaculates of infertile men regardless of whether&#xD;
      or not ICSI data were provided. Taking into account: 1) study population (history of ICSI&#xD;
      failure versus no prior history of ICSI failure); 2) semen analysis profile of participants&#xD;
      (oligozoospermia vs. normozoospermia); 3) method of SDF testing; and 4) method of sperm&#xD;
      retrieval, and finding conflicting evidence regarding the use of Testi-ICSI in nonazoospermic&#xD;
      men and the inherent risks of complications after sperm retrieval, it is necessary to clarify&#xD;
      whether any particular male infertility population may derive benefit from this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five studies compared SDF levels between ejaculated and testicular sperm for 143 patients who&#xD;
      served as their own controls. The mean SDF rates in testicular and ejaculated sperm were 8.9&#xD;
      ± 5.1% and 33.4 ± 12.8% (P &lt;.0001), respectively. Overall, the results indicated that SDF&#xD;
      rates were lower in testicular sperm than in ejaculate with the mean difference being 24.58%&#xD;
      (95% CI 32.53 to 16.64); I2 = 92%; P &lt;.001. To assess heterogeneity, we performed a subgroup&#xD;
      analysis according to the method used to assess SDF. Four studies used TUNEL assay and one&#xD;
      study, the SCD test. With TUNEL, pooled results indicated lower rates of SDF in testis sperm&#xD;
      than in ejaculates, with a mean difference of 19.78% (95% CI 22.35% to 17.21%; I2 = 15%; P&#xD;
      &lt;.001). In the only study using the SCD method, the mean difference was 32.4% (95% CI 34.85%&#xD;
      to 29.95%; P &lt;.001) in favor of testicular sperm.Regarding clinical pregnancy rates (CPR),&#xD;
      four studies provided CPRs for 379 Testi-ICSI and Ejac-ICSI embryo transfers in patients with&#xD;
      high AEF. The results indicated that CPRs were higher with Testi-ICSI than with Ejac-ICSI,&#xD;
      being 50.0% and 29.4% (P &lt;.001), respectively, with an OR of 2.42 (95% CI, 1.57 to 3.73; I2 =&#xD;
      34%; P &lt;.001). Subgroup analysis by study population and semen profile revealed that the&#xD;
      observed pooled effect size was larger for failed ICSI in studies with normozoospermic men,&#xD;
      with greater improvement in Testi-ICSI observed in couples with no history of ICSI failure&#xD;
      and oligozoospermic men, although differences between subgroups were not statistically&#xD;
      significant. The consistency in the direction of effect across all studies increased&#xD;
      confidence in the results of a positive outcome effect of Testi-ICSI in CPR.When considering&#xD;
      miscarriage rates in four studies between 151 Testi-ICSI and Ejac-ICSI clinical pregnancies&#xD;
      in patients with high AEF. The results indicated that for miscarriage the rates were reduced&#xD;
      with Testi-ICSI compared with Ejac-ICSI, being 9.4% and 29.1% (P&lt;.002), respectively, with an&#xD;
      OR of 0.28 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.68; P = 0.005; I2 = 11%). The observed pooled effect size was&#xD;
      larger for studies involving couples with a history of ICSI failure and normozoospermia than&#xD;
      without a history of ICSI failure and oligozoospermia, although the difference between&#xD;
      subgroups was not statistically significant. Regarding live newborn rates (LBR), two studies&#xD;
      reported LBRs for 272 embryo transfers of Testi-ICSI and Ejac-ICSI in patients with high SDF.&#xD;
      The results indicated that LBRs were higher with Testi-ICSI than with Ejac-ICSI, being 46.9%&#xD;
      and 25.6% (P &lt;.001), respectively, with an OR of 2.58 (95% CI 1.54-4.35; I2 = 0, P &lt;.001).&#xD;
      These results were consistent in suggesting a positive effect of Testi-ICSI on TRNV among men&#xD;
      with high SDF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the studies included in our meta-analysis used TUNEL assay, which has been considered&#xD;
      the most accurate method for predicting pregnancy in ART, with an area under the receiver&#xD;
      operating characteristic curve of 0.71 (95% CI 0.66-0.76). Four of the studies applied the&#xD;
      cutoff value of 30% sperm with fragmented DNA in pure semen to discriminate between normal&#xD;
      and high SDF samples (34, 37, 40, 41), and the remaining studies used thresholds of 29%, 15%,&#xD;
      and 7%. Notably, three of the four studies providing Testi-ICSI and Ejac-ICSI data agree on&#xD;
      the cutoff value used to classify patients with high SDF. Therefore, despite the controversy&#xD;
      as to which sperm DNA test and threshold values should be adopted clinically, our results&#xD;
      suggest that Testi-ICSI is beneficial when SDF values exceed 29%. Many conditions associated&#xD;
      with SDF may be correctable, including varicocele, lifestyle factors, and genital infections,&#xD;
      and potentially enable or improve the possibility of natural conception or allow the use of&#xD;
      ejaculated sperm for ICSI. In other cases, testicular biopsy may be an option to&#xD;
      consider.Finally, despite having low overall DNA damage, testicular sperm may have higher&#xD;
      rates of aneuploidy. In a recent paper, SDF rates were almost three times lower in testicular&#xD;
      sperm than in ejaculated counterparts (14.9± 5.0% vs. 40.6± 14.8%; P&lt;.05), but aneuploidy&#xD;
      rates for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y were higher in the former (12.4%± 3.7% vs. 5.7%±&#xD;
      1.2%; P&lt;.05). Nevertheless, the data do not show an increased risk of malformations in&#xD;
      offspring generated from ICSI cycles using testicular sperm, but continued monitoring is&#xD;
      required until the safety of this strategy is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that the quality and number of available studies on Test-ICSI in the context of high&#xD;
      SDF is still limited, further studies are required, particularly randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      that evaluate different aspects still unresolved in previous work. For example, none of the&#xD;
      studies genetically analyzed the available embryos, nor their quality, let alone the&#xD;
      cumulative rates obtained with frozen embryos, and subsequently in subsequent thawed cycles.&#xD;
      The calculation of the results, estimating embryo transfer as the denominator, is introducing&#xD;
      a negative bias, that is, unintentionally hiding a greater effect of the intervention, by&#xD;
      selecting among the available embryos those with better characteristics, and taking into&#xD;
      account only the contribution of these (thus making the differences between the groups to be&#xD;
      compared smaller). Any intervention carried out in relation to spermatozoa must take this&#xD;
      limitation into account, since it affects the entire embryo cohort, not just the embryos&#xD;
      transferred, and thus the magnitude of the effect of the intervention is not adequately&#xD;
      assessed. This would improve the adequacy of the effect size estimate and allow a better&#xD;
      judgment of the clinical significance of our findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the study of semen samples after freezing and thawing/capacitation allows&#xD;
      control of iatrogenic damage caused by laboratory manipulation, which had not been previously&#xD;
      considered, and the control of the female contributing factor to reproductive success that is&#xD;
      missing in previous studies would also be considered in our work, by statistically&#xD;
      controlling for potentially influential variables. For the time being, our meta-analysis&#xD;
      indicates that FAE rates are lower in testis sperm than in ejaculated sperm and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes are higher for men with confirmed post-testicular SDF when Testi-ICSI rather than&#xD;
      Ejac-ICSI is used. Therefore, the existing literature supports the recommendation to use&#xD;
      Testi-ICSI in select groups of men with confirmed post-testicular SDF in ejaculate. Given the&#xD;
      generally low to moderate quality of the studies reviewed and the potential risks associated&#xD;
      with sperm retrieval, the need for further confirmatory evidence using an alternative&#xD;
      prospective approach is warranted. At present, Testi-ICSI should be reserved for men with&#xD;
      substantial AEF undergoing ART, particularly those who have experienced repeated ICSI&#xD;
      failures and when measures to correct other underlying factors causing SDF have failed.&#xD;
