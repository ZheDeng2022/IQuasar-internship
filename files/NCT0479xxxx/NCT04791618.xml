    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to test whether a technology application(Health360x) that&#xD;
      lets participants set goals for better health and track health can help participants reduce&#xD;
      their heart disease risk. Investigators will compare life style intervention using Health360x&#xD;

      technology in the form of Health360x to support participant efforts to change health&#xD;
      behaviors.&#xD;

    <measure>Life Simple 7(LS7 the metrics for defining ideal cardiovascular health) score at 6-month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The LS7 score consists of 4 behavioral and 3 clinical measures. The behavioral measures are smoking, body Mass Index (BMI), physical activity and healthy dietary pattern. The clinical measures are blood pressure, total cholesterol and fasting plasma glucose.Each LS7 component will be given a point score of 0, 1, or 2 to represent poor, intermediate, or ideal health, respectively. Then, an overall LS7 score ranging from 0 to 14 will be calculated as the sum of the LS7 component scores. The overall LS7 score will be further classified as inadequate (0-4), average (5-9), or optimum (10-14) cardiovascular health.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form-12 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-12) is a measure of general physical and mental health.&#xD;
The SF-12 consists of 12 items with a Likert-type response format that measures quality of life with a Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). Subscales associated with the PCS include physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, and general health perceptions. Subscales associated with the MCS include vitality (energy and fatigue), social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. The total score for each subscale ranges from 0 to 100 and low values represent a poor health state while high values represent a good health state.</description>

    <measure>Change in High-sensitivity C-reactive Protein (HsCRP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>C-reactive protein (CRP) is a biomarker of cardiovascular health which increases in the blood when inflammation is present. The Hs-CRP test can measure low levels of CRP which indicate the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). A measurement of less than 1.0 milligrams of CRP per liter of blood (mg/L) is defined as low risk, 1.0 to 3.0 mg/ L is average risk, and above 3.0 mg/L is high risk of developing CVD</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Plasma Cysteine</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma cysteine is a biomarker of oxidative stress, which is implicated in the pathophysiology of multiple conditions including cardiovascular disease (CVD). Higher levels of cysteine are associated with increased risk of CVD.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cystine</measure>

    <description>Cells expressing CD34 antigen (a protein encoded by the CD34 gene) are called CD34+ cells and can be isolated from blood samples. CD34+ cell count is a biomarker of regenerative capacity and reduced counts of CD34+ is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Carotid-femoral artery pulse wave velocity (PWV) will be determined using transcutaneous Doppler flow velocity recordings simultaneously over the common carotid artery and the femoral artery. Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) estimates of the speed of the pressure wave traveling along the aorta and is regarded as a direct measure of large artery stiffness. Normal ranges for PWV are age based (PWV increases with age) and standardized thresholds for CVD risk have not been established. This study will assess the change in PWV in participants between baseline and after the 6 month intervention</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI) is a measure of microvascular endothelial function that is calculated as a ratio of preocclusion to postocclusion pulse signal amplitude. RHI will be estimated using digital pulse amplitude tonometry (EndoPAT). Greater RHI indicates better endothelial function.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Glutathione</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in circulating progenitor cells (CPC) CD34+/CD133+</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Progenitor cells (PCs), including CD34+/CD133+ cells, are part of the mechanisms underlying regeneration, and the pivotal role they play in vascular repair has only recently been appreciated. Endogenous PCs contribute to reendothelialization of tissues after endothelial injury, attenuating progression to frank atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction correlates with PC number and function and a low PC count appears to be an independent predictor of poor outcome in patients with CAD, stroke or acute lung injury. CD34+/CD133+ cell counts improved risk prediction metrics beyond standard risk factors.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) CD34+/VEGF2R+</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Augmentation Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Augmentation index (AIx) is a composite measure of the magnitude of arterial wave reflections and systemic arterial stiffness and increases as the aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) increases. Impaired arterial elastic properties, measured as the aortic AIx and/or PWV, are increasingly recognized as independent predictors of incident CVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization), as well as all-cause mortality.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Carotid Intima Media Thickness (CIMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>A CIMT scan is performed by using ultrasound determine the presence and severity of vascular disease. Presence of carotid plaque is associated with a 2-3-fold increased risk of future CVD events, and increased CIMT is associated with prevalent cardiovascular disease and an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Progression of CIMT has been used as a surrogate marker of change in CVD risk.</description>
