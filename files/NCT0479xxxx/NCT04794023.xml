  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AQUARIUZ ablation laser is a solid-state laser and has been CE approved for corneal&#xD;
      surgery since March 2020 for the treatment of short- and longsightedness with and without&#xD;
      astigmatism. The aim of this study is to collect the first clinical data. Safety and&#xD;
      performance are examined here. The treatment with AQUARIUZ is comparable to treatments with&#xD;
      an excimer laser, with the difference that these are operated with gas. Solid-state lasers&#xD;
      and excimer lasers use the same process for tissue ablation, with a small difference in&#xD;
      wavelength. This difference manifests itself in the lower involvement of water in the&#xD;
      ablation process with the result of a gentler and safer treatment. Similar to excimer lasers&#xD;
      for corneal surgery, the AQAURIUZ system (Ziemer Ophthalmic Systems AG) is equipped with a&#xD;
      fast eye tracker (eye tracking system) to correct eye movements during the treatment. The&#xD;
      shape of the removed portion of the cornea has an aspherical profile corresponding to the&#xD;
      state of the art.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the safety of use of the AQUARIUZ corneal ablation laser&#xD;
      for LASIK procedures in myopia and myopia with astigmatism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to compare the predicted visual and refractive outcomes of LASIK&#xD;
      procedures using the AQUARIUZ Ablation with clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned in 3 phases to mitigate the inherent risk of a first in man study and to&#xD;
      allow for verification and confirmation of the system correction factor at an early stage.&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  other acute or chronic illnesses that increases the risk to the participant&#xD;

&#xD;
              11. Patients with a diagnosed collagen vascular, atopic syndrome, autoimmune or&#xD;
                  immunodeficiency disease&#xD;
