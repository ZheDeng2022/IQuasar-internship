  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Renal Failure (CRF); The result of a decrease in the glomerular filtration value is&#xD;
      defined as a chronic and progressive deterioration in the fluid-solute balance of the kidney&#xD;
      and metabolic-endocrine functions. Treatment is kidney transplant or dialysis. CRF affects&#xD;
      10-15% of adults worldwide. CRF rate in the general adult population in Turkey is 15.7%.&#xD;
      According to the data of the Turkish Nephrology Association, renal replacement therapy (RRT)&#xD;
      is applied to a total of 77,311 patients in our country by the end of 2017. The most common&#xD;
      (76%) applied RRT type is hemodialysis treatment. In individuals receiving hemodialysis&#xD;
      treatment, nausea-vomiting, weakness, fatigue, itching, fluid-solute imbalances, hypotension&#xD;
      and pain can be seen due to uremia. This situation reduces the functionality of the patient&#xD;
      and the limitation of physical activities brings physical and psycho-social effects with it.&#xD;
      The dependence of the individual on the dialysis machine, the healthcare team and the family&#xD;
      in treatment programs that last three days a week, on average four hours a day, affects the&#xD;
      personal lives of the patients. It can be said that nursing care and education are of great&#xD;
      importance in resolving the existing or potential problems of patients who are dependent on&#xD;
      hemodialysis as a result of CRF, and in adapting patients to life with their disease. It is&#xD;
      the nursing theories that will guide these attempts of nurses. Because nursing theories&#xD;
      interpret and define the profession; thus helping nurses in training, practice and research&#xD;
      activities as a professional. Nursing Model of Roper, Logan-Tierney (RLT), one of the&#xD;
      important theories of nursing, is based on the life model. In this model, the main purpose of&#xD;
      nursing is to ensure that people are informed so that they can lead a quality and healthy&#xD;
      life. This model, which can be integrated into all service areas of the health care system&#xD;
      and handles individual-centered care with a humanistic and holistic approach, supports the&#xD;
      participation of the individual in care. It is predicted that the patient education program&#xD;
      created using the Nursing Model of RLT will support the increase of the independence levels&#xD;
      and self-care abilities of individuals who receive hemodialysis treatment.&#xD;

      Chronic Renal Failure (CRF); The result of a decrease in the glomerular filtration value is&#xD;
      defined as a chronic and progressive deterioration in the fluid-solute balance of the kidney&#xD;
      and metabolic-endocrine functions. CRF is an irreversible, progressive disease involving many&#xD;
      systems. Its treatment is kidney transplant or dialysis. CRF affects 10-15% of adults&#xD;
      worldwide. In other words, one out of every six adults has CRF. CRF rate in the general adult&#xD;
      population in Turkey is 15.7%. According to the data of the Turkish Nephrology Association,&#xD;
      renal replacement therapy (RRT) is applied to a total of 77,311 patients in our country as of&#xD;
      the end of 2017. The most common (76%) applied RRT type is hemodialysis treatment. In&#xD;
      individuals receiving hemodialysis treatment, nausea-vomiting, weakness, fatigue, itching,&#xD;
      fluid-solute imbalances, hypotension and pain can be seen due to uremia. This situation&#xD;
      reduces the functionality of the patient and the limitation of physical activities brings&#xD;
      physical and psycho-social effects with it. The dependence of the person on the dialysis&#xD;
      machine, the healthcare team and the family in the treatment programs that last three days a&#xD;
      week, an average of four hours a day, affects the personal lives of the patients. It can be&#xD;
      said that nursing care and education are of great importance in resolving the existing or&#xD;
      potential problems of patients whose CRF result is due to hemodialysis, and in adapting&#xD;
      patients to life with their disease. It is the nursing theories that will guide these&#xD;
      attempts of nurses. Because nursing theories interpret and define the profession; thus&#xD;
      helping nurses in training, practice, research activities as a professional. Nursing Model of&#xD;
      Roper, Logan-Tierney (RLT), one of the important theories of nursing, is based on the life&#xD;
      model. In this model, the main purpose of nursing is to ensure that people are informed so&#xD;
      that they can lead a quality and healthy life. In the &quot;Nursing Model&quot; developed by RLT based&#xD;
      on the Life Model, they focused on providing nursing care based on human characteristics,&#xD;
      believed in the necessity of observations and measurable events and activities, and based&#xD;
      their nursing services on these beliefs. This model, which can be integrated into all service&#xD;
      areas of the health care system and handles individual-centered care with a humanistic and&#xD;
      holistic approach, supports the participation of the individual in care. It is predicted that&#xD;
      the patient education program created using the Nursing Model of RLT will support the&#xD;
      increase of the independence levels and self-care abilities of individuals who receive&#xD;
      hemodialysis treatment. In this study, it is planned to evaluate the effect of the education&#xD;
      given to individuals receiving hemodialysis based on Roper, Logan-Tierney's Nursing Model on&#xD;
      the level of independence and self-care ability in daily living activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research for the development of the nursing profession contributes to the knowledge of&#xD;
      nursing science by developing and testing nursing models / theories. In the literature, it is&#xD;
      seen that the use of the Nursing Model of RLT is limited only by mentioning the content of&#xD;
      the theory in certain parts of the study rather than reflecting it on the whole study. There&#xD;
      are no extensive explanations about the model and enough information about how it can be used&#xD;
      in practice. It has been determined that postgraduate studies conducted using the Nursing&#xD;
      Model of RLT are mostly descriptive studies. However, nursing theories and models should be&#xD;
      used effectively in research and practice. When the studies on individuals who receive&#xD;
      hemodialysis treatment are examined, it has been determined that the use of the Nursing Model&#xD;
      of RLT is very low. It is predicted that the patient education program created using this&#xD;
      Nursing Model will support the increase of the independence levels and self-care abilities of&#xD;
      individuals who receive hemodialysis treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the patient education program based on the Nursing Model of RLT, individuals&#xD;
      who receive hemodialysis treatment will increase their independence levels and self-care&#xD;
      abilities in daily living activities. It will be ensured that caregiving healthcare&#xD;
      professionals perform hemodialysis treatment with less stress.&#xD;
