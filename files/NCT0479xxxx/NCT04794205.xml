  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta-Caryophyllene is an essential oil and cannabis plant derivative also found in edible&#xD;
      herbs. It has shown promise as a potential analgesic in preclinical trials. However, there&#xD;
      are no human studies characterizing pharmacokinetics of BCP in humans. Therefore, it is of&#xD;
      great importance to determine the pharmacokinetics of BCP in humans so that appropriate&#xD;
      dosing can be developed for analgesia. This pharmacokinetic work will lay the groundwork for&#xD;
      subsequent experiments testing the neural mechanism of BCP on pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic pain conditions are among the most common reasons adults seek medical care. Given the&#xD;
      abuse potential for opioid analgesics, a substantial number of individuals with chronic pain&#xD;
      have turned to alternatives such as medical marijuana. There is increasing evidence that&#xD;
      medical marijuana has potential benefits for pain related conditions, but it also carries&#xD;
      unwanted side effects such as impaired cognition and motor skills that may linger long after&#xD;
      use, social stigma, and a moderate potential for abuse. Much of the marijuana/pain research&#xD;
      is predicated on the assumption that its potential analgesic effects are due to its primary&#xD;
      psychoactive ingredient - delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). However, marijuana also&#xD;
      contains dozens of phytochemicals, including cannabinoids and terpenes. Accordingly, there is&#xD;
      interest in characterizing potential pain-relieving effects of these non-intoxicating&#xD;
      constituents of marijuana. Thus far, it is unclear which components may be most relevant for&#xD;
      influencing pain, or the mechanisms by which they exert their effects. Betacaryophyllene&#xD;
      (BCP) may be a possible candidate because it is isolatable, has shown evidence as a potential&#xD;
      analgesic in preclinical research, is known to be safe for human administration, and there is&#xD;
      a strong premise for believing it interacts with the neurobiological systems in the brain&#xD;
      that process pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project was conceptualized to advance our mechanistic understanding of the analgesic&#xD;
      potential of BCP in humans. The study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind&#xD;
      study of the pharmacokinetic mechanisms of BCP, including dosing and duration of action, and&#xD;
      its potential analgesic effect on thermal pain induction following single-oral dosage. Ten&#xD;
      healthy participants will be screened and on each of four subsequent visits will be dosed&#xD;
      with either 5 mg, 30 mg, 150 mg of BCP or placebo. Participants' sensitivity to thermal pain&#xD;
      induction will be measured before and after administration of the drug using a self survey of&#xD;
      pain level. Successful completion of the project may elucidate the potential analgesic&#xD;
      effects of ingesting beta-caryophyllene in humans, which can lead to new forms of treatment&#xD;
      for pain.&#xD;
