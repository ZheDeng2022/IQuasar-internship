      Dental caries, also known as tooth decay, it can occur in primary teeth in early childhood,&#xD;
      is formed through interaction between acid-producing bacteria and carbohydrate. The caries&#xD;
      develops in both the crowns and roots of teeth. Progress of caries depended on the lifestyle&#xD;
      of the child (as high numbers of cariogenic bacteria, inadequate salivary flow, insufficient&#xD;
      fluoride exposure and poor oral hygiene). To avoid this disease should follow the proper oral&#xD;
      hygiene and improve lifestyle 1. A lot of methods found to treatment the decayed tooth -&#xD;
      like; Hall technique and Silver diamine fluoride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first report on the Hall Technique published in 2007 by a general dental practitioner&#xD;
      from Aberdeen/Scotland, Dr. Norna Hall. Dr. Hall used PMCs to restore carious primary molars&#xD;
      rather than using the standard technique, placed them using a simplified method2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have recommended that Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) solution would exert a&#xD;
      preventive result in managing early childhood caries ECC. However, no well-designed clinical&#xD;
      trials have yet been performed to study the effect of SDF on caries prevention. the objective&#xD;
      is useful in arresting early childhood caries (ECC) 3&#xD;
