      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been proposed that a hyperactivity of the endocannabinoids system could be involved in&#xD;
      the cognitive deficits involved in Down Syndrome (DS). Hyperactivation of the type-1&#xD;
      cannabinoid (CB1) receptor by exogenous cannabinoids, such as the active principle of&#xD;
      cannabis tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), induces several modifications of the&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to compare those CB1-dependent EEG parameters in subjects with DS&#xD;
      and age-matched typically developing subjects (TD, control group). These investigations can&#xD;
      increase our knowledge of the involvement of the CB1 receptor in DS cognitive deficits and&#xD;
      potentially identify biomarkers of target engagement of new therapies of this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was recently showed in pre-clinical DS models that the endocannabinoid system is&#xD;
      hyperactivated in the brain and that human adult subjects with DS showed higher plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of the main endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide&#xD;
      (N-arachidonoylethanolamine, 2-AEA) as compared with those found in typically developing&#xD;
      subjects. Alterations of neural oscillations induced by the consumption of THC preparations&#xD;
      are well established and it is hypothesized that they would be similar to those found in&#xD;
      subjects with DS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess different neural markers using electroencephalography (EEG) in typically developing&#xD;
      subjects and in subjects with DS in resting state and while conducting selected cognitive&#xD;
      tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-interventional, cross-sectional, monocenter study in male and female adult subjects with&#xD;
      DS and typically developing subjects (total n=48).&#xD;
