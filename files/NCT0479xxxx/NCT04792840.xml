  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, it is estimated that there are more than 3.8 million living women has a&#xD;
      history of invasive breast cancer, and 268,600 women will be newly diagnosed in 2019.&#xD;
      Sixty-four percent of breast cancer survivors (more than 2.4 million women) are ≥ 65 years,&#xD;
      whereas 7% are aged younger than 50 years 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common treatment of early stage (stage I or II) breast cancer is breast-conserving&#xD;
      surgery (BCS) with adjuvant radiation therapy (49%) and 34% of patients undergo mastectomy.&#xD;
      In contrary, more than two-thirds (68%) of patients with stage III disease undergo mastectomy&#xD;
      and most of them receive adjuvant chemotherapy 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the most debilitating morbidity after surgery and radiotherapy for breast cancer is&#xD;
      related to treatment of the axilla. This includes persistent arm lymphoedema, impaired&#xD;
      shoulder mobility and brachial plexopathy. Other exogenous factors have an influence on the&#xD;
      risk of radiotherapy-related morbidity as patients' age and obesity 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphedema of the arm occurs in 19.9% of women who undergo axillary lymph node dissection and&#xD;
      in 5.6% of women who have a sentinel lymph node biopsy 4. Irradiation of the regional lymph&#xD;
      nodes may increase the risk, especially among patients receiving axillary lymph node&#xD;
      dissection 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early diagnosis of lymphedema is important for optimizing its treatment and preventing its&#xD;
      progression 6. Some forms of cancer rehabilitation may reduce the risk and lessen the&#xD;
      severity of this condition 7, 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with adjuvant aromatase inhibitors (AI), which is generally reserved for&#xD;
      postmenopausal women, can cause osteoporosis 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoporosis, a process of bone mineral density (BMD) reduction, is accelerated by estrogen&#xD;
      deficiency in postmeno¬pausal women. Tamoxifen reduces BMD in premenopausal women, while&#xD;
      promotes bone formation in postmenopausal patients. On the other hand, adjuvant aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors (AIs) therapy enhances the BMD decrease to about 2.5% per year, due to a long&#xD;
      lasting significant deprivation of circula¬tory and tissue estrogens 10. In the bone&#xD;
      companion study of the MA.17 trial, patients treated with anastrozole reported a significant&#xD;
      decreases in BMD (~4%), compared to those treated with tamoxifen 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual energies' X ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan is the current validated 'gold standard' for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of osteoporosis, fracture risk estimation and follow up of anti osteoporotic&#xD;
      treatment 12-14, since it is non invasive, simple, precise, fast, less expensive than other&#xD;
      imaging techniques, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and more&#xD;
      sensitive than quantitative ultrasound (QUS) 15.&#xD;
