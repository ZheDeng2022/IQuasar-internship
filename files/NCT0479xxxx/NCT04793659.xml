  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fasudil, a Rho kinase inhibitor, is believed to reduce wandering behaviors of elopement and&#xD;
      getting lost by improving spatial memory and navigation through improvements in hippocampal&#xD;
      blood flow. Fasudil is non-sedating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of oral fasudil in reducing wandering&#xD;
      behaviors of elopement and/or getting lost in subjects with dementia. In addition, effects on&#xD;
      wandering behaviors of excess movement and pacing, cognition, memory, neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      symptomatology, caregiver/nursing staff burden, and the safety and tolerability of fasudil&#xD;
      treatment will be assessed.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will consist of subjects with dementia and wandering behaviors of&#xD;
      elopement and/or getting lost. While it is anticipated that most participants will be&#xD;
      residing at home (with caregiver support), subjects may live in another setting such as a&#xD;
      group home, an assisted living unit, or in a long-term care facility, provided that a&#xD;
      caregiver, formal or informal, has sufficient contact with the subject to permit accurate&#xD;
      completion of the necessary assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will enter the Open-Label Phase and receive treatment with fasudil 90&#xD;
      mg/day (30 mg three times daily [tid]) for 6 weeks in Open-Label Period 1. Responders (i.e.,&#xD;
      subjects who improve 2 points or more on the GIW) will proceed to the Double-Blind Phase.&#xD;
      Subjects in whom fasudil is well-tolerated (i.e. subjects with ≤ 2 drug-related AEs of mild&#xD;
      intensity, no drug-related AEs of greater than mild intensity, and creatinine level of &lt; 1.5&#xD;
      mg/dL at all times during the period) and who do not respond will enter Open-Label Period 2,&#xD;
      and be dosed with fasudil 180 mg/day (60 mg tid) for 6 weeks. Responders will proceed to the&#xD;
      Double-Blind Phase and non-responders will move to the final post-treatment visit. In the&#xD;
      Double-Blind Phase, subjects will receive treatment with either placebo or the dose they&#xD;
      responded to in the Open-Label Phase (90 mg/day or 180 mg/day) for 6 weeks (Double-Blind&#xD;
      Period 1), following which treatment assignment will be crossed over for 6 weeks&#xD;
      (Double-Blind Period 2). A final post-treatment visit will occur 14 days after the last dose&#xD;
      of study drug. Visits may be performed by qualified healthcare professionals at home or other&#xD;
      care setting, or at a doctor's office/clinic. Interviews may be performed by telephone and/or&#xD;
      telemedicine as appropriate.&#xD;

    <description>The WWR-C is composed of targeted questions related to excess walking, spontaneous pacing, elopement, and wayfinding; it is designed to be assessed on a weekly basis by caregivers about subjects for whom they care. The WWR-C asks the caregiver to rate the subject's behavior for the previous week.</description>

    <description>The NPI-Q provides an assessment of dementia-related emotional behavioral symptomatology in routine clinical practice settings. Caregiver distress is also assessed.&#xD;
The NPI-Q asks the assessor to rate the previous 30 days. At the Final Visit, the assessor will rate the NPI-Q for the 2-week period following the final dose. The scale is completed by the caregiver without input from the subject. All reasonable efforts should be made to ensure each NPI-Q for an individual subject is completed by the same caregiver to minimize inter-rater variability.</description>
