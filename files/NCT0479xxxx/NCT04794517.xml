  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As chronic kidney disease (CKD) continues to increase worldwide, along with the demand for&#xD;
      related life-saving therapies, the financial burden of CKD will place an increasing drain on&#xD;
      health care systems. Experimental studies showed that glomerular capillary hypertension and&#xD;
      impaired sieving function with consequent protein overload play a pathogenic role in the&#xD;
      progression of CKD. Consistently, human studies show that proteinuria is an independent&#xD;
      predictor of progression and that its reduction is renoprotective. At comparable BP control,&#xD;
      inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), including angiotensin converting enzyme&#xD;
      (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), more effectively than non-RAS&#xD;
      inhibitor therapy reduce proteinuria, slow progression to ESRD, and even improve the kidney&#xD;
      function achieving disease regression in some cases. In participants with diabetes, RAS&#xD;
      inhibitors delay the onset of microalbuminuria and its progression to macroalbuminuria, and&#xD;
      ACE inhibitors may reduce the excess cardiovascular mortality associated with diabetic renal&#xD;
      disease. In addition to RAS inhibitors, however, multimodal approaches including lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications and multidrug therapy will be required in most cases to optimize control of the&#xD;
      several risk factors for CKD and related cardiovascular morbidity. Novel medications,&#xD;
      including proximal tubular sodium - glucose co-transporter -2 (SGLT2 inhibitors - that&#xD;
      ameliorate glomerular hyperfiltration and proteinuria and slow renal disease progression in&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes by mechanisms apparently independent of improved metabolic control - might&#xD;
      help further improve the cost-effectiveness of renoprotective interventions even in&#xD;
      non-diabetic CKD. This phase 2, prospective, randomized, cross over, placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      will primarily aim to assess whether the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin ameliorates&#xD;
      hyperfiltration and reduces proteinuria as compared to placebo in patients with non-diabetic&#xD;
      CKD, with particular focus on those at highest risk of progression to end stage kidney&#xD;
      disease (ESKD) because of severe renal insufficiency (Stage IV CKD) and proteinuria (&gt;0.5&#xD;
      g/24 hours).&#xD;
