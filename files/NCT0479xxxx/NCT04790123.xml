  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of complex cryptoglandular anal fistula is high, it affects eminently young&#xD;
      patients and implies an important alteration in their quality of life and high prevalence in&#xD;
      sick leave. Its treatment remains a real challenge due to the limited efficacy of sphincter&#xD;
      preservation techniques and the inevitable risk of faecal incontinence in those cases that&#xD;
      require surgery. Goals: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the injection of freshly&#xD;
      collected autologous adipose tissue as a minimally invasive, highly reproducible alternative,&#xD;
      without risk for the continence of the patient, and of very low cost, in the treatment of&#xD;
      complex cryptoglandular anal fistula. Methodology: Prospective multicenter, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Randomization list for&#xD;
      each center to ensure the balance of inter-center allocation. Patients older than 18 years&#xD;
      with cryptoglandular anal fistula with suppuration for more than 6 weeks and less than 1&#xD;
      year, who have received at most: curettage and drainage placement will be included. Treatment&#xD;
      group: injection of fresh autologous fat into the fistulous tract, after curettage and&#xD;
      closure of the internal orifice, and after lipoaspirate fat in the abdomen and centrifugation&#xD;
      thereof. Placebo group: curettage and closure of the internal orifice and simulated&#xD;
      intervention in the abdomen. Evaluation: protocolized clinical history and fistula complexity&#xD;
      score (CFS), subjective perception of its pathology, St.Marks continence score, Quality of&#xD;
      life questionnaire (QoLAF), and endoanal 3D ultrasound, at baseline, at one week, and at 3, 6&#xD;
      and 12 months after the intervention. The patients and the evaluator will be blind to the&#xD;
      treatment. Patients who cannot end up receiving treatment due to intraoperative incidents or&#xD;
      medical decision will be excluded from the study (post randomization exclusion). In each&#xD;
      center there will be a blind evaluator to perform the follow-ups and endoanal ultrasound.&#xD;
