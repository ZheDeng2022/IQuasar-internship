    <textblock>
      ATLAS-IT-05 is an open-label, single-arm study in patients with superficial advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors accessible for injection (cutaneous, subcutaneous, lymph node, or intramuscular&#xD;
      tumors) and who have either exhausted treatment options or are not eligible for, suitable&#xD;
      for, or willing to undergo such treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of LTX-315 in combination with the immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pembrolizumab in patients with superficial advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LTX-315 has been administered with pembrolizumab in a previous Phase 1/2 study (ATLAS-IT-05),&#xD;
      and there were clear indications that LTX-315 + pembrolizumab was a clinically active&#xD;
      combination. Furthermore, the addition of LTX-315 to pembrolizumab dosing did not appear to&#xD;
      increase the overall incidence or severity profile of toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will document the preliminary efficacy, clinical safety, and tolerability&#xD;
      of LTX-315 in combination with pembrolizumab, in a dose and regimen that is considered to be&#xD;
      safe, in 2 cohorts of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 will consist of patients with selected tumors that have an FDA-approved ICI&#xD;
      treatment and have progressed after prior anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) or anti-programmed&#xD;
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy, alone or in combination with systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 will consist of patients with tumors that do not have any FDA-approved ICI&#xD;
      treatment, and may or may not have received prior anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. The&#xD;
      rationale for including this cohort is to test the ability of intratumoral injection of&#xD;
      LTX-315 to convert an immunologically &quot;cold&quot; tumor to &quot;hot&quot; by causing cytolysis within the&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
