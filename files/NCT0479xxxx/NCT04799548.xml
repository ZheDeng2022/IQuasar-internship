      This study is a phase II, prospective, single-center, single-arm trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the combination of neoadjuvant transcatheter arterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization (TACE) and PD-1 antibody Tislelizumab in the locally advanced stomach&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the pathologic complete&#xD;
      response (pCR) rate of TACE plus Tislelizumab. The second purpose is to evaluate pathologic&#xD;
      response rate (pRR), objective Response Rate (ORR), overall survival (OS) and&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) of the patients enrolled in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of advanced gastric cancer has been a significant global health problem. With&#xD;
      surgery still the backbone, various clinical trials have shown the benefit of perioperative&#xD;
      treatment to gastric cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The report of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment in gastric cancer is&#xD;
      relatively limited, though different case reports have showed its efficacy and safety in&#xD;
      advanced gastric cancer. With transarterial infusion chemotherapy, TACE increases the local&#xD;
      concentration of chemotherapeutic agents and reduces adverse reaction. With embolization,&#xD;
      TACE blocks the blood supply and causes the necrosis of tumors, in this way exposing tumor&#xD;
      antigen and promoting tumor immunity. The combination of TACE and PD-1 antibody is expected&#xD;
      to further boost tumor immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meanwhile, Noman et.al. reported hypoxia could upregulate PD-L1 by activating HIF-1alpha. So,&#xD;
      embolism may lead to immune evasion of tumors by upregulating PD-L1, but on the other side&#xD;
      generate targets for PD-1/PD-L1 therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on those knowledges, we designed this phase II, prospective, single-center, single-arm&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of neoadjuvant transcatheter&#xD;
      arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and PD-1 antibody Tislelizumab in the locally advanced&#xD;
      stomach adenocarcinoma. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the pathologic&#xD;
      complete response (pCR) rate of TACE plus Tislelizumab. The second purpose is to evaluate&#xD;
      pathologic response rate (pRR), objective Response Rate (ORR), overall survival (OS) and PFS&#xD;
      (progression-free survival) of the patients enrolled in this study.&#xD;
