  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a traditional view going back to 1800, spinal cord has been described as a protected&#xD;
      bundle of nerves that connects the brain to the body. Galen contended that spinal cord&#xD;
      mediates motor, sensory and some of the autonomic functions below the neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury (TSCI) is a catastrophic unexpected and devastating event that&#xD;
      can be occurred along the spinal column (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar). A global-incident&#xD;
      rate (2007) is estimated at 23 TSCI cases per million (179312 cases per annum). TSCI can&#xD;
      often results in a life-threatening condition that includes varying degrees of motor&#xD;
      paralysis and sensory loss and impairment of bowel, bladder, sexual, and other physiologic&#xD;
      functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators suggest a new experimental rehabilitative protocol for TSCI&#xD;
      patients called Neural Motor Recruitment Method (NEUROM). This method is based on the&#xD;
      mentioned histological and/or functional reorganization model after TSCI, on the MI concepts&#xD;
      and the targeted sensory inputs related to motor recovery. The hypothesis here is that NEUROM&#xD;
      can enhance sparing- induced plasticity and increase motor and sensory recovery in SCI&#xD;
      patients especially when combined to tDCS.&#xD;

      PARTICIPANTS Fifty paraplegic patients will be recruited from inpatient rehabilitation&#xD;
      hospitals. The patients will be treated at Rahma Hospital for Rehabilitation in Tripoli and&#xD;
      Physical Therapy Center of the Faculty of Public Health-I in Hadath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main inclusion criteria will be age between 18-30 years, diagnosis of chronic incomplete&#xD;
      lower dorsal (below Th10) or lumbar spinal cord injury as defined by the American Spinal&#xD;
      Injury Association Impairment scale classification (AIS B, C or D) and at least 3 months'&#xD;
      post-injury. Ethical committee's approval will be obtain from the Lebanese University&#xD;
      official ethical committee and informed consent will be obtained from all participants with&#xD;
      respect the the Declaration of Helsinki ethical considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria included neuropsychiatric comorbidities; traumatic brain injury (TBI);&#xD;
      involvement in any specific program of rehabilitation other than the conventional protocol&#xD;
      since his injury; contraindications to tDCS such as metal in the head or implanted brain&#xD;
      medical devices. Patients with history of seizure, use of medications containing sodium&#xD;
      channel blocker such as carbamazepine and any substance abuse will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study. Patients with severe spasticity greater then and equal to 3 out of 4 as determined by&#xD;
      a Modified Ashworth Scale will be also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the experiment will start, patients should have received conventional physiotherapy in&#xD;
      the physical therapy center, and demonstrated stable lower limb functional scores, thus their&#xD;
      performance must not change from the end of the conventional therapy until the first baseline&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be randomly assigned into three groups: 1) Conventional group (n=20) where&#xD;
      patients will receive a standardized conventional type of intervention (stretching,&#xD;
      strengthening, neuro-muscular facilitation), Experimental Group (n=20) receiving the neural&#xD;
      motor recruitment NEROM and the Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) Group (n=10)&#xD;
      receiving the NEROM combined to the tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo a detailed medical examination with particular attention to the&#xD;
      subjects of the experimental group who will receive tDCS in order to eliminate any adverse&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before every session, participants will be prepared for the closed-loop rehabilitation&#xD;
      protocol by a static stretching of 20 minutes in both lower legs especially for the&#xD;
      hamstrings and the soleus muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GENERAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONVENTIONAL REHABILITATION PROGRAM For the conventional control group, investigators will&#xD;
      include therapeutic exercises such as: Repetitive neuromuscular facilitation, Passive and&#xD;
      Active Mobilization, Strengthening, Endurance exercises, and/or musculoskeletal interventions&#xD;
      (Static and dynamic stretching).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEURAL MOTOR RECRUITMENT NEROM Patients of the NEROM and the tDCS groups will receive a daily&#xD;
      home MI training with 20 minutes of stretching during 7 days. MI training will be&#xD;
      individually delivered in the same quiet room designed for this purpose. SCI participants&#xD;
      will lay on their bed facing a 43 inches screen distant from their faces of about 3.5 meters&#xD;
      with a height of the center of the screen of 1.2 meters from the floor. Screen will show&#xD;
      5-minutes video of two feet repeating large movements of dorsi- and plantar flexion. The&#xD;
      instructions given to the subject were detailed and read aloud. During this part, an audio&#xD;
      computer output guided the subject to feel the movement (as a kinesthetic imagery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION tDCS group will receive NEUROM + tDCS. Transcranial&#xD;
      Direct Current Stimulation which is a form of non-invasive cortical stimulation will be&#xD;
      performed. Participants will remain seated in their own wheelchair or will be provided with a&#xD;
      comfortable chair. The StarstimNE non-invasive wireless tDCS neurostimulator (NE&#xD;
      Neuroelectrics®, Barcelona, Spain) will be used to deliver the direct current. The StarstimNE&#xD;
      neurostimulator included a wireless neoprene cap based on the International 10-20 System,&#xD;
      which will be placed on each participant's head by aligning the central CZ electrode position&#xD;
      with the vertex. Small Ag/AgCl gelled electrodes, with a surface contact area of 3.14 cm2,&#xD;
      specific to the StarstimNEdevice (Pi electrodes, Neuroelectrics®), will be used. In all&#xD;
      sessions, one electrode was placed on the left M1, and the other on the right M1;&#xD;
      corresponding to C3 and C4 of the International 10-20 EEG system. In one session the anode&#xD;
      was on the left M1, and the cathode on the right M1, and this is referred as AL-CR montage.&#xD;
      In other session the anode was on the right M1, and the cathode on the left M1 (AR-CL). In&#xD;
      the stimulation period, DC current was gradually increased over a 7-s period until it reached&#xD;
      1 mA, and constant current stimulation was subsequently maintained for a total of 20 min.&#xD;
      During tDCS, the patient will be asked to perform kinesthetic imagery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASUREMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vividness of motor imagery questionnaire (VMIQ) Participants were asked to indicate the&#xD;
           vividness of an imagined movement on a 5-point scale: 1 (excellent imagination of the&#xD;
           movement performance as lively as actual performance), 2 (a good capacity to imagine&#xD;
           movement performance), 3 (moderate capacity to imagine the performance of a movement), 4&#xD;
           (a vague or unclear image) or 5 (no image at all).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessment of movement attempt and execution The studied motor task is consisted of&#xD;
           repetitive alternating dorsal and plantar flexion of the right foot (30°-0°-45°) at a&#xD;
           self-paced rhythm. The ability to attempt moving the foot (motor attempt, MA) was&#xD;
           assessed as follows. The perceived intensity and frequency of attempted movements was&#xD;
           rated in a structured interview on phantom sensations, which had been developed for&#xD;
           evaluating phantom body phenomena, paresthesia and movement sensations in SCI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensity of the feeling to move the feet and the frequency of spontaneous attempts in&#xD;
      daily life were rated. Answers were noted as qualitative descriptors and both the phenomena's&#xD;
      frequency and intensity were individually rated using a 6-point scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ability of attempt to move the right foot with intensity of the feeling (1: very weak; 6:&#xD;
      very high) and frequency of spontaneous attempt in daily life (1: very rare; 6: very often).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. The ASIA motor and sensory examinations will be performed by SCI-experienced physical&#xD;
      therapists at initial (baseline) and every examination point (week +1, week +2, and week +4).&#xD;
      Five key muscle groups will be assessed using the ASIA International Standards for&#xD;
      Neurological Classification of SCI, recorded using a six-point ordinal scale for both lower&#xD;
      limbs resulting in an ASIA total maximum score of 50. Sensation will be recorded for the 12&#xD;
      key sensory points using a three-point ordinal scale for both lower limbs (maximum possible&#xD;
      scores = 48) for light touch (LT) and pin prick (PP) (151).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. The visual analog scale (VAS) will be used to obtain a measure of introspective perception&#xD;
      of movement while watching the movie in the illusion condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after all sessions, subjects will be interviewed about the strength of the&#xD;
      kinesthetic illusion; subjects will provide answers on the VAS regarding the strength of the&#xD;
      feeling of actual movement, with &quot;0 mm&quot; indicating that subjects have no illusory sensation&#xD;
      at all and &quot;100 mm&quot; indicating that they feel exactly as if their own finger was moving.&#xD;
      Before the first part of the imagery protocol, investigators will instruct KI training and&#xD;
      confirm that all subjects will report a VAS score greater than 50 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED OUTCOMES Priming of the motor cortex to augment functional benefits with peripheral&#xD;
      training is relatively new, and therapeutic effects of motor cortex stimulation as an&#xD;
      intervention alone or combined with peripheral training is reported by only a few&#xD;
      researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research is needed to increase effectiveness of physical rehabilitation in Spinal Cord&#xD;
      Injury. To date, quality of rehabilitative interventions is poor and therapists need to&#xD;
      differentiate between therapies with unequal impacts on outcomes. This type of protocol will&#xD;
      find answers to some clinical questions about the effectiveness of non-conventional&#xD;
      strategies to decrease disabilities after spinal cord injury as post-SCI patients' status&#xD;
      will have a negative effect on societal and health system in Lebanon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APPLICABILITY This type of protocol will find answers to some clinical questions about the&#xD;
      effectiveness of non-conventional strategies to decrease disabilities after spinal cord&#xD;
      injury as post-SCI patients' status will have a negative effect on societal and health system&#xD;
      in Lebanon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our findings may support that modulating excitatory input of the corticospinal tracts on&#xD;
      spinal circuits combining with motor imagery and static strategy in a closed-loop&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocol may be a promising strategy in improving lower limb functions in&#xD;
      persons with incomplete paraplegia.&#xD;
