      The aim of the present study is determine the cost-effectiveness, clinical- effectiveness,&#xD;
      acceptability and adverse effect of resin sealants versus the fluoride varnish for the&#xD;
      prevention of dental caries on newly erupted permanent molars.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Cochrane systematic reviews found low quality evidence supporting Current practice&#xD;
      guidelines that recommend the use of Resin based fissure sealant over Fluoride varnish in&#xD;
      prevent dental caries. However, they did not address the cost-effectiveness, A more recent&#xD;
      systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that no statistical significance difference&#xD;
      between Resin based fissure sealant and Fluoride varnish with a high-quality evidence in&#xD;
      prevent dental caries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will measure cost effectiveness and clinical effectiveness for resin fissure&#xD;
      sealant and fluoride varnish.&#xD;
