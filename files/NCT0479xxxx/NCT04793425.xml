  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of acute myocardial infarction (MI) in Poland is at the level of standardized&#xD;
      European care. However, the first months after MI are crucial from the perspective of&#xD;
      patient's prognosis. It is extremely important to take care of all cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile application (afterAMI) supported by web system is a novel telemedical tool created to&#xD;
      support patient and physician during the process of cardiac rehabilitation. The application&#xD;
      has educational model with focus on cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle after MI.&#xD;
      Moreover, there is a module to control vital signs like blood pressure, heart rate, weight&#xD;
      and many others. Additionally, application will send reminders for better drug adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 patients will be recruited to take part in the study. All of which will be hospitalized&#xD;
      at the 1st Department and Clinic of Cardiology because of the MI. The aim of the project is&#xD;
      to study the impact of application-supported model of care with comparison to standard care.&#xD;
      At the end of the study cardiovascular risk factors control will be analysed, as well as&#xD;
      rehospitalizations, patient's knowledge regarding risk factors, return to work and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, open-label, randomized, single-centre study. All 100 patients&#xD;
      will be observed 6 months after discharge from the hospital. End points will be assessed&#xD;
      during control visit 1- and 6-months after inclusion into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is an example of a telemedicine solution application into everyday practice,&#xD;
      which is consistent with multiple international cardiac societies.&#xD;
