  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As cancer survival rates have been increased due to technological developments and early&#xD;
      detection strategies, there has been been a growing need to assess the effect of long-term&#xD;
      complications and adverse effects upon patients' functionality and quality of life.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy, which is accepted to be the body of systemic adjuvant therapy is attributed to&#xD;
      long-term survival, yet some side effects such as sarcopenia, loss of muscle strength and&#xD;
      functional capacity, fatigue, and sensory disturbances due to the neurotoxic effects have&#xD;
      been well known. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a condition that is&#xD;
      characterized by main loss of cutaneous sensation especially in the distal part of the&#xD;
      extremities. CIPN affects approximately 30-40% of patients with cancer undergoing&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Loss of sensation in distal sides of upper and lower extremities may cause not&#xD;
      only deterioration of fine hand skills but also loss of balance and thereby one's mobility&#xD;
      and independence are detrimentally affected. Thus, this study is aimed to assess CIPN in&#xD;
      patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy in a longitudinal design by assessing the&#xD;
      cutaneous function of the sensory nerves and related effect of motor function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) which affects over 30-40% of patients with&#xD;
      cancer undergoing chemotherapy cause cutaneous loss of sensation. A specific and selective&#xD;
      function carries great importance not only in daily life but also in task-specific complex&#xD;
      movements. Since the long-term survival of cancer is increased, back to work is quite&#xD;
      important in both one's participation in community life and financial issues. Irrespective of&#xD;
      age or other socio-clinical and socio-demographic characteristics, patients may be affected&#xD;
      detrimentally after systemic adjuvant chemotherapy implementation in the perspective of&#xD;
      sensory and motor aspects. Thus, this study is aimed to assess cutaneous sensory and motor&#xD;
      function in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy in a longitudinal design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research was planned as an observational-cross sectional cohort study within a&#xD;
      longitudinal design. Patients diagnosed with cancer and applied to medical oncology unit in&#xD;
      Izmir Bakircay University Çiğli State and Training Hospital for systemic adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be assessed in three different time points set as following: Time 1: before&#xD;
      chemotherapy application, Time 2: interim time point (approx.8 weeks later) and Time 3:&#xD;
      post-chemotherapy time point (12-20 weeks later after initial assessment). The main outcome&#xD;
      measures were set as handgrip strength and Minnesota Rate of Manipulation Test (MRMT) for&#xD;
      motor function while Semmens-Weinstein Monofilament Test (SWMT) for sensory evaluation.&#xD;
      Secondarily, patients' quality of life and fatigue will be assessed with European&#xD;
      Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) specific scales such as QLQ-C30 for&#xD;
      general quality of life and QLQ-FA12 for fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand Grip Strength:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand-Grip Strength Handgrip strength will be assessed with Lafayette Professional Hand&#xD;
      Dynamometer, Model 5030L1, LaFayette Instruments, NY, USA). The standard position which can&#xD;
      be achieved by 90-degree elbow flexion, shoulder abducted, and hand mid-prone positioned;&#xD;
      90-degree shoulder abduction and 90-degree shoulder abduction positions will be used to&#xD;
      assess hang-grip strength. Three measurements will be requested and the maximum value of them&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRMT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Minnesota Rate of Manipulation test (MRMT, LaFayatte Instruments, NY, USA) will be used&#xD;
      to assess the fine hand skills of patients who undergo chemotherapy. There are five other&#xD;
      sub-tests to evaluate hand function such as one or two hands turning, displacing, etc.&#xD;
      However, since CIPN might affect both hands, we chose to use two hands turning and placing&#xD;
      the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, 60 wooden circle-shaped discs are placed on the pegboard. (15 discs x 4 row).&#xD;
      Patients are requested to stand in front of the pegboard. Each patient will be informed about&#xD;
      the test as following: &quot;Start with the top-right corner of the board. Hold the disc and turn&#xD;
      with your right hand, give it to your left then place it again. Continue this until reaching&#xD;
      the top left corner. In the second row, you will start to top left corner, hold the disc and&#xD;
      turn with your left hand, give it to your right and place it again&quot;. Patients also will be&#xD;
      informed about doing this as best and fast they can while avoiding exaggerated movements of&#xD;
      the trunk. Each patient will be tested for two trials, the third one will be the main test in&#xD;
      which time will be calculated via chronometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scales and Forms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be scales and form which are required to fill out by participants. The following&#xD;
      list of scales will be filled with participants themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire&#xD;
      (EORTC-QLQ-C30) is the most frequently used cancer-specific health-related questionnaire. It&#xD;
      consists of 28 items and each is scored &quot;1: None&quot; through &quot;4: A lot&quot; according to the 4-based&#xD;
      Likert Scoring System. Besides, Item 29 and 30 are scored &quot;1&quot; through &quot;7&quot; in which are asked&#xD;
      about health and quality of life through the last week. The higher scores indicate the worst&#xD;
      quality of life or vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is the sub-module of the C30 questionnaire which consists of a total of 23&#xD;
      items. Scoring and interpretation of the questionnaire total score are the same as with the&#xD;
      C30 questionnaire. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer and who volunteered to participate&#xD;
      in this study are also requested to fill out this health-related quality of life&#xD;
      patient-reported outcome scale. While C30 is requested to fill out for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-B+) The Functional Assessment of Cancer&#xD;
      Therapy- Breast (FACT-B) consists of 37 items. To assess the health-related specific quality&#xD;
      of life of patients with breast cancer, each item is scored &quot;0: None&quot; through &quot;4: A Lot&quot;.&#xD;
      Emotional, Functional, Physical, Social, and Family and Other Concerns are the main&#xD;
      sub-domains that directly assess the related quality of life. Higher scores indicate worst,&#xD;
      while lower scores indicate the best.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of This Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effect of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) on the motor&#xD;
           and sensory function&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare results of functional capacity, motor and sensory function between&#xD;
           pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: There is no difference in hand and plantar cutaneous sensory function between&#xD;
      pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy periods H1-1: Cutaneous function of both sides of the&#xD;
      hand and plantar skin tissue is decreased due to chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2-1: Functional capacity and quality of life are decreased due to chemotherapy compared to&#xD;
      the baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3-1: Handgrip strength and Hand dexterity test results are worsened due to chemotherapy&#xD;
      compared to the baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A priori power analysis was performed via the G*Power 3.1.9 program. Since there will be&#xD;
      repeated measures along with three different time points, a power analysis was performed&#xD;
      according to the within-group factors design in repeated measures analysis of variance test.&#xD;
      Middle effect size according to the partial eta squared was set at 0.03 then general effect&#xD;
      size was calculated as 0.17. In 95% Confidence Interval and 80% power, setting non-sphericity&#xD;
      correction as default and correlation among repeated measures was set as 0.5. It was found&#xD;
      that a total of 54 participants are needed to achieve these results, however, in case of a&#xD;
      10% potential drop-out rate and possible violation of sphericity, it is planned to include a&#xD;
      total of 72 patients in this study.&#xD;
