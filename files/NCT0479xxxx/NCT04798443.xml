  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aim to compare the outcomes of Dextranomer/hyaluronic acid&#xD;
      (Dexell®) and extravesical reimplantation (Lich- Gregoir) procedures for primary&#xD;
      vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) grades III and IV in children.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 patients with 93 renal unites were prospectively enrolled in a comparative&#xD;
      intervention study. Patients were randomly allocated by simple randomization at a 1: 1 ratio&#xD;
      into 2 groups, where dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (Dexell) injection was used in Group A (30&#xD;
      patients with 45 renal units) and Lich-Gregoir in Group B (30 patients with 48 renal units).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children over 1 year with primary VUR grade III &amp; IV based on recent VCUG included in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study and method of attaining consent were approved by clinical research and ethical&#xD;
      committee of our department. Written consents were taken from patients' guardians involved in&#xD;
      the study. the investigators offered all of patients with symptomatic VUR entry into a&#xD;
      prospective protocol between June 2015 and February 2018 at the Urology Department, Al&#xD;
      Hussein University Hospital, Al-Azhar University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. dextranomer/hyaluronic acid injection: The endoscopic procedure was done under general&#xD;
           anesthesia, and all patients received antibiotic prophylaxis. the investigators used the&#xD;
           subureteral injection technique (STING), as described by O'Donnell and Puri . The volume&#xD;
           of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid was injected until ureteral orifice collapse in all&#xD;
           patients. The needle was held for 30 s.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ureteral reimplantation (lich-gregoir): The juxtavesical ureter is dissected and a&#xD;
           submucosal groove is created extending laterally from the ureteral hiatus along the&#xD;
           course of the ureter. The ureter is placed in the groove and the detrusor is closed over&#xD;
           the ureter with ureteric stent fixation for 21 days. Urethral catheter for bladder&#xD;
           drainage for 3-5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Care All children were maintained on prophylaxis until resolution of reflux&#xD;
      documented on the VCUG. Patients were assessed by general examination, serial urinalysis and&#xD;
      urine C.S. renal ultrasound at 1,3 months and at 1 year after the procedure and a VCUG at 3-6&#xD;
      months. MRU at 1 year. DMSA scintigraphy were done at 6 months after the procedure. the&#xD;
      investigators analyzed the outcome in these 2 surgical groups in terms of success rate at&#xD;
      short-term follow-up, contralateral reflux, de novo hydronephrosis, urinary tract infections&#xD;
      and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators considered that a patient was cured from reflux when there was no VUR on&#xD;
      VCUG.&#xD;
