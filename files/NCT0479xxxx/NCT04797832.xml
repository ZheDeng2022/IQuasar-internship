  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency is common among patients undergoing TAVI. It is estimated at 54-79%. Previous&#xD;
      non-randomized small trial have shown symptomatic benefit in treating iron deficiency in this&#xD;
      group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators predict, that as IV iron will improve symptoms, quality of life and&#xD;
      exercise tolerance in this group of patients.&#xD;

      Iron deficiency (ID) among patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)&#xD;
      is common (54%-79% .These patients suffer from higher mortality, unplanned readmission for&#xD;
      worsening heart failure or red blood cell transfusions during the first year after TAVI.IV&#xD;
      Iron therapy was found to be feasible in the 56 patients who were treated and showed&#xD;
      improvement in symptoms at 30 days follow-up.Anemia in TAVI patients is multifactorial,&#xD;
      related to advanced age, frailty, coagulopathy, medications, kidney disease, bleeding,&#xD;
      inflammation and ID. The most treatable part is ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron deficiency (ID) is a common comorbidity in other diseases. In heart failure (HF)&#xD;
      patients, it is associated with poor outcome, worsening of New York Heart Association (NYHA)&#xD;
      Class, and re-hospitalizations. While the mechanisms and pathophysiology of ID in HF is not&#xD;
      well understood, it is presumed to be a combination of impaired absorption, renal&#xD;
      dysfunction, hemodilution and drugs that are used for the treatment of HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages of (intra-venous) IV ferric carboxymaltose to patients with reduced ejection&#xD;
      fraction (HFrEF) with stable chronic heart failure and functional ID has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      the risk of hospitalizations up to 60%, improve symptoms, exercise tolerance, functional&#xD;
      capacity and overall QoL]. Accordingly, the latest 2016 ESC Guidelines recommended the&#xD;
      treatment in patients with HfrEF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and ID (Class IIA,LOC&#xD;
      A). No guidelines recommend IV iron supplementation in TAVI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two major, placebo-controlled studies, mentioned above (CONFIRM-AF and FAIR-AF) have&#xD;
      demonstrated the positive outcomes after correction of ID in stable HF patients, with a&#xD;
      well-tolerated IV substance. Furthermore, the effect of treating iron deficiency on quality&#xD;
      of life and functional status has already been studied and found useful with various types of&#xD;
      intravenous iron in the chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease.The effect of&#xD;
      treating with oral iron supplements has been studied in HF patients with no difference in&#xD;
      exercise capacity, symptoms, NT pro BNP, iron stores, Hemoglobin levels or V02 compared to&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators aim to examine the effect of IV iron (ferric gluconate) which&#xD;
      is a more affordable IV Iron on patients with ID admitted for TAVI. No randomized trial has&#xD;
      been published in this topic to this day.&#xD;
