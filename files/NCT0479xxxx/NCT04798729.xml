      Aim: The aim of this study is to compare the T-Scan digital occlusal analysis system and the&#xD;
      occlusal analysis mode of the CEREC Omnicam system, which is mainly used for design/&#xD;
      production, using the data recorded at the centric occlusion position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material-Method: Occlusal recordings were obtained from healthy 20 females and 20 males aged&#xD;
      18-25 at the centric occlusion position. Records were saved as .jpeg format and transferred&#xD;
      to Adobe Photoshop CS6 program. Blue, green, and red colors (shown by the same color codes in&#xD;
      both systems) representing light, intense and tight contacts, respectively, were evaluated in&#xD;
      terms of the pixel counts. For statistical comparison the differences between the systems&#xD;
      Independent Sample T-Test and, between the genders, One Sample T- Test were used (α = 0.05).&#xD;

    <description>In both systems, the data of contact intensity were defined with a color scale of blue to red where blue showed the lowest intensity and red the highest. The contact area images obtained from both systems were recorded in .jpeg format and were then transferred to the Adobe Photoshop CS6 program (Adobe Systems, USA) for comparisons to be made.&#xD;
The number of pixels in the contact areas of the upper and lower jaws of each subject in all the recordings obtained with the T-Scan and CEREC Omnicam systems were determined using the Adobe Photoshop CS6 pixel-based photographic procedure program.</description>
