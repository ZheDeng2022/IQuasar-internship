  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of the study are to use the Noom mobile app to help individuals with weight loss&#xD;
      and weight loss maintenance. This project will test the comparative efficacy of Noom Health&#xD;
      vs. Noom Digital Health for weight loss, quality of life, psychosocial functioning, and&#xD;
      self-reported health status. It is expected that use of Noom Health will show&#xD;
      post-intervention success relative to Noom Digital Health as well as long-term success with&#xD;
      weight loss maintenance. Data is expected to show that participants who are older, have less&#xD;
      support, have more health conditions, and with more psychosocial problems will benefit more&#xD;
      from Noom Health. It is also expected that confidence in the ability to lose weight will&#xD;
      produce more successful results in Noom Health vs. Noom Digital Health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 600 subjects will be enrolled in a randomized-controlled trial comparing the Noom&#xD;
      app (Noom Health) to a digital control (Noom Digital Health) with 6 months of intervention&#xD;
      and 6 months active maintenance in both groups. Measures will include demographics,&#xD;
      psychosocial measures, height/weight, waist circumference, weight loss history/practices,&#xD;
      health care practices/utilization, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete informed consent and interviews via a HIPAA-compliant&#xD;
      videoconference (Zoom) and other questionnaires via a REDCap interface. All participants will&#xD;
      complete screening/baseline procedures to determine eligibility and initial information.&#xD;
      Subsequently, they will be randomized to one of the groups for a 6-month intervention and 6-&#xD;
      month maintenance period (12 months total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Noom Health, participants will be encouraged to use the app multiple times per day to log&#xD;
      eating episodes, physical activity and weight. Coaches will also interact with participants&#xD;
      directly through the app. In Noom Digital Health, participants will use a simplified version&#xD;
      to log eating episodes and weight. Both conditions will receive the same weight loss advice&#xD;
      content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention, participants will complete monthly satisfaction surveys.&#xD;
      Additionally, follow-up measures will be conducted at 7 time points (Screening/Baseline, 1&#xD;
      month, 4 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, and 30 months).&#xD;
