  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare two distinct modes of NIM Vital application in thyroid&#xD;
      surgery: i-IONM vs. NerveTrend mode with respect to prevalence of early postoperative RLN&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis explored in this study is that NerveTrend mode may be more accurate than&#xD;
      conventional i-IONM mode in intraoperative identification of impending neural injury and in&#xD;
      prognostication of postoperative glottis function in monitored bilateral thyroid surgery.&#xD;
      Hence, NerveTrend mode may be considered a bridge between i-IONM and c-IONM modes, and&#xD;
      particularly in health care environments with limited financial resources it can be&#xD;
      considered a substantial step forward representing a modern alternative to the c-IONM&#xD;
      technique and providing benefits over conventional i-IONM mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, randomized study with 2 arms: i-IONM vs. NeveTrend mode (n=132 patients and&#xD;
      264 nerves at risk, each).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is prevalence of recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury (%) on&#xD;
      postoperative day 1 assessed by direct laryngoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past two decades, intraoperative neural monitoring (IONM) has evolved into a mature&#xD;
      risk minimization tool. Meta-analyses of studies, most of which were limited by poor study&#xD;
      designs and the sole use of intermittent nerve stimulation, failed to clearly demonstrate&#xD;
      superiority of intermittent IONM (i-IONM) over anatomic visual recurrent laryngeal nerve&#xD;
      (RLN) dissection in the absence of IONM. However, a substantial number of systematic reviews&#xD;
      of i-IONM in thyroidectomy have conflicting results, but their mean methodological quality is&#xD;
      critically low. Sanabria et al suggested that design of a systematic review should comply&#xD;
      with methodological standards and recommendations to offer relevant and practical information&#xD;
      for decision making. In particular, with the advent of continuous IONM (c-IONM),&#xD;
      intraoperative nerve electromyographic tracings, registered almost in real time during the&#xD;
      operation, accurately predict postoperative vocal fold function when International Neural&#xD;
      Monitoring Study Group (INMSG) quality standards are adhered to. Despite promising data on&#xD;
      benefits of c-IONM is still remains rarely utilized worldwide in thyroid surgery. C-IONM aids&#xD;
      in avoiding permanent traction-related nerve injury by urging surgeons to reverse harmful&#xD;
      surgical maneuvers. C-IONM also forms an integral part in the surgical concept of staged&#xD;
      thyroidectomy. Delaying completion surgery on the other side until nerve function has&#xD;
      recovered practically abolishes the risk of bilateral vocal fold palsy. C-IONM has greatly&#xD;
      furthered our understanding of functional RLN injury, enabling conception of effective risk&#xD;
      minimization strategies tailored to the individual patient. As recently reported by Schneider&#xD;
      at al c-IONM is superior to i-IONM in preventing vocal cord palsy. Based on nerves at risk&#xD;
      (5208 versus 5024 nerves), c-IONM had in this study a 1.7-fold lower early postoperative&#xD;
      vocal cord palsy rate than i-IONM (1.5 versus 2.5 %). This translated into a 30-fold lower&#xD;
      permanent vocal cord palsy rate (0.02 versus 0.6 %). Early postoperative vocal cord palsies&#xD;
      were 17.9-fold less likely to become permanent with c-IONM than i-IONM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, a brand new NIM Vital equipment allows now for using i-IONM in quasi&#xD;
      continuous mode which is termed NerveTrend mode. This concept is a natural evolution of&#xD;
      i-IONM towards c-IONM mode but is operator dependent and not automatic as in c-IONM mode.&#xD;
      Hence, careful clinical validation of NerveTrend mode is needed in order to identify its&#xD;
      clinical pertinence with respect to preventing neural damage compared to the standard of&#xD;
      i-IONM mode in thyroid surgery. A prospective, randomized study with 2 arms: i-IONM vs.&#xD;
      NeveTrend mode (n=132 patients and 264 nerves at risk, each).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who will sign the informed consent will be randomized to two groups: i-IONM vs.&#xD;
      NerveTrend application during planned total thyroidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standardized approach to IONM will be used as outlined by the guidelines of the&#xD;
      International Neural Monitoring Study Group in Thyroid and Parathyroid Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the operations will be performed under general anesthesia by two experienced endocrine&#xD;
      surgeons (MB, AK) with annual volume of thyroid surgery &gt; 300 cases, each. The anesthesia&#xD;
      protocol is: intravenous midazolam premedication, induction with fentanyl, thiopental and&#xD;
      suxamethonium, endotracheal intubation and sevoflurane maintenance. No other muscle relaxants&#xD;
      are used during surgery. A standard cervicotomy is used in all the patients. Visual&#xD;
      identification of RLN low in the neck (below the crossing with the inferior thyroid artery)&#xD;
      will facilitated by the use of the IONM system employing the nerve mapping technique. Once&#xD;
      the nerve iss visually identified, repeated stimulations with the IONM monopolar probe served&#xD;
      to trace the nerve path in the operative field and test its functional integrity during&#xD;
      dissection. In each patient, RLN will be exposed and the branches of the superior and&#xD;
      inferior thyroid arteries will be divided close to the thyroid capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIM Vital (Medtronic, Jacksonville, US) will be used. The NIM Vital system operates with&#xD;
      surface electrodes integrated with an endotracheal NIM TriVantage tube 7.0-8.0 in diameter,&#xD;
      which is inserted by an anesthetist between the vocal folds under direct vision during&#xD;
      intubation. The standardized technique of IONM RLNs wll be used, including initial vagal&#xD;
      response evaluation at the beginning and final vagal response evaluation at the end of&#xD;
      surgery (IONM = L1+V1+R1+R2+V2+L2) according to the recommendations formulated by the&#xD;
      International Intraoperative Neural Monitoring Study Group. The nerves will be stimulated&#xD;
      using a monopolar electrode and the interrupted stimulation technique at 1mA, 100ms impulse&#xD;
      duration and 4Hz frequency. In case of the bifurcated RLN nerves, the assessment includes&#xD;
      post-stimulation response of each nerve branch. Adduction of the vocal folds is detected by&#xD;
      the endotracheal tube electromyography and abduction by finger palpation of muscle&#xD;
      contraction in the posterior cricoarytenoid (&quot;laryngeal twitch&quot;). In operations with i-IONM&#xD;
      mode the IONM stimulator will be used to test vagal response at the beginning of surgery, map&#xD;
      out and trace the RLNs during surgery by repetitive stimulations, and in case of loss of&#xD;
      signal (LOS) it will be used to identify the type and site of neural injury (Type I vs. Type&#xD;
      II). Final prognostication of postoperative neral function will be based on vagal stimulation&#xD;
      at the end of each lobectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In operations with NerveTrend the IONM stimulator will be used in the same manner as in the&#xD;
      i-IONM arm, but the EMG trending including amplitude and latency changes from initial vagal&#xD;
      baseline will be evaluated using the NerveTrend mode at 3 - 5min intervals to assure almost&#xD;
      real time EMG tracing and allow for modification of surgical maneuvers in case of occurrence&#xD;
      of severe combined events (yellow zone) in order not to end up with the LOS (red zone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LOS is defined as absence of EMG signal following stimulation of the ipsilateral vagus nerve,&#xD;
      EMG signal amplitude below 100 μV following stimulation with 1-2 mA current in dry field,&#xD;
      lack of palpable &quot;laryngeal twitch&quot; or visible laryngeal movement following stimulation of&#xD;
      the ipsilateral vagus nerve. To differentiate between true and false LOS, the INMSG-proposed&#xD;
      problem-solving algorithm will be employed intraoperatively. In cases intraoperatively&#xD;
      recognized as true LOS, the neuromapping technique is used to determine the character of&#xD;
      nerve damage (segmental- type I, global - type II), and the localization of the injury site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IONM assessment is based on the definition by Chan and Lo. The percentage of RLN dysfunctions&#xD;
      is calculated per the number of RLNs at risk and not per the number of patients. Loss of&#xD;
      signal after vagal stimulation following thyroid lobe resection (V2) is classified as a&#xD;
      positive test result prognosticating ipsilateral vocal cord paresis. The test is interpreted&#xD;
      as true positive (TP) when laryngoscopy confirmed ipsilateral vocal cord paresis, and false&#xD;
      positive (FP) when the mobility of the ipsilateral vocal fold is normal. Preserved normal&#xD;
      signal following vagal stimulation after thyroid lobe resection (V2) is classified as a&#xD;
      negative result that prognosticated normal postoperative mobility of the ipsilateral vocal&#xD;
      fold. The test is interpreted as true negative (TN) when laryngoscopy demonstrated&#xD;
      postoperative normal mobility of the ipsilateral vocal fold and as false negative (FN) when&#xD;
      ipsilateral vocal fold paresis is seen postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation for the study: The sample size is estimated based on the principle of&#xD;
      detecting a 5% difference in the prevalence of early RLN injury (6% for i-IONM vs. 1% for&#xD;
      NerveTrend) with a 80% probability at p &lt; 0.05. Assuming a 20% drop out rate a group of 528&#xD;
      nerves at risk (assessed in 264 patients undergoing bilateral thyroid surgery) should be&#xD;
      enough to test if clinically pertinent differences exist between i-IONM vs. NerveTrend modes&#xD;
      (n = 264 nerves at risk which is equal to 132 patients in each respective group undergoing&#xD;
      bilateral thyroid surgery). The resultant data will be statistically processed using the&#xD;
      statistical software MedCalc (version 19, MedCalc Software, Belgium). Assessment of the&#xD;
      changeability of the investigated parameters will be presented by arithmetic means, median&#xD;
      values, standard deviations (SD), minimum and maximum values (min - max), 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval (95% CI) and percentage of prevalence (%). An inter-group comparison of particular&#xD;
      properties will be done by means of the Chi-2 test (non-parametric variables) and by the&#xD;
      univariate analysis of variance ANOVA (parametric variables). To assess the diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy of intraoperative neuromonitoring, the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC)&#xD;
      curves will be analyzed and the Area Under Curve (AUC) values will be compared based on the&#xD;
      non-parametric method of DeLong et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the predictive values of the positive and negative results will be calculated and the&#xD;
      most optimal predictive criterion will be identified for i-IONM vs NerveTrend, separately.&#xD;
      The incidence of nerve events will be calculated based on the number of nerves at risk. The&#xD;
      significance level is accepted at p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
