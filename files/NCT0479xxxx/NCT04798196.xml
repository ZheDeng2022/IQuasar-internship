  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) are costly and pervasive among older adults. MCCs account&#xD;
      for 90% of Medicare spending, and 65% of Medicare beneficiaries have 3 or more chronic&#xD;
      conditions; 23% have 5 or more. MCCs are often addressed in primary care, where time&#xD;
      pressures force a focus on medication and lab results rather than self-management skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate whether voice-activated &quot;smart&quot;&#xD;
      technology increases adoption and sustains use of an evidence-based electronic health&#xD;
      intervention (Elder Tree, or ET) for older adults with multiple chronic conditions, and&#xD;
      thereby improves its potential to widely enhance quality of life and health outcomes. ET is&#xD;
      an existing intervention providing tools, motivation, and support on a computer platform to&#xD;
      help older adults manage their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ)-funded randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) found that ET improved quality of life and other factors among high users of primary&#xD;
      care with multiple chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. However, many people&#xD;
      did not use it extensively, which is a common problem with all web apps.&#xD;

    <description>ElderTree (ET) is an existing intervention providing tools, motivation, and support on a computer platform to help older adults manage their health.&#xD;
ET is based on the extensively tested Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS). ET is a &quot;walled garden&quot; free of ads, with design features based on older users' feedback as well as best-practice principles such as uncluttered screens and large type. ET uses computers to deliver key elements of successful interventions: long duration, ongoing outreach, prompts, monitoring, cognitive reframing, action planning, problem solving, self-tailoring, and peer support.

ElderTree on smart system (ET- SS) will use voice-activated &quot;smart&quot; speakers connected to the Internet. Because they are used by talking and listening rather than typing and reading, many barriers associated with laptop use can be avoided.</description>
