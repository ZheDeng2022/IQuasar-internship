  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator will apply 16 sessions of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (rTMS) over 4 consecutive days for adult patients suffering from Tourette's Syndrome.&#xD;
      Following rTMS, patients will undergo 8 sessions of Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for&#xD;
      Tics (CBIT) over 10 weeks via telemedicine. Clinical improvement in tic severity will be the&#xD;
      primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures including underlying physiological&#xD;
      effects will be measured via functional magnetic resonance imaginge (fMRI), high-density&#xD;
      electroencephalograhy (HD-EEG), and TMS.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomly assigned to active or sham stimulation, with 10 in each group,&#xD;
      followed by 10 weeks of tele-CBIT. Patients will have primary and secondary outcome measures&#xD;
      performed at four time points: Baseline (T0), following rTMS (T1), following CBIT (T2), and 1&#xD;
      month later (T3). The rTMS protocol will consist of 6 trains targeted to the supplementary&#xD;
      motor area (SMA) lasting 5 minutes each (300 pulses per train) with an intertrain interval of&#xD;
      1 minute for a total duration of 35 minutes (1800 pulses). Patients will receive 4 sessions&#xD;
      each day on 4 consecutive days for a total of 16 sessions. Daily duration of this study&#xD;
      protocol should last approximately 170 minutes including a 10 minute break in between each&#xD;
      session. The sham protocol will be the same except a sham coil will be used instead of an&#xD;
      active coil. Following rTMS, patients will undergo 10 weeks of tele-CBIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following outcome measures will be collected at four timepoints (T0, T1, T2, and T3):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tics will be examined with the standardized Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) and the&#xD;
      modified Rush Videotape Tic Rating Scale (mRVTRS), and co-morbid symptoms with the Beck&#xD;
      Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive&#xD;
      Scale (Y-BOCS) and Adult ADHD Self-Reports Scale (ASRS). Quality of life will be assessed&#xD;
      with the Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome - Quality of Life scale (GTS-QOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS measures: A single-pulse of TMS will be targeted over the motor cortex to generate a&#xD;
      motor evoked potential (MEP), which can be captured on EMG. The rest of the EMG will be&#xD;
      analyzed to assess the time between the TMS pulse and the MEP (also known as the latency) and&#xD;
      the amount of time muscle activity remains silent following the MEP (also known as the&#xD;
      cortical silent period). In a paired-pulse TMS paradigm, a subthreshold pulse will be&#xD;
      provided followed by an interstimulus interval and then subsequent delivery of a&#xD;
      suprathreshold pulse. When the interstimulus interval is short (1-4 msec), the ratio of MEP&#xD;
      amplitudes produced by these two pulses is known as short interval intracortical inhibition&#xD;
      (SICI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI measure: Functional MRI will be used to record Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD)&#xD;
      activity changes in patients at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HD-EEG measure: A 128-electrode cap will be used to assess electrical activity in patients at&#xD;
      rest and actively trying to suppress their tics.&#xD;

    <measure>Tic severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tic severity will be measured with YGTSS. YGTSS is a clinician-rated scale used to assess tic severity, scored out of 100 where a higher score indicates greater tic frequency and severity. It includes a checklist of motor and vocal tics followed by an assessment of the number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and inference of motor tics and phonic tics - scored separately. Each of these dimensions is scored on a 0 to 5 scale. The YGTSS provides three tic severity scores: Total Motor (0 to 25); Total Phonic (0 to 25) and the combined Total Tic Severity Score (0 to 50), as well as a separate Impairment dimension scored from 0 to 50.</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a tool used by an objective examiner to quantify the severity of a patient's tics by rating the number of body areas affected, motor tic frequency, phonic tic frequency, motor tic severity, and phonic tic severity, each on a 0 through 4 score by watching a video of the patient. Scored out of 20, where a higher score indicates greater tic severity.</description>
