  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with serious mental illness (SMI) such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and&#xD;
      bipolar affective disorder have a significantly reduced life expectancy, caused in part by&#xD;
      increased incidences of mortality from physical health conditions such as cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD) and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic clinical decision support systems (eCDSS) offer clinicians patient-specific advice&#xD;
      and recommendations based on clinical guidelines, theoretically overcoming obstacles in the&#xD;
      use of existing paper-based guidelines. Adoption of eCDSS to address CVD risk in people with&#xD;
      SMI presents a unique opportunity for research, but requires evidence of acceptability and&#xD;
      feasibility before scaling up of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key objective of this study is to establish the feasibility and acceptability of an eCDSS&#xD;
      (CogStack @ Maudsley) compromising a real-time electronic health record powered alerting and&#xD;
      clinical decision support system for diabetes management in secondary inpatient mental&#xD;
      healthcare settings. End-users of the eCDSS will be clinicians only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly we will conduct initial surveys and interviews with clinicians on inpatient wards to&#xD;
      scope experiences of managing diabetes in secondary mental healthcare settings and attitudes&#xD;
      towards use of digital technologies to aid in clinical decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A feasibility study will then be run to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of&#xD;
      implementing eCDSS on inpatient wards. This will involve a cluster RCT on inpatient general&#xD;
      adult psychiatry wards, where 4 months of eCDSS use by clinicians on intervention wards will&#xD;
      be compared to 4 months of treatment as usual on control wards. All clinicians on recruited&#xD;
      wards will be eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, participating clinicians on intervention wards will be invited to&#xD;
      take part in a survey and interview which will explore their experiences and attitudes&#xD;
      towards using the eCDSS, and an implementation science framework will be applied to inform&#xD;
      future implementation of eCDSS. Group level pseudonymised outcome data will be gathered&#xD;
      through a separate study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with serious mental illness (SMI) such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and&#xD;
      bipolar affective disorder have a significantly reduced life expectancy in comparison to the&#xD;
      general population. Improvements to the primary prevention of physical health illnesses like&#xD;
      diabetes in the general population have not been mirrored to the same extent in people with&#xD;
      SMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by a high blood sugar level over a&#xD;
      prolonged period of time. If left untreated or poorly managed, diabetes can lead to various&#xD;
      long term health complications including cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease, foot ulcers, damage to the nerves and damage to the eyes. Diabetes accounts for&#xD;
      approximately 10% of healthcare resources in the UK, and this is set to rise to 17% with an&#xD;
      estimated cost of Â£39.8billion by 2035 when direct healthcare costs and indirect costs on&#xD;
      productivity are taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with SMI have higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as&#xD;
      central obesity, high blood pressure, raised cholesterol levels, and raised blood sugar&#xD;
      levels compared to the general population. Local rates of diabetes in people with a diagnosis&#xD;
      of established psychosis are 20% with a further 30% evidencing dysglycaemia (raised blood&#xD;
      sugar levels). Again locally, rates of glucose dysregulation (indicator for high risk of&#xD;
      developing diabetes) doubles in the first year after a first psychotic episode, creating a&#xD;
      unique window for prevention strategies to address these risks as early as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key inequality in healthcare provision in people with SMI is the less than adequate&#xD;
      assessment and treatment of physical health conditions such as diabetes in secondary mental&#xD;
      healthcare settings. There is therefore a need for more targeted and clinically informed&#xD;
      interventions, that improve the standard of physical healthcare screening and interventions&#xD;
      offered to people with SMI across both primary and secondary care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Globally, studies evaluating the provision of care by clinicians reveal that there is a&#xD;
      sub-optimal uptake of guidelines into actual practice. The underlying factors for this are&#xD;
      complex and occur at a combination of patient, clinician and system levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adoption of digital technology to improve physical health in people with a diagnosis of SMI&#xD;
      presents a unique opportunity, but requires evidence of acceptability, feasibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness. Given the rising disease burden from diabetes in SMI, and deficits in&#xD;
      providing evidence-based care for diabetes prevention and treatment, there is a pressing need&#xD;
      to identify more systems-focused solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic clinical decision support systems (eCDSS) are well established as a strategic&#xD;
      method of improving care for prevention and management of chronic conditions. eCDSS is&#xD;
      defined as &quot;any electronic information system based on a software algorithm designed to aid&#xD;
      directly in clinical decision making, in which characteristics of individual patients are&#xD;
      used to generate patient-specific assessments or recommendations that are then presented to&#xD;
      clinicians for consideration&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical guidelines remain under-utilized in clinical practice, thus eCDSS has the potential&#xD;
      to overcome problems associated with the use of traditional paper-based guidelines. However,&#xD;
      the existing evidence base for eCDSSs improving clinical performance and patient outcomes in&#xD;
      mental healthcare settings remains sparse. In addition, electronic systems that are not&#xD;
      accepted by their users cannot be expected to contribute to improving quality of care, hence&#xD;
      facilitators, barriers and other consequences need to be understood for successful&#xD;
      implementation of novel digital tools and could also serve as a basis for future system&#xD;
      re-engineering. Hence there is call for research to include evaluating its implementation for&#xD;
      successful future scalability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key digital tool to be used for eCDSS in this study is CogStack, a software platform&#xD;
      developed by the National Institute for Health Research Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre&#xD;
      (NIHR Maudsley BRC) and PhiDataLab. CogStack is an open source information retrieval and&#xD;
      extraction system with the capability to offer near real-time natural language processing&#xD;
      (NLP) of electronic health records. CogStack implements new data mining techniques,&#xD;
      specifically the ability to search any clinical data source (unstructured and structured),&#xD;
      and NLP applications developed to automate information extraction of medical concepts. The&#xD;
      platform has shown early potential to be of value to clinicians in monitoring, intervention&#xD;
      and follow up for their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to establish the feasibility and acceptability of an&#xD;
      eCDSS (Cogstack@Maudsley) compromising a real-time computerised alerting and clinical&#xD;
      decision support system for dysglycaemia management in secondary mental healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary objectives are to assess whether the system leads to changes in screening and&#xD;
      follow-up testing rates for dysglycaemia, and subsequent clinician-led evidence-based&#xD;
      interventions for dysglycaemia and diabetes (this will be measured using pseudonymised group&#xD;
      observational data gathered from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM)&#xD;
      Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) Clinical Records Interactive Search (CRIS) system once ward&#xD;
      access to the eCDSS has ended). Since 2006, South London and Maudsley NHS Trust has operated&#xD;
      fully electronic health records. The Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system,&#xD;
      established in 2008, is an ethically approved electronic health records interface system that&#xD;
      allows researchers to access deidentified electronic health records from this Trust for&#xD;
      research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a process evaluation to assess the barriers, facilitators, unintended&#xD;
      consequences, and indicative costs of implementing the system onto inpatient general adult&#xD;
      psychiatry wards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data gathered from this study will allow the research team to refine the system, address&#xD;
      potential problems with future successful implementation, and inform a larger and more&#xD;
      definitive effectiveness trial which will examine for hypothesised improvements in;&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Clinical outcomes relating to diabetes care&#xD;
