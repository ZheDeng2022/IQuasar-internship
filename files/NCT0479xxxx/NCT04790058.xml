  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syncope is a common reason for emergency department (ED) presentation. While often benign,&#xD;
      some patients have serious and life-threatening underlying causes, both cardiac and&#xD;
      non-cardiac, which may or may not be apparent at the time of the initial ED assessment.&#xD;
      Identifying which patients will benefit from further investigation, ongoing monitoring and/or&#xD;
      hospital admission is essential to reduce both adverse outcomes and the high costs. Our group&#xD;
      has spent over a decade developing the evidence base for a risk stratification tool directed&#xD;
      at optimizing the accuracy of ED decisions: the Canadian Syncope Risk Score (CSRS). This tool&#xD;
      is now ready for the final phase of its introduction into clinical practice, namely a robust,&#xD;
      multicentre implementation trial of the CSRS based practice recommendations to demonstrate&#xD;
      its real-world effectiveness. Prior to the launch of the large-scale implementation trial, a&#xD;
      pilot study to assess primarily the feasibility and secondarily the effectiveness is needed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ED crowding limits the ability of the emergency providers to provide quality care, is a&#xD;
      growing crisis in North America and Europe, and leads to unsafe and rushed disposition&#xD;
      decisions which compromise patient care. On the other hand, hospital admission is expensive,&#xD;
      and an increasing awareness of nosocomial morbidity and the harms of unnecessary testing and&#xD;
      hospitalization exert countervailing pressure on low-yield admissions from the ED. Therefore,&#xD;
      improved accuracy in ED disposition decision-making is more important than ever, and syncope&#xD;
      typifies a common, high stakes condition in which improvements in efficiency are badly&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying which patients will benefit from further cardiac rhythm monitoring and/or&#xD;
      hospital admission is essential to reduce both adverse outcomes and high costs. A&#xD;
      comprehensive literature review of risk-tools and international guidelines concede that&#xD;
      previously published tools lack or have failed external validation, are excessively complex,&#xD;
      include as outcomes obvious conditions readily identified during the index ED evaluation, or&#xD;
      lacked power and specificity. These tools also do not offer specific clinical actions and are&#xD;
      not supported by the guidelines. The CSRS addresses each of the above weaknesses and coupled&#xD;
      with outpatient live cardiac monitoring is an innovative and standardized approach to ED&#xD;
      syncope management to expedite ED care, improve patient safety and reduce healthcare costs.&#xD;
      The investigators have identified the barriers and facilitators to effectively adapt&#xD;
      knowledge into local contexts as per the Knowledge to Action cycle, and have selected&#xD;
      implementation strategies accordingly. The proposed pilot study is a right step before&#xD;
      widescale implementation.&#xD;

    <description>During the control period, there will be no interventions. The intervention is the knowledge translation of the CSRS practice recommendations.The components of the practice recommendations include: 1) evidence-informed systematic clinical evaluation with appropriate history, physical examination and in-ED investigations for detecting serious underlying conditions and predicting 30-day serious outcomes; 2) application of the CSRS for risk-stratification at the end of ED visit after no serious underlying conditions for the syncope were identified; 3) use of patient information materials to aid in disposition; and 4) the use of 15-day outpatient cardiac monitoring for CSRS medium and high-risk patients upon ED discharge. The ED physician or non-ED physician performing consultation on the patient can apply all the components of the practice recommendation and decide disposition of the patients who are eligible to be studied.</description>

    <description>The intervention is knowledge translation of the CSRS practice recommendations. The first month of the intervention period will be designated as a transition period during which we will undertake intense educational efforts. The practice recommendations will be available online to physicians involved in ED syncope care. The practice recommendations and the online calculator will either be integrated into the electronic medical records (EMR) platforms or a hyperlink provided to physicians at the two hospitals for easy reference and score calculation. The intervention which is the application of the practice recommendations will occur during the patient's ED visit and patients who are eligible for 15-day cardiac rhythm monitoring will have their device applied either at the time of ED discharge or the next day morning.</description>

        The investigator will study the effect of Knowledge Translation on physicians involved in&#xD;
        ED syncope care and the effect of the practice recommendations on patients, ED management&#xD;
        and safety in 30-days and in 1-year. As the unit of randomization is the ED, all patients&#xD;
        presenting to the ED with syncope among whom no serious condition was identified during the&#xD;
        index ED evaluation and who did not require consultation/ hospitalization for a non-syncope&#xD;
        related reason will be included in the study for analysis. The investigator will use the&#xD;
        Canadian Emergency Department Information System presenting complaints suggestive of&#xD;
        syncope/pre-syncope or an ED discharge diagnosis of syncope using discharge diagnoses&#xD;
        fields or ICD-10 code R.55 for syncope to identify patients.&#xD;
