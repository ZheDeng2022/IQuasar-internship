  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The adolescence is a landmark in perceiving the sexuality and awareness about the sexual&#xD;
      experiences. Genitals warts were shown to be a potential risk to impair the sexual functions&#xD;
      in women. Adolescence is a vulnerable period in which the individuals may be prone to the&#xD;
      negative effects of the disorders affecting sexual functions such as genital warts. The&#xD;
      current study aimed to investigate the impact of genital warts on sexual functions in female&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;

      This current study aimed to elucidate the impact of genital warts on female sexual function&#xD;
      in adolescence. The current study also targeted to reveal whether there is any correlation&#xD;
      between the genital warts and the female sexual dysfunction, as well as the sexuality related&#xD;
      distress. The current study is conducted at Youth Center Outpatient Clinic of Ankara City&#xD;
      Hospital which is a high-volume tertiary health care center in Turkey. The study was&#xD;
      prospectively designed and data were collected between the 1 August 2020 and 1 February 2021.&#xD;
      Totally 90 female adolescents between the age of 17-21 who had regular sexual intercourse&#xD;
      with heterosexual partners were included. The Study group composed of 45 adolescents who had&#xD;
      genital warts and the Control group included 45 healthy adolescents. Female sexual function&#xD;
      Index (FSFI), Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX) and Female Sexual Dysfunction Scale&#xD;
      (FSDS) scores were compared between the two groups to evaluate the sexual functions.&#xD;
      Difference between two independent means (two groups) power analysis demonstrated that this&#xD;
      study achieved a power of 0.99, 0.98 , 0.99 with a 5% level of significance for comparison of&#xD;
      45 adolescents with genital warts and 45 healthy adolescents in terms of FSFI, ASEX, and FSDS&#xD;
      scores, respectively.&#xD;
