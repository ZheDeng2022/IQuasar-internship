  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot test of the Mopati program (&quot;partner&quot; in Setswana), which is a&#xD;
      multi-level intervention that guides healthcare providers and patients about treatment&#xD;
      partner selection, and trains treatment partners on provision of effective support. The&#xD;
      Specific Aims are: (1) To develop a multi-level treatment partner intervention with input&#xD;
      from community and healthcare provider stakeholders in Botswana; and (2) To conduct a pilot&#xD;
      test of the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects on viral suppression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will train health care providers to guide unsuppressed HIV positive patients in&#xD;
      the selection of a treatment partner. All health care providers at the intervention clinic&#xD;
      (e.g., physicians, nurses, peer counselors) will be educated about effective characteristics&#xD;
      of treatment partners, and provided with standard guidance about treatment partner selection&#xD;
      to deliver to all patients initiating ART or who are not suppressed (however, for increased&#xD;
      impact, the investigators will test the intervention only among those not suppressed). The&#xD;
      standard guidance will incorporate Motivational Interviewing (MI) strategies, to acknowledge&#xD;
      patients' difficulties and offer advice without trying to force the patient to select a&#xD;
      treatment partner of a particular type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention clinic will sponsor group sessions for treatment partners of unsuppressed&#xD;
      patients, to educate treatment partners about HIV treatment, and train treatment partners on&#xD;
      counseling skills to convey acceptance of and compassion, and to be non-judgmental and&#xD;
      non-confrontational. The investigators will train treatment partners in core MI skills of&#xD;
      open questions and reflective listening, to avoid confrontations and support patients in&#xD;
      developing motivation for adherence. In the training, the investigators will use experiential&#xD;
      learning methods to help partners to understand that confronting their partners about poor&#xD;
      adherence, while born out of love and concern for patients' health, is ineffective. The&#xD;
      investigators do not intend for treatment partners to be proficient in all MI counseling&#xD;
      strategies, but the investigators will train treatment partners to use the two core MI&#xD;
      skills. Patients and their treatment partners will be asked to attend at least 3 sessions&#xD;
      over the 3-month intervention period. The investigators will survey patients and treatment&#xD;
      partners at baseline and 3-months post-baseline and collect viral load from clinic records.&#xD;
      Intervention feasibility and acceptability will be assessed via mixed methods (e.g., semi-&#xD;
      structured interviews with patients, treatment partners, and clinic staff; refusal rates).&#xD;
