      Background: Maternal and paternal breastfeeding self-efficacy is an important factor and&#xD;
      could be modified in improving breastfeeding outcomes. Conducting breastfeeding educational&#xD;
      intervention that involves the husband as well as incorporating a web-based platform based on&#xD;
      breastfeeding self-efficacy theory is needs to be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The aim to investigate the effectiveness of the web-based educational&#xD;
      intervention on breastfeeding self-efficacy and breastfeeding outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized control trial will be conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      web-based educational intervention on breastfeeding self-efficacy and breastfeeding outcomes.&#xD;
      80 mothers and fathers from primary health care and public hospital in Jakarta will be&#xD;
      recruited in this study and will randomly allocate using block randomization. The&#xD;
      participants in the intervention group will receive standard usual care and web-based&#xD;
      educational intervention, while the control group will receive usual care. The outcomes of&#xD;
      this study are breastfeeding self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, infant feeding attitude, as&#xD;
      well as breastfeeding outcomes that will be measured at baseline, 38 weeks of pregnancy, 1&#xD;
      week, 1, 3, and 6 months. A generalized Linear Model will be used to test the effect of the&#xD;
      intervention for the group, time as well as group and time interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipatory result:The educational intervention will be effective in helping mothers and&#xD;
      fathers receiving interventions to have higher breastfeeding self-efficacy, lower levels of&#xD;
      depression and anxiety, higher breastfeeding attitude as well as exclusive breastfeeding rate&#xD;
      compared to mothers and fathers in the control group.&#xD;

      Study Design A randomized controlled trial design, two-arm, with a 1:1 allocation ratio, will&#xD;
      be conducted. The participants will be allocated in the intervention group or control group&#xD;
      using block randomization with a block size of 4. The statistician, who will not join in the&#xD;
      recruitment process, will generate the sequence of random allocation. To maintain the&#xD;
      allocation concealment, we will use opaque sealed envelopes that contain the sequence&#xD;
      numbers. Due to the nature of the study, it is difficult to blind the participants. Only the&#xD;
      data collector will be blinded to the participant's group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and setting The mother and her spouse will be invited to participate in this&#xD;
      study during the prenatal period from a public hospital and health care center in Jakarta.&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria of mothers are: (a) primiparous and singleton pregnancy at 12-34&#xD;
      weeks' gestation, (b) age â‰¥ 20 years, (c) tend to breastfeed the infant, (d) the husband&#xD;
      willing to participate in the educational program, (e) capable to use a cell phone, (f) can&#xD;
      access the internet, (g) fluent in reading and writing Bahasa. We will not include the&#xD;
      mothers and their partners in the study if they have no time to join in the online&#xD;
      educational intervention. Mothers will be excluded if they have conditions as follows: (a)&#xD;
      presence of congenital anomaly for the baby, (b) chronic disease or high-risk complications&#xD;
      during pregnancy and after delivery. To recruit suitable participants, we will approach the&#xD;
      eligible mothers and fathers using online recruitment via whatsapp from the patient list&#xD;
      during antenatal check-up and flyer at the hospital and health center. All participants will&#xD;
      be provided online informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation The sample size will be estimated based on a previous study of&#xD;
      breastfeeding self-efficacy intervention (Ansari, Abedi, Hasanpoor, &amp; Bani, 2014). A&#xD;
      two-sided two-sample unequal variance t-test is needed (Julious, 2004) to detect a medium&#xD;
      effect size in self-efficacy between intervention and control group (Ansari, Abedi,&#xD;
      Hasanpoor, &amp; Bani, 2014) using 80% power at a 5% significance level (alpha). Considering the&#xD;
      drop-outs rate and pandemic situation in Indonesia, we will recruit 160 pairs of participants&#xD;
      (200 pairs of mothers and fathers for each group) in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The intervention program will be pilot tested before the formal study. The&#xD;
      content validity of the intervention will be conducted by the breastfeeding expert panel&#xD;
      including one obstetric specialist, two lactation consultants, one educator and one&#xD;
      pediatrician (Appendix 7). The participants in the intervention group will receive standard&#xD;
      usual care in primary health care and the web-based educational intervention. The development&#xD;
      of the educational intervention is based on the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Theory (BSE)&#xD;
      (Dennis, 1999) The strategies will be developed from the four sources of breastfeeding&#xD;
      self-efficacy framework (Dennis, 1999) including (a) performance accomplishment (past&#xD;
      breastfeeding experience); (b) vicarious experience for example observation of others&#xD;
      individual performance, whether live, recorded, or printed) (Dennis, 1999; Kingston et.al.,&#xD;
      2007); (c) verbal persuasion (i.e. encouragement from a lactation consultant); (d)&#xD;
      physiological and emotional arousal (i.e. reducing negative interpretation like pain,&#xD;
      fatigue, anxiety or stress). The educational program will be consisted of six sessions which&#xD;
      cover 4 elements of breastfeeding self-efficacy theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To support the educational program, the researchers will discuss with the expert of&#xD;
      information system to prepare the website. The website will be created by using hosting and&#xD;
      domain services. Each session of education program will be delivered by written information&#xD;
      and video. Additionally, massage board for each session will be provided to allow mothers to&#xD;
      ask the question regarding the topic. The website will be designed to be compatible with&#xD;
      mobile phone, computer, and also tablets. After the expert approve the applicability of the&#xD;
      website, the pilot study will be conducted with 10 mothers and fathers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will recruit the mothers and fathers using flyer and the internet&#xD;
      advertisement for the potential eligible mothers and fathers. The research team using e-mail&#xD;
      or communication application will contact mothers and fathers who are interested to&#xD;
      participate in the study. The information regarding the purposes of the research will be&#xD;
      given to the mothers and fathers who eligible for this study. After participants agree to&#xD;
      participate in the research, the researcher will contact the participants to give the&#xD;
      username and the password. The research assistant will guide the participant to log in and&#xD;
      fill the personal information. The participants will be reminded to enter the website within&#xD;
      3 days by whatsapp and can complete the education session within 4 weeks. Mothers could not&#xD;
      start the other session before completing the previous one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total of section is 6-10 and will be followed up by telephone counselling at 2, 4, and 6&#xD;
      weeks postpartum. The duration of each session is 10-20 minutes, while duration of telephone&#xD;
      counselling is 30 minutes. Telephone counselling intends to support mothers in sustaining&#xD;
      exclusive breastfeeding until six months. The lactation consultant will ask about mother's&#xD;
      feeling after delivery, possible missconceptions, dan give emotional support for mothers and&#xD;
      fathers. Additionally, these telephone counselling also aim to monitor breastfeeding progress&#xD;
      and also identify potential problems related to breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group Mothers in the control group will receive standard treatment with pamphlets&#xD;
      during the prenatal period. After delivery, standard postpartum care will be provided by the&#xD;
      midwife, including pamphlets, rooming in and encourage mothers to breastfeed the baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement The primary outcome of this study is maternal and paternal breastfeeding&#xD;
      self-efficacy. The secondary outcomes including infant feeding attitude, depressive symptoms,&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms, and breastfeeding rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic characteristics and obstetric variables Maternal socio-demographic&#xD;
      characteristics (i.e. age, level of education, working status, religion and wealth index) and&#xD;
      obstetric variables (i.e. parity, mode of delivery and frequency of antenatal check-up) will&#xD;
      be measured at baseline (recruitment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal breastfeeding self-efficacy Maternal breastfeeding self-efficacy is defined as the&#xD;
      confidence of a mother in her ability to feed the baby (Dennis, 1999). Bahasa Indonesia&#xD;
      version of the Breastfeeding Self Efficacy Short Form (BSE-SF) maternal version will be used&#xD;
      to measure self-efficacy among breastfeeding mothers (Sandhi, Lee, Chipojola, Huda, &amp; Kuo,&#xD;
      2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This questionnaire is a 14-items, self-reported questionnaire that measures breastfeeding&#xD;
      self-efficacy on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (not at all confident) to 5 (very confident)&#xD;
      (C. L. Dennis, 2003). Total scores are 14-70, with higher scores that suggest greater&#xD;
      self-efficacy of breastfeeding. The Cronbach alpha of the BESE-SF Indonesia version was 0.90.&#xD;
      We will measure the data at baseline, and follow up at 38 weeks of pregnancy, 1 week, 1, 3,&#xD;
      and 6 months after delivery through an online questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paternal breastfeeding self-efficacy Paternal versions of the Breastfeeding Self- efficacy&#xD;
      Scale-Short Form (BSES-SF) will be used to measure confidence with breastfeeding (Dennis,&#xD;
      Brennenstuhl, &amp; Abbass-Dick, 2018). This is a 14-item measure where items are rated on a&#xD;
      5-point Likert scale with response format ranging from not at all confident (1) to very&#xD;
      confident (5). Items summed to produce a total score ranging from 14 to 70, with higher&#xD;
      scores indicating higher breastfeeding self-efficacy. We will measure the data at baseline,&#xD;
      and follow up at 38 weeks of pregnancy, 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months after delivery through an&#xD;
      online questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression The Bahasa Indonesia version of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) will&#xD;
      be used to assess postpartum depressive symptoms in mothers (Paramita, Faradiba, &amp; Febrayosi,&#xD;
      2018). EPDS consist of 10-items which comprises of a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;no&quot;) to 3&#xD;
      (&quot;most of the time&quot;). The total EPDS score ranges from 0-30 whisch highest score indicates a&#xD;
      higher depression level. The Bahasa Indonesia version of the EPDS had a Cronbach's alpha&#xD;
      0.86. A cut-off point is â‰¤ 12 (low scorers) and &gt; 13 (high scorers) (J. L. Cox, Holden, &amp;&#xD;
      Sagovsky, 1987). We will measure the data at baseline, and follow up at 38 weeks of&#xD;
      pregnancy, 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months after delivery through an online questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) Bahasa Indonesia version questionnaire will&#xD;
      be used to measure anxiety (Setyowati et al., 2019). The SAS consists of 20 items with&#xD;
      4-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;no&quot;) to 3 (&quot;most of the time&quot;). The total score range from&#xD;
      20-80, which the higher score indicating more anxiety. Cronbach's alpha for the Bahasa&#xD;
      Indonesian translated of SAS subscales was 0.658. We will measure the data at baseline, and&#xD;
      follow up at 38 weeks of pregnancy, 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months after delivery through an&#xD;
      online questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale (IIFAS) IIFAS Bahasa Indonesia version consists of&#xD;
      16-items questionnaire to measure attitudes of mothers (Utami, 2016). The IIFAS was designed&#xD;
      to assess maternal attitude towards infant feeding and to predict breastfeeding intention and&#xD;
      exclusivity (Mora, Russell, Dungy, Losch, &amp; Dusdieker, 1999). Participants will respond for&#xD;
      each items on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly&#xD;
      agree). The total IIFAS score range from 16 to 80 with highest scores reflecting positive&#xD;
      attitude towards breastfeeding. The Cronbach alpha of this scale is 0.87 (Utami, 2016). We&#xD;
      will measure the data at baseline, and follow up at 38 weeks of pregnancy, 1 week, 1, 3, and&#xD;
      6 months after delivery through an online questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breastfeeding rate Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as mothers who only fed breast milk to&#xD;
      their infants. This could also include the delivery of breast milk and vitamin or mineral&#xD;
      supplement syrups. Predominant is defined as breast milk-receiving infants as the, defined as&#xD;
      infants receiving any liquid or semi-solid food from a bottle of nipple.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A self-report questionnaire will use to assess the mothers' breastfeeding rate. The&#xD;
      breastfeeding rate will be collected at 1 week, 1, 3and 6 months of infant age through online&#xD;
      or telephone interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection At baseline, demographic characteristics, paternal and maternal breastfeeding&#xD;
      self-efficacy, infant feeding attitude, anxiety as well as depression will be measured. We&#xD;
      will follow-up those variables at 38 weeks of pregnancy, 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months after&#xD;
      delivery through online questionnaire. Breastfeeding rate will be collected at 1 week, 1,&#xD;
      3and 6 months of infant age through online or telephone interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Data analysis will perform using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences&#xD;
      (SPSS) vers. 21 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA). The distribution of the continuous variables will&#xD;
      report using means and standard deviations, while the continuous data will adopt frequency&#xD;
      and percentages. Chi-square test will be used to compare the demographic characteristic of&#xD;
      the categorical variables (i.e. level of education, working status, and religion, parity),&#xD;
      while t-test for continues variables (i.e. age) between intervention and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main analyses for this study will use the Generalized Linear Model to test the main&#xD;
      effect of educational intervention on breastfeeding self efficacy, breastfeeding attitude,&#xD;
      anxiety and depression for group, time as well as group and time interaction. Chi-square test&#xD;
      or Fisher exact test will be used. Odds Ratio (OR) and Confidence Intervals (CI) will be&#xD;
      calculated to examine the association between intervention and control group.&#xD;
