  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laryngeal mask is a common supraglottic device (SGD) used in the daily practice for airway&#xD;
      management. Consecutive generations have permitted an expansion of its use. At the moment,&#xD;
      the SGD is being used in several situations, which include general anesthesia,&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and difficult airway management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To insert the SGD safely in these situations, the Fourth National Audit Project has&#xD;
      encouraged the use of second-generation SGD equipped with the passage of a nasogastric tube.&#xD;
      Ambu Auragain™ is a recent second-generation SGD with an incorporated gastric drainage&#xD;
      channel and the capability of working as a conduit for tracheal intubation. It has higher&#xD;
      leak pressure than the ones of first generation, which is a key marker of efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of its use; a higher leak pressure suggests a better seal between the artificial airway and&#xD;
      patient's airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are still few reports of which volume of cuff is the most appropriate for it&#xD;
      use. The cuff inflating volume is not standardized and it is common practice to inflate the&#xD;
      SGD cuff according to the manufacturer's recommendations, without using a manometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hyperinflation of the laryngeal mask cuff was associated with complications ranging from&#xD;
      sore throat, or dysphagia and dysphonia, to more serious complications such as paralysis of&#xD;
      the vocal cord, arytenoid cartilages dislocation, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and&#xD;
      hypoglossal nerve injury. Also, the excess of volume or pressure is related to poor&#xD;
      ventilation and increase the risk of gastric insufflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the best cuff inflation method, in order to limit the&#xD;
      intracuff pressure beyond the recommended maximum pressure (PM &lt; 60 cmH2O) and to allows&#xD;
      decrease the pharyngo-laryngeal complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary outcome is to compare three different cuff inflating methods using Auragain™&#xD;
      laryngeal mask during fibro bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedures, and&#xD;
      to control the intracuff pressure, and the effect on pharyngo-laryngeal complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three different cuff inflating methods are: 1) residual volume group (RV group ) 2) half&#xD;
      of the maximum volume group (MV group) 3) unchanged volume group (NV group)&#xD;

      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial. The study was approved by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of University Hospital of La Paz, Madrid. Written informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      from each participant before the procedure. The investigators plan to include 210&#xD;
      participants scheduled for fibrobronchoscopy with EBUS-trans-bronchial needle aspiration&#xD;
      (TBNA)) procedures under general anesthesia using a laryngeal mask airway device (LMA).&#xD;
      Participants will be allocated randomly to one of three groups of cuff inflating methods&#xD;
      according to computer-generated randomization. The size of LMA will be chosen according to&#xD;
      body weight, following the manufacturer recommendations (LMA size 3 for patients of 30-50 kg,&#xD;
      LMA size 4 for patients of 50-70 kg and LMA size 5 for patients with a weight &gt;70 kg). After&#xD;
      standard monitoring with electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure device and pulse&#xD;
      oximeter were applied, general anesthesia will be induced with Propofol 2.5 mg.kg-1 and&#xD;
      fentanyl 1 mcg.kg-1 intravenously, face mask ventilation with 100% oxygen will be used after&#xD;
      participants have lost eyelash reflex. Then, the assigned LMA will be inserted, after&#xD;
      appropriate conditions for laryngeal mask insertion are obtained. LMA Insertion will be&#xD;
      performed with standard maneuver according to LMA practice manual by the same experienced&#xD;
      anesthesiologist (&gt; 1-year use experience). The initial position of LMA will be assessed by&#xD;
      visualization of bilateral chest movement when positive pressure ventilation will be&#xD;
      performed and the square capnography waveform is observed on the monitor screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the LMA is not in the proper position at the first attempt, anesthetist will use an &quot;up&#xD;
      and down&quot; maneuver to adjust and reposition LMA to attain satisfactory ventilation. If this&#xD;
      maneuver fails, LMA will be withdrawn from the mouth of the participants and a second attempt&#xD;
      will be authorized to acquire a correct position. If the proper position of LMA cannot be&#xD;
      achieved after two attempts, the airway will be controlled with another device or a tracheal&#xD;
      intubation will be performed and the participants will be excluded from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient´s lungs will be ventilated with the anesthesia machine in controlled volume mode,&#xD;
      using the following parameters: Tidal volume, 8 ml/kg; frequency, 12-14 per min; the ratio of&#xD;
      inspiratory and expiratory, (I: E) = 1:2; and positive end expiratory pressure, 5 cmH20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the laryngeal mask will be fixed with adhesive tape and the vital signs will be stable,&#xD;
      the laryngeal mask cuff will be connected with a closed system manometer composed of a&#xD;
      three-way stopcock, a 5 ml syringe and a manometer. Intracuff pressure will be measured and&#xD;
      recorded, if it exceeds of 60 cmH20 we will deflate the cuff 1 mL by 1 mL with the syringe&#xD;
      until intracuff pressure reaches 60 cmH20. The deflated volume and the final intracuff&#xD;
      pressure will be recorded. We will measure the inspiratory peak airway pressure, the volume&#xD;
      difference of inspiratory and expiratory tidal volume under the positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation. The plateau pressure, medium pressure and Compliance will also be recorded at&#xD;
      the corresponding cuff inflating volume, before and after measuring OLP. The OLP will be&#xD;
      measured simultaneously at the corresponding cuff inflating volume, by setting the airway&#xD;
      pressure relief valve (APL) of the breathing circuit to 40 cmH20 at a fixed gas flow rate of&#xD;
      4 L/ min and reading the airway pressure on manometer at which equilibrium of airway pressure&#xD;
      will be established or at the pressure the air leakage will be heard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fiberoptic visibility scores will be recorded on a scale of 1 to 4 (4: only vocal cords&#xD;
      visible, 3: vocal cords plus posterior epiglottis visible, 2: vocal cords plus anterior&#xD;
      epiglottis visible, 1: vocal cords not seen). A score of 1 will be considered the worst and a&#xD;
      score of 4 was considered the best.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any adverse events (i.e., desaturation (pulse oximetry&lt; 90%), aspiration/regurgitation,&#xD;
      bronchospasm, airway obstruction, coughing, gagging or vomiting) and corresponding&#xD;
      interventions will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure, all participants will be transferred to the recovery unit and observed&#xD;
      for at least 1 hour. Observed adverse effects, such as sore throat, hoarseness, aphasia,&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting will be recorded in the recovery room period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 24h, a home telephone interview will record these parameters, as well as participants&#xD;
      satisfaction scores using visual analog scales.&#xD;
