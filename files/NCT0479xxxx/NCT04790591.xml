  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fast-track/rapid recovery/Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs have proven both&#xD;
      safe and effective in joint replacement surgery, to the degree where same-day surgery have&#xD;
      been tested in selected cases. A transition of the minor partial knee replacement (PKR)&#xD;
      procedure, compared with the alternative and more commonly used total knee replacement (TKR)&#xD;
      for knee osteoarthritis, into a same-day regime seems reasonable. Especially as PKR is&#xD;
      reported to have lower risk of short-term complications than does TKR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess efficacy, patient satisfaction and safety outcome measures&#xD;
      for PKR when using a same-day surgery protocol in a Swedish healthcare context where ERAS&#xD;
      programs nowadays are considered common ground.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With no preselection of patients, all PKR cases by one high-volume surgeon will&#xD;
      chronologically be scheduled as the first morning case for one consecutive year, and thereby&#xD;
      be included in the study. In order for discharge, strict post-surgery criteria will have to&#xD;
      be met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thesis is that the same-day surgery will be both feasible and safe.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The eligibility for being considered a medial PKR is either antero-medial osteoarthritis or&#xD;
      spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee. The study-protocol has a pragmatic approach to whom of&#xD;
      the PKR candidates will be considered for same-day surgery, as no preselection of patients&#xD;
      will be done prior to surgery. I.e., everyone considered for a PKR procedure will be informed&#xD;
      prior to surgery by a multidisciplinary team (anesthesiologist, nurse, physiotherapist, and&#xD;
      surgeon) that if the surgery will be scheduled in the morning, he/she will then be following&#xD;
      a same-day surgery protocol and likely be discharged to home later the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of one high-volume surgeon´s (MT) first morning slots for one consecutive year will be&#xD;
      dedicated to patients who will undergo PKR surgery, and thereby also be included in the&#xD;
      study. The slots will be filled continuously as the patients are put up for surgery. When all&#xD;
      slots have been taken within one week any additional PKR cases will be assigned to surgery&#xD;
      later in the day the same week (as will all the THRs and the TKRs during this period) and&#xD;
      consequently not taking part in this study. The operation scheduling will be put together on&#xD;
      a weekly basis, in a strict chronological order, by a team of nurses without any insight from&#xD;
      the surgeon in question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria for discharge will be based strictly on postoperative parameters categorized&#xD;
      into four dimensions - vital parameters, urinary function, bleeding, and mobilization. The&#xD;
      vital parameters will be measured and scored by the National Early Warning Score (NEWS),&#xD;
      where the threshold for discharge will be conservatively set to zero (NEWS 0). The urinary&#xD;
      function algorithm for discharge will, in short, be if no need for catheterization and less&#xD;
      than 200 ml of residual volume after spontaneous void. A compression stocking will be removed&#xD;
      six hours post-surgery and if no ongoing bleeding discharge can be considered. Last, but not&#xD;
      least, a physiotherapist will evaluate whether basic activity of daily living (ADL) can be&#xD;
      performed in a safely manner using crutches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures for this three-month follow-up will be safety, i.e. number of&#xD;
      adverse events and readmissions. Secondary aims will be feasibility such as same-day surgery&#xD;
      achievement and extra outpatient visits needed and for what reasons. Patient-satisfaction&#xD;
      will also be evaluated after the participants/patients have ben discharged to their own home.&#xD;
      A two-arm subgroup analysis will be conducted between those aged &lt;80 yrs and classified as&#xD;
      ASA &lt;3 and those aged ≥80 yrs. and/or classified as ASA class ≥3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive data will be presented as unadjusted means with standard deviations (SD), medians&#xD;
      with range, or as numbers with proportions (%). The between-group differences will be&#xD;
      presented as means with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and p values using Welch's test,&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U-test and Likelihood Ratio Test (or when violated Fisher's exact test) for&#xD;
      numerical, ordinal and categorical variables respectively. Multivariate analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted using logistic regression.&#xD;

(One can argue whether this study should be defined as a cohort study or as an open clinical trial. The idea of the study originated from the need to observe/confirm the feasibility and safety aspects of a routine which as of today has become common practice, namely same-day surgery, but as such it may also be categorized as a treatment... Either way, based on the preselection of age and comorbidity often reported in the literature, a two-arm subgroup analysis of the nonselective study participants will be conducted.)</intervention_model_description>
