  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BrUOG-401 is a prospective, single-arm, phase 2 trial of first-line therapy in adult patients&#xD;
      with previously untreated FL or MZL. All patients will be assigned the same initial treatment&#xD;
      plan, modified by interim response assessment (IRA) after Cycle 4. All patients will start&#xD;
      treatment with four 21-day cycles (C1-4) of mosunetuzumab alone (using step-up dosing during&#xD;
      C1), followed by IRA. Patients who achieve CR at IRA will continue with additional 4 cycles&#xD;
      (C5-8) of mosunetuzumab. Patients who achieve PR at IRA will receive mosunetuzumab with&#xD;
      lenalidomide augmentation during C5-8. Primary response assessment (PRA) will occur after C8.&#xD;
      Patients who remain in PR at PRA will continue for additional 4 cycles (extended&#xD;
      augmentation).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
             and to comply with the study protocol procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age ≥18 years at the time of signing informed consent. Because no dosing or adverse&#xD;
             event data are currently available on the use of mosunetuzumab in patients &lt;18 years&#xD;
             of age, they are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  follicular lymphoma (grade 1, 2, 3a, or not otherwise specified) or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  marginal zone lymphoma (nodal, extranodal, or splenic), according to 2016 WHO&#xD;
                  classification and confirmed to express the CD20 antigen by immunohistochemistry&#xD;
                  or flow cytometry. Patients in whom definitive pathologic subtype of FL/MZL is&#xD;
                  undetermined due to limited biopsy material can be enrolled if in the&#xD;
                  investigator's opinion integrated clinicopathologic data are consistent with the&#xD;
                  eligible diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Agreement to provide, if available, lymphoma tissue for correlative analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. At least one bi-dimensionally measurable nodal lesion, defined as &gt;1.5 cm in its&#xD;
             longest dimension, or one bi-dimensionally measurable extranodal lesion, defined as&#xD;
             &gt;1.0 cm in its longest diameter; with the exception of splenic MZL, which must be&#xD;
             evaluable using the International SMZL Group criteria.76,88,89&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. No prior systemic therapy for B-cell lymphoma, except for palliative corticosteroids;&#xD;
             prior radiation therapy is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Indication to start systemic therapy for lymphoma, in the investigator's judgement.&#xD;
             Patients with low burden of disease are eligible if they desire therapy; asymptomatic&#xD;
             patients should thoroughly understand the risks and benefits of lymphoma-directed&#xD;
             therapy versus watchful waiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Performance status ECOG 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Adequate hematologic function (unless due to underlying lymphoma as established by&#xD;
             bone marrow involvement or splenomegaly):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1.0 x 109/L,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelet count ≥75 x 109/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥40 mL/min/1.73m2 using the Mayo Quadratic Formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The effects of mosunetuzumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason and because lenalidomide used in this trial is known to be teratogenic, women&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal&#xD;
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) and refrain from donating eggs or&#xD;
             sperm throughout the treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of trial therapy.&#xD;
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Grade 3b follicular lymphoma or transformed lymphoma.&#xD;

          6. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requiring oral corticosteroids or chronic&#xD;
             oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;

             syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple&#xD;

             corticosteroids for &gt;12 months prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of any systemic immunosuppressive medications (including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-tumor necrosis&#xD;
             factor agents) with the exception of corticosteroid treatment using &lt;10 mg/day&#xD;
             prednisone or equivalent within 2 weeks prior to first treatment; a brief course of&#xD;
             palliative corticosteroids at higher doses (prednisone up to 100 mg daily, for up to 7&#xD;
             days) is allowed, but must be completed at least 7 days before the first dose of&#xD;
