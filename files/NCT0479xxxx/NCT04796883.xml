      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, single-arm single-center, open-label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma who require glaucoma surgery procedures that&#xD;
      meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and provide written informed consent will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 subjects will be enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
      15 patients will be implanted according to procedure 1 (see section 8.7), at completion&#xD;
      additional 15 patients will be implanted according to procedure 2 (see section 8.7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) center will participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Subject participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of active enrolment is anticipated to last approximately 6 months. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be achieved when the final study subject has completed 6 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single study group. This is a single-arm design; there is no control device in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits &amp; Procedures Pre-operative visit: 0-3 months prior to the implantation procedure. The&#xD;
      visit will include the subject's qualification assessment for inclusion/exclusion criteria as&#xD;
      described above. Informed consent must be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete anamnesis will be taken including the subject's medical complaints, medical history,&#xD;
      and medication use. Ophthalmic examinations as well as ultrasound biomicroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure: Procedure will be performed under anesthesia (at physician discretion)&#xD;
      and a Hanita shunt will be implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: All subjects will have regular follow-up visits at 1 and 7 days and on 1, 3, and 6&#xD;
      months post-implantation. 1-year post-operative evaluation is optional at the sponsor's&#xD;
      discretion. All postoperative visits will include a complete ophthalmic examination,&#xD;

    <measure>VISUAL ACUITY</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>โข Distance (far) manifest refraction and the testing distance used will be recorded on the case report forms. Manifest refraction will be determined using the maximum plus for best visual acuity method. The distance manifest refraction will be done with a distance adjusted chart but not less than 4 meters. The actual manifest refraction distance will be noted on the case report forms.&#xD;
Visual acuity will be measured with ETDRS format charts for distance and near. Results will be recorded in a LogMar scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>SLIT LAMP EXAM</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The slit lamp exam will include the measurement of aqueous cell and flare, and the measurement of corneal edema by a standard grading system. It will also include an evaluation for the presence of pupillary irregularities, iris atrophy and pigment dispersion. A gonioscopic exam using a consistent grading system at each site will also be conducted.&#xD;
For the evaluation of aqueous cells and flare, use a slit lamp beam 0.3 mm wide and 1 mm high, and use the following grading:&#xD;
Cells none (0) = no cells seen trace (+1) = 1-5 cells seen mild (+2) = 6-15 cells seen moderate (+3) = 16-30 cells seen severe (+4) = &gt; 30 cells seen&#xD;
Flare none (0) = No Tyndall effect trace (+1) = Tyndall effect barely discernible mild (+2) = Tyndall beam in anterior chamber is mildly intense moderate (+3) = Tyndall beam in anterior chamber is moderately intense severe (+4) = Tyndall beam is severely intense. The aqueous has a white and milky appearance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>MEASUREMENT OF INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Intraocular pressure will be measured using Goldmann applanation tonometry or other validated methods.</description>
