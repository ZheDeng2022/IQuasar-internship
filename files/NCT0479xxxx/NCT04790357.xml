  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major public health issue in developed countries. A full etiological work up&#xD;
      within a short time is critical to implement the appropriate preventive treatment. The&#xD;
      etiological work up is actually based on a clinical examination and on a group of&#xD;
      paraclinical examinations. The realization of the standard strategy is time consuming, and&#xD;
      increase the cost of the medical care. A non-invasive one-shot examination of the heart, the&#xD;
      aorta and the cervical and intracranial arteries (cci-MRI) could overcome these&#xD;
      disadvantages.The investigator therefore propose to carry out an overall assessment of the&#xD;
      performance of the cci-MR in the etiological work up of ischemic strokes and TIAs compared to&#xD;
      the reference strategy&#xD;

    <time_frame>Within 8 days after hospitalization</time_frame>
    <description>Presence or absence of coronary, intracranial, cervical, aortic atheroma. The diagnostic work up will focus on cervical artery stenosis ≥ 50%; aortic arch atheroma ≥ 4 mm; intracranial artery stenosis ≥ 50% and presence of ischemic myocardial scar. The scar pattern was classified as ischemic if its distribution was sub-endocardial to transmural within a coronary vascular territory and if scar was associated with segmental systolic dysfunction on corresponding cine images. Atherosclerotic burden will be classified in 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 atherosclerotic levels according to the number of arterial territories affected by at least one significant abnormality.</description>
