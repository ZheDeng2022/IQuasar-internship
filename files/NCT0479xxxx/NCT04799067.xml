      This is a prospective, cohort study. This study will include approximate 600 End Stage Renal&#xD;
      Disease (ESRD) patients receiving Haemodialysis (HD) treatment twice a week or thrice a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments at enrolment and in follow-up are summarized as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment - Patients will be in Long Interdialytic interval (LIDI) at enrolment (V1).&#xD;
      Demographic characteristics, medical history, etiology of ESRD, concomitant medications,&#xD;
      dialysis vintage, an electrocardiogram (ECG), a pre-dialysis serum potassium measurement and&#xD;
      a post- dialysis serum potassium measurement, blood routine, blood gas analysis and other&#xD;
      blood biochemistry measurements, etc., will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up - Potassium measurements, including pre-dialysis potassium measurements at LIDI&#xD;
      once every month (V3-V8), pre-dialysis potassium at SIDI during the first week (V2) for&#xD;
      patients in HD thrice a week specifically, will be obtained. Concomitant medications, blood&#xD;
      routine, blood gas analysis and other blood biochemistry measurements, etc., will be obtained&#xD;
