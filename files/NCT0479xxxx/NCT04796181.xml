  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Single center, single blinded, prospective validation study for the accuracy and&#xD;
      safety evaluation of Neteera 130H, a novel, radar-based contact-free device for heart and&#xD;
      respiratory rate measurements compared to reference devices and manual measurements. For the&#xD;
      purpose of this study, up to 100 eligible subjects, 18 years old and above will be enrolled&#xD;
      for a single study visit in which the subjects will be screened and upon eligibility&#xD;
      confirmation, will undergo HR and RR measurements using the investigational device as well as&#xD;
      the reference devices. RR will also be measured manually by the site staff.&#xD;
