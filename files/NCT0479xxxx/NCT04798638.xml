    <textblock>
      To assess the pharmacokinetics of TY-9591 tablets and Osimertinib Mesylate tablets after a&#xD;
      single fasting administration and the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of TY-9591&#xD;
      tablets in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, open label, two phases study in healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers. The first phase is a two-sequence, two-period crossover trial. The volunteers&#xD;
      will be randomly distributed into two groups and given either TY-9591 tablets or Osimertinib&#xD;
      Mesylate tablets on a single fasting administration. In the second phase, all volunteers will&#xD;
      be administrated TY-9591 tablets after a high fat meal. The washout between each treatment is&#xD;
      no less than 21 days.&#xD;
