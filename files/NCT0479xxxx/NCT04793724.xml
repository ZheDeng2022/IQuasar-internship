  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is characterized by impaired airway clearance and mucus&#xD;
      stagnation. This results in recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections often&#xD;
      leading to chronic inflammation and, if not treated early and properly, to irreversible&#xD;
      functional and structural changes of the respiratory tract. As there is no causal treatment&#xD;
      of PCD yet, airway clearance techniques (ACT) provide fundamental care for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simeox is a new airway clearance device, recently developed by the French company&#xD;
      PhysioAssist. This technology is based on pneumatic vibrations generated by the device&#xD;
      itself. Vibrations are induced by rapidly alternating between atmospheric and negative&#xD;
      pressure as the patient exhales, providing the most effective clearance of mucus from the&#xD;
      lungs. Vibrations of different intensity and frequency are known to alter the rheological&#xD;
      properties of mucus in the airways, whilst the negative pressure during exhalation helps to&#xD;
      mobilise and drain the mucus to the central bronchi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there have not yet been any evidence based papers published clarifying the effect of&#xD;
      Simeox specifically in patients with PCD, using up-to-date information, experience, and&#xD;
      positive feedback from our patients, we assume that there could be a significant benefit for&#xD;
      the effectiveness of ACT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study the effectiveness of ACT will be evaluated based on the short-term effect(s) of&#xD;
      respiratory physiotherapy with Simeox on changes in lung function and thoracic expansibility&#xD;
      paediatric patients with PCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interventional randomised non-inferiority crossover trial will be conducted in Motol&#xD;
      University Hospital; the project was developed by the multidisciplinary team (MDT) of the&#xD;
      Division of Paediatric Pulmonology of the Department of Paediatrics, 2nd Faculty of Medicine,&#xD;
      Charles University in Prague and Motol University Hospital; and the Department of&#xD;
      Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and&#xD;
      Motol University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned into 2 arms - &quot;Simeox-first group&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;Pari-O-PEP first&quot; group. Randomisation will be done using computer generated code for each&#xD;
      patient. The protocol will include 3 study visits - K0, K1 and K2 planned 3 months apart.&#xD;
      After 6 months (second visit - K1), each patient will be switched to the other interventional&#xD;
      group (crossed over). The first session (K0) includes an initial lung function assessment&#xD;
      using spirometry, nitrogen-Multiple Breath Washout test (N2-MBW), Electrical Impedance&#xD;
      Tomography (EIT), 6 Minute Walk Test (6 MWT), respiratory amplitudes (RA), and a theoretical&#xD;
      introduction to therapy with the Simeox device. The second (K1) and third (K2) sessions will&#xD;
      be interventional, including a respiratory physiotherapy session in between each measurement,&#xD;
      excluding 6 MWT, which will be measured just once per session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to randomisation criteria, participants will initially undergo either&#xD;
      physiotherapist-administered 20-minute ACT session using the Simeox device or 30-minute&#xD;
      therapy with PARI O-PEP. In accordance with the rules for crossover study design, each&#xD;
      patient will undergo therapy with both ACT devices, ideally within six-month duration of the&#xD;
      study. These interventions will take place in between each measurement (spirometry, MBW, EIT,&#xD;
      RA) during the second (K1) and the third (K2) session.&#xD;

clearance of the upper airways before the physiotherapy session&#xD;
correct position of the mouthpiece in patient's mouth, with the lips placed on the thinnest part of the mouthpiece and the tongue positioned underneath the mouthpiece&#xD;
slow nasal inhalation without too much recruitment of the inspiratory residual volume (IRV) and an exhalation with real deflation of the thorax&#xD;
step-by-step shifting of the patient's tidal volume towards the expiratory residual volume (ERV), in order to target the most distal regions of the lungs&#xD;
comfortable, relaxed sitting position with straightened spine&#xD;
controlled cough, which will be encouraged only when it is productive</description>

    <description>ACT with PARI O-PEP will be performed in an upright sitting position, using four positions of the device for the most effective clearance of mucus from the lungs. These positions will be:&#xD;
horizontal;&#xD;
low;&#xD;
transition of the device from the low position to the horizontal position;&#xD;
upside down.&#xD;
The mouthpiece will be placed between the patient's teeth as per standard procedure, and enclosed properly within the lips. Patients will perform slow and deep inhalation via the nose, then hold their breath for about 1 to 2 seconds at the end of inhalation. Exhalation will be performed slowly and completely into the PARI O-PEP through the patient's mouth. At the end of the session, the patient will perform &quot;huffing&quot; with the PARI O-PEP device in the upside down position in order to maintain open airways, and, if possible, expectoration sputum.</description>
