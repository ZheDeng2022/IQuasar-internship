  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the use of focused ultrasound ablation, low-dose gemcitabine (a&#xD;
      chemotherapy) and the combination of focused ultrasound ablation plus low-dose gemcitabine in&#xD;
      patients with early-stage breast cancers. We will be testing the effects of each of these&#xD;
      regimens on cells in the immune system. We hypothesize that the combination of focused&#xD;
      ultrasound ablation and gemcitabine will decrease myeloid-derived suppressor cells and will&#xD;
      increase T cell activity. We also hypothesize that focused ultrasound ablation and low-dose&#xD;
      gemcitabine will be safe and will result in non-inferior surgical completion rates and tumor&#xD;
      margin assessments.&#xD;
