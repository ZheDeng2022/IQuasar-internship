    <textblock>
      It is a prospective, single center, single-arm clinical study to enroll a maximum of 25&#xD;
      subjects. The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical utility of the da Vinci®&#xD;
      SP™ Surgical System, instruments and accessories in TORS benign base of tongue resection&#xD;
      procedures for the treatment of moderate to severe OSA. da Vinci® SP™ Surgical System,&#xD;
      instruments and accessories are the approved medical device product by MFDS (Ministry of Food&#xD;
      and Drug Safety, Republic of Korea).&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will undergo TORS benign base of tongue resection procedures (i.e., partial glossectomy, epiglottoplasty, epiglottectomy, and/or lingual tonsillectomy) for the treatment of OSA. Concomitant non-robotic surgical procedures may also be performed as part of the subject's treatment for OSA, and can include one or more of the following: uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), lateral pharyngoplasty, expansion sphincter pharyngoplasty, palatine tonsillectomy, or a modified uvulopalatoplasty. Nasal surgery such as septoplasty or turbinoplasty can be combined if it is needed.</description>
