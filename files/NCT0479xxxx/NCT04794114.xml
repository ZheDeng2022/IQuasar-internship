  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      hemiplegia is a pathological condition that affects one side of the body which is associated&#xD;
      with difficulty in maintaining an upright posture and walking and which is commonly&#xD;
      compensated for by using orthoses (AFO). However, the orthoses are inadequate for sports from&#xD;
      a design and prescription point of view, which specifies that the goal of the orthosis is to&#xD;
      support walking and that any other use compromises its reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective therefore provides for an improvement in the involvement of these children&#xD;
      in sports activities (both at school and during leisure time) through the development of new&#xD;
      generation orthoses.&#xD;

      The main objective therefore provides for an improvement in the involvement of these children&#xD;
      in sports activities (both at school and during leisure time) through the development of new&#xD;
      generation orthoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: the second objective involves the verification of the orthosis&#xD;
      previously designed and built, ie the device must comply with the project specifications and&#xD;
      allow the patient to perform sports activities. Correct functioning will be tested by&#xD;
      functional evaluation of the model developed through biomechanical analysis of movement&#xD;
      performed indoors (in the laboratory) and outdoors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notes on the calculation of the sample size: the project foresees the involvement at the&#xD;
      moment of 20 children with hemiplegia under treatment at MEDEA to whom an overall improvement&#xD;
      of the living conditions is to be guaranteed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steps: 1-Technology design - &quot;to play together&quot; 2 - Analysis and identification of the&#xD;
      guidelines for the prescription of use; 3 - Evaluation of the motor biomechanical situation&#xD;
      of subjects wearing orthoses: indoor and outdoor to evaluate the limits of the orthosis used;&#xD;
      4 - identification of indicators for the evaluation of motor performance; 5 - Identification&#xD;
      of the technical specifications (functional and clinical, mechanical, structural, geometric,&#xD;
      materials, design) of the new generation orthosis-sensor system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6- Definition of inclusion criteria, recruitment of 20 subjects starting from Medea and&#xD;
      contacts with schools and families to which they belong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7- Validation- &quot;to verify it really runs&quot; WP5.1 - Functional evaluation of the model&#xD;
      developed through biomechanical analysis of movement carried out in the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The I.R.C.C.S E. Medea will appropriately select 20 children with hemiplegia and wearers of&#xD;
      orthoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A biomechanical assessment will be performed through gait analysis to identify the limits of&#xD;
      the orthosis used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8- Two conditions will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  walking tests without orthoses;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  walking tests with orthoses usually used. From the comparative analysis of the collected&#xD;
           data, the criticalities of the device will be defined in order to identify the project&#xD;
           specifications of the new generation orthosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           9-Following the design and construction of the new AFO, a biomechanical evaluation will&#xD;
           be performed again by means of gait analysis to validate its correct functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
           10- Further validation will be performed using virtual reality environments (GRAIL Gait&#xD;
           Real time Analysis Interactive Lab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a rehabilitation process, once a certain degree of confidence has been reached in the&#xD;
      use of the new orthosis, the device will be tested using outdoor wearable sensors. By doing&#xD;
      so, it will be possible to identify indicators for the evaluation of sports performance.&#xD;
