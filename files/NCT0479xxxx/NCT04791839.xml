    <textblock>
      Since anti-PD1, anti-TIGIT, and A2R antagonists have complementary mechanisms of action, and&#xD;
      the latter two have shown synergism in combination with antibodies against PD-1, othis study&#xD;
      aims to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the triplet combination of zimberelimab,&#xD;
      domvanalimab, and etrumadenant in patients with non-small cell lung cancer previously treated&#xD;
      with immune checkpoint blockade therapy.&#xD;
