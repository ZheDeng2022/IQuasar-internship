  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Necrotizing enterocolitis(NEC) is one of the most serious disease in the newborn infants, and&#xD;
      two and more grades of NEC usually lead to surgery, even death. But, it is difficult to&#xD;
      predict when to operate the surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Necrotizing enterocolitis(NEC) is characterized by vomit, abdominal distention, hypoactive&#xD;
      bowel sounds and bloody stools, even shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC) and&#xD;
      sepsis. X-ray is shown Intestinal wall gas and/or portal vein pneumatosis and&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two and more grades of NEC in newborn infant is a urgent condition, and whether or not&#xD;
      operation is difficult to predict.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, the investigators develop a score system including five parameters(abdominal&#xD;
      circumference, base excess, heart rate, severities of respiratory distress, sepsis) in one&#xD;
      retrospective cohort, and the score system is used and assessed to predict the need for&#xD;
      surgery in another prospective cohort.&#xD;
