      According to the prevalence survey of thyroid diseases in ten cities in China in 2010,&#xD;
      TSH&gt;4.2 mIU /L was the diagnostic cut-off point, and the prevalence of hypothyroidism was&#xD;
      17.8%, including 1.1% clinical hypothyroidism.The annual incidence of hypothyroidism in China&#xD;
      is 2.9‰, and primary hypothyroidism is the most common.Typical patients have chilliness,&#xD;
      fatigue, swelling of hands and feet, lethargy, memory loss, hypoperspiration, joint pain,&#xD;
      weight gain, constipation, menstrual disorder or menorrhagia, infertility, which affects the&#xD;
      physiological and psychological functions of patients and reduces the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients.The treatment goal of primary clinical hypothyroidism is that the symptoms and signs&#xD;
      of hypothyroidism disappear, and TSH, TT4 and FT4 values remain in the normal&#xD;
      range.Levothyroxine (L-T4) is the main alternative therapy for this disease.Thyroid disease&#xD;
      patients quality of life questionnaire (Thyroid - specific Patient Reported Outcome, ThyPRO)&#xD;
      for the development of the Danish scholars such as WATT first can be applied to various&#xD;
      comprehensive scale of benign Thyroid disease patients, applied in the Danish people has good&#xD;
      reliability and validity, has been translated into ten languages application in many&#xD;
      countries the crowd, WATT et al in 2015 developed the scale of the concise version&#xD;
      (ThyPRO39).Studies have shown that in the treatment of patients with thyroid disease, even if&#xD;
      thyroid function is within the normal range, there are still physiological or psychological&#xD;
      impairments such as chills, fatigue, anxiety, depression, which reduces the quality of life&#xD;
      of patients.Studies have shown that TSH level in patients with hypothyroidism is correlated&#xD;
      with patients' quality of life. Even within the normal range, the higher TSH level is, the&#xD;
      worse the patients' quality of life score is, and there is an independent correlation in&#xD;
      fatigue and emotional susceptibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study except for other factors, such as merger disease with primary hypothyroidism&#xD;
      patients quality of life assessment, observe the normal JiaJian patients, we use the current&#xD;
      widely used thyroid disease patients to evaluate the quality of life questionnaire (ThyPRO -&#xD;
      39), observe thyroid hormone levels in patients with hypothyroidism and their quality of life&#xD;

      Hypothyroidism is a systemic metabolic syndrome caused by reduced thyroid hormone production&#xD;
      and secretion or reduced tissue function.According to the prevalence survey of thyroid&#xD;
      diseases in ten cities in China in 2010, TSH&gt;4.2 mIU /L was the diagnostic cut-off point, and&#xD;
      the prevalence of hypothyroidism was 17.8%, of which the prevalence of subclinical&#xD;
      hypothyroidism was 16.7%, and the prevalence of clinical hypothyroidism was 1.1% [6].The&#xD;
      prevalence was higher in females than in males and increased with age.The annual incidence of&#xD;
      hypothyroidism in China is 2.9‰[7].Epidemiological evidence suggests that hypothyroidism is&#xD;
      associated with anxiety and mood disorders [4].Several studies have shown that hypothyroidism&#xD;
      is associated with lower quality of life (QOL), higher load symptom, poorer physical and&#xD;
      mental health, and poorer attention performance.The treatment goal of primary clinical&#xD;
      hypothyroidism is that the symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism disappear, and TSH, TT4 and&#xD;
      FT4 values remain in the normal range.Levothyroxine (L-T4) is the main alternative therapy&#xD;
      for this disease [8].Thypro questionnaire (Thypro) is the first comprehensive scale developed&#xD;
      by Danish scholar Watt et al., which is applicable to patients with various benign Thyroid&#xD;
      diseases. It has been translated into 10 languages and applied in populations in many&#xD;
      countries.[9].Studies have shown that, in the treatment of hypothyroidism patients, even if&#xD;
      thyroid function is in the normal range, there are still chills, fatigue, anxiety, depression&#xD;
      and other physiological or psychological damage, reducing the quality of life of patients.The&#xD;
      relationship between thyroid hormone levels and quality of life in patients with treated&#xD;
      hypothyroidism is controversial.Studies have shown that in patients with primary&#xD;
      hypothyroidism, higher TSH values are associated with impaired quality of life, even if TSH&#xD;
      is within the normal reference range.TSH was positively correlated with the scores of fatigue&#xD;
      and emotional susceptibility scales, indicating that these two aspects of quality of life&#xD;
      were significantly affected with the increase of TSH level [1].However, some studies have&#xD;
      shown that the quality of life of hypothyroidism patients treated with levothyroxine has&#xD;
      nothing to do with the level of thyroid hormone, and TSH or free T4 cannot be used as the&#xD;
      indicator of the best treatment effect, because it cannot reflect the patient's quality of&#xD;
      life [2].But in the study, a significant percentage of patients with hypothyroidism&#xD;
      simultaneously with high blood pressure, diabetes, dyslipidemia, diseases such as depression&#xD;
      or anxiety, long-term use may affect the metabolism of thyroid hormones and drugs, and&#xD;
      combined with the disease itself also has effect on the quality of life in patients with [2],&#xD;
      not real thyroid hormone levels in patients with quality of life, their metabolism and the&#xD;
      influence of correlation, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study except for other factors, such as merger disease with primary hypothyroidism&#xD;
      patients quality of life assessment, observe the normal JiaJian patients, we use the current&#xD;
      widely used thyroid disease patients to evaluate the quality of life questionnaire (ThyPRO -&#xD;
      39), observe JiaJian thyroid hormone levels in patients with son and their quality of life&#xD;
      scale and the relevance of the blood sugar, blood lipid metabolic indicators related to&#xD;
      relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signed in patients voluntary and informed consent, to assess all criteria of patients,&#xD;
      collected demographic data (such as gender, age, etc.), record the history and the other&#xD;
      previous medical history, family history, related to the vital signs data (such as height,&#xD;
      weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, BMI and waist hip ratio, blood pressure),&#xD;
      laboratory indexes (including thyroid function, HbA1c, fasting insulin, fasting C peptide,&#xD;
      blood biochemistry), thyroid ultrasound.Patients meeting the inclusion criteria received two&#xD;
      questionnaires: ThyPRO-39 (Chinese version), and the MOS 36-item Short Form Health Survey&#xD;
      (SF36).ThyPRO39 has 39 items, 12 subscale tables and 1 single item to evaluate overall&#xD;
      quality of life.The 12 subscales were further divided into 3 categories: (1) somatic symptoms&#xD;
      (goiter symptoms, hyperthyroidism symptoms, hypothyroidism symptoms, thyroid ophthalmopathy&#xD;
      symptoms);(2) physiological (fatigue, cognition), psychological (anxiety, depression, mood)&#xD;
      and social (social activities, daily life);(3) the appearance.This scale is a self-rating&#xD;
      scale, and Likert 5-grade score is used to calculate the crude score of each subscale, and&#xD;
      then the control scoresheet and calculation formula are converted into standard score. The&#xD;
      total score of standard score ranges from 0 to 100, and the higher the score, the worse the&#xD;
      quality of life [3].SF36 is a commonly used universal scale for the study of quality of life&#xD;
      in patients with thyroid disease, which measures 8 health concepts and 1 self-rating of&#xD;
      health changes.Eight of these health concepts are further divided into two categories, namely&#xD;
      physical health and mental health.SF36 is a multi-item scale, each dimension contains 2 ~ 10&#xD;
      items, including a total of 36 items.The total score of SF36 is 100 points, and the higher&#xD;
      the score, the better the health status [5].The purpose of this study was to evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship between thyroid function and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and related&#xD;
      metabolic indicators in patients with hypothyroidism.&#xD;
