      Background: Root canal preparation techniques using manual instruments have found to be&#xD;
      time-consuming and may lead to iatrogenic errors such as ledging, zipping, canal&#xD;
      transportation, and apical blockage. To overcome this, much attention has been directed&#xD;
      toward root canal preparation using nickel-titanium (NiTi)-rotary instruments. The&#xD;
      flexibility and the instrument design of NiTi-rotary files allow it to closely follow the&#xD;
      original root canal path. Aim: This in vitro study aims to compare the amount of dentin&#xD;
      removal in primary molars instrumented with hand versus rotary files and the root canal&#xD;
      transportation and risk of perforation using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Materials&#xD;
      and Method: ( 20 ) extracted discarded mandibular second primary molars were selected to&#xD;
      contribute in the study, having minimal apical resorption with presence of at least two-third&#xD;
      remaining root structure with absence of visual perforating resorption. The teeth included in&#xD;
      the study were stored in water or saline till the experimental time. The extracted primary&#xD;
      molars were divided into two groups of the study: Group I was prepared with rotary&#xD;
      instrumentation using ProTaper Next (Dentsply, Switzerland) and Group II was prepared by&#xD;
      manual instrumentation using K type files. All the root canals (n=40) were prepared up to&#xD;
      size 35 using the step-back technique. The teeth were subjected to CBCT scans for the&#xD;
      evaluation of thickness of radicular dentin remaining, risk of perforation and canal&#xD;
      transportation before and after instrumentation in the two groups at three different&#xD;
      locations (2, 4 and 7 mm from the apex) . Dentin removal was calculated by superimposing&#xD;
      images using the InVivo 5.1 software. Data were statistically analyzed using independent&#xD;
      samples t test.&#xD;

      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the shape &amp; diameter of root canals, risk of perforation and the canal&#xD;
      transportation after using rotary versus manual instruments on root extracted second primary&#xD;
      molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracted second primary molars will be collected from the dental clinics of Pediatric&#xD;
      Dentistry and Dental Public Health Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The teeth are extracted either due to periodontal problems or because they are not restorable&#xD;
      (beyond restoration) by the conventional coronal restorations or full coverage restorations&#xD;
      in the case of root caries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The teeth will be selected according to our inclusions and exclusion criteria. The teeth will&#xD;
      be collected, sterilized and stored according to the Occupational Safety and Health&#xD;
      Administration guidelines and regulations, ultrasonic scaler will be used to clean and remove&#xD;
      soft tissue debris and calculus attached to the teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teeth will be divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (1); ((ProTaper Next, Rotary system). Group (2); K- files, Manual instruments. For&#xD;
      cleaning and shaping of the canal system and mechanical preparation of root canal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then shape of the canal (Canal transportation), canal diameter and risk of canal perforation&#xD;
      will be compared in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after preparation of the root canal, the shape of the canal will be assessed by&#xD;
      using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and diameter of the canal will be measured by&#xD;
      using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).&#xD;
