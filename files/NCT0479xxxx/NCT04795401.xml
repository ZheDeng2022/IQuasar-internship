  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end-stage renal disease require permanent vascular access to enable safe and&#xD;
      effective hemodialysis. An arteriovenous fistula (AVF), where a vein is mobilized and&#xD;
      connected to an artery in the arm, is considered the gold standard and first choice for&#xD;
      vascular access. After fistula creation, the vein is subjected to high pressure and flow, and&#xD;
      undergoes remodeling. This includes the possibility of significant dilatation and intimal&#xD;
      hyperplasia. Normal AVF flow required for effective dialysis is around 0.6 liters/min or&#xD;
      0.4-0.8 liters/min. However, in at least 20% of patients, excessive remodeling and dilatation&#xD;
      of the fistula result in a high flow AVF with &gt;2 liters/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High flow fistulas significantly increase the risk for the development of high output cardiac&#xD;
      failure, skin breakdown, bleeding, hand ischemia, and other systemic complications. In cases&#xD;
      of high flow AVF, venous reconstruction procedures, banding and/or plication, are often&#xD;
      required to limit venous diameter and flow. The longevity of this procedure is limited as the&#xD;
      reconstructed segment remodels and re-dilates due to ongoing arterial pressure. Banding and&#xD;
      plication are both procedures that are designed to increase resistance to flow. Banding is&#xD;
      performed by wrapping a segment of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) around the outflow tract of&#xD;
      the fistula, or by placing a suture around the fistula near the arterial anastomotic area to&#xD;
      create a narrowing. Fistula plication involves narrowing of a short segment of the proximal&#xD;
      venous outflow tract, usually accomplished by suturing or stapling the fistula for 2-6 cm.&#xD;
      One of the notable systemic effects of a hemodialysis AVF is an acute decrease in systemic&#xD;
      vascular resistance with a simultaneous increase in venous return to the heart, and thus an&#xD;
      increase of the cardiac output. Cardiac failure occurs more frequently in patients with an&#xD;
      access flow QA&gt;2 l/min and CPRâ‰¥20%. Another adverse systemic effect of AV fistulas is&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension. The increased flow volume to the heart from an AV fistula yields an&#xD;
      increase in pulmonary pressures. This can limit pulmonary vasodilation and result in&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;

    <description>The SF-36 questionnaire consists of 36 items, which are used to calculate eight subscales: physical functioning (PF), role physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). The first four scores can be summed to create the physical composite score (PCS), while the last four can be summed to create the mental composite score (MCS). Scores for the SF-36 scales range between 0 and 100, with higher scores indicating a better HRQOL.</description>
