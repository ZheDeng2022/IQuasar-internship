  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease with an infectious character, where, as the result&#xD;
      of the host response to a dysbiotic microflora, attachment and bone loss occur. The host&#xD;
      response and the healing period following the treatment differs among individuals, but the&#xD;
      reason behind is not fully understood. The macrophages and T cells play an important role in&#xD;
      the immune response and in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases, but their role in the&#xD;
      healing following periodontal therapy is not known. In this study, we aim to reveal the&#xD;
      effects of initial macrophage and T cell activities in the gingival tissue on the differences&#xD;
      of the response to phase I periodontal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      42 individuals will be included in the study. Granulation tissue samples will be collected&#xD;
      from two separate deep pockets of each individual, initially. At the same session, full-mouth&#xD;
      scaling and root debridement will be conducted. Saliva, subgingival biofilm and gingival&#xD;
      crevicular fluid (GCF) samples will also be collected, initially, and at the 2nd, 6th, 12th&#xD;
      and 24th weeks. At the same appointments, periodontal parameters will be recorded. When the&#xD;
      clinical procedures are concluded, the samples will be sent to Turku University with dry ice.&#xD;
      Tissue and GCF concentrations of related cytokines will be analyzed with Luminex. The density&#xD;
      of macrophage types will be defined by immunoblot analysis of related markers. Macrophage&#xD;
      subpopulations in tissues will be specified by proteomics. Likewise, quantities of&#xD;
      periodontal pathogens will be evaluated with DNA isolation and next generation sequencing.&#xD;
