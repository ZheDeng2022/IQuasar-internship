      The specific aim of the study will be to set up a perioperative database to longitudinally&#xD;
      track the progress of elderly patients undergoing major surgery from the preoperative period&#xD;
      to five years postoperatively. This database will form the foundation of a programme that&#xD;
      will be sustainable through future grants to implement clinical strategies to improve&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Singaporeans are rapidly ageing. One in every 4 Singaporeans will be aged 65 years and older&#xD;
      in 2030, double the rate of that in 2015. Elderly patients have more chronic diseases and&#xD;
      have a poorer recovery profile after illness or surgery. More recently, it has been reported&#xD;
      that Singaporeans spend 10 years of their lives in poor health. Elderly patients are&#xD;
      over-represented in patients coming for surgery, particularly for major cardiac and&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgeries. While surgery is wonderful and lifesaving, the truth is that many&#xD;
      elderly patients do not do well after major surgery. This was eloquently reported in the New&#xD;
      York Times recently in an article titled &quot;The Elderly Are Getting Complex Surgeries. Often It&#xD;
      Doesn't End Well.&quot; Elderly patients value quality of life over quantity of life, but many are&#xD;
      not aware of the long-term debilitation, organ dysfunction, pain, depression, economic burden&#xD;
      and social strain that frequently accompanies major surgery. Elderly patients are more likely&#xD;
      to lose independence after surgery, both physically and cognitively, and may never recover&#xD;
      fully. There is clearly a disconnect between the elderly patient's (and their loved ones')&#xD;
      expectations and reality. There is therefore a need to look closely at the operative journey&#xD;
      of the elderly patient undergoing major surgery. Currently, clinical care is primarily&#xD;
      concerned about achieving a technically successful surgery and recovery in the immediate&#xD;
      postoperative phase, but there is much less oversight once the patient leaves the hospital&#xD;
      system to community care. However, perioperative management significantly impacts the quality&#xD;
      of life and activities of daily living for years after surgery. At NUHS, the MILES&#xD;
      (Management and Innovation for Longevity in Elderly Surgical patients) programme has&#xD;
      successfully reduced hospital length of stay of elderly patients undergoing abdominal surgery&#xD;
      by addressing frailty and performing prehabilitation in selected patients. In this study, the&#xD;
      study team intend to expand on this clinical programme to look at 3 primary concerns, namely&#xD;
      postoperative delirium, trajectory of ageing, and myocardial injury, and the long-term&#xD;
      implications of these concerns. Second, the team will incorporate biomarkers and other&#xD;
      investigations to better risk profile patients, elucidate mechanistic processes, and provide&#xD;
      better diagnostic and prognostic tools to clinicians. Third, the team will investigate the&#xD;
      complimentary and detrimental roles of common systemic pathologies such as diabetes, anemia,&#xD;
      renal dysfunction, malignancy, pain, and poor sleep on these outcomes. Therefore, the team&#xD;
      intends to do a longitudinal study starting from the preoperative period up to 5 years after&#xD;
      surgery in patients aged 65 years and above undergoing elective non-cardiac major surgery,&#xD;
      defined as a surgery lasting at least 2 hours and requiring at least one day stay in hospital&#xD;
      after surgery. It is envisioned that by using the data gained from this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will be able to identify risk factors, trajectories of outcomes and gaps in&#xD;
      their clinical care, and from there, formulate clinical strategies to address these gaps and&#xD;
      mitigate the risk factors.&#xD;
