      Cirrhosis is a condition characterized by diffuse fibrosis, severe disruption of the&#xD;
      intrahepatic arterial and venous flow, portal hypertension and, ultimately, liver cell&#xD;
      failure. Traditionally, cirrhosis has been dichotomised in compensated and decompensated, and&#xD;
      the transition to decompensated cirrhosis happens when any of the following hallmarks occurs:&#xD;
      presence of ascites, variceal haemorrhage and/ or hepatic encephalopathy (HE) . In Egypt, HCV&#xD;
      is the main cause of liver cirrhosis followed by HBV&#xD;

      Cirrhosis is a condition characterized by diffuse fibrosis, severe disruption of the&#xD;
      intrahepatic arterial and venous flow, portal hypertension and, ultimately, liver cell&#xD;
      failure. Traditionally, cirrhosis has been dichotomised in compensated and decompensated, and&#xD;
      the transition to decompensated cirrhosis happens when any of the following hallmarks occurs:&#xD;
      presence of ascites, variceal haemorrhage and/ or hepatic encephalopathy (HE). In Egypt, HCV&#xD;
      is the main cause of liver cirrhosis followed by HBV. Once cirrhosis transitions from the&#xD;
      compensated to the decompensated stage, it is associated with short-term survival (3-5 years)&#xD;
      . The concept of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) has been widely used to study patients&#xD;
      who underwent artificial support therapies as a bridge to liver transplantation (LT). In&#xD;
      2009, the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) provided the first&#xD;
      consensus on ACLF, defined as &quot;an acute hepatic insult manifesting as jaundice and&#xD;
      coagulopathy, complicated within 4 weeks by ascites and/or encephalopathy&quot;. In 2014, the&#xD;
      definition was further expanded to include 'high 28-day mortality'. Therefore, acute on top&#xD;
      of chronic liver failure (ACLF) is defined as a syndrome characterized by acute decompensated&#xD;
      cirrhosis associated with failure of various organs and high short term mortality rate; based&#xD;
      on CANONIC study which is a large scale prospective study, in which the kidneys were the most&#xD;
      common affected organs, followed by liver, coagulation, the brain, circulation and the lungs.&#xD;
      ACLF can occur in patients with chronic liver disease without cirrhosis (type A), with&#xD;
      compensated cirrhosis (type B), and with decompensated cirrhosis (type C) .In many cases, a&#xD;
      precipitating factor linked to the development of ACLF can be identified including alcohol&#xD;
      intake, reactivation of HBV or acute hepatitis due to HAV or HEV, bacterial infection or GI&#xD;
      hemorrhage. The CLIF-C OF score which consists of numbers and types of organ failures (OFs)&#xD;
      including kidneys, liver, coagulation, the brain, circulation, and the lungs is associated&#xD;
      with 28-day and 90-day mortality. Moreover, some specific organ dysfunction such as kidney&#xD;
      dysfunction and moderate HE, when associated with single OF, was also associated with bad&#xD;
      prognosis . On this background, diagnostic criteria of ACLF were established according to the&#xD;
      presence, type and number of OFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of ACLF was graded into different stages according to the number of OFs on ACLF&#xD;
      grade 1, grade 2 and grade 3 and mortality correlates with ACLF severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To predict prognosis and mortality more accurately. developed CLIF-C-ACLF score which has a&#xD;
      greater prognostic capability than CLIF-C- OF, It consists of the CLIF-C- OF combined with&#xD;
      age and WBCs count. Few studies have addressed the patterns of acute on chronic liver failure&#xD;
      in Egyptian cirrhotic patients . Therefore, we will conduct our study to shed&#xD;
