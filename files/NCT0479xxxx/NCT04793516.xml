  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will help test and develop a virtual reality (VR) system that is&#xD;
      being designed to help people with spatial neglect after stroke.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will be tested to see if they have spatial neglect after their&#xD;
      stroke, and the severity of such. Spatial neglect is a disorder that may occur after a stroke&#xD;
      that leads to a person paying more attention to one side of their body over the other. Each&#xD;
      testing session, they will perform paper and pencil neglect tests before and after playing a&#xD;
      VR video game that is being designed as a potential future treatment. They will also give&#xD;
      feedback on the game after the session is over. People who have spatial neglect after stroke&#xD;
      are encouraged to apply.&#xD;
