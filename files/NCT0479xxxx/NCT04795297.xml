  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      .During one year all the resected basal cell carcinomas (BCC) analyzed in Montpellier&#xD;
      University Hospital Anatomopathology unit were included in this study. Localisation and&#xD;
      histological characteristics were collected. All the recurrences of BCC were searched from&#xD;
      the medical records (or histopathology request form).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 804 BCC, 48 were recurrent BCC with or without complete first resection. Patients with&#xD;
      recurrent BCC were contacted to obtain agreement and more informations about the first&#xD;
      resection and some clinical informations like sun exposure and phototype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis focused on the localisation of recurrent BCC (with a complete first&#xD;
      resection) compared to localisations of primary BCC in this population. The goal was to&#xD;
      identified localisations with an increased risk of recurrences.&#xD;
