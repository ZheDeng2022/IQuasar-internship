  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compassion meditation (CM) is a contemplative practice that builds compassion for and&#xD;
      connectedness with others. CM has shown promise as a way of enhancing recovery for Veterans&#xD;
      with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The proposed project will examine the feasibility&#xD;
      of a clinical trial by assessing our ability to deliver CM and a control intervention&#xD;
      consistently with a diverse groups of Veterans from different parts of the country and&#xD;
      optimizing the way in which outcomes are determined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common health concern among Veterans. Although&#xD;
      empirically-supported approaches are widely available, engagement rates are low and&#xD;
      partial/non response is common. There has been considerable interest in the role of&#xD;
      complementary and alternative interventions for PTSD, but little research is available to&#xD;
      guide decisions about care. Compassion meditation (CM), a contemplative practice that is&#xD;
      intended to foster connectedness with others, shows promise for the treatment of PTSD in&#xD;
      Veterans. In healthy populations, CM fosters positive emotion and social connectedness, both&#xD;
      of which are known to enhance coping and resilience in the face of extreme stress. Based on&#xD;
      this theoretical rationale, the investigators' recently completed a two-phase proof of&#xD;
      concept trial of CM for Veterans with PTSD. The first phase employed qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative procedures to iteratively refine an existing CM protocol for Veterans with PTSD.&#xD;
      The second phase utilized a pilot randomized controlled trial to establish the feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of a randomized trial of CM for Veterans with PTSD and to examine potential&#xD;
      clinical impact. On the basis of promising results, this project will evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of a future multi-site efficacy trial of CM for PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the investigators' prior work is an encouraging first step, key questions remain.&#xD;
      First, the investigators' data come from a single site in Southern California. It is possible&#xD;
      that there are regional differences in the acceptability of CM, so the investigators plan to&#xD;
      examine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining a diverse group of Veterans residing in&#xD;
      other areas as well as confirming the acceptability of the approach to this broader group of&#xD;
      Veterans. Second, the investigators' previous trial relied on a single therapist, who was&#xD;
      actively engaged in the development process. It is important to demonstrate that others can&#xD;
      be trained to deliver the approach with fidelity and to have some confidence that results are&#xD;
      attributable to the protocol rather than to an individual. Finally, in the interest of&#xD;
      ultimately understanding the way in which these interventions lead to symptom change, the&#xD;
      investigators' will continue to refine their assessment strategy. If successful, this project&#xD;
      will lay the necessary groundwork for an efficacy trial of CM, which ultimately could provide&#xD;
      an additional evidence-based treatment option for Veterans with PTSD.&#xD;
