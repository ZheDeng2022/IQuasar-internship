  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of melatonin supplementation on patient&#xD;
      sleep quality, length of stay, and opioid consumption following primary, unilateral, elective&#xD;
      total hip or knee arthroplasty.&#xD;

      This will be a single-center randomized double blind placebo control clinical trial. In the&#xD;
      cohort of patients undergoing primary elective total hip and the cohort of patients&#xD;
      undergoing primary elective knee arthroplasty, participants are recruited from those who are&#xD;
      willing to consent and participate in the study, and will be randomly 1:1 divided into&#xD;
      intervention group and placebo group.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective is the Epworth Sleep Score used to evaluate the impact of melatonin use on the quality of sleep, including total hours of sleep and nighttime awakenings in patients undergoing elective primary total hip and knee arthroplasty.The ESS score (the sum of 8 item scores, 0-3) can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher that person's average sleep propensity in daily life (ASP), or their 'daytime sleepiness'.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the quality of sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Screening Visit), Visit 2 (2 months post surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the patient reported survey on quality of sleep. Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) uses a 7-point Likert scale to quantify a patient's sleepiness at the time the questionnaire is completed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of hospital length of stay</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Screening Visit), 14 days after surgery visit</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate hospital length of stay in patients who take melatonin as a sleep aid for 14 days after surgery. Measured by patient reported outcome questionnaires.</description>

    <measure>Change in narcotic consumption patterns</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Screening Visit), 14 days after surgery visit</time_frame>
    <description>Narcotic consumption patterns in patients who take melatonin as a sleep aid for 14 days after surgery. Opioid consumption will be measured based on in-patient pain medications given following surgery.</description>
