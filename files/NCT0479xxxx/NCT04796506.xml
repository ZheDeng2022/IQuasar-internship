  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of exercise rehabilitation on&#xD;
      cognition and to evaluate slow wave sleep (SWS) as a biomarker and mediator of response to&#xD;
      rehabilitation-induced improvement in cognitive performance among persons with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (PwP), with the ultimate goal of maximizing rehabilitation efficacy at the individual&#xD;
      level (i.e. precision rehabilitation).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep impairment adversely affects cognitive function and increases risk for dementia. Slow&#xD;
      wave sleep (SWS) or delta sleep (non-REM stage 3; N3) is especially important for cognition&#xD;
      due to its association with synaptic plasticity, synaptic potentiation, synaptic&#xD;
      renormalization, and cortical reorganization, especially in prefrontal cortex. Clinically,&#xD;
      SWS contributes to memory consolidation and language performance. The investigators have&#xD;
      previously shown that the amount of SWS in persons with Parkinson's disease (PwP) is related&#xD;
      to cognitive performance, especially in the domain of executive function. The investigators&#xD;
      have also shown that exercise increases SWS in some PwP and that participants who have an&#xD;
      exercise-induced increase in SWS also have improvement in executive function. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate changes in cognitive function and SWS due to progressive resistance training&#xD;
      rehabilitation (PRT). Participants who do not have an increase in SWS with PRT&#xD;
      (non-responders) over 12 weeks will be transitioned to an endurance training (ET)&#xD;
      intervention, while those who do have an increase in SWS (responders) will continue in PRT&#xD;
      for an additional 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>PD subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the progressive resistance training (PRT) rehabilitation group or the delayed exercise (DE) control group (wait 12 weeks and begin resistance training). Change in slow wave sleep (SWS) from baseline to 12-weeks will be used to determine the arm assignment in the second 12-week period of the trial for the original PRT group. Specifically, participants with an increase in SWS (responders) will continue in PRT for the 2nd 12 weeks of the trial, while non-responders (participants without increase in SWS) will transition to endurance training (ET) to assess if PRT followed by ET can enhance response in these non-responders.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>PD subjects may be randomized (1:1) to PRT with supervised sessions 3 times per week for 12 weeks. Exercise training will consist of a combination of resistance training (RT) and bodyweight functional mobility exercises with limited rest intervals. The full volume exercise prescription will consist of: 1) five movements to improve strength and muscle mass each performed for 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions; 2) trunk exercises to improve postural stability; and 3) 3-4 bodyweight exercises to improve power and balance. Change in slow wave sleep (SWS) from baseline to 12-weeks will be used to determine the assignment in the second 12-week period. Subjects with an increase in SWS by &gt;24 minutes will continue in PRT for the 2nd 12 weeks of the trial, while participants with &lt;24 minutes increase in SWS will transition to endurance training (ET).</description>

    <description>Non-responders to PRT will transition too ET during 2nd 12 weeks of the study. This intervention is supervised endurance training, 3 times per week for 12 weeks. Each session lasts approximately 75 min., comprised of warm-up, stimulus phase for 50-60 min., and cool-down. Sessions are split between cycle ergometer and treadmill exercise. Participant heart rate is monitored to maintain target exercise intensity of 60-80% (±5%) of heart rate reserve (HRR).</description>
