  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is one of the four priority non-communicable diseases worldwide. Globally,&#xD;
      425 million adults suffered from diabetes mellitus (7.2-11.3%) in 2017 and the International&#xD;
      Diabetes Federation estimates an increase of 48% of the prevalence until 2045. Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, which is the most common type of diabetes, is mainly seen in adults older than 40&#xD;
      years. Diabetes can lead to serious long-term complications as well as a lower quality of&#xD;
      life, worse mental health, and a reduced life expectancy. These health consequences produce&#xD;
      significant health care costs. Due to the chronical character of diabetes, the disease&#xD;
      requires continuous therapy, regular medical appointments, and good adherence of those&#xD;
      suffering. Therefore, diabetes self-management education (DSME) plays a significant role to&#xD;
      increase patient's self-management capacity and improve diabetes therapy. Research indicates&#xD;
      that these outcomes might be difficult to maintain and seem to decline soon after DSME ends.&#xD;
      Consequently, effective strategies to preserve the positive effects of DSME are needed.&#xD;
      Preliminary results show that peer support, which means support from a person who has&#xD;
      experiential knowledge of a specific behaviour or stressor and similar characteristics as the&#xD;
      target population, is associated with better outcomes in terms of HbA1c, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease risk factors or self-efficacy at lower cost compared to standard therapy. Although&#xD;
      those results are promising, research on peer support in diabetes care is still in its&#xD;
      infancy and the influence of various factors is unclear. Peer support instant messaging&#xD;
      services (IMS) approaches have significant potential for diabetes management because support&#xD;
      can be provided easily and prompt, is inexpensive, and needs less effort to attend compared&#xD;
      to standard therapy. Furthermore, almost half of the 40-69-year-old age group, which is&#xD;
      mostly affected by the onset of type 2 diabetes, use IMS. The major objective of the project&#xD;
      is to analyse the impact of a peer supported IMS intervention in addition to a standard&#xD;
      diabetes therapy on the glycaemic control of type 2 diabetic patients. A total of 205&#xD;
      participants (196 participants and 9 moderators) with type 2 diabetes mellitus, older than 40&#xD;
      years will be included and randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Both&#xD;
      groups will receive standard therapy, but the intervention group will use the peer support&#xD;
      IMS tool, additionally. The duration of the intervention will last for seven months, followed&#xD;
      by a follow-up of seven months. Biochemical, behavioural, and psychosocial parameters will be&#xD;
      measured before, in the middle, and after the intervention as well as after the follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life will be measured using the 'Short-Form-Health Survey' (SF-12): the SF-12 includes eight dimensions ('physical functioning', 'role limitations due to physical problems', 'bodily pain', 'vitality', 'general health perceptions' , 'social functioning', 'role limitations due to emotional problems', 'mental health'). The summary scores 'physical component summary' and 'mental component summary' (0-100 scales) can be calculated from the specified scales.</description>

Personal traits will be assessed using the Big Five Inventory German (BFI-2). The BFI-2 captures 'extraversion', 'agreeableness', 'conscientiousness', 'negative emotionality' and 'openness', each represented by three sub-facets. The BFI-2 consists of 60 items using a five-item Likert scale with the endpoints '1' (strongly disagree) to '5' (strongly agree).</description>
