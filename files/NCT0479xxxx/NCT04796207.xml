      Determine if the daily docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) supplement will&#xD;
      reduce serum levels of biomarkers of sub-concussion injuries over a course of American&#xD;
      football season among collegiate football athletes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      American football is one of the most popular sports in the U.S. Yet this sport is associated&#xD;
      with increased risk of concussion (also known as mild traumatic brain injury, or mTBI) and&#xD;
      sub-concussive injury from repeated head impacts (RHI) due to the aggressive and high-speed&#xD;
      nature of the game. Current protective equipment used by players are not sufficient to reduce&#xD;
      concussion incidence and severity, nor are there any therapeutics available to prevent&#xD;
      concussion. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial to determine&#xD;
      if an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) fish oil supplement containing 3.0 grams of&#xD;
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) can reduce blood&#xD;
      biomarkers of sub-concussion injuries compared to placebo (high-oleic safflower oil) over a&#xD;
      course of the American football season among collegiate football athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosage of DHA/EPA used in this study is generally safe, and procedures involved, monthly&#xD;
      blood draws, surveys, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), pose minimal risks to&#xD;
      participants. While this study provides no direct benefit to participants, successful&#xD;
      outcomes of this study can benefit the society by shedding light on development of potential&#xD;
      preventative therapeutics for sports-induced mTBI and brain injury from RHI. The risk-benefit&#xD;
      profile is appropriate for conducting this study. Based on preclinical studies and previous&#xD;
      clinical study results, the investigators expect that in comparison to placebo treatment, DHA&#xD;
      and EPA treatment throughout the course of one American football season can maintain lower&#xD;
      levels of sub-concussion associated biomarkers, inflammatory cytokines, and cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk markers. The investigators also expect participants treated with DHA and EPA to have&#xD;
      lower brain MRI imaging markers of sub concussion injury.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized to treatment (3 grams DHA and EPA (2:1 weight ratio)) or placebo (3 grams high-oleic safflower oil) in a 1:1 allocation ratio based on their position on the football team and roster depth (starter vs. non-starter). Participants will be recruited as a single cohort. After screening, participants will be treated with DHA and EPA or matching placebo for 25 weeks (a full course of an American football season, including summer camp training sessions). A follow-up visit is scheduled 7 weeks after the final dosing at week 32 for recovery and adverse event evaluation.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Study personnel will be kept blind to treatment assignments. The treatment assignment for each participant will be available to the investigator in a sealed envelope that may be opened only in the case of a serious adverse event which the investigator feels cannot be adequately treated without knowing the identity of the study medication. Code breakers will be collected and reviewed at the end of the study. If the blinding has been broken, then the investigator will provide documentation regarding the fact and indicate the other staff that received this information.</masking_description>
