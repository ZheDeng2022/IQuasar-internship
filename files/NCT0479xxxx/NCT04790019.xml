  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is worldwide health epidemic categorized by poor bone health, primarily&#xD;
      diagnosed by low bone mineral density, and costs healthcare systems billions every year.&#xD;
      Athletes and exercising people who expend large amounts of energy in physical activity, or&#xD;
      restrict diet in order to lose weight, are at risk of low energy availability. This is when&#xD;
      an individual fails to match their exercise energy demand with a appropriate dietary intake&#xD;
      in order to maintain optimal physiological function; which can lead to low bone mineral&#xD;
      density, osteoporosis both early and later in life and an increased risk of injury. Runners&#xD;
      are particularly susceptible to stress fracture in response to low energy availability due to&#xD;
      repetitive ground impact. Research shows that as little as five days low energy availability&#xD;
      significantly reduces bone formation, and significantly increases bone resorption, in&#xD;
      physically active women. The ideal solution is to restore energy availability; however, this&#xD;
      is often very difficult during periods of intense training and conflicts with the goal of&#xD;
      weight loss. Therefore, there is a need to develop an alternative tool to protect bone&#xD;
      health. It is critical that any exercise intervention does not further reduce energy&#xD;
      availability as previous research shows that this accelerates bone loss rather than prevents&#xD;
      it. Low repetition high impact jumping exercise is highly beneficial to bone health and has&#xD;
      been shown to improve bone structure when used as a long-term intervention in energy replete&#xD;
      states. It takes very little time to complete and uses a very small amount of energy.&#xD;
      However, no study to date has examined the effects of such an intervention during low energy&#xD;
      availability. The current study will investigate whether low repetition high impact jumping&#xD;
      prevents or reduces the reduction in bone formation and the increase in bone resorption&#xD;
      experienced during five days of low energy availability and findings will have implications&#xD;
      on athletic and recreational training recommendations in order to protect bone health.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants will complete two four-day experimental conditions within the first seven days&#xD;
      of two separate menstrual cycles. These will be preceded by a four-day baseline assessment&#xD;
      period. There are three experimental conditions in total: control (CON), low energy&#xD;
      availability (LEA) and low energy availability and high impact jumping (LEA+J). Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to complete the control condition and either the LEA or LEA+J&#xD;
      condition. The order in which the two conditions are completed will be randomized and&#xD;
      counterbalanced. In total, fifteen laboratory visits will be required per participant:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment (four days and one visit):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will come to the laboratory to complete the informed consent procedure on day 1,&#xD;
      once they have had at least 24 hours to consider the participant information sheet. Providing&#xD;
      informed consent is given, participants will complete three questionnaires (a health screen,&#xD;
      the Low Energy Availability in Females Questionnaire and the International Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire) which include questions regarding their medical and injury history, dietary&#xD;
      habits, menstrual cycle and physical activity habits. They will then have their height and&#xD;
      weight taken. Provided the responses and measures confirm that the participant meets the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, they will then undergo familiarization of resting metabolic&#xD;
      rate assessment where they will lay supine in a dimly lit room whilst expired gas is&#xD;
      collected via a mouthpiece. During familiarization the researcher will check for signs of&#xD;
      hyperventilation. Following that, the participants will be familiarized with a jumping&#xD;
      exercise routine if the participant is randomized into the group that will be performing this&#xD;
      routine during an experimental condition. Finally, the participant will be asked to complete&#xD;
      an incremental exercise test to volitional exhaustion on a treadmill whilst expired gas is&#xD;
      collected and analysed using a metabolic cart, and heart rate and rating of perceived&#xD;
      exertion are taken, as a measure of aerobic fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the following three days (2, 3 and 4), participants will be instructed to self-report&#xD;
      weighed energy intake using a set of scales provided and a food diary according to the&#xD;
      instructions on the diary itself which the researcher will read through with the participant.&#xD;
      They will be asked to eat according to their usual dietary habits and return it&#xD;
      electronically at the end of day 4, or during a subsequent visit. Participants will also be&#xD;
      provided with a tri-axial accelerometer (Actigraph GT3X+) device and instructed to wear it&#xD;
      around the waist for the entirety of days 2, 3 or 4 (apart from when bathing and washing).&#xD;
      They will be not required to visit the laboratory on days 2, 3 or 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental conditions (four days and four visits, per condition):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will outline the experimental protocol assuming the participant is completing&#xD;
      the LEA+J condition followed by the CON condition, and end with a description of how the&#xD;
      protocol differs should they be randomly allocated to complete the LEA condition as opposed&#xD;
      to the LEA+J, condition. Participants will be required to refrain from exercise which is not&#xD;
      part of the study for the entirety of all experimental conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEA+J condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to notify the research team at the onset of their next menses&#xD;
      and will commence the experimental condition the following day, or the day after that if the&#xD;
      participant is not able to do what is required of them the following day. From the first&#xD;
      until the last day of each condition, participants will be required to wear the Actigraph&#xD;
      device at all times apart from when bathing and washing. Participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      record their diet during day 1, as they did during days 2, 3 and 4 of the baseline condition,&#xD;
      and will be asked to eat according to their usual dietary habits but instructed to make&#xD;
      choices that they will be able to replicate ahead of each subsequent experimental condition.&#xD;
      They will not be permitted to drink caffeine or alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to collect their final meal on day 1 from the laboratory and&#xD;
      will be instructed to eat it at exactly 20:00. They will complete the Pittsburgh Sleep&#xD;
      Quality Index (PSQI; a questionnaire regarding sleep habits and quality during the last&#xD;
      month). They will also be instructed to refrain from any other food or drink, other than&#xD;
      water, for the rest of the evening. Participants will be provided with a self-report water&#xD;
      intake record sheet and water bottle from which to drink and instructed to report daily water&#xD;
      intake from the start of day 2 until the end of the condition. They will also be provided&#xD;
      with a small container suitable to collect a urine sample upon waking the following morning.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to bring the sample with them to the laboratory, where it&#xD;
      will be analysed and disposed of immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 2 of the first condition, participants will be required to arrive at the laboratory&#xD;
      between 06:00-09:00 without eating breakfast or ingesting caffeine for at least 18 hours&#xD;
      prior. The participant will be asked to travel by car or by public transport and restrict&#xD;
      walking distance as much as possible. Weight and body composition will be taken in shorts and&#xD;
      underwear using scales and bio-electrical impedance. The investigators will then perform a&#xD;
      resting metabolic rate assessment and a series of cardiovascular measures using pressure&#xD;
      cuffs, tonometry and electrocardiography. A venous blood sample will be split into plasma and&#xD;
      serum separation Vacutainers from the arm by a phlebotomy trained researcher using standard&#xD;
      venepuncture methods. The participants will then be instructed to complete a brief high&#xD;
      impact jumping exercise routine on a Kistler force platform with demonstrations by the&#xD;
      researcher and continued feedback to maintain optimum form. All jumps will be performed&#xD;
      barefoot. The investigators will then provide a breakfast to consume in the laboratory along&#xD;
      with a multivitamin multi-mineral tablet. The food the participants are required to eat for&#xD;
      the rest of the day will be packed into a cool box to take away and the participants will not&#xD;
      be permitted to consume anything which is not provided within the cool box, other than&#xD;
      &quot;calorie-free&quot; drinks (black coffee, black tea, green tea, etc.). The participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to perform a similar jump routine at home at least 8 hours after the morning jump&#xD;
      routine. All jumps will be performed barefoot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 3 and 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days 3 and 4, participants will be required to arrive at the laboratory between&#xD;
      06:00-09:00 without eating breakfast. Participants will return any uneaten food from the&#xD;
      previous day and report any items consumed (other than &quot;calorie-free&quot; drinks) that were not&#xD;
      part of the cool box provided. The participants will complete the morning jump routine and&#xD;
      have their prescribed breakfast with multivitamin and multi-mineral tablet at the laboratory,&#xD;
      before leaving with the rest of their food for that day packed in a cool box. The&#xD;
      participants will not be permitted to consume anything which is not provided within the cool&#xD;
      box, other than &quot;calorie-free&quot; drinks. The participants will be instructed to complete the&#xD;
      evening jump routine - as on day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During day 4, participants will only be permitted to drink water and will be instructed to&#xD;
      consume their final meal at 20:00 and refrain from any other food or drink (other than water)&#xD;
      for the rest of the evening. At the end of day 6, the participants will also be provided with&#xD;
      a small container suitable to collect a urine sample upon waking the following morning.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to bring the sample with them to the laboratory, where it&#xD;
      will be analysed and disposed of immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 5, participants will repeat the same process as on day 2, except will be required to&#xD;
      arrive at the laboratory at the exact same time rather than anywhere between 06:00 - 09:00&#xD;
      and they will not complete the morning or evening jump routines, the PSQI or be given&#xD;
      breakfast, a multivitamin multi-mineral tablet nor food to take away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with an ovulatory test kit to take away and use once per day&#xD;
      (urinate on a stick as per a pregnancy test) for up to 8 days in the middle of the menstrual&#xD;
      cycle. Once a positive test is observed the participants will report this to the research&#xD;
      team and if no positive is reported within 8 days this will also be reported to the research&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CON condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 1-5:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will again be required to notify the research team at the onset of the next&#xD;
      menses (following the end of the LEA+J condition) and will commence the CON condition the&#xD;
      following day, or the day after that if the participant is not able to do what is required of&#xD;
      them the following day. The same procedure as in the LEA+J condition will be repeated,&#xD;
      however, rather than recording their diet during day 1, participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      repeat what was previously recorded. Also, the total energy intake in the food provided in&#xD;
      the LEA+J condition will be a third of that provided in the CON condition and participants&#xD;
      will not take a multivitamin multi-mineral tablet or be required to perform morning or&#xD;
      evening jump routines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How will the protocol differ for participants completing the LEA condition?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure for the LEA condition is the same as in the LEA+J condition, however,&#xD;
      participants will not be required to perform morning or evening jump routines.&#xD;
