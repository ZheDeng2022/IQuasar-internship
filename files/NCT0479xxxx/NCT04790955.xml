  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SCLC patients after initial treatment failure are treated with SBRT and low-dose radiotherapy&#xD;
      concurrent with PARP inhibitors + temozolomide +PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for two cycles at&#xD;
      least, then PARP inhibitors+temozolomide+PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors two cycles, PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      inhibitors maintenance therapy lasted for up to 2 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCLC is easy to relapse and drug resistance soon after initial treatment , although&#xD;
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy is sensitive at first treatment. Topotecan monotherapy is&#xD;
      recommended in the NCCN guidelines for second-line standard treatment and the CSCO SCLC&#xD;
      guidelines for diagnosis and treatment 2020 edition, but its effective rate is low, 24% for&#xD;
      platinum-sensitive relapse, 2-6% for platinum-resistant, overall PFS is about 3-4 months and&#xD;
      OS is about 6-8 months. Although immunotherapy have been successful at the first-line and&#xD;
      third-line treatments of SCLC in the extensive stage , the second-line treatment has not&#xD;
      achieved a breakthrough, and the effective rate of third-line immune single drug is between&#xD;
      10-20%.It is an important challenge and breakthrough to effectively improve the efficacy and&#xD;
      survival of second-line treatment of SCLC. Immunocombination therapy is an important strategy&#xD;
      to improve the efficacy. Some studies have shown that PARP inhibitors and low-dose&#xD;
      radiotherapy can improve the efficacy of immunotherapy. PARP inhibitors are not only&#xD;
      sensitizers of chemoradiotherapy, but also immunomodulators. High dose radiotherapy has the&#xD;
      effect of in situ vaccine and increases tumor antigen release presentation. Low dose&#xD;
      radiotherapy promotes the penetration of immune cells into tumor stroma and tumor bed and&#xD;
      increases immune response. The combination of high and low dose radiotherapy and immunization&#xD;
      can improve the immune effect and increase the incidence of distant effect. So the objective&#xD;
      of this study is to observe the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment of SCLC with&#xD;
      SBRT and low-dose radiotherapy combined with PARP inhibitor + temozolomide and PD-1 /PD-L1&#xD;
      inhibitor.&#xD;
