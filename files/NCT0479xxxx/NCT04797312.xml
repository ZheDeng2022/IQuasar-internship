  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid-Free Anesthesia (OFA) is an anesthesia protocol that does not use morphine, and is&#xD;
      increasingly used routinely. Indeed, this protocol would theoretically allow a better&#xD;
      post-operative analgesic control, a lower incidence of post-operative complications (e.g.&#xD;
      post-operative nausea and vomiting). In the end, it would also allow a better overall&#xD;
      post-operative recovery and a decrease in the incidence of chronic post-operative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the literature is poor on this issue and no randomized controlled study has&#xD;
      evaluated the effect of the use of this type of anesthesia protocol on postoperative&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;

    <description>The OFA protocol begins with a systematic preoperative premedication with clonidine, continues with an adapted intraoperative management without opioid administration, but associating several molecules (clonidine, magnesium, lidocaine, ketamine) and ends with a continued administration of xylocaine up to 1 hour postoperatively in PACU. The use of an opioid in preoperative or intraoperative phases is considered as a deviation from the protocol.&#xD;
To these different molecules, the use of hypnotic molecules left to the choice of the practitioner and a curare will be systematically associated.</description>
