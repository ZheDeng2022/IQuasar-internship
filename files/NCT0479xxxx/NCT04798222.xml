      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate relative bioavailability of AZD9977 and&#xD;
      dapagliflozin and compare the plasma concentration time profiles after dosing with different&#xD;
      capsule formulations containing both AZD9977 and dapagliflozin or solely dapagliflozin, the&#xD;
      AZD9977 capsule, and dapagliflozin tablet under fasted conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at 2 study centers in Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized to one of the 8 treatment sequences (4 unique&#xD;
      sequences to Group 1 and 4 unique sequences to Group 2). In Group 1, participants will&#xD;
      receive 5 single dose treatments, while in Group 2 participants will receive 4 single dose&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Below treatments A, B, C, D and E will be given to participants in Group 1 and treatments A,&#xD;
      F, G and H will be given to participants in Group 2 in randomized order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment A: AZD9977 Dose A + 10 mg dapagliflozin tablet, fasted&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment B: AZD9977 Dose A + 10 mg dapagliflozin capsule 1, fasted&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treatment C: AZD9977 Dose A + 10 mg dapagliflozin capsule 1, fed&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Treatment D: AZD9977 Dose A + 10 mg dapagliflozin capsule 2, fasted&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Treatment E: AZD9977 Dose A + 10 mg dapagliflozin capsule 2, fed&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Treatment F: AZD9977 Dose A + 10 mg dapagliflozin capsule 3, fasted&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Treatment G: AZD9977 Dose A + 10 mg dapagliflozin capsule 4, fasted&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Treatment H: 10 mg dapagliflozin capsule, fasted&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening period of maximum 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four or five treatment periods during which participants will be resident at the study&#xD;
           center from the day before dosing until at least 72 hours after the final dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A final visit within 5 to 7 days after administration of the last treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will receive single dose treatments under fasted or fed conditions,&#xD;
      separated by at least 4 days washout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be involved in the study for approximately 6 to 7 weeks.&#xD;
