  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexual assault on college campuses is a prevalent public health problem, with 1 in 3 women&#xD;
      experiencing sexual assault during her time in college. It is a major cause of injury, mental&#xD;
      health concerns, sexually transmitted infections, and poor educational outcomes in youth and&#xD;
      young adults. The Enhanced Assess, Acknowledge, Act (EAAA) sexual assault resistance&#xD;
      intervention is the only intervention that has been shown to reduce sexual assault&#xD;
      victimization for college women in a randomized controlled trial. EAAA is a 12-hour, peer&#xD;
      facilitator-led, in-person intervention proven to reduce attempted or completed rape&#xD;
      victimization by over 50% among female undergraduates, with durable effects lasting more than&#xD;
      two years. Despite its unique efficacy, uptake of EAAA has been limited, in large part&#xD;
      because universities prefer less costly interventions that can be administered online;&#xD;
      unfortunately, no online intervention has been proven to reduce victimization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project seeks to adapt the existing EAAA intervention for online delivery to groups of&#xD;
      students by live facilitators using a systematic adaptation process called ADAPT-ITT. After&#xD;
      adapting and refining the intervention, the proposed work seeks to collect feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and efficacy-related outcome data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has three aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Aim 1: Following the ADAPT-ITT framework, pilot a minimally adapted internet-delivered&#xD;
           EAAA (IDEA3) with undergraduate women (n=12), collecting data on acceptability&#xD;
           immediately following the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim 2: Produce a fully adapted IDEA3 intervention that retains core elements of the&#xD;
           in-person intervention crucial for efficacy, while capitalizing on unique strengths of&#xD;
           the online modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Aim 3: Test the feasibility and acceptability of IDEA3 through a pilot trial and examine&#xD;
           intermediary outcomes shown to be strong mediators of EAAA's effect on reducing&#xD;
           victimization (n=64).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope this intervention may prevent as many as 50% of sexual assaults&#xD;
      experienced by college women, comparable to the existing in-person intervention from which&#xD;
      this online intervention is being adapted. Once the intervention has been finalized, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to disseminate the intervention and make it widely available to&#xD;
      institutions through the SARE Centre, a non-profit partner on the study that currently&#xD;
      disseminates the in-person version of the intervention, EAAA.&#xD;

    <description>This will be assessed by reviewing speed of recruitment and noting no-shows (at first session), overall session attendance, and retention rates for the online intervention to determine whether incentives are sufficient for a future larger trial; reviewing fidelity to the original intervention based on reviewing recordings of all online intervention sessions; reviewing and cataloging deviations from the manual; and final review of what pieces of IDEA3 went well and what pieces need to be further adapted in the future.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of IDEA3 intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Within one week of the final intervention session</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed from summary statistics calculated from survey questions completed by participants relating to dimensions of affective attitude (how the individual feels about the intervention); burden (perceived effort required to participate); ethicality (extent to which the intervention fits with the individual's value system), perceived effectiveness, and whether they would recommend the intervention to a friend.</description>

    <time_frame>Within one week of the final intervention session</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed from participant answers to baseline and post-test surveys that use validated scales to measure self-defense self-efficacy (i.e. confidence that one could defend oneself against sexual assault)</description>

    <measure>Efficacy of IDEA3 intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Within one week of the final intervention session</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed from participant answers to baseline and post-test surveys that use validated scales to measure five intermediary outcomes that account for EAAA's effect on reducing victimization: earlier detection of risk in coercive situations; greater risk perception of acquaintance rape; lower rape myth acceptance; knowledge of, and willingness to use evidence-based forceful verbal and physical resistance in a hypothetical situation; and earlier identification of 'discomfort' and earlier willingness to leave a hypothetical situation.</description>
