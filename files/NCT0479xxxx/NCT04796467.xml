  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted PET imaging with 68Ga-labeled compounds is&#xD;
      able to provide superior sensitivity and specificity to detect primary prostate tumor and its&#xD;
      metastases, like the widely studied 68Ga-PSMA-617. This pilot study was prospectively&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the early dynamic distribution of 68Ga-P16-093, a novel&#xD;
      radiopharmaceutical targeting PSMA, which was compared with 68Ga-PSMA-617 in the same group&#xD;
      of prostate cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide in men, with&#xD;
      persistently high numbers dying from this disease. Due to low levels of glycolysis in&#xD;
      prostate cancer cell, the uses of 18F-FDG PET/CT to detect prostate cancer and its metastases&#xD;
      are limited. Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), as known as folate hydrolase I or&#xD;
      glutamate carboxypeptidase II, is overexpressed on the cells of prostatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
      Various low molecular weight radiopharmaceuticals targeting PSMA such as PSMA-617, PSMA-11&#xD;
      for 68Ga-labeling have been developed. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT has demonstrated desirable&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity in the detection of prostate cancer lesions, which can find many&#xD;
      micro lesions that cannot be identified by CT, MRI and bone scan. 68Ga-P16-093, a novel&#xD;
      radiopharmaceutical targeting PSMA, with the urea fragment of a conjugate that employs the&#xD;
      HBED-CC chelator for labeling with 68Ga(III). The HBED-based chelating ligand binds the&#xD;
      68Ga3+ ion with high affinity in a pseudo-octahedral N2O4 coordination sphere by its two&#xD;
      phenolate O, two amino-acetate carboxylate O, and two amino N donor atoms. Mark A. Green&#xD;
      et.al had demonstrated that 68Ga-P16-093 provided diagnostic information that appeared&#xD;
      equivalent to 68Ga-PSMA-11 in prostate cancer patients presenting with biochemical&#xD;
      recurrence, and 68Ga-P16-093 exhibits less urinary excretion than observed for 68Ga-PSMA-11.&#xD;
      This pilot study was prospectively designed to evaluate the early dynamic distribution of&#xD;
      68Ga-P16-093 compared with 68Ga-PSMA-617 in the same group of prostate cancer patients.&#xD;
