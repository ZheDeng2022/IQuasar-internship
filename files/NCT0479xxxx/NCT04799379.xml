      Multi-center, prospective, cohort study, of patients scheduled for elective rectal surgery&#xD;
      who received absorbable hemostatic powder to assess whether it can improve patient&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes, reduce usage of drains and prove to be cost-effective. This cohort&#xD;
      will be compared to a previously studied cohort using drains (Power and IMPRICA study) with&#xD;
      comparable patient characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is: postoperative pelvic sepsis within 60 postoperative&#xD;
      days including anastomotic leakage, pelvic abscess and peritonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: postoperative morbidities, rate of reoperation and length of&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;

      Multimodal surgical rehabilitation, also known as Enhanced Recovery After Surgery, entails&#xD;
      the application of a series of perioperative procedure measures and strategies aimed at&#xD;
      patients who are going to undergo a surgical procedure with the objective of reducing&#xD;
      secondary stress caused by the surgical intervention and thus achieve enhanced recovery of&#xD;
      the patient and decrease complications and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERAS protocols are care programs based on scientific evidence, encompassing all aspects of&#xD;
      patient care and requiring multidisciplinary management, with the participation of diverse&#xD;
      specialists1. Starting at the diagnosis, their aim is to recognize patients' individual needs&#xD;
      to optimize their treatment before, during and after surgery. The close collaboration of all&#xD;
      specialists participating in the process, as well as of the actual patients and their&#xD;
      relatives has proved to be essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Multimodal Rehabilitation Programmes (MRP) or Enhanced Recovery Programmes (ERAS) review&#xD;
      traditional perioperative procedure practices, evaluating the specific key points of each&#xD;
      type of surgery and analysing their scientific evidence. MRPs have shown, in cents that have&#xD;
      routinely adopted them, a significant improvement in the patient's quality of life.&#xD;
      Furthermore, MRPs significantly reducing the hospital stay and potential complications&#xD;
      associated with hospitalisation2, being the anastomotic leak (AL) the most serious of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total mesorectal excision (TME) and bowel restoration is currently the standard treatment for&#xD;
      middle to low rectal cancer. However, TME has been shown to be associated with high&#xD;
      anastomotic leakage with a reported incidence of up to 24%, reaching 50% when clinically&#xD;
      silent radiographic leaks are considered3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite a large number of studies in the literature that have investigated risk factors, the&#xD;
      fundamental causes of AL remain unclear. In this sense, according to enhanced recovery after&#xD;
      surgery (ERAS) protocols4, pelvic drain should not be used routinely as it may cause patient&#xD;
      discomfort and prolong hospitalization. Moreover, drain itself is also a potential site of&#xD;
      infection especially if open or passive drainage system is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even based in the best available evidence, ERAS protocols have important implementation&#xD;
      problems because they have to put up with traditional attitudes. In this sense, many surgeons&#xD;
      still advocate the use of a prophylactic pelvic drain because they believe that fluid&#xD;
      collection in the pelvis could be a potential source of contamination and thereby weakening&#xD;
      anastomotic integrity and healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study from the Spanish group GERM2, avoidance of drains was achieved only in&#xD;
      34.7% of patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. ERAS centres had a greater&#xD;
      avoidance of drains vs non-ERAS centres (38.6% vs 28.3%), although most patients still&#xD;
      received drains. More relevant, avoidance of drainage was associated with a significant&#xD;
      reduction in moderate to severe complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that it is more than justified to try new options that help surgeons reduce the&#xD;
      use of drains. One of these, is the use of hemostatic agents. Some topical hemostats may&#xD;
      theoretically be of benefit due to its claimed lymphostatic properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Published data for this is sparse, but some studies, have shown statistically significant&#xD;
      reduction of fluid collection after using Arista®AH5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arista is a plant-based, flowable powder engineered to rapidly dehydrate blood, enhancing&#xD;
      clotting on contact. Arista facilitates the formation of a highly resilient, natural clot&#xD;
      within just a few minutes regardless of the patient's coagulation status. Arista® is fully&#xD;
      absorbable within 24 to 48 hours of application, and because Arista degrades rapidly, it does&#xD;
      not promote infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been designed to support the working hypothesis that Arista® placed&#xD;
      intraoperatively into the dissected pelvic area could reduce sepsis and postoperative&#xD;
      anastomotic leakage. We choose to study Arista® for a theoretical reason: it contains&#xD;
      microporous polysaccharide hemospheres (MPHs). MPHs not only activate the coagulation cascade&#xD;
      but they cause tissue desiccation which presumably seals capillaries and could theoretically&#xD;
      also seal small lymph vessels left open by electrosurgical devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study assumptions: Arista spread on the pelvic floor at the end of surgery may allow to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. close small holes and prevent fluid from penetrating into the pelvic floor, thereby&#xD;
           avoiding AL&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. facilitate the avoidance of drains&#xD;
