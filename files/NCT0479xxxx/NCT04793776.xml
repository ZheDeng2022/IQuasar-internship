  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is one of the most prevalent mental health conditions affecting Veterans who have served&#xD;
      since 9/11. Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) report difficulty controlling&#xD;
      impulsive aggression (IA). An inability to manage one's emotions (emotion dysregulation) is&#xD;
      an underlying mechanism of IA. Reducing IA and increasing use of PTSD evidence-based&#xD;
      psychotherapies are two critical missions for the Veterans Health Administration. The&#xD;
      proposed research supports these missions by comparing a 3- session emotion regulation&#xD;
      treatment (Manage Emotions to Reduce Aggression) to a control group in order to determine if&#xD;
      MERA can reduce IA and prepare Veterans for PTSD treatment. By enhancing Veterans' abilities&#xD;
      to cope with trauma-related emotions and feel equipped to initiate PTSD treatments, this&#xD;
      research aims to help Veterans decrease IA and ultimately recover from PTSD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aggression can have devastating interpersonal and societal consequences, including&#xD;
      incarceration, family violence, disruption of treatment-facilitating factors, and death.&#xD;
      About 50% of Veterans with full and subthreshold posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)&#xD;
      reported engaging in aggression after returning from deployment. This level of aggression is&#xD;
      higher than Veterans without PTSD5 and civilians with PTSD. Current psychotherapy options to&#xD;
      reduce aggression include present centered therapies (PCTs), anger management, and evidence&#xD;
      based psychotherapies (EBP) for PTSD. Anger management reduces aggression in civilian samples&#xD;
      with small to moderate effect sizes. However, few anger management treatment studies have&#xD;
      examined Veterans with PTSD and measured acts of aggression. Consistently, VA clinicians also&#xD;
      provide PCTs and EBP for PTSD. It is unknown how effectively PCTs reduce aggression.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, even with gold standard EBP for PTSD Veterans only experience small to&#xD;
      moderate reductions in aggression. While any decline is an improvement, these treatments&#xD;
      leave room for novel methods to help Veterans reduce aggression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotion regulation ability may be a key to reducing aggression. The team revealed that among&#xD;
      Veterans with PTSD and aggression, impulsive aggression (emotionally charged, reactive, and&#xD;
      uncontrolled) is more common than premeditated aggression (deliberate, instrumental, and&#xD;
      planned). Emotion dysregulation, or the inability to detect emotions, accept emotions, and/or&#xD;
      engage in content-appropriate regulation, is related to impulsive aggression and to PTSD&#xD;
      severity. The investigators demonstrated that emotion dysregulation fully mediated the&#xD;
      relationship between PTSD and impulsive aggression in Veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing emotion regulation ability of many emotions is an innovative method to reduce&#xD;
      aggression. Full-length treatments that incorporate emotion regulation training (8-12&#xD;
      sessions) have augmented EBP for PTSD and improved Veterans' emotion regulation skills.&#xD;
      However, a brief format is needed for returning Veterans. Eight weeks of treatment,&#xD;
      particularly when offered prior to EBP, is an unfeasible commitment for many Veterans who are&#xD;
      reintegrating into their communities. Additionally, most drop outs from EBP for PTSD occur&#xD;
      prior to session three making the initial sessions a critical time for skill development.&#xD;
      Finally, Veterans have experienced wait times to receive treatment due to the growing&#xD;
      population of returning Veterans. To address these challenges, the team developed a 3-session&#xD;
      emotion regulation treatment, called Manage Emotions to Reduce Aggression (MERA). Male combat&#xD;
      Veterans who completed MERA in an open trial (N=20) endorsed the brief model, utilized the&#xD;
      skills, and found the treatment helpful at the 4-week follow up. MERA had a low dropout rate&#xD;
      of 8% from active treatment. MERA completers demonstrated a medium to large pre- to&#xD;
      post-treatment reduction in frequency of aggression (Cohen's d = 0.73).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the proposed study is to conduct a 2-site randomized clinical trial (RCT) to test&#xD;
      if MERA is efficacious at reducing aggression and emotion dysregulation compared to 3&#xD;
      sessions of PCT, which is often the standard of care for Veterans with aggression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine if MERA results in reductions in frequency of impulsive aggression compared&#xD;
      to PCT in Veterans (N = 204) with subthreshold or full PTSD who have deployed for combat&#xD;
      operations since 9/11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: MERA will demonstrate statistically significant greater reductions in frequency&#xD;
      of aggression (measured by the Overt Aggression Scale) relative to PCT at the 2-month&#xD;
      posttreatment assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine if MERA reduces emotion dysregulation relative to PCT. Hypothesis 2: MERA will&#xD;
      demonstrate statistically significant greater reductions in emotion dysregulation (measured&#xD;
      by Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale) relative to PCT at the posttreatment assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim. Veterans who learn to regulate their emotions rather than avoid them may be&#xD;
      more likely to engage in EBP for PTSD. The investigators will examine if Veterans who&#xD;
      complete MERA have higher rates of EBP initiation compared to Veterans who complete PCT.&#xD;
      Exploratory Hypothesis: Veterans who complete MERA will have statistically significant higher&#xD;
      rates of EBP initiation than Veterans who complete PCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the hypotheses are supported, the VA will have a brief treatment that can help Veterans&#xD;
      manage their aggression by directly targeting emotion dysregulation. MERA may also be&#xD;
      applicable to Veterans with emotion dysregulation and other psychological disorders.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This randomized clinical trial (RCT) is designed to examine if a brief emotion regulation treatment, MERA, is efficacious at reducing aggression compared to present centered therapy (PCT) in Veterans with full or subthreshold PTSD. The investigators will use a parallel group RCT design, a 1:1 allocation ratio, and a superiority (MERA &gt; PCT) framework.

    <description>Overt Aggression Scale is a 17-item self-report measure that assesses frequency of verbal and physical aggression against self, other, and objects and while driving over the past week. Veterans' self-reported aggressive acts will be summed to create an OAA total score. Minimum score = 0; there is no maximum score as Veterans can report as many episodes of aggression as they engage in.</description>

    <description>Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (16) is a 36-item self-report measure with 6 different emotion-dysregulation factors: nonacceptance of emotional responses, difficulties engaging in goal directed behaviors, impulse-control difficulties, lack of emotional awareness, limited access to emotion regulation strategies, and lack of emotional clarity. Scoring is based on how well the item describes the individual in the past month, from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). Minimum score = 36; Maximum score = 180. Higher scores represent more emotion dysregulation.</description>
