  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the relationship between CCTA-based pericoronary inflammation&#xD;
      and plaque features as well as local immune-inflammatory biomarkers in ACS patients. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that perivascular FAI might serve as a reliable sensor of coronary&#xD;
      immune-inflammatory disorder, and closely related to the plaque vulnerability.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The pericoronary fat attenuation index (FAI), which capture by standard coronary computed&#xD;
      tomography angiography (CCTA), has emerged as a novel imaging biomarker of coronary&#xD;
      inflammation. This study aimed to assess whether increased Pericoronary FAI on CCTA are&#xD;
      associated with high-risk plaque (HRP) feature as well as local T cell subsets and their&#xD;
      intracellular cytokines levels in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes ( ACS) patients.&#xD;
      195 lesions in 130 non-ST elevation ACS patients were prospectively enrolled and evaluated by&#xD;
      CCTA and coronary angiography in this study. Blood were taken from coronary artery&#xD;
      immediately after the diagnostic angiogram. Local T cell subsets and their intracellular&#xD;
      cytokines levels were detected by Flow Cytometry. CCTA and pericoronary FAI examinations were&#xD;
      performed using a 320-detecor (Aquilion ONE, Toshiba Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan)&#xD;
      Systems. Coronary plaque characteristics were analyzed cross each of the main coronary&#xD;
      arteries using commercialized software package (Qangio CT, Medis, The Netherlands).&#xD;
