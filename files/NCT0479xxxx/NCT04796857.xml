      Aim of this study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab in combination with&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients with relapsed /refractory non-GCB diffuse large B cell lymphoma usually have&#xD;
      a bad prognosis. These patients cannot be treated successfully or tolerated the conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Lenalidomide has a unique therapeutic effect in Non-GCB DLBCL. Some studies&#xD;
      have shown that the combination of lenalidomide and PD-1 antibody shows a synergistic effect&#xD;
      in the exploration of DLBCL, and the patients are well tolerated.The investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab in combination with lenalidomide in the&#xD;
      elderly patients with relapsed refractory non-GCB DLBCL failed from second line chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
