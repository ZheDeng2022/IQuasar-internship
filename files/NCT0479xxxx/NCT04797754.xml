      The purpose of this proposed study, is the development and validation of EISA, a Self-report&#xD;
      outcome measurement tool, for assessing the satisfaction of everyday functional needs, for&#xD;
      consumers using Electronic Assistive Devices (EADs) as the primary means to complete&#xD;
      Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). The EISA outcome measure is proposed to be&#xD;
      designed as a questionnaire that can be self or interview-administered to users of EADs. The&#xD;
      development of EISA shall be modeled along the lines of development of the self-report&#xD;
      outcome measure, Functional Mobility Assessment (FMA) (Kumar et al., 2013). The proposed tool&#xD;
      EISA, would serve as a dynamic gage, for assessing perceived user function, related to using&#xD;
      EADs for completing IADLs. The instrument is proposed to undergo systematic development in&#xD;
      three phases. In phase 1, an initial pool of potential EISA items shall be generated, based&#xD;
      on literature review data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 2, content experts (clinician and EADs user) review panels, shall assess the initial&#xD;
      pool of potential EISA items for further content validity. The objective of phase 3, would be&#xD;
      a validation of the first iteration of EISA, by establishing reliability for test-retest&#xD;
      administration and internal consistency, at acceptable levels, by 25-100 EADs users.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis for test-retest reliability and internal consistency estimation shall be&#xD;
      carried out in phase 3 of the study, using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)&#xD;
      version 24 software.&#xD;

      Objective: The purpose of this proposed study, is the development and validation of EISA, a&#xD;
      Self-report outcome measurement tool, for assessing satisfaction of everyday functional&#xD;
      needs, for consumers using EADs as the primary means to complete IADLs. The EISA outcome&#xD;
      measure is proposed to be designed as a questionnaire that can be self or interview&#xD;
      administered to users of EADs. Development of EISA shall be modeled along the lines of&#xD;
      development of the self-report outcome measure, FMA (Kumar et al., 2013). The proposed tool&#xD;
      EISA would serve as a dynamic gauge, for assessing perceived user function, related to using&#xD;
      EADs for completing IADLs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The instrument is proposed to undergo systematic development in three phases. In Phase 1, an&#xD;
      initial pool of potential EISA items shall be generated, based on literature review data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2, content experts (clinician and EADs user) review panels, shall assess the initial&#xD;
      pool of potential EISA items for further content validity. The objective of phase 3, would be&#xD;
      validation of the first iteration of EISA, by establishing reliability for test-retest&#xD;
      administration and internal consistency, at acceptable levels, by 25-100 EADs users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis for test-retest reliability and internal consistency estimation shall be&#xD;
      carried out using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 software, in&#xD;
      Phase 3 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Briefly describe previous findings or observations that provide the background&#xD;
      leading to this proposal. It cannot be stressed enough, that for both able-bodied individuals&#xD;
      and PWD, having access to ICT, is no longer a luxury, but rather, a basic necessity, to cope&#xD;
      with the current technology based lifestyle. Furthermore, having equal and timely access to&#xD;
      IT for PWD is imperative to enable them to live independently and have a high Quality of&#xD;
      Life. Moreover, this equal and timely access not only provides increased life options for PWD&#xD;
      but also, wider economic benefits for the society at large. However, currently, several&#xD;
      factors are impeding this equal and timely access to ICT for PWD. These factors include (1)&#xD;
      lack of an outcome measure specifically designed and validated to assess the satisfaction of&#xD;
      everyday functional needs related to EAD; (2) inappropriateness, impracticality, apart from&#xD;
      lack of clinical utility and psychometric validation of existing outcome measures to assess&#xD;
      the satisfaction of everyday functional needs of PWD, related to EADs; (3) continual and&#xD;
      fast-paced, disruptive innovations very often rendering essential services inaccessible for&#xD;
      PWD. Therefore, to fill this unmet need, as well as, to enable PWD to have equal opportunity&#xD;
      with able-bodied individuals to tap their optimal potential, this study proposes the&#xD;
      development and validation of a self-report outcome measure, EISA, specifically designed to&#xD;
      assess satisfaction of everyday functional needs of PWD, related to EADs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: In this day and age of IT, it is crucial for PWD to have access to EAD that&#xD;
      matches their individualized needs and enables them to achieve their optimal potential.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, as can be gleaned from the aforementioned analysis, currently there is no good&#xD;
      outcome tool for the assessment of user-satisfaction in performing functional needs with&#xD;
      EADs.&#xD;
