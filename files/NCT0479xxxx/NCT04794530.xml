  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among people with peripheral artery disease (PAD) age 55 and older, the investigators will&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that PAD participants randomized to cocoa flavanols will have greater&#xD;
      improvement or less decline in six-minute walk distance at six-month follow-up, compared to&#xD;
      those randomized to placebo. The study will randomize 190 participants with PAD age 55 and&#xD;
      older to one of two groups for six months: cocoa flavanols vs placebo. Our primary outcome is&#xD;
      change in six-minute walk distance at six-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes are&#xD;
      Actigraph-measured physical activity, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD),&#xD;
      gastrocnemius muscle biopsy measures of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and&#xD;
      phosphorylated eNOS, gastrocnemius muscle perfusion (measured by magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI)) and gastrocnemius muscle characteristics (measured by muscle biopsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the specific aims, the study will randomize 190 participants age 55 and older with&#xD;
      PAD to one of two groups: cocoa flavanols vs placebo. Participants will be followed for six&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
