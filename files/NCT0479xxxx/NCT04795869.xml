      This phase II clinical trial studies how well giving brentuximab vedotin together with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in treating patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) that has come back&#xD;
      (recurrent). Monoclonal antibody-drug conjugates, such as brentuximab vedotin, can block&#xD;
      cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Pembrolizumab is an antibody-drug&#xD;
      that stimulates body's natural antitumor immune responses. Giving brentuximab vedotin&#xD;
      together with pembrolizumab may work better than brentuximab vedotin alone in treating&#xD;
      patients with recurrent peripheral T-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the antineoplastic efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in previously treated patients with PTCL, as measured by the overall objective&#xD;
      response rate (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of brentuximab vedotin in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess efficacy using duration of objective response (DOR), time to response (TTR),&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 3 of cycle 1, day 1 of subsequent cycles. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for up to 16 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. After 6 cycles of treatment, patients may discontinue treatment if&#xD;
      they experience disease progression, are eligible for stem cell transplant, or if they elect&#xD;
      to not undergo stem cell transplantation (SCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 5 years.&#xD;

          -  Patients who have primary relapsed/refractory disease with relapse within 6 months of&#xD;
             receipt of frontline treatment are not eligible&#xD;

          -  Patients who were refractory to a prior brentuximab vedotin-containing regimen are not&#xD;
             eligible. (Note: Patients who previously received a brentuximab vedotin-containing&#xD;
             regimen and who experienced stable disease for &gt;= 3 months or better as best response&#xD;
