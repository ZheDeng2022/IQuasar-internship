  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently limited treatments available that show anti-biofilm efficacy for wound&#xD;
      infection management Biofilms account for over 80% of infections and approximately 65% of&#xD;
      nosocomial infections caused by microorganisms in the developed world involve biofilms. There&#xD;
      clearly is a need for cost effective, highly stable, easily obtained biofilm targeted&#xD;
      strategies for treatment of chronic wound biofilm infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information generated from this project has the potential of providing considerable&#xD;
      benefits to wound care by determining the efficacy of EDT dressing in managing wound biofilm&#xD;
      infection and efficacy in wound healing and closure. Such knowledge could help therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies and could provide information for future clinical studies to further understanding&#xD;
      -of EDT wound dressings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized open-label clinical study to test the efficacy of the treatment protocol&#xD;
      using an optimized EDThi &amp; EDTlo sequential approach in infected or high risk of infection&#xD;
      burn/trauma/surgery chronic wounds against biofilm infection. This trial will determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of EDT dressing against wound biofilm infection. subjects will be randomized to one&#xD;
      of the two groups: 1) standard of care (SoC) only and 2) SoC + EDT dressing treatment. In&#xD;
      group 2, in addition to SoC, the patients will apply the EDThi dressing (PED-10) on the&#xD;
      wound(s) for the first 3 weeks following enrollment followed by Procellera® for additional 3&#xD;
      weeks. The use of dressings will be discontinued anytime if complete wound closure is&#xD;
      achieved.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Ages 18 years and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. subjects willing and able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. patients with infected chronic trauma or surgical wounds&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. wound(s) must be able to be covered by the EDT dressing&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. All patients, with wounds below the knee, must have wound tissue oxygenation adequate&#xD;
             to support wound healing per provider discretion, this may be defined by one or more&#xD;
             of the following perfusion values within 6 months on enrollment: peri-wound&#xD;
             transcutaneous oxygen measurements ≥ 25 mmHg (TCOM),Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) &gt;0.7,&#xD;
             or a Toe pressure (TP) &gt; 40 mmHg, If none of these tests were performed during&#xD;
             standard of care, then a trained study team member may obtain a TCOM measurement after&#xD;
             the patient has consented and before they are enrolled. If there are multiple&#xD;
             perfusion values that conflict, then a physician will review and determine if they are&#xD;
             eligible for enrollment. If a patient has had a recent re-vascularization, the patient&#xD;
             may be enrolled once adequate perfusion has been verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must be able to read and understand English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Individuals who are deemed unable to understand the procedures, risks and benefits of&#xD;
             the study, ie. Informed consent will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prisoners&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Wound tissue not available for analysis&#xD;
