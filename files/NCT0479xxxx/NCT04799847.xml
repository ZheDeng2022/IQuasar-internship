      A Multicenter, Non-randomized, Uncontrolled, Open-label Phase I/II study to Observe the&#xD;
      Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of Catumaxomab in Patients with Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder&#xD;
      Cancer who have Failed or are Intolerant to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) Vaccine&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, non-randomized, uncontrolled, open-label phase I/II study to observe&#xD;
      the safety and preliminary efficiency of catumaxomab in patients (hereinafter referred to as&#xD;
      participants) with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who have failed or are&#xD;
      intolerant to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted in 3 phases sequentially: dose escalation phase, dose expansion phase&#xD;
      and dose extension phase. In the dose escalation phase, the preliminary safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile of catumaxomab for 4 cycles of instillation in participants are&#xD;
      explored. Data will be collected after completing DLT observation in all cohorts, but it is&#xD;
      not required to lock database. DSMB will review the data of each dose cohort and decide&#xD;
      whether to open the enrollment for the next cohort. DSMB will recommend the dose at dose&#xD;
      expansion phase according to the relevant data after the completion of DLT observation and&#xD;
      the first efficiency assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose expansion phase, 24 participants will receive the catumaxomab treatment at dosing&#xD;
      scheme recommended by the DSMB. DLT events occurred within 28 days after the initial&#xD;
      instillation will be investigated. After th DLT observation period, DSMB will evaluate the&#xD;
      data from both dose escalation and dose expansion phase and decide whether to initiate the&#xD;
      dose extension phase; protocol amendment might be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose extension phase, the elgible participants are enrolled and allocated into three&#xD;
      arms according to the type of BCG treatment failure: refractory, relapse, and intolerance. A&#xD;
      maximum 125 participants are enrolled in the 3 arms, with at least 30 participants allocated&#xD;
      to each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will have chest and abdominal CT and pelvic MRI scan at baseline to&#xD;
      determine the area of lesion and to rule out possible extra-bladder lesions. From the initial&#xD;
      instillation, cystoscopy, bladder biopsy, urinary cytology, and pelvic MRI scan are performed&#xD;
      every 12 weeks (±7 days); chest and abdominal CT scans are performed every 24 weeks (±7&#xD;
      days)1 until recurrence, progression, consent withdrawal, or 96 weeks (±7 days) from the&#xD;
      initial instillation, whichever occurs firstly. Participants who discontinue study treatment&#xD;
      early due to any reasons other than disease progression will continue to have the tumor&#xD;
      response assessment as planned until the participant has disease progression, withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent, loss of follow-up, death, 96 weeks (± 7 days) after the initial instillation or&#xD;
      until the end of the study, whichever occurs firstly.&#xD;
