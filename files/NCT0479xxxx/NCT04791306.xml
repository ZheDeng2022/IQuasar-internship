  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to analyze the impact of a single acute exercise intervention (ergometry) on the&#xD;
      expression pattern of specific heart health related miRNAs in healthy, previously sedentary&#xD;
      participants, and how this pattern will be changed after 4 months of increasing the weekly&#xD;
      physical activity &gt;150 minutes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise induced changes in heat health related miRNA expression pattern are analyzed in&#xD;
      plasma samples collected at rest and immediately after the completion of an all-out ergo&#xD;
      spirometry test, conducted during the baseline examination. Additionally participants will&#xD;
      perform a pulse wave analysis to evaluate their arterial stiffness, a bioimpedanzanalysis to&#xD;
      evaluate their body composition, blood lipids will be measured as well as their exercise&#xD;
      capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline examination, all participants will perform once per week a supervised&#xD;
      endurance and strength training at our facility. In addition, the participants will be&#xD;
      provided with a digital application for planning and documentation of their home based&#xD;
      physical activity. Together with an expert, they plan their weekly physical activities so&#xD;
      that they reach 150 min of physical activity each week over a period of 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this training/exercise intervention all participants will perform all measurements from&#xD;
      the baseline examination again.&#xD;
