  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescence is a time of heightened reward sensitivity and greater impulsivity. On top of&#xD;
      this, many teenagers experience chronic sleep deprivation and misalignment of their circadian&#xD;
      rhythms due to biological shifts in their sleep/wake patterns paired with early school start&#xD;
      times. Many studies find that this increases the risk for substance use (SU). However, what&#xD;
      impact circadian rhythm and sleep disruption either together or independently have on the&#xD;
      neuronal circuitry that controls reward and cognition, or if there are interventions that&#xD;
      might help to modify these disruptions is unknown. Project 2 (P2) of the CARRS center will&#xD;
      test an innovative and mechanistic model of brain circuitry that uses multi-method&#xD;
      approaches, takes a developmental perspective, and incorporates key sleep and reward&#xD;
      constructs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Substance use (SU) and substance use disorders (SUD) pose devastating health, financial, and&#xD;
      societal costs. The incidence of SU and SUDs increases across adolescence, making this&#xD;
      sensitive developmental period one of both heightened risk-and heightened opportunity for&#xD;
      prevention and intervention. However, to develop effective interventions investigators need&#xD;
      to identify novel and modifiable risk factors and mechanisms for SUD. Sleep and circadian&#xD;
      rhythm disturbances are such risk factors, and the reward system, with its increasing&#xD;
      sensitivity during adolescence, provides a plausible mechanistic substrate. The focus on&#xD;
      sleep, circadian rhythms, and reward system function is particularly salient given the&#xD;
      extensive, parallel development of these systems during adolescence, and the plausible&#xD;
      linkages between sleep and circadian rhythms, reward function, and SUD risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late sleep timing, short sleep duration and circadian misalignment are associated with&#xD;
      increased substance use in teenagers and young adults. The central hypothesis of the Center&#xD;
      for Adolescent Reward, Rhythms and Sleep (CARRS) is that adolescent development acts on&#xD;
      underlying sleep and circadian traits to modify homeostatic sleep drive, circadian phase, and&#xD;
      circadian alignment, which in turn impact cortico-limbic functions critical to SU risk (e.g.,&#xD;
      reward and cognitive control). Investigators further hypothesize that specific manipulations&#xD;
      of sleep and circadian rhythms during adolescence will affect reward responsivity and&#xD;
      cognitive control in either positive or negative directions. These manipulations will provide&#xD;
      experimental support for our model, and proof of concept for novel clinical interventions to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of SU and SUDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most previous studies have examined individual components of circadian rhythms, sleep, and&#xD;
      reward function in adolescence. Project 2 (P2) of CARRS will test an innovative and&#xD;
      mechanistic model of brain circuitry that uses multi-method approaches, takes a developmental&#xD;
      perspective, and incorporates key sleep and reward constructs. Most notably, P2 improves upon&#xD;
      past observational work by testing an experimental intervention that manipulates sleep and&#xD;
      circadian rhythms to directly examine its impact on reward function and cognitive control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P2 will study 150 adolescents (age 13-15, 50% female) across two key sleep phenotypes: early&#xD;
      sleep timing (low risk, n=50) and late sleep timing (high risk, n=100). All participants will&#xD;
      complete the observational study: 1 week of home sleep monitoring (actigraphy), followed by&#xD;
      an overnight laboratory visit to assess self-report, behavioral, and neuroimaging (fMRI)&#xD;
      tasks tapping cognitive control and reward function, as well as circadian phase via salivary&#xD;
      melatonin and molecular rhythms via hair follicles. The Late group will continue to the&#xD;
      experimental study, each participant randomized to manipulation or attentional control&#xD;
      conditions (n=50 each). Investigators will probe whether advancing sleep/circadian timing and&#xD;
      extending sleep duration via sleep scheduling and chronotherapeutic approaches (reducing PM&#xD;
      light exposure; administering AM bright light) improves sleep, circadian, and neurobehavioral&#xD;
      function relevant to SUD risk. Finally, repeated 6-month follow-up assessments of sleep and&#xD;
      SU for all participants are included to examine longitudinal associations.&#xD;
