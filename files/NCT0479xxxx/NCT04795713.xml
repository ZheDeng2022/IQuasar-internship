    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1 Open-label, dose escalation and expansion study of MT-6402 (an&#xD;
      Engineered Toxin Body (ETB)) in subjects with advanced solid cancer that expresses PD-L1&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two sequential parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1 (Dose Escalation): The purpose of Part 1 is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
           tolerability of MT-6402 in subjects with advanced cancer (solid tumors) and to estimate&#xD;
           the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2 (Dose Expansion): The purpose of Part 2 is to confirm the recommended Phase 2&#xD;
           dose (RP2D) and to evaluate the efficacy of MT-6402 in subjects with advanced cancer.&#xD;
           Part 2 will include subjects with PD-L1 positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who&#xD;
           received prior PD-1/PD-L1 treatment, subjects with PD-L1 positive squamous cell cancer&#xD;
           of the head and neck (SCCHN) who are refractory to or ineligible for platinum-based&#xD;
           therapy and received prior PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and subjects with any other relapsed or&#xD;
           refractory PD-L1 positive solid tumor who received PD-1/PD-L1 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 138 eligible subjects will be identified and treated through competitive enrollment at&#xD;
      multiple study centers&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Parts 1 and 2, a subject may participate for the following four (4) periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening Period - up to 28 days before first dose of MT-6402&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Period - active period where a subject will receive doses of MT-6402 over a&#xD;
           28-day treatment period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short-term Follow-up Period - up to 90 days after last dose of MT-6402&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long-term follow-up Period - up to 24 months after last dose of MT-6402&#xD;
&#xD;
      MT-6402 will be given as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes on the same day every&#xD;
      week (i.e., days 1, 8, 15 and 22) of each cycle. A cycle is defined as 28 days. A subject can&#xD;
      continue receiving MT-6402 as long as it is well-tolerated or until the subject decides they&#xD;
      no longer want to participate in the study.&#xD;

                  standard treatment would not be in the subject's best interest. Subjects who&#xD;
                  refuse radical resection are eligible. NOTE: squamous cell carcinoma of any other&#xD;
                  primary anatomic location in the head and neck, subjects with SCCHN of unknown&#xD;
                  primary, and subjects with skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and&#xD;
                  neck are not eligible for this arm. The tumor must be platinum resistant or the&#xD;
                  subject ineligible for platinum therapy due to hypersensitivity or concerns with&#xD;
                  ototoxicity.&#xD;

&#xD;
               6. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 55%, assessed preferably by&#xD;
                  echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan if ECHO is not&#xD;
                  available, within 28 days before starting study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. High-risk uncontrolled arrhythmias (i.e., atrial tachycardia with a heart rate &gt;&#xD;

                  350 cells/mL may be enrolled, but must be taking appropriate opportunistic&#xD;
                  infection prophylaxis, if clinically relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subjects with positive HBV serology are eligible if they have an undetectable&#xD;
                  viral load and the subject will receive antiviral prophylaxis for potential HBV&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Subjects with positive HCV serology are eligible if quantitative polymerase chain&#xD;
                  reaction (PCR) for plasma HCV RNA is below the lower limit of detection.&#xD;
                  Concurrent antiviral HCV treatment per institutional guidelines is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Current treatment requiring systemic steroids at doses &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone&#xD;
             equivalent.&#xD;
