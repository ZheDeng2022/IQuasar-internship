    <textblock>
      The present protocol aims to evaluate the effect of two different 16-week High-intensity&#xD;
      interval training (HIIT) programs on daily physical activity, body composition,&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness, eating behaviour, enjoyment and quality of life in overweight&#xD;
      women. Methods: Ninety overweight women (25 - 50 years old) with a body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to three groups of 30 participants: a remote home-based HIIT&#xD;
      intervention group; a traditional HIIT intervention group; and a non-exercise control group.&#xD;
      Both intervention groups will undergo a 16-week progressive HIIT program following the Tabata&#xD;
      method. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 4th, 8th, and after 16-week for physical&#xD;
      activity, body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, eating behaviour, enjoyment and&#xD;
      quality of life. The study will have a 16-week follow-up post intervention. Results: The&#xD;
      participant's enrolment will begin in December 2021, and investigators will anticipate the&#xD;
      study completion by the mid of 2022. Conclusions: The HIIT programs might have beneficial&#xD;
      effects on daily physical activity, body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness and overall&#xD;
      quality of life in overweight women. Moreover, it might be a more enjoyable form of exercise,&#xD;
      once it is performed faster than other exercise forms. As a beneficial side effect, these&#xD;
      healthy behaviours might have a favourable impact on women's eating behaviours. This study&#xD;
      results are expected to add health and well-being professionals' evidence-based knowledge to&#xD;
      create strategies and design home-based exercise interventions.&#xD;

      Methods Trial design: The study will be a 3-arm Randomized Controlled Trial, in which a&#xD;
      similar number of participants will be assigned to three groups: a supervised remote&#xD;
      home-based HIIT intervention group (Home-HITT), or a presential a supervised traditional HIIT&#xD;
      intervention group (Traditional-HIIT), and a non-exercise control group (CG). The study will&#xD;
      have a 32-week duration and will be carried out in Portugal. This RCT will be &quot;single-blind&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been designed according to CONSORT statement for clinical trials. This RCT&#xD;
      will apply the &quot;intention-to-treat principle&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose rationale: The CG participants will maintain their usual physical and dietary activity.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, after the 16-week intervention, participants selected to the CG will have the&#xD;
      chance to receive the same 16-week HIIT program. Both interventions will consist of a 16-week&#xD;
      exercise program with HIIT with a frequency of 3 days/week. The Home-HIIT group participants&#xD;
      will attend HIIT workout sessions supervised by a specialised instructor via a&#xD;
      videoconference application, while the Traditional-HIIT group participants will attend HIIT&#xD;
      workout sessions supervised in person by the same instructor. Every HIIT workout session will&#xD;
      have a 10 minutes' warm-up, followed by an 8/12/16/20 minutes of HIIT training and 5 minutes'&#xD;
      cool-down. The intervention will have a type of HIIT program called the Tabata method once it&#xD;
      can be performed in home-based programs. Tabata training method has been defined as a HIIT&#xD;
      with submaximal effort performed at 80-95% of maximal heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tabata method uses eight sets of 20 seconds of exercise bouts separated by 10 seconds rest,&#xD;
      in 2 to 5 blocks. It seems that this method is demanding for ordinary adults so it will have&#xD;
      four stages of physical adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each session, all participants in the intervention groups will receive a class&#xD;
      reminder through a short message service (SMS). After each session, all participants will&#xD;
      also receive an SMS with positive reinforcement about their exercise session participation.&#xD;
      In order to compensate for possible absences, extra classes will be given. The 16 weeks&#xD;
      intervention period was chosen because evidence shows that this period is sufficient to&#xD;
      evidence changes in PA levels. Guidelines suggest the need to accumulate 75 min/week of&#xD;
      vigorous-intensity PA. Despite the guidelines, this exercise protocol will be characterized&#xD;
      by progression in both exercise intensity and volume because the investigators will be&#xD;
      handling sedentary and overweight women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will have a follow-up period of 16 weeks. During this period, it is&#xD;
      necessary to verify the study variables' evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection and Withdrawal of Subjects: Participants in this study will be volunteers recruited&#xD;
      through Health Centers Portimão, Lagoa and Lagos (Algarve, Portugal) and through promotional&#xD;
      flyers placed in region´s local councils. All the participants will be informed of the&#xD;
      procedures of the study before signing the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Withdrawal: Individuals will be removed from the study when the following situations&#xD;
      are verified: i) medical indication; ii) prolonged illness during the study or injury&#xD;
      incapacitating to continue the study; iii) show willingness to leave the study. Participants&#xD;
      may be replaced if the withdrawal happens before the intervention starts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation: The study should be interrupted if it is found that the application of the&#xD;
      HIIT exercise program is at the origin of the participants physical and/or psychological&#xD;
      problems. There will also be an interruption of the study if it is found that the participant&#xD;
      initiated a physical exercise program parallel to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Determination: To determine a priori the sample size, investigators used G*Power&#xD;
      (version 3.1.9.7). The sample size was determined by the study's primary objective (effect of&#xD;
      the intervention on PA, body composition and cardiovascular health). Based on a large effect&#xD;
      size of 0.80 (Cohen's f), performing a sample size calculation for repeated measures analysis&#xD;
      of variance with an expectable correlation of 0.50 between measurements, alfa of 0.05 and 85%&#xD;
      of power, a total sample size of 60 women will be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the investigators have two experimental groups, the aim is to have 90 women in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis SPSS (StatisticalPackage for the SocialSciences) software, version 27.0,&#xD;
      IBM Windows will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the procedures for sample distribution characterization's, the mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation and amplitude of the distribution (min. value and max. value) will be determined.&#xD;
      To determine data normality, the investigators will use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov analysis.&#xD;
      Parametric statistics will be applied if data is normally distributed. One-way ANOVA will be&#xD;
      used for comparisons of the three groups on all outcome's variables. To determine the&#xD;
      relation between the independent measures, the investigators will use a two-way ANOVA. If&#xD;
      there are significant differences between the different groups, the Bonferroni Post-hoc test&#xD;
      will determine significance levels. In this study, the investigators will use a p-value of&#xD;
      0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: In order to minimize selection bias, stratified randomization will be carried&#xD;
      out when allocating individuals to the experimental and control groups, thus maintaining&#xD;
      identical characteristics in both groups This stratification will be carried out based on&#xD;
      age, sex and ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments: For the present study, participants will be evaluated before the intervention in&#xD;
      the 4th ,8th and 16th week of the intervention. After that, participants will be evaluated in&#xD;
      the 32nd week for follow-up to analyse the possible effect of detraining. Assessments will be&#xD;
      performed through the following instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sociodemographic questionnaire - Questionnaire made for the study with questions about&#xD;
           age, sex;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Anthropometry and Body Composition - Stature and weight will be evaluated to calculate&#xD;
           body mass index. Weight and statures will be measured to the nearest 0.1Kg and 0.1cm&#xD;
           correspondingly (calibrated weighing-machine and stadiometer). For the body mass index&#xD;
           calculation, weight in kilo-grams will be divided by the height in squared meters. The&#xD;
           criteria for defining excess weight and obesity proposed by World Health Organization.&#xD;
           The waist circumference will be recorded using a non-elastic measuring tape, which is&#xD;
           placed horizontally above the top of the iliac crest. This measurement should be&#xD;
           performed with a tense tape without compressing the skin and at the end of exhalation.&#xD;
           It will be assessed % fat mass, bone mass and muscle mass with a bioimpedance&#xD;
           weighing-machine electric model Tanita BC601. Before the test, the participants will be&#xD;
           told to lie down in a supination position to ensure good blood circulation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood Pressure (BP) - The BP will be assessed using electronic BP device OMRON M2 (13)&#xD;
           according to validation protocols;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. PA Questionnaire - For measuring PA, by questionnaire it will be used International&#xD;
           Physical Activity Questionnaire - Long Version (IPAQ);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Daily PA - Objectively measured daily PA will be assessed through accelerometers, using&#xD;
           the Model ActiGraph GT3X+ (Pensacola, USA), triaxial accelerometer, supported by the&#xD;
           ActiLife Software. ActiGraf models have been widely used in research, and it is&#xD;
           estimated that more than 50% of the research using accelerometry uses this brand.&#xD;
           Participants will use the accelerometer for seven consecutive days, during the day and&#xD;
           night (night sleep), except for activity involving water (e.g., swimming) or contact&#xD;
           (e.g., combat sports). The devices will be placed in the hip because it seems to be more&#xD;
           effective in classifying the intensity of PA and the movement patterns. The&#xD;
           accelerometer will be programmed for 60 seconds epoch length. Each day will only be&#xD;
           considered when recording at least 600 minutes of activity, i.e., 10 hours. The daily&#xD;
           time spent in light, moderate and vigorous-intensity activities will be calculated;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Exercise intensity - Investigators will monitor exercise intensity with the perceived&#xD;
           exertion Borg Scale. This scale has been used in RCT with HIIT;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Cardiorespiratory Fitness (CRF) - To assess VO2max the Chester Step Test will be used.&#xD;
           This field test proved to be reliability to estimate CRF and has been used in controlled&#xD;
           trials with the overweight population;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Enjoyment - To measure the enjoyment, the investigators will use Portuguese version of&#xD;
           the the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES);&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Quality of life - To assess the quality of life it will be used the Portuguese version&#xD;
           of the SF-36 Questionnaire. This questionnaire evaluates 8 dimensions: physical&#xD;
           function, physical performance, physical pain, general health, mental health, emotional&#xD;
           performance, social function and vitality;&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Eating Behaviour - The eating behaviour will be assessed through the Portuguese version&#xD;
           of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire - R21 (TFEQ - R21) questionnaire, consisting of&#xD;
           21 items and three subscales: cognitive restraint, uncontrolled eating and emotional&#xD;
           eating;&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Satisfaction with the study - A satisfaction Likert-scale questionnaire that the&#xD;
           participants should fill out, aims to assess the satisfaction with the exercise classes.&#xD;
           The Likert-scale questionnaire will be created for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing: According to the inclusion/exclusion criteria mentioned, the participants will be&#xD;
      assessed to be eligible to participate in the study. In December 2021, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized and allocated in three different groups (CG, Home HIIT and Class HIIT). The&#xD;
      intervention will begin in December 2021 and end in September 2022. The close-out of the&#xD;
      study will be in September.&#xD;
