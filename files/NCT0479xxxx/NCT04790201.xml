  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will adapt and pilot a feasible and effective problem-solving therapy designed&#xD;
      for low-resource settings to address common mental disorders like depression and anxiety -&#xD;
      the Friendship Bench- in a Vietnamese population of individuals living with HIV who also have&#xD;
      opiate use disorder. The Friendship Bench approach has the potential to make an important&#xD;
      contribution to address CMDs and reduce barriers to HIV treatment success among people living&#xD;
      with HIV (PLWH) with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), a critical population driving the HIV&#xD;
      epidemic in Vietnam and many Southeast Asian countries. This proposal will generate critical&#xD;
      evidence for designing a fully powered clinical trial to test the investigation team's&#xD;
      adapted FB protocol in improving HIV, mental health, and drug use treatment outcomes for this&#xD;
      vulnerable population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Injection drug use is the primary driver of the HIV epidemic in Southeast Asia. In 2017, the&#xD;
      HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Southeast Asia was 15%. PWID, most of&#xD;
      whom have OUD, who are living with HIV have low rates of retention in care, antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (ART) initiation, and viral suppression. PWID also experience high rates of&#xD;
      HIV-related and all-cause mortality. Common mental disorders (CMDs), including depressive,&#xD;
      anxiety, and stress-related illnesses, occur in 40-50% of PLWH and OUD. Despite serious&#xD;
      consequences of mental illness on health and HIV progression, mental illness remains&#xD;
      under-diagnosed and under-treated in HIV populations, especially in low- and middle-income&#xD;
      countries (LMICs), such as many countries in Southeast Asia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To respond to the great need for mental health treatment in low- and middle-income countries,&#xD;
      the global mental health field has focused on developing task-shifting and integration&#xD;
      approaches that equip non-specialists to deliver evidence-based mental health interventions&#xD;
      at scale. However, such task shifting interventions to address CMDs have received limited&#xD;
      attention in Southeast Asia among OUD. Vietnam, with its high prevalence of PLWH and OUD, its&#xD;
      integration of methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) with HIV care, and its priority for&#xD;
      developing CMD care for this population, is an ideal setting to evaluate task-shifting mental&#xD;
      health approaches to address CMDs and improve HIV care outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Friendship Bench (FB) is a feasible and effective task-shifting mental health&#xD;
      intervention designed for low-resource settings that is a strong candidate to address CMDs in&#xD;
      this population. FB is a problem solving therapy-based intervention with demonstrated&#xD;
      effectiveness in treating CMDs among primary care patients when delivered by lay counselors.&#xD;
      Lay counselors may effectively deliver FB to PLWH with OUD, but CMD may prove more difficult&#xD;
      to treat in patients with OUD and require professionally trained counselors to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' objective is to complete a pilot randomized trial of 75 patients from 4&#xD;
      MMT clinics in Hanoi. The investigators' specific aims are: 1) To adapt the Friendship Bench&#xD;
      (FB) protocol to be optimized for PLWH and OUD in Vietnam; and 2) To evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability of the adapted FB as well as preliminary indicators&#xD;
      of its impact in improving CMDs and HIV care and drug use treatment outcomes. The Friendship&#xD;
      Bench approach has the potential to make an important contribution to address CMDs and reduce&#xD;
      barriers to HIV treatment success among PLWH with OUD, a critical population driving the HIV&#xD;
      epidemic in Vietnam and many Southeast Asian countries. This proposal will generate critical&#xD;
      evidence for designing a fully powered clinical trial to test the adapted FB protocol in&#xD;
      improving HIV, mental health, and drug use treatment outcomes for this vulnerable population.&#xD;

    <description>A qualitative, applied thematic approach will summarize and report intervention acceptability across key informant interviews (n=84). Acceptability will be defined as the ability to deliver a culturally and resource-appropriate intervention. Acceptability will be measured through brief exit interviews with all patient participants (n=75), HIV providers treating patients in the FB protocol, professional counselors (n=3), lay counselors (n=3), and supervising Master Trainers (n=1 per clinic, n=2 or 3 total). Exit interviews with patients will occur after the final FB session, while exit interviews with other groups will occur after the end of FB activities at each site. Exit interviews will include both closed and open-ended questions and will measure how easy the intervention was to participate in or deliver, the perceived usefulness of the intervention, and suggestions for improvement.</description>

    <description>The DASS-21 measures self-reported depression, anxiety, and stress using three sub-scales. Questionnaire items ask about experiencing various signs and symptoms over the last week and use a Likert scale with response choices and scoring as follows: 0 indicating &quot;Does not apply to me at all (Never)&quot;, 1 indicating &quot;Applied to me to some degree, or some of the time (Sometimes)&quot;, 2 indicating &quot;Applied to me to a considerable degree, or a good part of time (Often)&quot;, and 3 indicating &quot;Applied to me very much, or most of the time (Always)&quot;. A DASS-21 stress sub-scale score ≥10 indicates stress disorders. Severity on the stress sub-scale is measured as follows: Normal: 0-10, Mild: 11-18, Moderate: 19-26, Severe: 27-34, Extremely Severe: 35-42. The proportion of participants with a Depression Anxiety Stress-Scale (DASS-21) stress sub-scale score indicating a stress disorder (a score ≥ 19) will be measured.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Medical record indicates infection with HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been screened with the DASS-21 which has been translated, standardized and&#xD;
             validated in the Vietnamese population with a positive result indicating a CMD (Henry&#xD;
             &amp; Crawford 2005; Le et al. 2017; Tran et al. 2013). The investigators will consider as&#xD;
             eligible all patients with a depression subscale score ≥ 7, an anxiety subscale score&#xD;
             ≥ 6, and/or a stress subscale score ≥ 10. Elevated depressive symptoms be present for&#xD;
             ≥2 weeks and elevated anxiety or post-traumatic stress-related symptoms be present for&#xD;
             ≥1 month. The investigators will consider a positive screen for any of the three&#xD;
             categories as indicating a CMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
