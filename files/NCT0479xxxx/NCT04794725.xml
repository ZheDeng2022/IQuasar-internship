  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In low- and middle-income countries, viral load (VL) monitoring of patients living with HIV&#xD;
      and followed on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in remote settings is still scarce. Barriers to&#xD;
      VL monitoring are essentially the limited access to a laboratory able to perform this&#xD;
      measurement, its cost, as well as the lack of human and material resources. Blood sampling&#xD;
      using dried blood spots (DBS), which has been validated and is immediately available, could&#xD;
      overcome these barriers. With DBS, transfer and conservation of samples are simplified&#xD;
      enabling access to VL monitoring to patients seeking care in sites far from laboratory&#xD;
      facilities. Use of DBS also offers the advantage not to require extensive investments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To guide decision makers in the implementation of strategies to scale-up HIV VL monitoring in&#xD;
      remote settings, field evaluations of DBS in routine conditions are needed. It is in this&#xD;
      context that we propose this field evaluation of the Cobas® plasma separation card in Vietnam&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Vietnam, in 2018, HIV prevalence was estimated at 0.3% among adults and the estimated&#xD;
      proportion of PLHIV on ART was 65%, however the HIV epidemic is essentially concentrated in&#xD;
      people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men and sex workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of today, routine HIV VL monitoring is not yet available in remote settings in Vietnam.&#xD;
      Despite an initiative we conducted and that documented the feasibility of DBS use in remote&#xD;
      settings, and although no genuine roll-out of POC machines is yet observed in the field, the&#xD;
      Ministry of Health of Vietnam has not yet decided to scale-up HIV VL monitoring using DBS.&#xD;
      More field evaluations are needed to convince the Ministry of Health that DBS can effectively&#xD;
      be used to scale-up HIV VL monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of HIV VL&#xD;
      measurement using the cobas® plasma separation card (PSC) against plasma at the threshold of&#xD;
      1000 copies/mL (threshold currently used to define failure in Vietnam, following the WHO&#xD;
      guidelines).&#xD;
