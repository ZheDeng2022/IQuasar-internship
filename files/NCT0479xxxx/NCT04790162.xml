  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation will examine the feasibility of delivery and effect on resilience,&#xD;
      depression and anxiety of a 90-day Heartfulness Practice delivered virtually for health care&#xD;
      students. It is hypothesized that by providing this program on-line, students will be able to&#xD;
      attend easily and complete the sessions. It is also hypothesized that those students who&#xD;
      participate in the meditation program will increase resilience.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Resilience as measured by Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 45 days, 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>25 item self-report questionnaire developed to quantify resilience and the impact of psychoeducation and resilience therapy techniques. Total scores range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating greater levels of resilience. The CD-RISC has been used in a variety of populations.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anxiety/Depression as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 45 days, 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>14-item screening scale developed to indicate the potential presence of anxiety and depression. HADS consists of a 7-item anxiety subscale and a 7-item depression subscale. The HADS has good validity and reliability and has been studied in a variety of populations</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability as measured by the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>45 days, 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>8-item measure of satisfaction that is rated on a 4-point Likert scale and has a score range from 8 to 32. Higher scores indicate greater levels of satisfaction. For this study, we will assign 3 levels of satisfaction: 1) dissatisfied or least satisfied (score 8-16); 2) satisfied (score 17-30); and 3) very satisfied (score 31-32)The CSQ-8 has good test-retest reliability, internal consistency and sensitivity to treatment</description>
