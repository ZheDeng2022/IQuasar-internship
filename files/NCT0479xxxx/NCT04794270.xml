    <measure>CLUE Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 1-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective overall comfort scores will be assessed using Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. A 5-point increase in an average CLUE score translates into 10% shift in the distribution of scores for population of soft disposable contact lens wearers. A higher CLUE score indicates better comfort with respect to contact lens wear.</description>
