      Allergic rhinitis is defined as the symptoms of sneezing, nasal itching, airflow obstruction,&#xD;
      and, mostly, clear nasal discharge caused by IgE-mediated reactions against inhaled allergens&#xD;
      and involving mucosal inflammation driven by T cells (Th2) auxiliary type 2. pollens and&#xD;
      molds, as well as allergens from perennial interiors, such as dust mites, pets, pests, and&#xD;
      some molds. The pattern of dominant allergens depends on the geographic region and degree of&#xD;
      urbanization, but the general prevalence of sensitization to allergens does not vary among&#xD;
      census districts in the United States. This research proposes to study a separate&#xD;
      antihistamine in a nasal spray. It is important to note that this antihistamine is available&#xD;
      without prescription (OTC) and has been studied intranasal since the 1950s1&#xD;

      Allergic rhinitis is defined as the symptoms of sneezing, nasal itching, airflow obstruction&#xD;
      and, mostly, clear nasal discharge caused by IgE-mediated reactions against inhaled allergens&#xD;
      and involving mucosal inflammation driven by T cells (Th2) auxiliary type 2. pollens and&#xD;
      molds, as well as allergens from perennial interiors, such as dust mites, pets, pests and&#xD;
      some molds. The pattern of dominant allergens depends on the geographic region and degree of&#xD;
      urbanization, but the general prevalence of sensitization to allergens does not vary among&#xD;
      census districts in the United States.2 Sensitization to inhaled allergens begins during the&#xD;
      first year of life; Sensitization to indoor allergens precedes sensitization to pollens.&#xD;
      Because viral respiratory infections occur frequently in young children and produce similar&#xD;
      symptoms, it is very difficult to diagnose allergic rhinitis in the first 2 or 3 years of&#xD;
      life. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis reaches its peak in the second to fourth decades of&#xD;
      life and then gradually decreases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of sensitization to inhaled allergens is increasing and is now more than 40% in&#xD;
      many populations in the United States and Europe. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis in the&#xD;
      United States is approximately 30%. Allergic rhinitis contributes to lost or unproductive&#xD;
      time at work and school, to sleep problems and among affected children, to less participation&#xD;
      in outdoor activities. In addition, children with allergic rhinitis are more likely than&#xD;
      unaffected children to have myringotomy tubes placed and their tonsils and adenoids removed.&#xD;
      The ability to control asthma in people with asthma and allergic rhinitis has been linked to&#xD;
      the control of allergic rhinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most people with asthma have rhinitis. The presence of allergic rhinitis (seasonal or&#xD;
      perennial) significantly increases the likelihood of asthma: up to 40% of people with&#xD;
      allergic rhinitis have or will have asthma. It is also important to define the physiological&#xD;
      functional breathing of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Functional or physiological breathing&#xD;
      is through the nose, while OSA is the collapse of the muscles of the oropharyngeal airways.&#xD;
      Nasal obstruction and OSA are usually comorbid. Therapies to increase nasal volume and&#xD;
      airflow in compromised patients have a significant benefit in reducing the symptoms of&#xD;
      nighttime and daytime respiratory disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nose represents more than 50% of the total resistance of the upper airway and plays an&#xD;
      important role in the establishment of physiological functions such as humidification,&#xD;
      heating and air filtration. The nasal mucosa is a dynamic organ controlled by the autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system. Periodic nasal congestion and decongestion have been termed the &quot;nasal&#xD;
      cycle.&quot; In patients with permanent unilateral nasal obstruction, the nasal cycle can&#xD;
      contribute to a significant increase in total resistance of the respiratory tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each nasal inhalation mixes nitric oxide (NO) gas from the maxillary sinuses and is&#xD;
      transported to the lungs. It is NOT necessary for the movement of the cilia in the paranasal&#xD;
      sinuses to carry out the waste, it is anti-fungal, antibacterial and anti-viral, it is also&#xD;
      important in the peripheral vasodilatation of the blood vessels. In selected patients, it was&#xD;
      recommended that the final point to treat OSA be the restoration of nasal breathing.&#xD;
      Resistance of the upper respiratory tract can cause an increase in blood pressure. Mouth&#xD;
      breathing does not have any of the mechanisms of physiological protection, so that people&#xD;
      with this condition are more prone to respiratory infections, as well as to dental sequelae&#xD;
      (gum disease, open anterior bite). That is why the investigators propose to study the&#xD;
      combination of an antihistamine with more than 60 years in the market that was studied&#xD;
      intranasal in the 50s. Nowadays it is known that the combination of antihistamine have better&#xD;
      effect, less side effects than oral treatments. In the US and Europe, a combination of&#xD;
      steroids with antihistamine of European origin is available only by recipes and is highly&#xD;
      expensive. This research proposes to study a separate antihistamine in a nasal spray. It is&#xD;
      important to note that this antihistamine is available without prescription (OTC) and has&#xD;
      been studied intranasal since the 1950s1,2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 14-day study will be conducted during the spring of&#xD;
      2019. After starting 5 days of placebo therapy, 100 patients from each group with moderate to&#xD;
      severe nasal symptoms will be randomized to treatment. with (1) chlorpheniramine nasal spray&#xD;
      vs placebo (nasal saline). All treatments will be administered in the form of 1 spray per&#xD;
      nostril twice a day. The main variable of effectiveness will be the change from the beginning&#xD;
      in the total score of nasal symptoms (TNSS), which consists of nasal congestion, nasal&#xD;
      discharge, nasal itching and sneezing. The main efficacy variables will be (1) the change&#xD;
      from the beginning to day 14 in the total reflective nasal symptom score (TNSS) in the first&#xD;
      12 hours, which combines scores for rhinorrhea, sneezing, itchy nose and nasal congestion,&#xD;
      and (2) Start of Action, based on the instant TNSS for 4 hours after the first dose of the&#xD;
      study drug. During the double-blind treatment period, patients will record their symptom&#xD;
      scores on daily cards twice a day (morning and afternoon). Patients older than or equal to 18&#xD;
      years will complete the questionnaire on the quality of life of rhinoconjunctivitis (RQLQ) at&#xD;
      the beginning of the study and on day 14. Patients will be instructed to call the office at&#xD;
      any time for any questions . Follow-up appointments will be in 1 week, two, and four weeks.&#xD;
