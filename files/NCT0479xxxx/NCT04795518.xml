    <textblock>
      Antibiotic prescriptions for children is a cause for concern in both developed and developing&#xD;
      countries, especially for its excessive use in non-established infections or in infections&#xD;
      with viral etiology (Friedman et al., 2011). Although antibiotics play a crucial role in&#xD;
      reducing child morbidity and mortality (De Jong et al., 2009), its irrational use directly&#xD;
      increases antibiotic resistance by promoting the emergence of resistant bacteria leading to&#xD;
      increased rates of treatment failures and more severe illness episodes with higher costs and&#xD;
      mortality rates (Adisa et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational prescribing implies using the right drug for the right patient at the right time in&#xD;
      the right dose and manner of administration at affordable cost with the right information.&#xD;
      Thus, rational antibiotic prescription has to be tailor-made for individual patients taking&#xD;
      into account the diagnosis, age, sex, weight, microorganism susceptibility, vital organ&#xD;
      functions, drug and food interactions, as well as socioeconomic background of a patient&#xD;
      (Aronson, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the dental community, awareness of clinical indications of antibiotic prescriptions to&#xD;
      the child dental patient is lacking. It was found that a substantial proportion of children&#xD;
      who received dental treatment for pain or localized swelling under general anaesthesia had&#xD;
      also received antibiotics, with wide variation in antibiotic regimens (Dar-Odeh et al.,&#xD;
      2018). Further, among members of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, there was a&#xD;
      trend toward overuse of antibiotics for non-indicated clinical conditions, like pain relief,&#xD;
      irreversible pulpitis, and localized dentoalveolar abscess (Sivaraman et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditions requiring antibiotic treatment in dentistry is limited and there should be (i) a&#xD;
      therapeutic goal to help treatment of acute/chronic infections (where drainage or debridement&#xD;
      is impossible) or (ii) a prophylactic goal to prevent metastatic infections (e.g., bacterial&#xD;
      endocarditis) or local or systemic spread of the infection (Dar-Odeh et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-clinical factors initiated antibiotic prescribing for some clinicians, such as&#xD;
      unavailability of close appointments and seeking parental satisfaction (Sivaraman et al.,&#xD;
      2013). A similar trend was observed in developing countries, where a substantial proportion&#xD;
      of dentists prescribe for non-indicated clinical conditions, such as dry socket, localized&#xD;
      periapical infection, marginal gingivitis, periodontitis, and pulpitis (Kouidhi et al.,&#xD;
      2011). This insufficient knowledge of the appropriate clinical indications is paralleled by a&#xD;
      lack of awareness of important interventions that promote the optimal use of antibiotics,&#xD;
      such as antibiotic stewardship programs. Other forms of abuse in prescribing antibiotics&#xD;
      include prescribing broad-spectrum antibiotics for infections that can be treated by&#xD;
      narrow-spectrum antibiotics, prescribing antibiotics for long periods, and adopting&#xD;
      inappropriate dosing regimens (Sivaraman et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who consult their GP due to tooth-related problems are unlikely to receive a&#xD;
      surgical intervention and have a greater likelihood of being prescribed a systemic antibiotic&#xD;
      compared to individuals who consult a dentist with similar symptoms (Cope et al.,&#xD;
      2015)complications from an odontogenic infection, (Seppänen et al., 2011) the management of&#xD;
      dental problems in general practice could result in increased patient morbidity. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the indiscriminate use of antibiotics may contribute to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant&#xD;
      bacterial strains (Cope et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a condition when bacteria change against antibiotics which are&#xD;
      developed to cure the illnesses they cause. It is a global crisis and posed as one of the&#xD;
      greatest threats to population health. This problem is driven by many factors such as low&#xD;
      quality of antibiotics and improper (under- or over-) use of antibiotics (including&#xD;
      self-medication) (Alumran et al., 2013). Self-medication, which refers to the use of any&#xD;
      medical products without a prescription or following unprofessional recommendations in&#xD;
      treating any illnesses (Togoobaatar et al., 2010), is particularly leading to the AR.&#xD;
      Self-medication practice possibly raises incorrect drug selection, drug resistance,&#xD;
      uncontrolled adverse effects or drug reactions, misdiagnosis, and delay in medical care&#xD;
      (El-Hawy et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been observed that contribute to the problem of antibiotic resistance by dentists can&#xD;
      be substantial as dentists prescribe 10% of all common antibiotics. Yingling et al concluded&#xD;
      from the findings of his study among members of the American Association of Endodontists&#xD;
      (AAE) that they were prescribing antibiotics inappropriately. On the contrary (Yingling et&#xD;
      al., 2002), the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that almost&#xD;
      one-third of all outpatient antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary (Swift and Gulden,&#xD;
      2002). The world has entered an era where some bacterial species are resistant to the full&#xD;
      range of antibiotics presently available, with the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus&#xD;
      aureus and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus being the most widely known example of&#xD;
      extensive resistance (Lewis, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that, in 2050, there will be more than 10 million deaths and 100 trillion USD&#xD;
      lost due to AR if no substantial actions have been made to eliminate this emerging threat. As&#xD;
      inappropriate antibiotic use is the primary cause of AR, responses to this phenomenon&#xD;
      prioritize promoting public awareness about AR (El-Hawy et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irrational prescribing can be due to errors such as required amount of drug or as errors in&#xD;
      writing, abbreviations, pharmaceutical form, drug dosage, administration method, or duration&#xD;
      of treatment. These errors can lead to ineffective treatment and dangerous, long-lasting&#xD;
      illness, or worse: harm to the patient and an increase of the cost of treatment (Grant et&#xD;
      al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dentists, like other health care practitioners should have sufficient knowledge about drugs.&#xD;
      Observing the prescription principles according to international law for dentists is&#xD;
      required. Although dental prescription generally contain pharmaceutics items are limited to&#xD;
      providing short-term drug therapy or specific drugs prescribed for dental surgeries but the&#xD;
      evidence suggests that in many countries, dentists often do not enjoy a good medical&#xD;
      knowledge for this reason, some mistakes in writing prescription occurred (Guzmán-Álvarez et&#xD;
      al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goud et al. reported that general dentists prescribed more than required antibiotics for root&#xD;
      canal therapy (Goud et al., 2012). Mendonca et al. found that in one-fourth of prescriptions&#xD;
      written by dentists, medication names were illegible (Mendonça et al., 2010). Ogunbodede et&#xD;
      al findings indicate the presence of different types of error in dentist's prescription in&#xD;
      term of dosing, frequency and duration of drug use (Ogunbodede et al., 2005).&#xD;
