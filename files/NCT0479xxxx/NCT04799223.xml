  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intestinal flora or microbiota is the group of bacteria that live in the intestine, in a&#xD;
      symbiotic relationship with the human body. It is estimated that human beings have around&#xD;
      2,000 different bacteria species. The gut microbiota plays a key in many of the body's&#xD;
      functions. Hence, the analysis of the gut microbiome provides insight into the state of the&#xD;
      microbiota as an indicator of overall health due to its metabolic, protective and nutritional&#xD;
      functions. A balanced diet promotes the formation and maintenance of a well-structured&#xD;
      microbiota, in which the different species of microorganisms cohabit in a balanced and&#xD;
      controlled system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is based on the hypothesis that the intake of certain plant-based foods rich in&#xD;
      various active ingredients (especially non-digestible carbohydrates, certain types of fats&#xD;
      and polyphenols) can modulate the microbiota and thus improve the health status of the human&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account this background, the objective of this study is to assess the effect of&#xD;
      the inclusion of functional foods and ingredients within a balanced diet on the composition&#xD;
      of the microbiota and also on health parameters associated with metabolic disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 60 volunteers participating in the study who meet the inclusion criteria, will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group (nutritional promotion): volunteers will be provided with basic&#xD;
           nutritional recommendations based on a Mediterranean diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental group (Nutribiota): volunteers will be instructed to follow a dietary&#xD;
           strategy similar to the control group, but including the functional foods and&#xD;
           ingredients developed by the companies with the aim to promote a balanced and specific&#xD;
           diet associated with improvements in the composition of the microbiota and metabolic&#xD;
           parameters of the volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study are 8 weeks, during which 4 visits are scheduled:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment: this visit will consist on an initial screening in which the volunteers&#xD;
           will be informed about the characteristics of the study and will be receive the&#xD;
           information sheet and the informed consent form to be signed by all those interested in&#xD;
           participating in the study. Volunteers who meet the inclusion for the study will be&#xD;
           asked to complete the Food Frequency Questionnaire and Physical Activity Questionnaire&#xD;
           for the next visit (visit 1). In addition, each participant will be provided with a&#xD;
           faecal microbiota sample collection kit which they will have to hand in with the&#xD;
           corresponding sample at the next visit (visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical investigation day 1 (week 0):after a fasting period of at least 10 hours, the&#xD;
           nursing staff will take a blood sample to analyze the biochemical parameters and&#xD;
           metabolomic profile. Anthropometric measurements will be taken from each volunteer&#xD;
           (weight, height, waist and hip circumference, and body composition analysis by&#xD;
           bioimpedance) with the collaboration of a dietician. In addition, faecal sample and Food&#xD;
           Frequency Questionnaire and Physical Activity Questionnaire will be collected.&#xD;
           Volunteers randomly assigned to the experimental group will be given the dishes and&#xD;
           functional ingredients designed by the companies, which they will have to incorporate&#xD;
           into a balanced dietary pattern following the indications given by the dietician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical investigation day 2 (week 4): In this visit, the adherence of the volunteers to&#xD;
           the study will be monitored and the weight of the volunteers will be registered. In&#xD;
           addition, all study volunteers will be given a faecal microbiota sample collection kit,&#xD;
           which should be handed in with the corresponding sample at the final visit. Moreover,&#xD;
           Food Frequency Questionnaire and Physical Activity Questionnaire will be given to each&#xD;
           volunteer in order to be filled for the final visit. Volunteers who belong to the&#xD;
           experimental group will be given dishes and functional ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical investigation day 3 (week 8): Faecal sample, Food Frequency Questionnaire and&#xD;
           Physical Activity Questionnaire will be collected. The procedures in this visit will be&#xD;
           the same as in visit 1, but dishes and functional ingredients will not be given to the&#xD;
           volunteers.&#xD;

    <description>Measured by analyzing the variable regions V3-V4 of the prokaryotic 16S rRNA (ribosomal ribonucleic acid) gene sequences, which gives 460 bp amplicons in a two-round PCR protocol. The kit used will be the Nextera® XT DNA Index Kit, FC-131-1002 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).&#xD;
In the first step, PCR is used to amplify a template out of a DNA fecal sample using specific primers from Illumina. Then, sequencing libraries are built with the MiSeq® Reagent Kit v3 (600 cycles) MS-102-3003 (Illumina). Finally, paired-end sequencing is performed on a MiSeq platform (Illumina) with a 600 cycles Miseq run.&#xD;
Fecal samples are self-collected by the volunteers' fecal samples using OMNIgene.GUT kits from DNA Genotek (Ottawa, ONT, Canada), according to the standard instructions provided by the company</description>
