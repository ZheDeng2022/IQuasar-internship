  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's primary aim is to assess whether there is a clinically significant reduction in&#xD;
      breathlessness in symptomatic individuals with chronic obstructive respiratory disease&#xD;
      (IwCOPD) following engagement with Technology-Assisted Respiratory Adherence prototype 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's secondary aim is to assess whether there is an associated maintenance or increase&#xD;
      in activities of daily living to support a positive benefit of Technology-Assisted&#xD;
      Respiratory Adherence prototype 3 on breathlessness and whether there is an improvement in&#xD;
      the physical activity experience of the patient.&#xD;
