    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this clinical study is to determine the feasibility of breast CT for&#xD;
      breast density assessment and association of CT-derived density measures with metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome in overweight/obese Mexican-origin women in Southern Arizona. These evaluations will&#xD;
      help support follow-up clinical research utilizing breast density acquired by breast CT as a&#xD;
      surrogate endpoint biomarker to evaluate breast cancer preventive strategies. The long-term&#xD;
      goal of these research efforts is to develop safe and effective preventive strategies to&#xD;
      reduce obesity-associated breast cancer burden in our catchment area.&#xD;

    <description>To determine the feasibility of applying a novel clinical prototype of breast CT to assess breast density on non-compressed breasts. Feasibility will be evaluated by the proportion of unmeasurable breast density within our study population utilizing computerized tomography (CT) scan.</description>
