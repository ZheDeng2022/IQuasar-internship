      This is a Phase 2 single site randomized clinical trial (RCT) to be supported by a new&#xD;
      NIH-NIAAA grant, R01-AA029113-01, to assess the efficacy of Prazosin (16mg/day) versus&#xD;
      Placebo over a 12 week treatment period, followed by a 1- and 3- month assessments&#xD;
      post-treatment for individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and history of past or current&#xD;
      evidence of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. If medical detoxification is required for any&#xD;
      patient, patients would be enrolled after medical detoxification. for those not requiring&#xD;
      detoxification, they will be enrolled directly without any requirement of alcohol abstinence.&#xD;
      All patients will be provided behavioral counseling weekly with a trained counselor to&#xD;
      support recovery during the trial. Primary outcomes will be percent of subjects no heavy&#xD;
      drinking days (PSNHDD) and %of any drinking and heavy drinking days as well as secondary&#xD;
      outcomes of craving, mood, anxiety and sleep problems.&#xD;
