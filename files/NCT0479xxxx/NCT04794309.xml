  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is one of the common public problems that its prevalence increase incredibly in the&#xD;
      last three decades in KSA. Thirty obese males aged 20 to 39 years will participate in the&#xD;
      study. The participants will be evaluated on skinfold thickness, percent of body fat, lipid&#xD;
      profile, and exercise capacity. All participants will perform a circuit training of aerobic&#xD;
      and resistance exercises and be instructed to follow a low carbohydrate diet for eight weeks.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Seventy young males with obesity participated in this study. They were divided randomly into two groups. Group 1 received circuit training with low-carbohydrate (LC) diet intervention and Group 2 was the control group. The study variables such as exercise capacity, body composition, skinfold thickness, percentage of body fat (BF%), and lipid profile were measured at the baseline and at the end of a 12-week intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The renowned modified sub-maximal treadmill exercise test,which is the leading indicator of EC,was done to calculate maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max). The test began with a warm-up at a speed of 2.7 km/h for five minutes, andthe speed was increasedevery three minutes until the participantexerted the maximum effort and stopped upon exhaustion.</description>

    <description>circuit training exercise start with 5 minutes of warming-up then followed by a 30-minute conditioning protocol formed 20 minutes of aerobic exercise and 10 minutes of resisted exercise. The cool-down period is doing in form of walking on a treadmill in low intensity for 5 minutes.&#xD;
Aerobic exercise will be performed on an electronically-braked cycle ergometer (Quinton Excalibur, QuintonInstrument Company, Bothell, WA). resistance exercise (RT) in the form of eight different exercises will be performed during each workout: military press, leg extension, bench press, standing leg curl (ankle weights), lateral pull-down, dumbbell triceps push-down, dumbbell seated biceps curl, and sit-ups (abdominal curls).&#xD;
The participant will do 10 minutes for Aerobic exercise followed by 10 minutes of resistance exercise then 10 minutes for Aerobic exercise. This cycle training will perform five days per week for eight weeks.</description>
