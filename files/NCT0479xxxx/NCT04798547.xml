    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized controlled trial (non-inferiority study) is to evaluate the&#xD;
      outcomes of 4 cm short myotomy compared to the 8 cm standard length myotomy in Per-Oral&#xD;
      Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM) for patients with achalasia. We hypothesize that a shorter myotomy&#xD;
      with POEM will have the same clinical efficacy as standard length myotomy based on&#xD;
      patient-reported Eckardt score with shorter procedure times and reduced complications.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Achalasia is a disorder of esophageal dysmotility characterized by dysfunctional peristalsis&#xD;
      and increased lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone. Achalasia is further divided into three&#xD;
      subtypes using high-resolution manometry (HRM) following the Chicago Classification. Type I,&#xD;
      or classic achalasia, and Type II achalasia are both characterized by aperistalsis and&#xD;
      increased LES tone and are thought to be a spectrum of the same disease process with Type II&#xD;
      evolving into Type I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per-oral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM) was first developed in 2008 as a treatment for achalasia.&#xD;
      The technique involves a trans-oral approach with a flexible endoscope. An endoscopic&#xD;
      incision is made in the esophagus and a submucosal tract is created towards the LES and&#xD;
      gastric cardia to expose the underlying muscle of the LES and distal esophagus. The inner&#xD;
      circular muscle is then dissected to create a myotomy and the tract is then closed with&#xD;
      endoscopic clips. By creating a myotomy, the increased LES tone is improved, allowing food to&#xD;
      pass into the stomach in order to relieve the dysphagia caused by achalasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike Type III achalasia, where POEM myotomy length is determined by HRM, the standard&#xD;
      myotomy length in Type I/Type II achalasia is typically 8 cm. The rationale for the 8 cm&#xD;
      myotomy is derived from the Heller myotomy procedure which is a laparoscopic surgery approach&#xD;
      in which the teaching has been to perform at least a 5 cm myotomy in the esophagus and an&#xD;
      additional 2-3 cm myotomy in the gastric cardia. However, the purpose of the myotomy in POEM,&#xD;
      is to reduce the LES tone. The clinical efficacy of the procedure comes from the myotomy of&#xD;
      the high pressure zone within the LES, which is only 2-3cm in length. This is much shorter&#xD;
      than the current standard POEM myotomy length. There are a few potential pitfalls regarding&#xD;
      longer myotomy lengths in the esophagus and in the gastric cardia. A longer esophageal&#xD;
      myotomy may result in esophageal wall strain in the area weakened by esophageal myotomy&#xD;
      resulting in a blown out myotomy which is identified by the presence of a pseudo-diverticulum&#xD;
      endoscopically. Longer gastric cardia myotomy has been thought to lead to an increased rate&#xD;
      of gastroesophageal reflux in patients undergoing POEM. There are no data looking at shorter&#xD;
      myotomy lengths in POEM for Type I and Type II achalasia. Our anecdotal experience at&#xD;
      Northwestern when performing short myotomy during POEM has not resulted in any difference in&#xD;
      procedural efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ENDPOINTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrollment, patients will complete the Eckardt study questionnaire and the GERDQ&#xD;
      questionnaire on the initial visit. Enrolled subjects will complete POEM as per clinical&#xD;
      standard of care with the following specifications. Patients will be randomized to receive a&#xD;
      short myotomy of 4 cm or standard myotomy of 8 cm. Following POEM, patients will be followed&#xD;
      in clinic per standard of care and study questionnaires will be administered at follow-up&#xD;
      visits. The Eckardt Symptom score is validated for research use in achalasia and is the tool&#xD;
      with which we monitor success rates for treatment of achalasia. We will also monitor GERD&#xD;
      symptoms with the GERDQ questionnaire. The endpoints for this study following randomization&#xD;
      and completion of 30 POEM procedures are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 3, 12 and 24-months of follow-up to monitor Eckardt score for all 30 participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 3, 12 and 14-months of follow-up to monitor safety and GERD for all 30 participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES INVOLVED:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the pool of patients seen in esophageal clinics and endoscopy&#xD;
      centers at Northwestern's Digestive Health Center who are specifically consented to undergo&#xD;
      POEM for Type I or Type II achalasia and also in patients with EGJ outflow obstruction that&#xD;
      demonstrate features of achalasia. Involvement with the study will not determine or affect&#xD;
      eligibility or recommendation for POEM in the treatment of achalasia. Upon enrollment,&#xD;
      patients will complete all study questionnaires on the initial visit - these include our&#xD;
      GERDQ questionnaire and our Northwestern Esophageal Quality of Life Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following enrollment, 30 patients will be randomized to receive either a 4 cm or 8 cm&#xD;
      myotomy. Randomization will occur via computer randomization software. At the time of the&#xD;
      procedure, the endoscopist will be given the randomized grouping in an opaque envelope&#xD;
      (either 4 cm or 8 cm myotomy). Participants will then undergo Per-Oral Endoscopic Myotomy as&#xD;
      per standard of care with flexible endoscope using an anterior approach. The only difference&#xD;
      in the procedure will be the length of the muscle layer dissection (myotomy). Fifteen&#xD;
      subjects will undergo the standard 8 cm myotomy, which includes 7 cm myotomy of the esophagus&#xD;
      and 1 cm myotomy of the gastric cardia. Fifteen subjects will undergo a short 4 cm myotomy,&#xD;
      which includes 3 cm myotomy in the esophagus and a 1 cm myotomy of the gastric cardia. All&#xD;
      participants will undergo intra-operative functional monitoring as is standard of care at&#xD;
      Northwestern to ensure adequate response to myotomy. If the shorter myotomy is insufficient,&#xD;
      the patient can undergo standard-length myotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored as per standard care before, during and after POEM procedure.&#xD;
      Post-procedure follow-up for both groups will adhere to standard of care. Data will be&#xD;
      collected on a prospective data from EPIC electronic health care records. Data collected will&#xD;
      include demographic information, imaging results, functional studies (specifically EndoFlip&#xD;
      and HRM) as well as questionnaire data.&#xD;
