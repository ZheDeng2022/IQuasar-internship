  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early monitoring of antineoplastic treatment benefit is a central medical need. Radiologic&#xD;
      assessment for documentation of response is done after several months of treatment usually.&#xD;
      This implies that patients not responding are exposed to unnecessary toxicity. According to&#xD;
      several reports showing the correlation of the amount of circulating tumour DNA with tumour&#xD;
      burden we aim to investigate its early dynamic change at the beginning and during&#xD;
      antineoplastic treament until radiologic response assessment. Blood samples necessary for&#xD;
      that are taken within the scope of clinical routine care. We hypothesize that the changes of&#xD;
      circulating tumour DNA correlate with the radiological findings.&#xD;

      Patients Patients with metastatic cancer who are treated with antineoplastic treatment are&#xD;
      eligible if a molecular marker is either known due to the type of cancer (Case A) or if a&#xD;
      molecular marker is known due to routine assessment (Case B). An example for &quot;Case A&quot; is&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer, which is known to harbor KRAS-mutations as part of tumorigenesis in more&#xD;
      than 90% (8), or multiple cancers harboring methylated WIF(9). A typical example for &quot;Case B&quot;&#xD;
      is colorectal or gastric cancer. Systemic treatment requires the knowledge of the mutational&#xD;
      status of RAS, EGFR and BRAF, which is assessed routinely from tumor tissue. If a mutation is&#xD;
      found the patient qualifies for participation in the project. We finally plan to include at&#xD;
      least 40 patients with mPDAC, another 40 patients with mCRC and 20 patients with mGC (100&#xD;
      patients in total at least).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The inclusion criteria therefore are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Metastatic cancer (mPDAC, mGC, mCRC)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Known mutation of the cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At least 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Eligible for antineoplastic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient treated at the Ordensklinikum Linz&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria o Inclusion criteria not met&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment monitoring Circulating tumor DNA is analysed from peripheral blood. For this&#xD;
      purpose, 30 ml blood is taken at start and during treatment additionally to the blood volume&#xD;
      required for analyses in the frame of routine. Therefore, there are no extra blood sampling&#xD;
      time points additionally to these required for routine care. Due to that, the time points&#xD;
      depend on the cancer type investigated as treatment schedules are different. However, within&#xD;
      an entity the time points are homogenous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of ctDNA The preparation of ctDNA is done in the Laboratory for Molecular Biology&#xD;
      and Tumor Cytogenetics at the Ordensklinikum Linz (Dr. Gerald Webersinke) and digital droplet&#xD;
      PCR is performed by the Department of Genetics at the Medical University of Innsbruck (Prof.&#xD;
      Johannes Zschoke). The analysis is performed in a batch and not in real time. In detail,&#xD;
      ctDNA detection is based on KRAS-screening in mPDAC or by patient specific ddPCR. The latter&#xD;
      patient specific ddPCR is based on the mutations found in the tumor by NGS-screening (ARCHER&#xD;
      or Truesight 170 or whole-genome sequencing if panels are negative) at the Laboratory in&#xD;
      Linz. This is the case for mGC and mCRC, where multiple mutations are possible (KRAS, NRAS,&#xD;
      BRAF, TP53). In patients suffering from mCRC, this analysis in performed within routine&#xD;
      procedures as such mutations are crucial for treatment decisions. In case of mGC mutations&#xD;
      screening is done within the proposed project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiology assessment Assessment of treatment response is performed as part of the routine&#xD;
      treatment after two to three months of treatment at the department of Radiology of the&#xD;
      Ordensklinikum Linz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Data are analyzed in order to detect a dependency between ctDNA dynamics and&#xD;
      response to treatment. Method for example is chi-square test. Software used is RStudio&#xD;
      Version 1.2.5019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive Statistics Mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum for every concentration&#xD;
      of ctDNA at each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROC-AUC analysis for every time point&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dynamics of ctDNA concentration at every time point (metric variable)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome after 12 weeks as a dichotome variable (responder [SD/PR/CR], non-responder)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculation of AUC with 95% CI (all time points)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ROC-curve (all time points)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculation of sensitivity and specificity for all time points with 95% CI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of the optimal threshold-value upon sensitivity and specificity for every&#xD;
           time point&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of predictive value of each time point based on sensitivity/specificity, AUC&#xD;
           by CI-values&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power-analysis Based on the current patient recruitment we assume to end up with a final&#xD;
      number of 100 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  n = 100&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Power 80 %&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significance-niveau 5 %, Confidence-Intervall (CI) 95 %&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of responders (estimated prevalence): 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensitivity and specificity: 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dropout-rate: 15 %&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for analysis We first compare Roc curves at the different timepoints to identify the&#xD;
      timepoint that as the best tradeoff between performance and gain of time (lack of power to&#xD;
      provide statistical comparisons). In a second step, we identify the best cut point of ctDNA&#xD;
      at the chosen timepoint based on youden index for instance and give sensitivity/specitivity&#xD;
      and also NPV/PPV at this cut-point.&#xD;
