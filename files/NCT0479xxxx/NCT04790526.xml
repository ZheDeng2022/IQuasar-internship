      The major aim of this project to check the dose response of eccentric exercise in reduction&#xD;
      of glycemic index in type II Diabetes Mellitus. This study aim to check the effect of&#xD;
      eccentric exercises on Glycemic index, quality of life, strength, exertion, balance and&#xD;
      proprioception in type II Diabetes Mellitus patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From the last three decades, the diabetes mellitus progress quadrupled.The International&#xD;
      Diabetes Federation (IDF) approximate that 1 in 11 adults with age between 20 to 79 years&#xD;
      have diabetes mellitus. Almost 90 percent of patients diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus are&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. According to the World Health Organization, Diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus could be 7th leading cause of death. Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) increase&#xD;
      progressively that affect around 25 million people in Europe and major public health issue&#xD;
      for middle income countries. It is proposed that the prevalence of diabetes mellitus will&#xD;
      increase up to 67% in middle-income countries from 2010 to 2030. In Pakistan, the Type II&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus prevalence in 2018 is 11.77%. The prevalence is more in male as compared to&#xD;
      females and urban area have 14.81 percent as compared to rural area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genetic architecture might partially determine an individual's response to environmental&#xD;
      changes.The risk factors of Type II Diabetes Mellitus include obesity, ageing, behavioral and&#xD;
      environment factors, diet and lifestyle. School-age children had also warned of a rise in&#xD;
      childhood obesity in Pakistan, which is considered a strong risk factor in diabetic patients.&#xD;
      The major cause of Type II Diabetes Mellitus is deficiency or loss of insulin. Brain utilize&#xD;
      glucose as source of energy and when brain is unable to maintain integrity, Many&#xD;
      physiological mechanism initiates to reduce and limit the effect of hypoglycemia.The response&#xD;
      of human body in reaction to reduce glucose level causes lowering the secretion of insulin&#xD;
      and release counter-regulatory hormone.Diabetes mellitus have strong correlation for&#xD;
      reduction in muscular strength and functional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study on global burden of diseases, Diabetes mellitus considered as ninth major&#xD;
      cause of reduced life expectancy. A study conducted decades ago concluded that 3.96 million&#xD;
      deaths occur due to diabetes mellitus with aged between 20-79 years. According to the&#xD;
      International Diabetes Federation, the number and complications of diabetes mellitus increase&#xD;
      rapidly up to 5.0 million deaths due to metabolic disorder.The prevalence of disability&#xD;
      occurrence due to diabetes mellitus increase significantly since 3 decades ago. According to&#xD;
      the global burden of Disease, Injuries and Risk factor statement, the 10th most common factor&#xD;
      of disability was fasting level of glucose in 1990, 4th common cause till 2005 and 3rd common&#xD;
      cause in 2015.45.8 percent of diabetes mellitus patients were approximately not diagnosed.&#xD;
      Those patient who are not diagnosed have more risk of complication as compared to those who&#xD;
      are diagnosed and start intervention. Medical expenditure of diabetes mellitus patients&#xD;
      increases three times more than general population.The cases of people living suffering from&#xD;
      Type II Diabetes Mellitus increase quadrupled between 1980 and 2014 globally. Adults who have&#xD;
      diagnosed diabetes mellitus enhance to 20 percent from 2010 to 2030 and predicted to increase&#xD;
      rapidly up to 69 percent. In Asia, the epidemic of Type II Diabetes Mellitus progress very&#xD;
      rapidly and characterized by onset at a lower BMI and younger age than in Western&#xD;
      populations. An average cost for the treatment of Diabetes Mellitus in Pakistan ranges from&#xD;
      650 to 20000 PKR.&#xD;
