  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this pilot study is to characterize illicit fentanyl and combination&#xD;
      fentanyl and opioid dependence explicitly, by assessing physiologic barriers to effective&#xD;
      buprenorphine induction. Results from this pilot study may make a case for a larger&#xD;
      feasibility study to be conducted through the Clinical Trials Network at the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Drug Abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that individuals dependent on illicit fentanyl and combination&#xD;
      fentanyl and opioids will have difficulty with standard buprenorphine induction, and will&#xD;
      need a modified approach. The primary outcome measure will be retention on buprenorphine at&#xD;
      seven days post induction. The secondary outcome measures will be objective precipitated&#xD;
      withdrawal and the rate of patients requiring or requesting to initiate methadone due to&#xD;
      intolerance of buprenorphine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Illicit synthetic fentanyl is found in increasing proportions of illicit drug samples, and&#xD;
      negatively influences how buprenorphine is used on the street to help with subjective&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms. In the clinic, it has been observed among individuals positive for&#xD;
      fentanyl that initiation of buprenorphine is difficult. When spontaneous withdrawal, normally&#xD;
      the signal that the patient is ready to initiate buprenorphine, and buprenorphine is given,&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms often seem to increase. It is unclear whether this represents&#xD;
      precipitated withdrawal versus progressing spontaneous withdrawal, but the standard clinical&#xD;
      approach has been to wait for more withdrawal symptoms and time to elapse before trying&#xD;
      another test dose. In this population, waiting is a clinically problematic strategy as many&#xD;
      patients in continuing withdrawal would resume opioid use rather than try buprenorphine&#xD;
      again. To date, there has been one study noting that fentanyl dependent patients are retained&#xD;
      at equal rates to patients with heroin dependence, but this study was observational,&#xD;
      retrospective and small. An alternative approach to induction would rapidly provide high&#xD;
      doses of buprenorphine initially. The theory behind rapid induction would be either that the&#xD;
      robust withdrawal observed is actually spontaneous withdrawal, calling for a higher initial&#xD;
      buprenorphine dosing regimen, or that some of the withdrawal observed may be precipitated,&#xD;
      but rapidly and fully occupying the receptors with partial agonist produces enough agonist&#xD;
      effect to subdue precipitated withdrawal. If found to be superior to standard induction, the&#xD;
      high dose induction regimen could be immediately implemented in primary care settings. Or, if&#xD;
      buprenorphine cannot be initiated for a given patient, a full opioid agonist, namely&#xD;
      methadone, may be the best first step, suggesting methadone as a first-line treatment for&#xD;
      those dependent on fentanyl and other high potency synthetics. Methadone administration is&#xD;
      currently restricted to specially licensed opioid treatment programs and not widely available&#xD;
      across clinical settings where buprenorphine can be initiated. If the availability of&#xD;
      methadone rescue in this study proves useful, it would support a larger case for regulatory&#xD;
      reforms to make methadone more widely available beyond traditional OTPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study proposed here would be the first pilot study to assess the extent that synthetic&#xD;
      opioid dependence prevents successful induction with buprenorphine-naloxone. Programs like&#xD;
      the Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute's opioid treatment program have been set up to serve&#xD;
      rural and impoverished small urban communities that have become the epicenter of the opioid&#xD;
      epidemic. The need to deliver evidence-based treatment effectively is paramount, especially&#xD;
      during a window of time in which an individual desiring treatment and having access to that&#xD;
      treatment is vanishingly small. A difficult initiation with substantial withdrawal symptoms&#xD;
      can derail motivation that can lead to treatment abandonment. A rapid assessment of whether&#xD;
      individuals cannot complete buprenorphine-naloxone induction who have been using illicit&#xD;
      fentanyl or combination fentanyl with other opioids is a starting point to change management&#xD;
      of this growing set of individuals.&#xD;
