      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome. Researchers think&#xD;
      brain development may be controlled by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). They want to learn how&#xD;
      abnormalities in the GABA system may contribute to ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) creates short-term changes in&#xD;
      how different parts of the brain communicate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right-handed people ages 14-17 with ASD, and healthy volunteers ages 18-25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medicine review&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological tests and rating scales&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forms and surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a hearing test and ear exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. They will lie on a&#xD;
      table that moves in and out of the MRI scanner. They may look at a screen while in the&#xD;
      scanner. A coil will be placed over their head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It takes pictures of chemicals in the&#xD;
      brain using the MRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have magnetoencephalography. They will sit in a chair. A helmet with&#xD;
      magnetic field sensors will be placed on their head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have TMS. A wire coil will be held on their scalp. A brief electrical&#xD;
      current will pass through the coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have electromyography. Sticky pad electrodes will be placed on the skin&#xD;
      during TMS. The electrical activity of their muscles will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have rTMS. It uses short bursts of magnetic pulses to affect brain&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASD participants will have 6 visits over 6-8 weeks. Healthy volunteers will have 3 visits&#xD;
      over 3-4 weeks....&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a within-subject, controlled, proof-of-mechanism study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to evaluate the relationship between local GABA concentration, structural and&#xD;
      functional network connectivity and MEG measures of auditory and language processing in&#xD;
      adolescents with ASD and the acute impact of a single session of continuous theta burst&#xD;
      stimulation over left posterior superior temporal cortex (pSTC) on these measures. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that GABA concentrations, DTI measures of tissue microstructure and fcMRI&#xD;
      obtained BOLD correlations within the language network will significantly contribute to the&#xD;
      prediction model for MEG indices of auditory and language processing. Participation in the&#xD;
      study involves six study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: The overall goal of the current study is to 1) Characterize the&#xD;
      relationship between an individual's baseline local cortical GABA concentration, DTI measures&#xD;
      of auditory and language network tissue microstructure, and fcMRI indices of local and&#xD;
      long-range network functional connectivity (predictor variables) and MEG indices of auditory&#xD;
      and language processing (dependent variables).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: 2) Evaluate the impact of a single session of cTBS over the left pSTC&#xD;
      on these MRS and MEG indices in adolescents (age 14-17) with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MEG: Evoked fields and Spectral Power&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MRS: GABA+/Cr concentrations in the left pSTC&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. DTI: Diffusion tensor derived parameters in the auditory radiations and arcuate&#xD;
           fasciculus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. fcMRI: BOLD correlations across pre-defined ROIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MEG: Inter-trial gamma-band coherence (ITC) and resting state alpha to gamma&#xD;
           phase-amplitude coupling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SRS-2, CELF-5, EVT, PPVT, ADOS-2, ADI-R, VABS-III, WASI- II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pilot phase of the study, we aim to enroll up to 20 healthy control adult&#xD;
      participants. These healthy control young adult participants (age 18-25) will undergo imaging&#xD;
      scans, cTBS, and MEG. They will additionally receive a medical history, brief neurological&#xD;
      and physical exam; and complete an IQ assessment and the SRS-2 self-report. As the aim of the&#xD;
      healthy control young adult portion of the study involves piloting procedures and tasks and&#xD;
      confirming target engagement of active stimulation, the healthy control young adults&#xD;
      participation will involve only 4 visits: Two enrollment/screening/baseline visit and two&#xD;
      cTBS visits (one with MRS/fMRI immediately before and after and one with MEG immediately&#xD;
      before and after).As with the main phase of the study, the visits may be split up to shorten&#xD;
      the length of session and limit fatigue. Visits will be scheduled about once a week. All&#xD;
      visits must be completed within six months of the date of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the main phase of the study, we aim to collect a sample of 55 adolescents age 14-17 with&#xD;
      ASD with complete data. In order to account for screen failures and participant attrition, we&#xD;
      will recruit a total of 86 individuals (56% above the goal enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All visits will be outpatient and take place in the Clinical Center (Building 10) on NIH&#xD;
      campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Study Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) will be applied using a MagPro X100 (MagVenture,&#xD;
      Inc. Alpharetta, GA). The cTBS protocol consists of bursts of three pulses of 50 Hz&#xD;
      stimulation repeated at 200 ms intervals (5 times per second) for 40 seconds (for a total of&#xD;
      600 pulses). Stimulation will be applied at an intensity of 80% of active motor threshold&#xD;
      (AMT). Brainsight (Rogue Research) frameless neuronavigation system will be used to target&#xD;
      the specific structural MRI-defined region of stimulation.&#xD;
