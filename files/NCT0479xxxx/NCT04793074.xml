      The present randomized controlled study aims to evaluate the role of transforming&#xD;
      nanoparticle dressing n management of chronic venous ulcers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present randomized controlled study was conducted at Helwan University Hospitals, Cairo,&#xD;
      Egypt. The study protocol was approved by the local ethical committee and all patients gave&#xD;
      informed consent before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included 60 patients with CVU. Patients were diagnosed on the basis of clinical&#xD;
      findings and vascular Doppler ultrasonography. Exclusion criteria were associated infection&#xD;
      and associated ulcers of other etiologies. Patients randomization was achieved using computer&#xD;
      generated numbers and sealed envelope technique. Randomization and patients' allocation to&#xD;
      the study interventions was performed by an independent researcher who wasn't aware of the&#xD;
      study interventions and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon recruitment, patients were subjected to careful history taking, thorough clinical&#xD;
      examination, standard laboratory investigations and vascular ultrasound examination. The&#xD;
      recorded parameters included demographic data (age, sex and body mass index), associated&#xD;
      morbidities, duration and size of CVU and history of previous interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, patients in the treatment group (n=30) had transforming nanoparticle&#xD;
      dressing while the control group (n=30) received conventional compression dressing. Before&#xD;
      applications of both dressings, the wound area was thoroughly cleaned. In the treatment&#xD;
      group, the dressing powder was applied as a thin layer to the ulcer surface. Any excess&#xD;
      powder surrounding the ulcer area was removed. In both groups, a secondary protective gauze&#xD;
      dressing was applied. Patients were follow up at weekly intervals until complete healing&#xD;
      occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point in the present study is the time to complete healing. The secondary&#xD;
      end-point the rate of healing (percent of reduction in ulcer area).&#xD;
