  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a multicenter, 4-cohort, prospective, Phase II trial conducted in patients with&#xD;
      untreated resectable MSI/dMMR carcinomas or EBV+ gastric cancer and aiming to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and the efficacy of ICI (immune checkpoint inhibitor) as neoadjuvant treatment in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPi) will benefit to MSI/dMMR tumors from&#xD;
      the early stages, whatever their anatomical origin. We assume that this neoadjuvant treatment&#xD;
      would improve the response rate, providing even high rate of pathological complete responses&#xD;
      and prolong patients survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipated endometrial, colorectal and gastric cancers to be the most frequent recruited&#xD;
      and constructed our statistical hypothesis with results in those 3 cancers. However patients&#xD;
      with other localized MSI/dMMR tumors could be included.&#xD;

      TREATMENT PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative pembrolizumab will be administered intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes at the&#xD;
      dose of 400 mg according to recent summary of product characteristics (SPC). A single dose&#xD;
      will be administered 6 weeks before the planned surgery, as close as possible to inclusion,&#xD;
      and whenever possible during standard visit (surgery, anesthesia or other).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery will be performed during the 6th week after pembrolizumab injection, as per standard&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adjuvant treatment will be administered upon the Investigator decision, depending on the&#xD;
      results and tolerance of pre-operative treatment and ability of the patient to receive the&#xD;
      treatment regarding his general post-operative condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 120 patients will be enrolled in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was thus evaluated by analogy with an A'Hern's single stage phase II design with&#xD;
      P0=25%, P1=50% and 85% power, leading to the inclusion of a maximum of 30 patients by cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sequential Bayesian design will be used to allow continuous monitoring of the primary&#xD;
      endpoint and update knowledge gradually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each cohort, interim analyses are planned after 6-week follow up of the first 10 patients&#xD;
      (i.e. after surgery) and then every 10 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early stopping will be recommended if there is a high posterior probability (≥90%) given&#xD;
      observed data that the rate of pathological response is lower than 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ENTRY, DATA MANAGEMENT AND STUDY MONITORING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data concerning the patients will be recorded in the electronic case report form&#xD;
      (eCRF) throughout the study. Serious adverse event (SAE) and Adverse Event of Specific&#xD;
      Interest (AESI) reporting will be also paper-based by e-mail and/or Fax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will perform the study monitoring and will help the investigators to conduct the&#xD;
      study in compliance with the clinical trial protocol, Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and local&#xD;
      law requirements.&#xD;
