  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to adapt and pilot a trauma-informed combination intervention named&#xD;
      'Kickin' it with the Gurlz' that was designed with, for, and by transgender women of color to&#xD;
      improve HIV prevention continuum outcomes. The intervention components include a violence and&#xD;
      gender affirmation screening tool, a peer-led adaptation of Seeking Safety, and&#xD;
      individual-level peer navigation sessions. We will examine the feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      and preliminary promise of the multicomponent by conducting a one-arm pilot with 30&#xD;
      transgender women of color who have a history of trauma. Participants will complete baseline,&#xD;
      immediate post-intervention, and 3-month follow up assessments.&#xD;

      This project seeks to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the trauma-informed&#xD;
      combination prevention intervention to improve HIV prevention continuum outcomes including&#xD;
      the development of community-informed strategies for subsequent RCTs. We will conduct a&#xD;
      one-arm pilot of the adapted multicomponent trauma-informed intervention named &quot;Kickin it&#xD;
      with the Gurlz.&quot; We will collect feasibility and acceptability data related to identifying,&#xD;
      recruiting, enrolling, intervening with, and retaining participants (i.e. recruitment length,&#xD;
      screening procedures, feasibility of conducting sessions, intervention acceptability,&#xD;
      retention rates, feasibility of verifying self-reported and medical chart review data on PrEP&#xD;
      use, and exit interviews with participants and staff at program conclusion). We will recruit&#xD;
      30 participants into the pilot study. Participants will complete baseline, end of program,&#xD;
      and 3-month post-intervention follow-up surveys. Exit interviews and interviews with key&#xD;
      stakeholders will identify strategies for implementing trauma-informed HIV prevention&#xD;
      efficacy trials with transgender women of color within close-knit communities, such as&#xD;
      acceptable and feasible control conditions, acceptable and feasible violence and gender&#xD;
      affirmation screening, biomedical confirmation methods, contamination concerns, and potential&#xD;
      changes needed within existing health care systems.&#xD;

    <description>CR-HIV is a binary indicator of any HIV risk (e.g., yes=1 vs. no=0), which is an algorithm based on whether a participant reports condomless anal or vaginal sex with a HIV serodiscordant or status-unknown primary or other partner in the past 3 months. If the participant reports condomless sex with a serodiscordant or status-unknown primary or other partner, then the participant is coded as 1 if they are not adherent to PrEP and 0=if they are adherent to PrEP.</description>
