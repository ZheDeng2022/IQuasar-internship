  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MODULAR ATP Clinical Study is designed to demonstrate safety, performance, and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the Modular Cardiac Rhythm Management (mCRM) Therapy System.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MODULAR ATP Clinical Study will enroll subjects with a standard Implantable Cardioverter&#xD;
      Defibrillator (ICD) indication applying international practice guidelines, as well as those&#xD;
      who already have an implanted S-ICD System and satisfy the inclusion criteria for this study,&#xD;
      while not meeting any exclusion criteria. Subjects will be followed for at least 6 months&#xD;
      following mCRM Therapy System implantation.&#xD;

    <description>Communication Success between the S-ICD and EMPOWER PG&#xD;
