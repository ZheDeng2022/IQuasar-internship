  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vietnam is currently decentralizing its methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) dispensing&#xD;
      network to its local commune health centers (CHC), which provides a window of opportunity to&#xD;
      study decentralization of harm reduction and HIV-related healthcare services into&#xD;
      community-based healthcare settings. Commune health workers (CHW) in Vietnam have widespread&#xD;
      misconceptions about harm reduction and perceived significant challenges associated with&#xD;
      treating people who use drugs. Intervention effort is needed to address these issues to&#xD;
      ensure a smooth implementation of the decentralized service model. This study is to pilot&#xD;
      testing an intervention with a primary focus on process optimization in six CHC-based MMT&#xD;
      distribution sites with 30 CHW and 90 MMT patients. The six CHC in Thai Nguyen Province of&#xD;
      Vietnam will be randomized to either an intervention condition or a control condition. The&#xD;
      intervention will be executed through a combination of in-person training and mobile phone&#xD;
      application utilization. The intervention outcomes on CHW and MMT clients will be evaluated&#xD;
      at baseline, 3-, and 6-months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention pilot will be conducted in six commune health center (CHC)-based methadone&#xD;
      maintenance therapy (MMT) distribution sites in Thai Nguyen Province of Vietnam. Five commune&#xD;
      health workers (CHW) and 15 MMT clients will be recruited from each of the CHC (total n = 30&#xD;
      CHW and 90 MMT clients). The six CHC will be matched into pairs based on the current number&#xD;
      of CHW and MMT patient load; and within each pair, the two CHC will be randomized into either&#xD;
      a control condition or an intervention condition. The intervention contents will include the&#xD;
      promotion of streamlined procedure, skill training, problem solving, knowledge acquisition,&#xD;
      networking and support, and information sharing. The intervention will be delivered through a&#xD;
      combination of service provider in-person training and mobile phone application utilization.&#xD;
      Provider-level outcomes (e.g., CHW's MMT/HIV service provision) and client-level outcomes&#xD;
      (e.g., treatment progress) will be measured at baseline, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention CHW will participate in three 60-minute intervention weekly sessions. During the intervention, CHW will be provided with the knowledge and skills to serve their MMT patients. The intervention sessions will also focus on enhancing the current service decentralization workflow so that the CHW can work with both their peer providers and their patients more efficiently. Two-times booster sessions will be offered before the 3- and 6-month survey for continued skill building for problem-solving. In addition to the group sessions, the intervention arm CHW will be encouraged to use a specially designed online platform to review the current policy and scientific findings, review their patients' treatment status, communicate with other providers, and provide instant consulting to their MMT patients. The MMT patients in the intervention condition can use the online platform to communicate with their CHW and view education materials disseminated by their MMT providers or CHW.</description>
