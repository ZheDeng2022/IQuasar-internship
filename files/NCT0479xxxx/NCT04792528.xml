      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dementia is a debilitating and devastating disease impacting the individuals, their families,&#xD;
      and the health care system. According to the World Health Organization the dementia epidemic&#xD;
      could overwhelm the global health care system and undermine social and economic development.&#xD;
      Currently, no curative treatment for dementia exists despite immense research activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cognitive and functional impairment in dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD),&#xD;
      develop slowly decades before clinical signs emerge. This knowledge has led to the&#xD;
      recognition of a prodromal period of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), between normal&#xD;
      cognition and dementia. This is at present the earliest stage for intervention in dementia;&#xD;
      even a short delay in dementia progression will have a large impact on global economy and&#xD;
      health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical multicenter study, we aim to investigate the efficiency and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of working memory training in MCI. To identify high responders to training&#xD;
      analysis of genetic markers, relative's stress and craniospinal clearance will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a blinded, randomized and controlled trail that will include 213 participants,&#xD;
      diagnosed with MCI, included from five Norwegian Memory clinics in four health care regions.&#xD;
      The groups will be randomized to either two training periods, one training period or active&#xD;
      control. The intervention is computerized working memory training. Neuropsychological status,&#xD;
      activities of daily living (ADL), and relative stress and quality of life will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and 3, 6, 12 ,24 and 48 months after training. Structural MRI will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline, and 3 and 6 months after training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants in the REACT MCI glymphatics substudy craniospinal clearance will be&#xD;
      measured at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cost-utility analysis will be performed to evaluate if the working memory training is more&#xD;
      cost-effective compared to the active control group in the MCI phase, taking a societal&#xD;
      perspective.&#xD;
