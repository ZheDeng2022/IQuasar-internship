  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease will be treated with&#xD;
      vedolizumab according to their clinic's standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is to check for side effects from treatment with vedolizumab.&#xD;
      Another aim is to learn how many participants have improved symptoms after treatment with&#xD;
      vedolizumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, prospective, post-marketing study of participants with&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (UC or CD), who have had an inadequate response with, lost&#xD;
      response to, or were intolerant to conventional therapy or an TNF-alpha antagonist. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of vedolizumab in a routine clinical&#xD;
      practice setting under real world conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll approximately 600 participants. The data will be prospectively&#xD;
      collected, at the centers from routinely scheduled follow-up visits and recorded into&#xD;
      electronic case report forms (e-CRFs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in South Korea. The overall time for data&#xD;
      collection in the study will be approximately 6 years.&#xD;

    <description>Clinical response:reduction of Mayo score of&gt;=3points and&gt;=30% from baseline score, with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding sub-score &gt;=1 point/an absolute rectal bleeding sub-score of &lt;=1 point in UC participants; and reduction of CDAI score&gt;=70 points from baseline score in CD participants. Mayo score:instrument to measure disease activity of UC; consists of 4 variables: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, physician rating of disease activity, and endoscopic findings. Each graded from 0-3. Total score range of 0-12. Higher scores indicating more severity. CDAI assesses CD based on clinical signs/symptoms such as number of liquid stools, intensity of abdominal pain, general wellbeing(subjective),and presence of complications, use of antidiarrheal, presence of abdominal mass, physical examination and hematocrit(objective).CDAI score is equal to sum of weighted scores for subjective and objective items. Total score ranged from 0-600 points. Higher score indicating more severity.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission is defined as: the Mayo score less than or equal to (&lt;=2) and no individual sub-score greater than (&gt;) 1 point in the ulcerative colitis (UC) participants; and Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score less than (&lt;) 150 points in the Crohn's disease (CD) participants. Mayo score: instrument to measure disease activity of UC; consists of 4 variables: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, physician rating of disease activity, and endoscopic findings. Each graded from 0-3. Total score range of 0-12. Higher scores indicating more severity. CDAI assesses CD based on clinical signs/symptoms such as number of liquid stools, intensity of abdominal pain, general wellbeing (subjective), and presence of complications, use of antidiarrheal, presence of abdominal mass, physical examination and hematocrit (objective).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Mucosal Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Mucosal healing is defined as: the Mayo endoscopic sub-score of &lt;=1 point in the UC participants; and Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) score &lt;3.5 points in the CD participants. Mayo score: instrument to measure disease activity of UC; consists of 4 variables: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, physician rating of disease activity, and endoscopic findings. Each graded from 0-3. Total score range of 0-12. Higher scores indicating more severity. CDEIS is an index of determining the severity of CD. The CDEIC considers rectum, sigmoid and left colon, transverse colon, right colon, ileum in terms of: deep ulcerations, superficial ulcerations, surface involved by disease and ulcerated surface measured. The presence of ulcerate and non-ulcerated stenosis will be recorded in each segment. Scale ranges from 0-44 with a higher score indicating greater severity of disease.</description>
