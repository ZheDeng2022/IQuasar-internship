  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of&#xD;
      parsaclisib plus investigator's choice of either rituximab or obinutuzumab versus placebo&#xD;
      plus investigator's choice of rituximab or obinutuzumab for the treatment of participants&#xD;
      with R/R FL or MZL. The Participants will be stratified in a 1:1 randomization ratio by&#xD;
      investigator's choice of rituximab or obinutuzumab prior to randomization, time since last&#xD;
      antilymphoma therapy (â‰¤ 2, &gt; 2 years), and disease histology (MZL or FL) .&#xD;
