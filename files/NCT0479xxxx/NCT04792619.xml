  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a paucity of research on the correlation between postural control and upper&#xD;
      extremity function. Analyzing the mechanisms of postural deficits and related problems is&#xD;
      believed to give idea for any conceivable advance in future rehabilitation strategies in&#xD;
      patients with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of scapular exercises on the scapular&#xD;
      stability and trunk control. We hypothesized that scapular exercises correct the scapular&#xD;
      position and improve postural control. Hence the reaching out movement can be applied in a&#xD;
      controlled and fluent manner at the end of the treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The patients in both groups were treated with the exercise program according to the Bobath concept was planned taking the functional needs of the survivors into account, including stretching and facilitation of latissimus dorsi muscle, facilitation of abdominal muscles, placing exercises, training of lumbar spine stabilizers, functional reach of shoulder in different directions. Five sessions of about an hour each were provided to the patients</description>

    <intervention_name>Isometric scapular exercises</intervention_name>
    <description>Isometric scapular exercises were performed to the patients included to the study group in a sitting position and at 900 of the shoulder flexion and 900 of the shoulder abduction. The patients were exercised by a physiotherapist using isometric contraction in protraction and retraction by a physiotherapist. Isometric contractions lasted 5 seconds and each exercise was repeated 2x15 times. One minute rest period was given between sets</description>
