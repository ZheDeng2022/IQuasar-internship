  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic meseteric ischemia (CMI) is a disease characterized by an insufficient blood supply&#xD;
      to the intestines due to a narrowing (stenosis) of one or multiple intestinal arteries. The&#xD;
      primary symptom is abdominal pain especially during meal digestion. Currently the diagnosis&#xD;
      of CMI is heavily reliant on the exclusion of differential diagnoses. With this study we wish&#xD;
      to evaluate whether a newer CT technology called dual-energy CT (DECT) may be able to&#xD;
      visualize this altered blood flow during meal consumption.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CMI is a relatively rare condition mainly affecting elderly patients &gt;60 years old. CMI is&#xD;
      characterized by an insufficient blood supply to the intestines due to a narrowing (stenosis)&#xD;
      of one or multiple intestinal arteries. The main symptoms associated with CMI are abdominal&#xD;
      pain following mealtimes and weight loss. Diagnosis for CMI is difficult as &gt;10% of all&#xD;
      elderly patients have stenotic changes in their intestinal arteries, however only a fraction&#xD;
      of these patients are symptomatic. The diagnosis of CMI is therefore mainly based on the&#xD;
      clinical history and evaluation. The challenging diagnosis is most likely the main&#xD;
      contributing factor to why five to 19% of patients experience no symptomatic relief following&#xD;
      surgical treatment. The surgical treatment consists of either open surgical bypass or, more&#xD;
      commonly, endovascular stent placement, opening the stenotic artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endovascular stent placement for patients with symptomatic CMI is a common procedure at the&#xD;
      Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Department of Vascular Surgery, Rigshospitalet, with&#xD;
      approximately 60 patients undergoing the procedure annually. Patients undergo a preoperative&#xD;
      CT scan including a non-contrast and arterial phase scan to evaluate the abdominal arterial&#xD;
      vessels and the degree of stenosis, however the bowel wall is not routinely evaluated. This&#xD;
      is mainly due to the fact that mesenteric blood flow is adequate during times of fasting,&#xD;
      however insufficient blood flow may occur at times of peak demand i.e. during digestion of a&#xD;
      meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DECT has shown improved conspicuity for bowel ischemia using monoenergetic images and allows&#xD;
      for iodine selective maps which have been used in the evaluation of pulmonary emboli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there are no current studies that have investigated applications of DECT in&#xD;
      the evaluation of CMI. We intend to investigate whether it is possible to visualize bowel&#xD;
      hypoperfusion using DECT following administration of a standardized meal.&#xD;

    <description>CMI patients planned for endovascular stent placement will be contacted and informed about this study prior to their procedure. If they wish to take part in the study, then a date for a pre-operative DECT scan will be arranged. Before scanning the patient will be given a standardized calorie dense drink (Nutridrink). This will take place one week prior to their surgical procedure. Following the surgical procedure, the patient will undergo another DECT scan before discharge.</description>
