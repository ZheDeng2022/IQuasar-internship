  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to determine the effect of surgically repaired UCLP on dental&#xD;
      arch dimensions and the need for orthodontic intervention in comparison with other healthy&#xD;
      children , the presence of dental anomalies and the best possible standards of care among&#xD;
      this group of Egyptian children.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In arranging to distinguish and implement the best possible standards of care for UCLP&#xD;
      children by the pediatric dental practitioner, evaluation of early treatment results after&#xD;
      essential surgical repair of cleft lip and palate with respect to arch dimensions is&#xD;
      fundamental. Although the dental arch dimensions for these children have been evaluated in&#xD;
      previous studies , few examiners in Egypt handled this issue Due to racial contrasts in&#xD;
      improvement of the dental arch and growth .The deficiency of data in Egypt tending to this&#xD;
      insufficient assemble of children presents a gap that prevents the transport of fitting&#xD;
      dental care to them. This is considered objective to fulfill this gap by spotting the most&#xD;
      characteristics of dental arch dimensions in surgically repaired UCLP children and compares&#xD;
      them with those of sound, coordinating, non-cleft.&#xD;
