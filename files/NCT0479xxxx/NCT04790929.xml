      Interaxon markets a head-worn EEG biofeedback device ('Muse') to encourage and aid effective&#xD;
      meditation and sleep. This device has been previously shown to improve workplace wellness,&#xD;
      fatigue and quality of life, and performance on the Stroop Task. It has also been shown to&#xD;
      improve physiological markers associated with improved relaxation. What is not known, is&#xD;
      whether the use of the Muse devices can improve cognitive function. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine whether use of the Muse Meditation system by healthy participants,&#xD;
      leads to improvements in cognition, sleep quality, mindfulness, improvement in quality of&#xD;
      life scores, reduction in perceived stress levels, and improvement in cognitive markers&#xD;
      relevant for safety and increased success in the workplace.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Meditation is a non-invasive technique that has recently gained significant popularity for&#xD;
      its ability to effect positive change on the mind and body. Even a brief (4 sessions)&#xD;
      meditation training intervention has been shown to lead to improvements in various areas of&#xD;
      cognitive function [1], stress and anxiety, and it has been shown to improve sleep in older&#xD;
      adults better than a sleep hygiene course [2]. Mindfulness is now being extensively used in&#xD;
      the workplace to promote various aspects of workplace wellness [3], and workplace health and&#xD;
      safety [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interaxon markets a head-worn EEG biofeedback device ('Muse') to encourage and aid effective&#xD;
      meditation and sleep. This device has been previously shown to improve workplace wellness,&#xD;
      fatigue and quality of life, and performance on the Stroop Task. It has also been shown to&#xD;
      improve physiological markers associated with improved relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will examine whether use of the Muse Meditation system by&#xD;
      healthy participants, leads to improvements in cognition, sleep quality, mindfulness,&#xD;
      improvement in quality of life scores, reduction in perceived stress levels, and improvement&#xD;
      in cognitive markers relevant for safety and increased success in the workplace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      240 participants will be randomly divided into 3 groups with 80 participants in each group&#xD;
      (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will use the Muse Meditation system with no coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will use the Muse Meditation system with additional online coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 will be a control group and will not use any of the Muse Meditation systems&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1 of the Study, all participants will complete the Cambridge Brain Sciences online&#xD;
      cognitive assessment battery, plus a longer questionnaire about stress levels, workplace&#xD;
      wellness, quality of life, mindfulness and sleep quality. They will then begin the 6-week&#xD;
      study according to their following Group assignments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Regular Muse Meditation System - No Coaching:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will join a 1.5-hour virtual onboarding session where they will complete their&#xD;
      first Muse session. Participants will then be asked to use the Muse Meditation system for a&#xD;
      minimum of 5 minutes a day (in one or multiple sessions), a minimum of 5 days a week, for 6&#xD;
      weeks. If they wish to use the system more frequently within the 6 weeks, they will be&#xD;
      encouraged to do so and will be able to choose between all the styles of meditation available&#xD;
      in the Muse Meditation System (Mind, Heart, Breath, Body, Guided or Sleep Journeys). For any&#xD;
      challenges that arise, participants will have unlimited access to Muse Customer Care via&#xD;
      phone, email, and video where appropriate during normal business hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Regular Muse Meditation System - Additional Coaching The procedure will be identical&#xD;
      to Group 1 above, but in addition, all participants will be asked to join regular online&#xD;
      coaching sessions. Participants will be divided into 8 cohorts of 10 people per cohort. Each&#xD;
      cohort will be offered group coaching once per week. Coaches will be versed in Mindfulness&#xD;
      and how to use Muse. Coaching will take place virtually using Interaxon's Zoom account.&#xD;
      Throughout the coaching, all participants will be referred to via their first names or their&#xD;
      anonymized login names. In addition, for any challenges that arise, participants will have&#xD;
      unlimited access to Muse Customer Care via phone, email, and video where appropriate during&#xD;
      normal business hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: Controls The participants in the control group will receive a Muse Device, which&#xD;
      they will be free to keep at the end of the study. They will be asked not to open and/or use&#xD;
      the Muse device until the entire study is complete. On day 1 of the Study, they will complete&#xD;
      the Cambridge Brain Sciences online cognitive assessment battery, plus a longer questionnaire&#xD;
      about stress levels, workplace wellness, quality of life, mindfulness, anxiety and depression&#xD;
      and sleep quality. At the completion of the study controls will be offered optional, free&#xD;
      group coaching sessions if they complete the study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Week 6 (at the completion of the main study period), all participants will be&#xD;
      reassessed using the Cambridge Brain Sciences online cognitive assessment battery , and the&#xD;
      longer questionnaire about stress levels, workplace wellness, quality of life, mindfulness&#xD;
      and sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will also complete a brief debriefing questionnaire at the end of Week 6,&#xD;
      reporting their experiences about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will again be assessed using the Cambridge Brain Sciences online cognitive assessment&#xD;
      battery, and the longer questionnaire about stress levels, workplace wellness, quality of&#xD;
      life, mindfulness and sleep quality at the end of Week 12 (6 weeks after completing the main&#xD;
      study period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Using the Muse Meditation system for 6 weeks will yield improvements in&#xD;
      cognitive performance on the Cambridge Brain Sciences battery, improvements in self-reported&#xD;
      sleep quality (e.g. decreased latency to sleep, improved sleep duration), improvements on&#xD;
      measures of mindfulness, improvement in quality of life scores, reduction in perceived stress&#xD;
      levels, reduction in anxiety, and improvement in cognitive markers (derived from the&#xD;
      Cambridge Brain Sciences scores) relevant for safety and increased success in the workplace.&#xD;
      The investigators expect to see these changes in both experimental groups relative to the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: These changes will persist well beyond the period of the study and will be&#xD;
      detectible at the 12-week follow-up session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: The participants who use the Muse Meditation system and have additional&#xD;
      coaching (Group 2), will experience improvements in cognition, stress, anxiety, and other&#xD;
      quality of life measures over and above those experienced by those who use the Muse&#xD;
      Meditation system with no coaching (Group 1).&#xD;
