  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Occurrence of acute right heart failure (ARHF) remains common during pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      (PH). Right atrial pressure (RAP) invasive measurement is the gold standard to diagnose ARHF&#xD;
      in order to improve diuretic treatment management. Existence of indirect signs of ARHF on&#xD;
      venous Doppler ultrasound waveform has long been described, but correlation with RAP has not&#xD;
      been properly established yet. It is the aim of our study in order to obtain an additional&#xD;
      tool to manage ARHF.&#xD;

    <description>Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios of venous modulation index*, measured by Pulsed Doppler on common femoral veins, as a diagnostic criterion for ARHF (defined by RAP ≥10 mm Hg).&#xD;
* Defined as the sum of the differences in the amplitudes of venous flow velocities over a period of 2 to 3 seconds, weighted by the maximum velocity.</description>

    <description>Patients undergoing a right heart catheterization for PH diagnosis or annual follow-up in the cardiological unit of the university hospital of Poitiers will be included. A venous Doppler ultrasound will be performed by a vascular physician, with experience in vascular ultrasound imaging, within 4 hours before the right heart catheterization. Morphological parameters of vena cava, and velocimetric parameters of femoral, jugular and supra-hepatic veins will be assessed in order to study their correlation with right auricular pressure value.</description>
