      This is an open-label, non-randomized, proof-of-concept comparison of clinical vs. research&#xD;
      stimulation patterns in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) being treated with Deep Brain&#xD;
      Stimulation (DBS) through the Medtronic Percept PC DBS device. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that stimulation patterns designed to better target excessive synchrony in a patient-tailored&#xD;
      manner may result in more efficient and effective therapy with fewer side effects. Medtronic&#xD;
      3rd-generation sensing implantable neural stimulator, Percept PC, is FDA-approved for&#xD;
      treating PD. The Percept PC device features BrainSense, the first and only available sensing&#xD;
      technology for deep brain stimulation. BrainSense technology allows the device to capture and&#xD;
      record brain signals (local field potentials, or LFP) using the brain-implanted DBS lead,&#xD;
      while simultaneously delivering therapeutic stimulation. Investigators plan to enroll and&#xD;
      complete investigations in 15 study subjects total, who have been previously implanted with&#xD;
      the Medtronic Percept PC for the treatment of PD, and who are optimized for clinical&#xD;
      stimulation and anti-Parkinsons medication. Investigations will be performed in UNMC Movement&#xD;
      Disorders Clinic, UNMC Neurosurgery Lab, and UNO Biomechanics Research Building, Gait Lab.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive research stimulation patterns and the effect on PD motor symptoms will&#xD;
      be assessed via Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-part III and gait measures.&#xD;
      Videotaping of patient UPDRS-III testing and gait will be obtained.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by both motor and&#xD;
      non-motor symptoms. Motor symptoms of PD include the clinical triad of tremor, rigidity, and&#xD;
      bradykinesia, and typically lead to the initial diagnosis. While there is yet no cure for PD,&#xD;
      medical and surgical therapies have been developed that effectively target the motor symptoms&#xD;
      of PD. Patients with PD who demonstrate significant motor fluctuations and dyskinesia are&#xD;
      considered for subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. Therapeutic&#xD;
      DBS leads to a reduction in pathological neuronal synchronization seen in PD. While&#xD;
      continuous high-frequency stimulation is effective for ameliorating motor symptoms, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that different stimulation patterns which are designed to better&#xD;
      target excessive synchrony in a patient-tailored manner, may result in more efficient and&#xD;
      effective therapy with fewer side effects. This overarching hypothesis is supported by prior&#xD;
      foundational preclinical and clinical research. Medtronic has developed proprietary&#xD;
      technology that allows implantable neural stimulators (INS) to deliver both standard clinical&#xD;
      electrical stimulation therapy and to record bioelectric data (i.e. local field potentials;&#xD;
      LFPs) through DBS leads implanted in the brain. Medtronic's 3rd-generation sensing DBS INS,&#xD;
      Percept PC, is FDA-approved for treating PD and can be used to explore unique biomarkers of&#xD;
      brain state changes associated with activities of daily living and disease symptomatic&#xD;
      states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will use Percept PC INS latent capabilities to deliver research stimulation.&#xD;
      Importantly, all stimulation in this research project will be delivered using charge-balanced&#xD;
      pulses, in compliance with all FDA safety guidelines including frequency (≤ 250 Hz) and&#xD;
      charge density (30 µC/cm2/phase). At the conclusion of the research study, standard clinical&#xD;
      stimulation will be re-activated.&#xD;
