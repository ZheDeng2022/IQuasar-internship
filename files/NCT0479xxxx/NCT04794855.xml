  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is the main cause of increased maternal and perinatal mortality during&#xD;
      pregnancy. Preeclampsia is mainly manifested as hypertension, urine protein, or damage&#xD;
      symptoms of other target organs after 20 weeks of pregnancy. In preeclampsia high-risk group,&#xD;
      early intervention and prevention of aspirin treatment can reduce preeclampsia or reduce its&#xD;
      complications. Some serological biomarkers, such as placental protein 13 and placental growth&#xD;
      factor, are closely related to preeclampsia. The clinical manifestations of preeclampsia are&#xD;
      diverse, and the biomarkers distribution of early and late preeclampsia is also different.&#xD;
      Multivariate models will be the trend for the prediction of risk of preeclampsia. The deep&#xD;
      learning model can train the algorithm layer by layer by unsupervised learning method, and&#xD;
      then use the supervised back propagation algorithm for tuning. It has strong capability and&#xD;
      flexibility, and has been successfully applied in medical fields, such as the diagnosis of&#xD;
      skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, maternal clinical data, routine laboratory indicators and biological markers&#xD;
      in early pregnancy will be combined, and a deep learning method based on multiple models will&#xD;
      be adopted to establish a risk prediction model for early preeclampsia, so as to improve the&#xD;
      clinical ability for early diagnosis of preeclampsia. The deep learning method reduces the&#xD;
      number of parameters by using spatial relative relation, which can improve the prediction&#xD;
      ability of the model. Multi-model method is a less commonly used modeling method, and the&#xD;
      models established by this method generally have better stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project combines the above two methods to establish a risk prediction model for&#xD;
      preeclampsia, and the research is of great significance.&#xD;

      Research objects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study. About 2000 pregnant women who will take regular prenatal&#xD;
      examination in the Department of Obstetrics, Peking University Third Hospital. During 6-8&#xD;
      weeks of gestation, routine laboratory tests, such as liver function, were required before&#xD;
      the establishment of obstetric records. The remain serum from routine laboratory tests will&#xD;
      be collected and frozen at -80℃ for detection of biological markers after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some routine laboratory tests will be carried out with the prenatal examination at 16-18&#xD;
      GWs、26-28 GWs、30-34GWs. The remain serum of the participants will be collected if the routine&#xD;
      tests were done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will not draw extra blood samples from the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Check the patient information and gestational age carefully to obtain the correct cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The samples of hemolysis, lipid turbidity and jaundice should be eliminated to prevent&#xD;
           interference with the experimental results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The serum was placed in a cryopreservation tube and immediately stored at -70℃.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Calibration and quality control should be carried out for each batch of testing. Record&#xD;
           the results of quality control and start testing after control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data dictionary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) General information of the research object: Data on risk factors for preeclampsia were&#xD;
      collected at 6-8 weeks of gestation, including age, primipara or pluripara, multiple births,&#xD;
      prepregnancy body mass index, preeclampsia history, basal systolic blood pressure, basal&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure, hypertension history, renal history, diabetes history, autoimmune&#xD;
      history, etc. The above records will be obtained from the medical records system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3) Test results of routine laboratory tests: Laboratory test results, such as total&#xD;
      cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterol and lipoprotein a and C reactive protein, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate&#xD;
      aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, urea, uric acid, creatinine and cystatine C,&#xD;
      D-dimer, neutrophils and lymphocytes ratio, platelet and lymphocyte ratio and so on, the&#xD;
      above test results can query from the electronic medical record system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (4) Biological markers detection: After delivery, the biomarkers will be tested with the 6-8&#xD;
      GWs samples of the 2000 participants, such as the complement factor B, complement factor H,&#xD;
      C3, complement C4, matrix metalloproteinases 7, placenta protein 13, soluble vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor receptor 1, placental growth factor, fibronectin, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (5) Establishment of database: To input the above original data into the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: About 100 to 160 preeclampsia patients will be collected out of the 2000&#xD;
      participants accoeding to the he incidence of preeclampsia which is 3% to 8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The missing data will be reported as missing, unavailable, non-reported, uninterpretable, or&#xD;
      considered missing because of data inconsistency or out-of-range results according to actual&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using univariate logistic regression model, maternal clinical data, routine laboratory&#xD;
      tests and biological markers in early pregnancy were divided into two categories: &quot;important&#xD;
      indicators&quot; and &quot;general indicators&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data set was divided into a training set and a test set in a 3:1 ratio for the training&#xD;
      and testing of preeclampsia risk prediction model, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of pregnant women without preeclampsia in the training set were evenly divided into&#xD;
      three subsets A, B and C, and the sample set of preeclampsia patients in the training set was&#xD;
      called set D.Build A deep learning model with two sets A and D, build A deep learning model&#xD;
      with two sets B and D, and build A deep learning model with two sets C and D.These three&#xD;
      models are successively referred to as Model 1, Model 2 and Model 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model test method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substituting the data of each sample in the test set into the above three deep learning&#xD;
      models, the three output values of each sample are obtained, and then the prediction of the&#xD;
      type of each sample is obtained based on the average value of the three numbers. Then the&#xD;
      prediction results are compared with the sample labels to evaluate the model.&#xD;
