    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, dose-escalating&#xD;
      study to characterize the safety (including the anti-drug antibodies(ADA)), tolerability&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic parameters（PD）of TG103. The study will consist of 3&#xD;
      periods: an approximately 2-week lead-in period, followed by a 12-week treatment period, and&#xD;
      a 3-week safety follow-up period. Three dose groups (7.5mg, 15mg and 22.5mg) of subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled and dosed sequentially; 12&#xD;
