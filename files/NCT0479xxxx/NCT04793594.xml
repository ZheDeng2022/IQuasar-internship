      The aim of this study is to compare the feasibility levels and advantages of balance tests&#xD;
      applied with tele-assessment methods to clinical application methods in stroke patients and&#xD;
      to reveal their effectiveness. Stroke patients who are referred to İstinye University&#xD;
      Bahçeşehir Liv Hospital Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Unit at March-September for&#xD;
      physiotherapy and meet the inclusion criteria will be included in the study. The Patient&#xD;
      Assessment Form which were prepared by the researcher and the Standardized Mini Mental Test,&#xD;
      The Rankin Scale, Timed Get Up and Go Test, Berg Balance Scale, Tinetti Balance and Gait Test&#xD;
      in order to evaluate the balance and walking of the participants due to stroke and to compare&#xD;
      the applicability level of the tests applied with the tele- assessment method and tests will&#xD;
      be completed by individuals who agreed to participate in the study and / or the researchers&#xD;
      who carried out the study.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Berg Balance Test is consisting of 14 items and measures the ability of individuals to maintain balance while performing functional tasks. Each task is scored from 0 (cannot perform independently) to 4 (stated best performance). 0-20 points are interpreted as high risk of falling, between 21-40 points as medium risk of falling, and between 41-56 points as low risk. The validity and reliability study of the Turkish version in stroke patients was performed by Şahin et al.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tinetti Balance And Gait Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tinetti Balance And Gait Scale is a total of 28 points, with a maximum of 16 and a walking score of 12 points. Those who score 26 and below are thought to have problems; It is observed that the risk of self-falling is five times higher in those who score 19 and below compared to normal individuals (17). Its adaptation to Turkish, validity and reliability study was carried out by Ağırcan in 2009.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up And Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Timed Up And Go Test is a simply and widely used and rapid test for assessing mobility and dinamic balance. The person is asked to stand up from the chair, walk 3 meters safely and at a normal pace, turn around, walk back, sit back on the chair, and the time is recorded in seconds (sec). The test is started with the patient's feet flat on the floor and arms resting on the armrest of the chair, and is performed in three repetitions and the best result is recorded. Walking longer than 12 seconds indicates a risk of falling.</description>
