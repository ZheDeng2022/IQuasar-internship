      A pooled analysis of three bioequivalence studies conducted for Fluticasone propionate 250&#xD;
      mcg and salmeterol xinafoate 50 mcg inhalation powder/Respirent Pharmaceuticals (Test, T) vs&#xD;
      ADVAIR DISKUS® 250/50 mcg inhalation powder/GSK (Reference, R) were conduted.&#xD;

      Data from three Bioequivalence studies with study codes: BECRO/RESP/BREATH-BE250-PIVOTAL&#xD;
      (BE250-PIVOTAL), BECRO/RESP/BREATH-BE250-PILOT (BE250-PILOT) and BECRO/RESP/BREATH-PK250&#xD;
      (PK250) were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pooled analysis of all three studies was conducted, including all eighty-two (82) subjects&#xD;
      of the three studies. Then, a pooled analysis of the BE250-PIVOTAL and the respective Pilot&#xD;
      study (BE250-PILOT) was also conducted since these two studies used products of the same&#xD;
      batch, including forty-eight (48) subjects.&#xD;
