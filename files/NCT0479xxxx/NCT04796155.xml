  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determination of fetal head position during labour is highly subjective and depends on&#xD;
      clinician's experience in vaginal digital examination. Monitoring the progress of labour with&#xD;
      intrapartum ultrasound (IU) exhibits higher accuracy rates. However, the dynamic process of&#xD;
      labour needs very frequent sonographic examination and that may decrease the feasibility.&#xD;
      Consultation to IU at certain time points can positively limit the need for ultrasound,&#xD;
      increase the effectiveness of IU and allow for safer labour in consistency with traditional&#xD;
      labour management. This study aims to investigate the use of IU in cases with suspected and&#xD;
      diagnosed labour arrest in both the first and second stage of labour.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low-risk pregnant women with singleton, vertex fetus who are at their 36th gestational weeks&#xD;
      and above with suspected first and second stages of labour arrest will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      study. Intrapartum ultrasound with transperineal and transabdominal approach will be&#xD;
      performed at two specific time points; 1) Suspicion of labour arrest, 2) Diagnosis of labour&#xD;
      arrest. The fetal head position, station, direction, progression and the structure of pubic&#xD;
      arch will be evaluated with IU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ultrasound examinations will be monitored and recorded to the memory storage of&#xD;
      ultrasound device. Recorded ultrasound examinations will be reviewed and measurements will be&#xD;
      performed at the end of the study period by two experienced clinicians who are not involved&#xD;
      in the examinations. These two blinded clinicians are not aware of labor outcomes, delivery&#xD;
      types, maternal and neonatal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General terms are defined according to the NICE guidelines. Those are; the first stage of&#xD;
      labour is established when there are regular painful contractions and there is progressive&#xD;
      cervical dilatation from 4 cm. If delay in the established first stage is suspected, all&#xD;
      aspects of progress in labour are assessed when diagnosing delay, including; cervical&#xD;
      dilatation of less than 2 cm in 4 hours for first labours, cervical dilatation of less than 2&#xD;
      cm in 4 hours, or a slowing in the progress of labour for second or subsequent labours,&#xD;
      descent, and rotation of the baby's head, changes in the strength, duration and frequency of&#xD;
      uterine contractions. Amniotomy is offered to a woman with suspected delay in the established&#xD;
      first stage of labour and women are advised to have a vaginal examination 2 hours later, and&#xD;
      diagnose delay if progress is less than 1 cm. If oxytocin is used due to insufficient uterine&#xD;
      contractions delay is diagnosed as progress is less than 2 cm within 4 hours. With regard to&#xD;
      the second stage of labour, for a nulliparous woman; birth would be expected to take place&#xD;
      within 3 hours of the start of the active second stage in most women. The delay is diagnosed&#xD;
      in the active second stage when it has lasted 2 hours and suspected delay if progress (in&#xD;
      terms of rotation and/or descent of the presenting part) is inadequate after 1 hour of the&#xD;
      active second stage. For a multiparous woman: birth would be expected to take place within 2&#xD;
      hours of the start of the active second stage in most women. The delay in the active second&#xD;
      stage is diagnosed when it has lasted 1 hour for multiparous women and suspected delay if&#xD;
      progress (in terms of rotation and/or descent of the presenting part) is inadequate after 30&#xD;
      minutes of the active second stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) practical&#xD;
      guidelines on intrapartum ultrasound recommend the evaluation of head position and descent&#xD;
      during the active phase of labour when labor progress is slow and when operative delivery is&#xD;
      considered. The use of IU is not meant to change the classic algorithm of labour monitoring&#xD;
      but to provide objective and reliable evaluations of the traditional parameters of crucial&#xD;
      importance when prolonged or arrested labour is suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of IU in prolonged labour with optimizing the&#xD;
      timing of IU.&#xD;
