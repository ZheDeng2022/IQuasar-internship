  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center, clinical trial in which 128&#xD;
      participants diagnosed with PTPNP will be randomized 1:1 into one of two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CMM plus Axon Therapy (n=64)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CMM alone (n=64)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be consented, screened, and undergo a 7-day baseline assessment to measure&#xD;
      pain scores and assess diary compliance. Participants meeting inclusion criteria will undergo&#xD;
      an in-clinic baseline evaluation, receive randomization assignment, and start their&#xD;
      respective treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will return to the clinic for assessment at Day 30 (± 14 days), Day 90 (± 14&#xD;
      days), Day 180 (± 30 days) and Day 365 (± 30 days). Participants randomized to the CMM plus&#xD;
      Axon Therapy group will return to the clinic for Axon Therapy treatments as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Month 1: 6 treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  WEEK 1: 3 treatments (consecutive treatments are best)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  WEEK 2-4: Weekly treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Month 2: Bi-monthly treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Months 3-12: Treatments every 2-4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to in-clinic assessments and treatments, all participants will a receive weekly&#xD;
      phone follow-up to assess pain intensity and occurrence of adverse events after treatment&#xD;
      starts. Weekly phone follow-ups will only occur during weeks when the participant is not in&#xD;
      clinic for treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Mean/percent change in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) worst pain (NRS) score (Q3) at Day 90 and 365&#xD;
The Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) is a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions during the 24-hour period prior to evaluation. The BPI-SF consists of 5 questions. Four items measure pain on 11-point response scales from 0 to 10 (&quot;No Pain&quot; to &quot;Pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. Another item, containing 7 sub-questions, evaluates the level of pain interference with daily functioning on 11-point response scales from 0 to 10 (&quot;Does not interfere&quot; to &quot;Completely interferes&quot;). BPI-pain interference is typically scored as the mean of the seven interference items. This mean can be used if more than 50%, or four of seven, of the total items have been completed on a given administration. For the purposes of this study question 2 (pain areas) and 7 will not be captured (treatments or medications for pain).</description>

    <description>Mean/percent change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores (diary) for primary area of pain at Day 30, 90, 180, 365&#xD;
The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a subjective measure of pain. It consists of a 10 cm line with two endpoints representing &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;. Subjects are asked to rate their pain by placing a mark on the line corresponding to their level of pain. The distance along the line from the &quot;no pain&quot; end to the subject's mark is measured. The VAS will be completed for the subjects' study indication pain for which the SCS system is treating. The VAS assessment of pain is a validated measure, and a 50% reduction from baseline is clinically accepted as a subject success.</description>

    <description>Mean/percent change in Pain Disability Index (PDI) scores at Day 365&#xD;
The PDI is a short, self-report instrument for measuring the degree of interference with normal role functioning caused by chronic pain. The form uses a 10-point scale ranging from 0 (no disability) to 10 (total disability) to rate pain-related interference in the following categories: family/home responsibilities, recreation, social activity, occupation, sexual behavior, self-care, and life-support activity. The total scores range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 70, where a higher score indicates higher pain-related interference. The PDI consists of 2 subscales: 1 measuring voluntary activities and 1 measuring obligatory activities. MCIC of the PDI was 9.5 points for GPE &quot;complaints&quot; and 8.5 for GPE &quot;self-care.&quot; In patients with CBP, change can be considered clinically important when PDI score has decreased 8.5 to 9.5 points.</description>

             participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with&#xD;
             compliance or the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator would make the subject inappropriate to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects with a current diagnosis of DSM-IV-TR Axis I disorder (including, for&#xD;
