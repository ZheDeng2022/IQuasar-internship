      The Epios early feasibility study aims to explore the uses of novel sub-scalp lead devices in&#xD;
      the detection of epileptic seizures. Epios leads are inserted subcutaneously through&#xD;
      dedicated tunneling toolkits and have been designed for continuous EEG recording in&#xD;
      inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical investigation is part of a stepwise program to validate the entire Epios system&#xD;
      and it starts with the validation of the Epios leads alone in this two steps study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the state of the art, epilepsy is defined as the spontaneous recurrence of&#xD;
      seizures at random intervals. When epilepsy is drug refractory, management plans rely&#xD;
      entirely on seizure self-reporting. However, it is now established that self-reports of&#xD;
      seizure burdens are inaccurate. The reasons for this are multiple, but important ones include&#xD;
      the fact that seizures can affect brain regions involved in awareness and memory, and that&#xD;
      epilepsy patient can also have persistent cognitive deficits, so they do not recall having a&#xD;
      seizure. EEG caps are the standard tool for monitoring brain waves, but this technology is&#xD;
      typically used for less than an hour and rarely can be managed for a period of a week or so&#xD;
      because of the need for continual technical interventions, like reapplying electrodes to the&#xD;
      skin. Thus, there is no way to fill the gap in the ability to obtain monitoring of EEG for&#xD;
      weeks, months or longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the unmet need for the objective monitoring of epileptic seizures in ambulatory&#xD;
      patients, innovative solutions are under development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Epios device under investigation in this study consists in novel sub-scalp leads&#xD;
      implanted between the scalp and the skull through an insertion tunneling toolkit for EEG&#xD;
      monitoring in short-term conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical investigation is part of a stepwise program to validate the entire Epios system&#xD;
      and it starts with the validation of the Epios leads alone in step 1 and step 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1 is an intra-operative step only, where a 10-minute long EEG recording is performed&#xD;
      using the Epios leads, after the patient has undergone general anesthesia for his/her&#xD;
      clinically-indicated brain surgery. The study material is removed before skin closure and end&#xD;
      of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2 is an inpatient, short-term step, where, following clinically-indicated surgery for&#xD;
      brain electrode implantation, the participants will stay in a continuous care unit. Clinical&#xD;
      care and study recordings (with Epios subscalp leads) will be carried out in parallel. The&#xD;
      Epios leads will remain implanted for the same length of time as the clinical electrodes:&#xD;
      clinical EEG workups in epilepsy last one week at the clinical trial hospital, rarely two&#xD;
      weeks, virtually never longer. In adherence to this approach, the implantation period of the&#xD;
      investigational electrode in step 2 will be less than twenty one days (&lt; 21 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steps 1 and 2 will take 12 to 18 months in total. First participant-In is planned in January&#xD;
      2021 for step 1 and last participant-In is planned in July 2022.&#xD;
