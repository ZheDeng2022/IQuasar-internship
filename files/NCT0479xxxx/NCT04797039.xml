  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to collect data about the MRI cryoablation procedure your&#xD;
      doctor(s) would normally perform in order to treat the participants focal prostate cancer and&#xD;
      to evaluate the participants condition after the participants treatment is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have been asked to take part in this research because the participants have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with prostate cancer and scheduled to have an ablation procedure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate MR-guided cryoablation of biopsy proven prostate&#xD;
      tumors using the Galil MRI-compatible cryoablation system. The system has been approved by&#xD;
      the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for soft tissue ablation and has been&#xD;
      utilized successfully at Mayo. All procedures will be performed according to approved&#xD;
      indications. the investigators wish to monitor the technique and collect data at the&#xD;
      participants follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study only collects data about the MRI-guided cryoablation procedure the participants&#xD;
      doctor(s) would normally perform in order to treat the participants focal prostate cancer and&#xD;
      to evaluate the participants condition after there treatment is performed. The participants&#xD;
      doctor will advise the participants when the participants should return for follow-up visits.&#xD;
      These visits will be according to the participants doctor's standard of care; usually return&#xD;
      visits are at 3-6months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months and 60 months after the&#xD;
      procedure, although the participants doctor may ask that the participants return for more&#xD;
      frequent visits.&#xD;
