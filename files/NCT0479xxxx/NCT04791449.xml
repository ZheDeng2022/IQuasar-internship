      The overarching purpose of this study is to investigate the impact that exercise, as&#xD;
      delivered through a medically supervised, outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program, has on&#xD;
      the wound healing process in Type 2 diabetics having foot ulcers classified as being Wound,&#xD;
      Ischemia, foot Infection (WIfI) stage 2 or lower. The criterion reference measure of diabetic&#xD;
      foot ulcer wound healing is be the time required to reach the maturation phase of the wound&#xD;
      healing cascade (wound closure without drainage).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study uses a two-group repeated measures design. Sixty volunteers will be recruited&#xD;
      through the University of New Mexico (UNM) Center for Healing in the Lower Extremity (CHILE)&#xD;
      clinic. A letter explaining the study will be placed in the file of all diabetic foot ulcer&#xD;
      (DFU) clients of CHILE clinic. There is section to be completed by interested clientele&#xD;
      (RSVP) and placed it in labelled box in the clinic office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research team member collects box contents (M-F) and contacts all respondents using the&#xD;
      preferred method provided on the RSVP to conduct an initial screening of inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and review study requirements. Those not qualifying for the study or uninterested&#xD;
      will be thanked for their initial interest. If the respondent is a viable prospect for&#xD;
      inclusion, the electronic medical record will be reviewed by the authorized research team&#xD;
      member to verify inclusion criteria are satisfied and no exclusion criteria are present. An&#xD;
      initial study-related appointment coinciding with their next scheduled wound care appointment&#xD;
      at the CHILE clinic will be set for eligible prospects. After screening into the study, the&#xD;
      prospects will be randomly assigned to a group via an online randomizer. Group 1 (Treatment&#xD;
      as Usual, TAU) participants receive the regularly scheduled standard wound care. Group 2&#xD;
      (Treatment as Usual plus Exercise, TAU-EX) receives the regularly scheduled standard wound&#xD;
      care and is assigned to the 12 -week medically supervised exercise program. Body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI), HbA1c, weight (wearing similar clothes at each weigh in), and vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor (VEGF) levels will be measured at baseline and then again at 4, 8 and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Informed Consent will be provided for the prospect's review; questions asked of the&#xD;
      research team member are encouraged. The 50:50 likelihood of being randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      of two groups (TAU or TAU-EX) will be explained. All participants will receive their&#xD;
      regularly scheduled standard wound care (per CHILE Clinic procedures) 2-3 times a week for 12&#xD;
      weeks or until the wound healed if less than 12 weeks. Expectations of group assignment and&#xD;
      incentivizing prospects for their time will be discussed fully. If the prospect wants to&#xD;
      continue with the study, the Informed Consent will be signed. If the prospect does not want&#xD;
      to continue, they will be thanked for their time plus encouraged to continue with their&#xD;
      scheduled wound care appointments and follow their wound care professional's recommendations.&#xD;
      A Spanish interpreter, in person or via phone, will be used for all subjects who are not&#xD;
      fluent in English. Official Spanish language versions of the Consent Form and study&#xD;
      questionnaires will be available as well. Regardless of group assignment, the participant&#xD;
      will be reminded to continue with their normally scheduled wound care appointments and to&#xD;
      follow their wound care professional's recommendations. All participants will also be&#xD;
      encouraged to maintain their normal daily activities unless contraindicated by their wound&#xD;
      care provider. A typical wound care appointment consists of the CHILE clinic wound care&#xD;
      technician removing the dressing. A wound care provider evaluates the drainage and the wound.&#xD;
      It is then cleaned with Vashe (Steadme Medical, Fort Worth, TX). The periwound is cleaned&#xD;
      with Hibiclens (Molnlycke Health Care, Brooklyn, NY). If debridement is necessary, it is&#xD;
      performed by the wound care provider as appropriate for the tissue type and location.&#xD;
      Measurement of the wound will be done weekly by the wound care provider using one of two&#xD;
      accepted wound measurement methods - clock method or modified clock method. Deviations from&#xD;
      the 12:00 - 6:00 numbering scheme are documented for length (i.e 2:00 - 8:00) and width at&#xD;
      the widest perpendicular (i.e. 10:00 - 5:00) point to the line of length. Wound depth will be&#xD;
      measured at the deepest section and any undermining or tunneling will be referred to by the&#xD;
      clock measures. New dressings will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After giving written consent, the TAU-EX participant will be scheduled for an initial intake&#xD;
      session at the UNM Cardiac Rehabilitation facility (ground floor of UNM hospital, UNMH) to&#xD;
      review risk factors, current exercise habits, exercise session expectations and undergo a&#xD;
      program orientation. They will sign a second consent form, be given a tour of the facility&#xD;
      and familiarized with the exercise equipment. They will be reminded that they will be&#xD;
      exercising along with cardiac rehabilitation clients in 2 to 3 exercise sessions per week;&#xD;
      the sessions will ideally coincide with the TAU-EX participant's normally scheduled wound&#xD;
      care appointments. An appointment will be scheduled so the Cardiac Rehabilitation staff can&#xD;
      conduct a maximal exercise capacity test per the facility's standard procedure (note:&#xD;
      arm-ergometry will be used); the heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), rating of perceived&#xD;
      exertion (RPE), arm cranking cadence and intensity will be converted to MET (metabolic&#xD;
      equivalent of task) level(s) with peak MET (MET peak) being the basis for each individualized&#xD;
      exercise prescription. Systematic program progression is supervised by the cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation program staff. Exercise program adjustments to intensity, duration, and&#xD;
      modality will be made each session as appropriate and as tolerated by the participant.&#xD;
      Exercise-related variables (i.e. intensity, duration, and modality) will be recorded each&#xD;
      session. HR and oxygen saturation (O2 sat) will be recorded pre-, during and post exercise.&#xD;
      Blood pressure and non-fasting blood glucose will be recorded pre- and post-exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first exercise session begins with a pre-participation non-fasting blood glucose finger&#xD;
      stick, resting HR and BP assessments, a brief (e.g. 5-minute) warm-up on an arm ergometer,&#xD;
      and a consult regarding session goals. The exercise physiologist will encourage the&#xD;
      participant to exercise in timed bouts at the combination of cadence and resistance&#xD;
      equivalent to 50% of MET peak. Each bout is followed by a recovery period (low speed cadence,&#xD;
      very light resistance) until HR approaches the pre-exercise level. This is followed by&#xD;
      iterations of exertion and active recovery until 20-30 minutes have passed. Following the&#xD;
      last bout's active recovery period and seated rest for hemodynamic assessment, the exercise&#xD;
      physiologist records all session data, comments, observations, and reviews the session with&#xD;
      the participant before scheduling the next exercise session. All subsequent exercise sessions&#xD;
      begin with a pre-participation finger stick (blood glucose target range is 100-250 mg/dL),&#xD;
      resting hemodynamic assessment, brief warm-up, and consult. Together the exercise&#xD;
      physiologist and participant set new goals for the day's session (i.e. increase cadence by 10&#xD;
      rpm at same resistance, exercise at the RPE associated with a slightly higher intensity, add&#xD;
      20 seconds to the exercise bout for the session, etc.). The participant's physiological&#xD;
      responses are monitored to ensure safety and recorded for use in upcoming sessions. Exercise&#xD;
      prescriptions will be progressed based on individual tolerance, adaptation, and motivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard wound care appointments consist of removal of wound dressing, evaluation of wound&#xD;
      (e.g. drainage, tissue status), wound cleaning, debridement as necessary, measurement,&#xD;
      redressing, and offloading (e.g. total contact casting), as applicable. Over the 12-wk&#xD;
      intervention period, all participants will be instructed to continue their normal daily&#xD;
      routines and adherence to the podiatrist's recommendations. The blood glucose range of&#xD;
      100-250 mg/dL is the acceptable range for the participant to be able to begin the day's&#xD;
      exercise program. If the glucose is above or below that range and the participant is&#xD;
      symptomatic, the clinic staff will contact the designated research team member who will&#xD;
      contact the participant's primary care provider and either refer them to their services or&#xD;
      direct the staff to take them to the UNM Urgent Care Clinic. If the participant is&#xD;
      asymptomic, the clinic staff will contact the designated research team member and she will&#xD;
      discuss the options with the participant regarding going home and re-adjusting meals,&#xD;
      medication, or whatever seemed to be the problem and have the participant return to exercise&#xD;
      in 1-2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers may withhold participation or withdraw from the study at any time without impact&#xD;
      on their DFU wound care at the CHILE clinic; coverage of TAU-EX exercise sessions will cease.&#xD;
      Participants may be withdrawn from the study by research team members if instructions are&#xD;
      repeatedly ignored or the participant is deemed at risk for harming themselves if they&#xD;
      continue. Upon withdrawal from the study, any hard copy information will be placed in a&#xD;
      locked medical records bin that is destroyed in accordance with UNM hospital regulations for&#xD;
      destroying all patient information. Data collected prior to withdrawal will remain in the&#xD;
      study database and may not be removed until 6 years after the study is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with any type of exercise, there are risks of injury, loss of consciousness, heart attack&#xD;
      and death. Unaccustomed increases in HR, breathing rate, and sweating during exercise&#xD;
      sessions, self-consciousness when exercising in a small group, and muscle soreness are all&#xD;
      normal responses to exercise. Development of an infection may or may not be associated with&#xD;
      the exercise program. All in the TAU-EX group will have provided documentation indicating&#xD;
      their medical provider approved of their participation. TAU-EX members will be counseled&#xD;
      regarding the warning signs and symptoms of heart attacks, shortness of breath, and/or loss&#xD;
      of consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All exercise sessions will be supervised by the exercise physiologists of the UNMH cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation program; symptoms indicative of cardiometabolic distress will result in&#xD;
      stoppage or intensity reduction of the exercise session. Participants in the TAU and TAU-EX&#xD;
      groups may experience bruising, soreness, bleeding, fainting as a result of blood draws and&#xD;
      discomfort resulting from the wound care appointments. Finger sticks for the TAU-EX group may&#xD;
      result in localized discomfort and/or bruising. DFU wound care is part of each participant's&#xD;
      normal treatment plan and beyond the scope of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be no direct benefit for individuals participating in this study. However, some&#xD;
      people have experienced weight loss, improved blood glucose control, and faster wound healing&#xD;
      when exercising on a regular basis. On a larger scale, results from this study may inform the&#xD;
      treatment plan of individuals receiving medical care for DFUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the nature of the research and the data that will collected, The investigators may&#xD;
      find that adherence to the wound care appointment schedules are increased for those in the&#xD;
      TAU-EX group compared to TAU. The investigators may also find that adherence may be predicted&#xD;
      based on some of the response combinations recorded on the questionnaires (i.e. support of&#xD;
      partner, transportation, comradery developed during exercise sessions).&#xD;
