    <textblock>
      The study purpose is to evaluate a novel multidisciplinary approach to fostering a&#xD;
      therapeutic partnership between the participants with developmental disabilities and the&#xD;
      participants family dog. This will culminate in an Animal Assisted Intervention aimed at&#xD;
      increasing activity levels, enhancing social support, and increasing feeling of&#xD;
      responsibility and wellbeing within this population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to evaluate a large scale novel multidisciplinary approach to&#xD;
      fostering atherapeutic partnership between adolescents with developmental disabilities (DD)&#xD;
      and the participants family dog. The investigators will evaluate imitative 'Do As I Do'&#xD;
      (DAID) training into a unique Animal Assisted Intervention (AAI) aimed at increasing activity&#xD;
      levels, enhancing social support by promoting a stronger dog-human bond, and increasing&#xD;
      feelings of responsibility and wellbeing within this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to address the critical need for empirical evaluation of novel&#xD;
      theoretically based multi-site animal assisted interventions through the following specific&#xD;
      aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate a novel multi-site DAID dog training intervention to promote&#xD;
      physical activity in adolescents with developmental disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the impact of a multi-site DAID intervention on the adolescent's&#xD;
      quality of life and feelings of social wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the impact of a multi-site DAID intervention on the child-dog&#xD;
      relationship and mutual wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Population: Adolescent participants with a developmental disability, between the&#xD;
      ages of 10-17 years will be recruited through community-based programs/organizations&#xD;
      associated with children with DDs in around our sites. A DD will be confirmed through parent&#xD;
      report (e.g., initial recruitment conversations, and documented through the initial&#xD;
      demographic questionnaire).&#xD;

    <description>'Do As I Do' (DAID) dog training employs operant conditioning to train dogs to copy the behavior of their owner upon hearing the verbal cue 'Do it', similar to teaching a dog the rules behind the game 'Simon Says'. Once this rule has been established and generalized, something that can be achieved in dogs by practicing with only 3-6 initially learned behaviors, owners can demonstrate new actions and use the cue 'Do it' to prompt a matched, imitative, behavioral response.</description>
