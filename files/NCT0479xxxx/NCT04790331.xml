      Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) is a minimally invasive technique used to restore&#xD;
      sinus ventilation and function in patients with recurrent acute or chronic infective&#xD;
      sinusitis in whom medical therapy has failed. The term FESS is used to draw attention to the&#xD;
      potential for reestablishing natural mucociliary clearance mechanism, drainage and aeration&#xD;
      of sinuses, and maintaining as much of the normal anatomy as possible. Over last few years&#xD;
      this technique has become popular worldwide due to its minimally invasive nature and&#xD;
      preservation of mucosa(1) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative bleeding presents a larger obstacle to endoscopic visualization. Blood&#xD;
      obscures the anatomy of the surgical field and dirties the endoscope lens leading to great&#xD;
      difficulty in visualization (2). Continued bleeding into the surgical field during FESS not&#xD;
      only impairs endoscopic vision , but also can lead to complications including : brain injury,&#xD;
      orbital or optic nerve injury, and catastrophic bleeding from major vessels (e.g., internal&#xD;
      carotid artery) (2,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic reconstruction with vascularized tissue is desirable to facilitate rapid&#xD;
      healing(4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various approaches have been used to secure a dry operating field , among them : conventional&#xD;
      anesthesia , total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) has been previously reported to result in&#xD;
      reduced blood loss when used for FESS .&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, few recent studies point out that (TIVA) may not significantly reduce blood loss.&#xD;
      (5,6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      One way to achieve this goal &quot;reduction of bleeding&quot; is to induce controlled hypotension For&#xD;
      half a century, controlled hypotension has been used to reduce bleeding and need for blood&#xD;
      transfusions and provide a satisfactory bloodless surgical field . Controlled hypotension is&#xD;
      defined as a reduction of the systolic blood pressure to 80-90mm Hg,a reduction of mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure &quot;MAP&quot; to 50-65mmHg or a 30% reduction of baseline &quot;MAP&quot;(7). Pharmacological&#xD;
      agents used include those agents , that can be used successfully alone and those that are&#xD;
      used adjunctively to limit dosage requirements and therefore , The adverse effects of the&#xD;
      other agents . Agents used successfully alone include inhalation anesthetics , sodium&#xD;
      Nitroprusside , nitroglycerin , trimethaphon camsilate , alprostadil (prostaglandin E1) ,&#xD;
      adenosine , remifentanil and agents used in spinal anesthesia.Agents that can be used alone&#xD;
      or in combination include :Calcium Channel antagonists ( e.g nicardipine) , beta adrenoceptor&#xD;
      - antagonists ( beta-blockers ) e.g bisoprolol , propranolol , esmolol ) and fenoldopam.&#xD;
      Agents that are mainly used adjunctively include ACE Inhibitors , and clonidine . The&#xD;
      definition of the ideal hypotensive agent is : It must be easy to administer , have a short&#xD;
      onset time , an effect that disappears quickly when administration is discontinued , a rapid&#xD;
      elimination without toxic metabolites , negligible effects on vital organs and a predictable&#xD;
      and dose dependent effect. New agents and techniques have been recently evaluated for their&#xD;
      ability to induce effective hypotension without impairing the perfusion of vital organs&#xD;
      .(7,8,9)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calcium channel blockers are drugs that block the entry of calcium into the muscle cells of&#xD;
      the heart and arteries. Thus, by blocking the entry of calcium, calcium channel blockers&#xD;
      reduce electrical conduction within the heart, decrease the force of contraction (work) of&#xD;
      the muscle cells, and dilate arteries which reduces blood pressure and thereby the effort the&#xD;
      heart must exert to pump blood(10) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although calcium channel blockers have a similar mechanism of action, they differ in their&#xD;
      ability to affect heart muscle vs. arteries, and they differ in their ability to affect heart&#xD;
      rate and contraction. For example; verapamil (Covera-HS, Verelan PM, Calan , Isoptin) and&#xD;
      diltiazim( cardizem , dilacor , tiazac , diltiaxl ), reduces the strength and rate of the&#xD;
      heart's contraction and are used in treating abnormal heart rhythms(10&#xD;
