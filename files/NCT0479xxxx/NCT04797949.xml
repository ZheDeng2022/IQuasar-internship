  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are data showing that a majority of pregnant women may not be accurately identified as&#xD;
      high risk through screening and therefore, not receiving prophylactic low dose aspirin as&#xD;
      recommended. This leads to missing many patients who would benefit from aspirin&#xD;
      administration. Aspirin is an effective, affordable and safe intervention and its universal&#xD;
      use in pregnancy has been proposed as the answer to help mitigate risk of significant&#xD;
      morbidity from preeclampsia. However, adherence to aspirin in women at low risk compared to&#xD;
      those deemed at high risk of preeclampsia has never been studied. One of the arguments&#xD;
      against universal aspirin administration is the concern that universal receipt would change&#xD;
      the compliance in those at high risk although there are no data to support this concern. To&#xD;
      address the lack of data on differences in adherence, our goal in this proposal is to assess&#xD;
      whether there is a difference in adherence to low dose aspirin (81 mg) in women at high risk&#xD;
      of preeclampsia as indicated by USPSTF risk algorithm when compared to those women randomized&#xD;
      to universal use.&#xD;

      Research objective- To compare adherence to low dose, 81mg of aspirin in women considered&#xD;
      high risk by USPSTF criteria vs universal receipt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Women considered high risk by USPSTF criteria will have better adherence to low&#xD;
      dose aspirin than women randomized to universal receipt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: English or Spanish speaking women between 10-20 weeks of gestation receiving&#xD;
      their care at Women &amp; Infants Hospital, with a plan to deliver at Women &amp; Infants Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled, patients will then be randomized to USPSTF criteria to determine if they&#xD;
      qualify for aspirin or to universal aspirin receipt. Once randomized, patients will undergo&#xD;
      video pill counts at multiple intervals in their prenatal care (monthly).&#xD;
