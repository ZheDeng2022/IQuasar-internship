      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a rare, progressive&#xD;
      disease. It occurs in some people infected with the HTLV-1 virus. It leads to weakness in the&#xD;
      lower limbs and other serious problems. It has no treatment. Teriflunomide is a drug used to&#xD;
      treat multiple sclerosis. It reduces immune cells that make the disease worse. Researchers&#xD;
      want to learn if this drug can help people with HAM/TSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn the effects, immune response, safety, and tolerability of teriflunomide in people&#xD;
      with HAM/TSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with HAM/TSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under protocol 98-N-0047.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical history. They will have physical and neurological exams.&#xD;
      They will have blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take 1 tablet of the study drug once a day for 9 months. They will keep a&#xD;
      drug diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have lymphapheresis. For this, blood is drawn from a needle in one arm. A&#xD;
      machine divides the blood into red cells, plasma, and white cells. The white cells are&#xD;
      removed. The plasma and red cells are returned to the participant through a needle in the&#xD;
      other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have lumbar punctures ( spinal taps ). For this, a thin needle is inserted&#xD;
      into the spinal canal in the lower back. Spinal fluid is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine. The MRI&#xD;
      scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. During the MRI,&#xD;
      participants will lie on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 15 months.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this single center, single arm, open label, baseline versus treatment pilot clinical&#xD;
      trial, sixteen subjects with HAM/TSP will receive teriflunomide 14mg by mouth once a day in&#xD;
      an initial 9 month treatment phase, followed by a 3 month post treatment follow-up phase.&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be collected every 3 months for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will determine the effects of teriflunomide, an FDA approved drug for the treatment of&#xD;
      relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis that inhibits de novo pyrimidine synthesis, on immune&#xD;
      activation markers in patients with HAM/TSP and the correlation of these with virological,&#xD;
      radiological and clinical measures of disease burden .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is ex vivo spontaneous lymphoproliferation in HAM/TSP patients&#xD;
      receiving teriflunomide. Secondary outcome measures will include determination of immune&#xD;
      activation patterns of PBMC and CSF using multicolor flow cytometric analysis and HTLV-I&#xD;
      proviral load in blood and CSF. Safety and tolerability of teriflunomide will be assessed by&#xD;
      tabulation of adverse events, clinical exam, standardized neurological disability scales&#xD;
      (EDSS, IPEC, HAQ-DI), MR imaging of brain and spinal cord and clinical laboratory studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 24 adults with HAM/TSP, targeting at least 16 participants who complete 9 months of&#xD;
      treatment with teriflunomide&#xD;
&#xD;
