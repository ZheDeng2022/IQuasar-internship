      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet is one of the most modifiable behaviors affecting health. But diet assessment measures&#xD;
      that are based on self-report can be inaccurate. Researchers want better ways to address the&#xD;
      role of diet in chronic disease. They want to see if stable isotopes can be used to better&#xD;
      assess what people eat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if stable isotopes can help scientists identify things people eat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18 to 65&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have blood&#xD;
      and urine tests. These tests will be repeated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the inpatient unit of the NIH in Phoenix, Arizona, for 13 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 7 days, participants will eat a diet prepared by the NIH kitchen. They will get balanced&#xD;
      meals that are 50% carbohydrates, 20% protein, and 30% fat. Then participants will be&#xD;
      randomly placed on one of 3 diets containing different percentages of carbohydrates from&#xD;
      soda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants height and weight will be measured. The amount of fat and muscle in their body&#xD;
      will be measured by body scans that are similar to x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have oral glucose tolerance tests. They will consume a sugar drink and then&#xD;
      give blood samples over 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give hair and stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a diet questionnaire. It assesses their food intake over 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete behavioral questionnaires and computer performance tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have fat biopsies taken from their stomach and thigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have three 24-hour stays in a metabolic chamber. It is used to measure&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an inpatient study in which highly specific diets will be fed to&#xD;
      volunteers for approximately 12 weeks and stable isotopes will be measured in blood and hair.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to one of three diets: a weight-maintaining diet without&#xD;
      soda, a weight maintaining diet with 20% of carbohydrates provided as soda, and a weight&#xD;
      maintaining diet with 40% of carbohydrates provided as soda. Ultimately, the goal is to&#xD;
      develop biomarkers to be used to validate food intake patterns in outpatient clinical and&#xD;
      epidemiological studies. The primary objective of this study is to validate the use of stable&#xD;
      isotope biomarkers as representatives of specific dietary intake patterns; changes in the&#xD;
      blood and hair carbon stable isotope ratio (13C/12C) will be measured from baseline to 12&#xD;
      weeks. Secondary objectives include evaluation of the effect of the amount of soda on urinary&#xD;
      sucrose and fructose excretion, extracellular vesicles levels and content, and gut&#xD;
      microbiota, measured from baseline to 12 weeks. Study volunteers will be adult non-diabetic&#xD;
      men and women who are in good health.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the blood carbon stable isotope ratio (13C/12C) from baseline to 12 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, Week 10, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>We will test biomarker diet relationships at the week 8, 10 and 12 sampling time points, using linear mixed effects models to evaluate single CIR biomarkers of SSB in plasma. Specifically, we will also test the time x group interaction by including it as a fixed effect in the mixed model analysis to evaluate the differences in the rate of CIR change over time across groups. Baseline CIR will be included as covariate in the mixed model analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change in the hair carbon stable isotope ratio (13C/12C) from baseline to 12 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>We will test biomarker diet relationships at baseline and 12 weeks to determine differences in values over time and dose.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the carbon stable isotope ratio of alanine from baseline to 12 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, every two weeks through Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>We will examine the time response of CIR-alanine. We will use a difference of 1.5 (Infinite) (+/-) from baseline as a preliminary criterion and adjust to ensure balanced representation of treatments in the 'time response' subset of participants. From these participants we will measure CIR-alanine at all timepoints. We will assess temporal change in CIR- alanine by examining week-to-week correlations to identify the time point at which biomarker measurements become independent of baseline, and by using linear mixed models to model the longitudinal trends over time.</description>

    <measure>Change in urinary sucrose/fructose over time and with varying levels of SSB intake.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, every two weeks through Week 12</time_frame>

&#xD;
        Conditions not specifically mentioned above may serve as criteria for exclusion at the&#xD;
        discretion of the investigators. Additionally, potential subjects might be excluded if they&#xD;
        demonstrate a style of interpersonal relationships that would inhibit successful completion&#xD;
        of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-English-speaking subjects as a population will be excluded from participation in this&#xD;
        protocol. One of the secondary hypotheses of the protocol relates to a battery of&#xD;
        psychological questionnaires and performances tests which are administered to the&#xD;
        volunteers at the beginning and end of the study. There are currently no validated,&#xD;
        translated forms of these questionnaires and tests available; therefore, we will restrict&#xD;
        enrollment to English speaking subjects only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        This study will not include vulnerable participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation of NIH Staff or family members of study team members:&#xD;
&#xD;
        NIH staff and family members of study team members may be enrolled in this study as this&#xD;
        population meets the study entry criteria. Neither participation nor refusal to participate&#xD;
        as a subject in the research will have an effect, either beneficial or adverse, on the&#xD;
        participant s employment or position at NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Every effort will be made to protect participant information, but such information may be&#xD;
        available in medical records and may be available to authorized users outside of the study&#xD;
        team in both an identifiable an unidentifiable manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The NIH Information Sheet on NIH Staff Research Participation will be made available.&#xD;
