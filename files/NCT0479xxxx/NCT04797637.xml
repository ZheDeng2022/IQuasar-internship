      This paucity of evidence supporting or dissuading the use of postoperative abdominal support&#xD;
      following cesarean section for the reduction of postoperative pain leaves important clinical&#xD;
      questions unanswered. Additionally, there is an absence of long-term outcomes associated with&#xD;
      the use of abdominal support devices. There remains a need for the development and&#xD;
      implementation of nonpharmacologic methods for analgesia for women following cesarean&#xD;
      sections, along with evidence-based recommendations regarding their use in postoperative&#xD;
      patients. The ABBy (G-Squared Medical, Brentwood, TN) is an extended-wear panniculus&#xD;
      retractor/tissue stabilizer that is intended for use postoperatively after abdominal&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is placed directly onto patient skin, superior to a transverse incision, and is then used&#xD;
      to elevate redundant tissues away from an incision or wound&#xD;
      (https://www.gsquaredmedical.com/How-it-Works.html). The ABBy can be removed and replaced by&#xD;
      patients and can be used for up to 10 days. This study aims to assess the effect of ABBy use&#xD;
      on postoperative pain, pain medication requirement, and patient satisfaction, when used as a&#xD;
      patient-positioning device in women following cesarean delivery.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain has significant short- and long-term implications for parturients&#xD;
      undergoing cesarean delivery. Poorly controlled postoperative pain can interfere with the&#xD;
      women's ability to care for herself and her newborn in the immediate postoperative period,&#xD;
      and can contribute to longer length of hospitalizations. Untreated pain is associated with&#xD;
      persistent pain, postpartum depression, and greater opioid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well established that an individualized, multimodal analgesic plan for the management&#xD;
      of postoperative pain following cesarean delivery is associated with superior pain relief and&#xD;
      decreased opioid consumption. While different institutional guidelines influence general&#xD;
      practice patterns, a combination of several medications acting on different receptors has&#xD;
      been shown to be effective in decreasing postoperative pain. In 2018, the cesarean section&#xD;
      rate in the United States was 31.9%, compared to 20.7% in 1996. As the cesarean delivery rate&#xD;
      increases, it is becoming more pertinent to develop and incorporate nonpharmacologic&#xD;
      practices for postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of abdominal binders as an adjunct to pharmacologic therapy for the management of&#xD;
      postoperative pain following major abdominal surgery has previously been discussed in&#xD;
      surgical literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The utility of abdominal support within the Obstetrics literature is both sparse and&#xD;
      conflicting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This paucity of evidence supporting or dissuading the use of postoperative abdominal support&#xD;
      following cesarean section for the reduction of postoperative pain leaves important clinical&#xD;
      questions unanswered. Additionally, there is an absence of long-term outcomes associated with&#xD;
      the use of abdominal support devices. There remains a need for the development and&#xD;
      implementation of nonpharmacologic methods for analgesia for women following cesarean&#xD;
      sections, along with evidence-based recommendations regarding their use in postoperative&#xD;
      patients. The ABBy (G-Squared Medical, Brentwood, TN) is an extended-wear panniculus&#xD;
      retractor/tissue stabilizer that is intended for use postoperatively after abdominal&#xD;
      procedure. It is placed directly onto patient skin, superior to a transverse incision, and is&#xD;
      then used to elevate redundant tissues away from an incision or wound&#xD;
      (https://www.gsquaredmedical.com/How-it-Works.html). The ABBy can be removed and replaced by&#xD;
      patients and can be used for up to 10 days. This study aims to assess the effect of ABBy use&#xD;
      on postoperative pain, pain medication requirement, and patient satisfaction, when used as a&#xD;
      patient-positioning device in women following cesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENROLLMENT/RANDOMIZATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All residents and Labor and Delivery staff will be apprised of the study and appropriate&#xD;
      patients with either planned cesarean delivery or those delivered by cesarean delivery within&#xD;
      36 hours will have the opportunity to participate in the trial. The research team will use a&#xD;
      daily list of all cesarean deliveries in Epic to identify potentially eligible patients for&#xD;
      enrollment. Prior to contacting the patient, the research team member will check with the&#xD;
      patient's nurse or care team to discuss eligibility and appropriateness for the study.&#xD;
      Notices will also be placed in Labor and Delivery regarding the study. Study personnel will&#xD;
      explain the study to the patient and allow ample time for the subject to ask questions&#xD;
      related to the study. If the subject consents, she will sign the informed consent document&#xD;
      and will be provided with a copy of the consent form prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled either during their delivery admission up until 36 hours after&#xD;
      delivery. After enrolling, randomization will be performed on the obstetric unit within the&#xD;
      first 36 hours postpartum. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using permutated&#xD;
      blocks of 6. REDCap will be used for randomization, using an uploaded randomization sequence.&#xD;
      A member of the study team will access REDCap to complete randomization. The randomization&#xD;
      result will be notated with the patient's study number and retained in the research record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet inclusion criteria and undergo cesarean delivery at Vanderbilt University&#xD;
      Hospital center will be asked to participate. Informed consent will be obtained during the&#xD;
      delivery admission. Enrolled patients will be randomized within the first 36 hours following&#xD;
      cesarean delivery. The 36-hour window for randomization will begin at the completion of&#xD;
      surgical case, as marked in the Anesthetic Care Record in the EMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the treatment group will have the ABBy device applied by study&#xD;
      personnel at the time of randomization, followed by continuation of usual postoperative care.&#xD;
      The control group will have postoperative care per usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cesarean delivery will be performed by patients' surgical team, with surgical technique per&#xD;
      surgeon preference. Women in the treatment group will have the ABBy device placed above the&#xD;
      incision within 36 hours of cesarean delivery completion. All team members placing the ABBy&#xD;
      device will undergo training and demonstrate competence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesia will be administered to all participants as per routine guidelines on&#xD;
      postpartum. All study patients will receive an electronic survey at 10 days postoperatively&#xD;
      and again at 14 days for those continuing to use the ABBy device or opioid medication at the&#xD;
      10-day survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific medical information regarding pregnancy and delivery will be collected and analyzed&#xD;
      from the patients' electronic medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rare risk exists if the patient has an unknown allergy to the adhesive material in the&#xD;
      device, though this is estimated at less than one per one million for the silicone-based&#xD;
      adhesive used, and per the manufacturer's report, the raw materials used in the silicone roll&#xD;
      stock construction (PS-1860) have been analyzed for biocompatibility and found to not cause&#xD;
      any adverse effect when used properly (Polymer Science, Monticello, IN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a risk of confidentiality breech in the collection of medical information. All&#xD;
      efforts will be made to protect the personal information of the patient by the use of study&#xD;
      number assignment and a password-protected database. Any breech in confidentiality will be&#xD;
      promptly reported to the Vanderbilt IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any adverse events will be reported to the Institutional Review Board in a timely manner as&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY WITHDRAWAL/DISCONTINUATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient who wishes to withdraw from the study will be allowed to withdraw. Should the&#xD;
      patient decide to withdraw from the study, she will notify the principal investigator and her&#xD;
      information will be deleted from the study records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: To detect a reduction in pain medication use of 40% using an alpha of 0.05 and a&#xD;
      beta of 0.20, 108 patients per group with a total sample of 216 patients will be required.&#xD;
      The labor and delivery unit performs about 1400 cesarean deliveries annually; therefore,&#xD;
      assuming an 80% eligibility rate and subsequent 50% participation rate, the study would be&#xD;
      conducted over a 12-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIVACY/CONFIDENTIALITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to participants are minimized by limiting this prospective study to subjects meeting&#xD;
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Access to PHI will be limited to the PI and&#xD;
      co-investigators. All patients will be de-identified by assignment of a study number. All&#xD;
      data collected in this study will be kept electronically in a secure REDCap database. The&#xD;
      primary risk in this study involves the disclosure of protected health information. This risk&#xD;
      is reasonable, given the above precautions, in relation to the potential benefit to both&#xD;
      future patients and society in general by the possibility of reducing the use of pain&#xD;
      medication in cesarean patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP/RECORD RETENTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will require 1 year for complete enrollment. Participants will be actively enrolled&#xD;
      in the study for the duration of their or delivery admission plus up to 14 days follow-up&#xD;
      time. Research records will be retained for up to 6 years.&#xD;
