  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to understand the impact of providing patient-specific cost at the&#xD;
      time of the clinical encounter on decision-making for heart failure medications. The&#xD;
      researchers will provide patients with heart failure with patient-specific cost information&#xD;
      for non-generic heart failure medications. This cost information will be populated onto a&#xD;
      checklist of recommended HF medications so that patients and their clinicians will have this&#xD;
      information available during their clinical encounter. Patients in the control arm will&#xD;
      receive the same checklist but without the cost information.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For many years, medical treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) was&#xD;
      defined by a combination of low-cost, generic medications. Recently, new medications have&#xD;
      demonstrated reductions in mortality and hospitalization. These include the angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor blocker and neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) sacubitril-valsartan, sodium-glucose&#xD;
      cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2I), and ivabradine. These medications all carry important&#xD;
      clinical benefits but also are more expensive, with co-payments varying significantly but&#xD;
      often in the range of $50-$100 per month. These costs are highly relevant for patients'&#xD;
      decisions, especially for patients who have Medicare Part D drug coverage and are not&#xD;
      eligible for co-pay assistance programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior research has demonstrated that patients are sensitive to costs regarding HFrEF&#xD;
      medications and receptive to cost discussions with clinicians. Some broad efforts at price&#xD;
      transparency have been promoted, but generic price information is of little value to patients&#xD;
      and clinicians when out-of-pocket costs vary significantly from patient to patient based on&#xD;
      insurance coverage. At present, neither clinicians nor patients have out-of-pocket costs&#xD;
      available at the time of clinical encounters in order to facilitate integration of this&#xD;
      information into decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is to examine the impact of integrating patient-specific&#xD;
      out-of-pocket cost into shared decision-making regarding heart failure medications in&#xD;
      patients with HFrEF. This will be performed by integrating patient-specific cost into an&#xD;
      existing, evidence-based checklist for HFrEF medications. The study will utilize a simple&#xD;
      cluster-randomized design. All patients in the study will receive, at the time of a clinical&#xD;
      encounter, an evidence-based heart failure medication checklist that describes&#xD;
      guideline-recommended medications for HFrEF. Patients in the intervention group will receive&#xD;
      a version of the checklist that also includes their estimated co-payment for non-generic&#xD;
      heart failure medications based upon their insurance status at the time of the encounter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a preliminary trial to understand the real impact of providing&#xD;
      patient-specific cost at the time of the clinical encounter. The researchers will audio&#xD;
      record clinical encounters, conduct a follow-up survey with participants, and collect&#xD;
      follow-up data regarding each patient's medications.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Discussed Medication Cost</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (during clinic encounter)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients whose clinic encounters involved a discussion of medication cost will be compared between study arms. The discussion of medication cost is a binary outcome of whether or not the cost of medication was discussed during the recorded clinical encounter. Any mention of medication cost will be counted as a cost discussion.</description>

    <measure>Physician Recommendation Coding System (PhyReCS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (during clinic encounter)</time_frame>
    <description>The strength of the clinical recommendation for a medication will be assessed with the Physician Recommendation Coding System (PhyReCS) scale, using the audio recording of the clinic encounter. The PhyReCS is a 5-point scale indicating how strongly the physician recommended a particular treatment. A strong recommendation is coded as +2, a mild recommendation is +1, recommendations neither for nor against treatment are coded as 0, a mild recommendation against treatment is -1, and a strong recommendation against treatment is coded as -2.</description>

    <measure>Low Literacy Decisional Conflict Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 to 3 weeks after clinic encounter</time_frame>
    <description>Participant perception of the visit with their doctor will be assessed with the Low Literacy Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). The DCS includes 10 questions which are responded to as yes (scored as 0), no (scored as 4), or unsure (scored as 2). Total scores range from 0 to 40 with low scores indicating less difficulty in understanding treatment options.</description>

    <description>To assess participant perceptions of their doctor, questions 14-18 of the CAHPS Clinician &amp; Group Survey - Adult Visit 4.0 (beta) instrument will be used. Responses are given on a 3-point scale where 1 = yes, definitely, 2 = yes, somewhat, and 3 = no. The total score of these 4 items range from 4 to 12 with lower scores indicating a more positive experience with their healthcare provider.</description>
