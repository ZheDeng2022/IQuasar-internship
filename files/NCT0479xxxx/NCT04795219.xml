  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of liver conditions associated with&#xD;
      fat accumulation that ranges from benign, non-progressive liver fat accumulation to severe&#xD;
      liver injury, cirrhosis, and liver failure. NAFLD is the most common liver disease in US&#xD;
      adults and the second leading cause for liver transplantation in the US. The natural history&#xD;
      of NAFLD in the general population has been well described, with those with non-alcoholic&#xD;
      fatty liver (NAFL, or simple steatosis) destined to have rare incidence of hepatic events&#xD;
      compared to those with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), who are at high risk for future&#xD;
      development of cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure. The NASH Clinical Research Network&#xD;
      (NASH CRN) was established by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney&#xD;
      Diseases (NIDDK) in 2002, through the mechanism of RFA-DK-01-025, to further the&#xD;
      understanding of diagnosis, mechanisms, progression and therapies of NASH. The NASH CRN&#xD;
      effort has resulted in numerous seminal studies in the field. However, NASH CRN studies have&#xD;
      systematically excluded persons living with HIV (PLWH), as NAFLD in these persons was thought&#xD;
      to be different from that in the general population due to HIV, ART, concomitant medications,&#xD;
      and co-infections. This has resulted in major knowledge gaps regarding NAFLD in the setting&#xD;
      of HIV. This ancillary study of NAFLD and NASH in Adults with HIV (HIV NASH CRN), HNC 001&#xD;
      goal is to examine the prevalence of hepatic steatosis and NAFLD in a large, multicenter, and&#xD;
      multiethnic cohort of PLWH (Steatosis in HIV Study)&#xD;

      NAFLD is the most prevalent of all liver disorders and is the most common cause of chronic&#xD;
      aminotransferase elevations in the United States. NAFLD also represents a major health threat&#xD;
      worldwide, with a substantial impact on healthcare expenditures in the US and Europe. With&#xD;
      the availability of highly effective ART, chronic liver disease has become a leading cause of&#xD;
      non-AIDS related morbidity and mortality in PLWH. NAFLD is projected to become the leading&#xD;
      cause of liver disease in the aging HIV population. The reported prevalence of NAFLD in PLWH&#xD;
      without viral hepatitis co-infection ranges from 15-54% when assessed by imaging modalities&#xD;
      and vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE), and is up to 73% in studies including&#xD;
      liver biopsy, exceeding the reported prevalence of NAFLD in the general population. These&#xD;
      prevalence figures vary as different modalities [computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, or&#xD;
      Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP)] and criteria to define NAFLD were used. Further,&#xD;
      current reports of NAFLD prevalence in PLWH are largely limited to single centers with small&#xD;
      numbers of participants, inclusion of patients with concurrent HCV or limiting the study&#xD;
      population to single sex or military personnel and their dependents. Systematic&#xD;
      characterization of NAFLD in PLWH requires a large, representative, multi-ethnic,&#xD;
      multi-centric cohort, which is currently lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While obesity, insulin resistance and other components of the metabolic syndrome have been&#xD;
      reported in some studies to increase the risk for NAFLD in PLWH, they are not universally&#xD;
      observed in all PLWH, as studies of men with HIV report lower incidence of hepatic steatosis&#xD;
      and lower BMI compared to controls. The impact of HIV and ART on NAFLD risk has also been&#xD;
      much debated, with some studies supporting a role for the duration of infection and ART&#xD;
      agents used, and others showing no associations. Recent reports suggest a potential decrease&#xD;
      in NAFLD/NASH frequency and severity with light to moderate alcohol consumption in the&#xD;
      general population. While PLWH commonly report alcohol use, the effects of non-heavy alcohol&#xD;
      consumption on NAFLD and NASH risk and severity have not been studied in this population.&#xD;
      Similarly, while coffee consumption has reported benefits on NAFLD in the general population,&#xD;
      this effect has not been explored in PLWH. Several genetic variants have been found to&#xD;
      modulate the risk and severity of NAFLD in the general population (Primary NAFLD), such as&#xD;
      PNPLA3, TM6SF2, FADS1, GCKR, MBOAT7, and HSD17B13. To date, only a few studies evaluated&#xD;
      genetic variation as a risk for NAFLD and its severity in PLWH. Emerging studies suggest an&#xD;
      important role for gut microbiome as well as circulating gut derived metabolites in&#xD;
      modulating the severity of Primary NAFLD but similar studies are lacking in PLWH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the prevalence of hepatic steatosis and NAFLD in a large, multicenter, and&#xD;
           multiethnic cohort of PLWH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To enroll at least 1250 PLWH into a cross-sectional study. The presence of hepatic&#xD;
           steatosis and NAFLD and advanced fibrosis will be defined based on clinical, diagnostic,&#xD;
           and VCTE criteria. Core data collection will include clinical, demographic, behavioral,&#xD;
           anthropometric and laboratory information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the prevalence of alcoholic liver disease versus NAFLD and assess the&#xD;
           effects of varying amounts of alcohol and other beverage consumption on the risk and&#xD;
           severity of hepatic steatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the relationship between host (age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, obesity,&#xD;
           genetic variants, gut microbiome, etc.), HIV disease (HIV-1 RNA level, CD4+ T cell&#xD;
           count, HIV duration) and HIV treatment with ART (type and duration), and environmental&#xD;
           (alcohol, coffee and other beverages, diet, physical activity, sleep, food insecurity)&#xD;
           factors and the prevalence of hepatic steatosis and NAFLD in PLWH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a robust specimen bank comprised of serum, plasma, genomic DNA as well as&#xD;
           PBMC and stool at select sites.&#xD;
