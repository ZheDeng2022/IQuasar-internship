  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will consolidate under one umbrella protocol all NIH studies of the safety and&#xD;
      survival of gene-modified lymphocytes in HIV-infected twins. The major purposes of the&#xD;
      current study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  place subjects from the various identical twin cell transfer/gene therapy studies on a&#xD;
           single, more uniform schedule of visits;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  examine the long-term safety of apheresis procedures in non-HIV-infected lymphocyte&#xD;
           donor twins;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  examine the long-term safety of lymphocytes in HIV-infected lymphocyte recipient twins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identical twins enrolled in NIH protocols 93-I-0110, 94-I-0206, 96-HG-0051, and 97-I-0165&#xD;
      involving the transfer of lymphocytes for the treatment of HIV infection are eligible to&#xD;
      continue their research participation under the current protocol, 02-I-0080.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not undergo any additional research procedures in this study. They will&#xD;
      continue to take their antiretroviral therapy and will be followed at least once a year, or&#xD;
      more often if medically indicated, with a medical history, physical examination and blood&#xD;
      tests for routine studies and to determine the number of lymphocytes in the blood. Recipient&#xD;
      twins will also have blood levels of gene-modified lymphocytes checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipient twins will have some blood stored for RCR (replication competent retrovirus)&#xD;
      testing, should it become necessary. A special virus was used to insert genes into the&#xD;
      donated lymphocytes and, although the virus was rendered incapable of growing in the body, a&#xD;
      theoretical risk exists that the virus could mix with other viruses and possibly begin&#xD;
      growing or reproducing. If a participant subsequently develops medical problems, the stored&#xD;
      blood samples can be checked for RCR to see if it may be a cause of the problem.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intramural NIAID sponsored several phase I-II studies of cell transfers during the 1990's,&#xD;
      including gene-modified cells, in identical twins discordant for HIV infection. These studies&#xD;
      were both novel in the field of alternative treatment strategies for HIV infection and served&#xD;
      as early studies in the developing field of clinical gene therapy. The current protocol&#xD;
      represents an umbrella protocol in which these early trials have been consolidated for&#xD;
      purposes of long-term safety monitoring and long-term follow-up of gene-modified cell&#xD;
      persistence. Cell recipients as well as donors enrolled in Intramural NIAID twin gene&#xD;
      marking, gene therapy and cell transfer studies have been eligible for study participation.&#xD;
      Participants are monitored for safety per a uniform standardized schedule. No gene therapy,&#xD;
      cell transfers or other investigational therapeutic interventions occur under the auspices of&#xD;
      this protocol.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Activet participation, in an NIAID/CCMD/NHGRI protocol involving the transfer of unmodified&#xD;
        lymphocytes, gene-marked lymphocytes or cells containing potentially therapeutic genes in&#xD;
        the treatment of HIV-1 infection (cell donors and recipients were eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ongoing follow-up with a primary medical care provider who manages the subject's&#xD;
        HIV-related and/or other medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Agree to comply with study requirements and clinical policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A history of gross noncompliance with prior NIAID/CCMD protocol requirements that, in the&#xD;
        opinion of the Principal Investigator, is likely to seriously compromise the safety or&#xD;
        value of an individual's participation in the present protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Refusal to follow Clinical Center policy on partner notification (if HIV-positive).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Refusal to permit research blood specimens to be stored (frozen) for potential future&#xD;
        studies, including RCR testing will be excluded (participants who have received&#xD;
        gene-modified cells may refuse to have specimens stored for research purposes other than&#xD;
        RCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would make the&#xD;
        subject inappropriate for protocol participation (such as anemia or inadequate venous&#xD;
        access).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Refusal to allow the NIH research team to exchange pertinent medical information with the&#xD;
        subjects primary medical care provider.&#xD;
