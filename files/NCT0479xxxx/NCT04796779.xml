  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether an investigational automated insulin delivery&#xD;
      system (&quot;study system&quot;) for young children (2 yo to less than 6 yo) with type 1 diabetes can&#xD;
      safely improve blood glucose (sometimes called blood sugar) control.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to closed loop control (CLC) system (t:slim X2 with&#xD;
      Control-IQ Technology) or to standard of care where the children will continue to use his or&#xD;
      her personal insulin pump or multiple daily injections. Both groups will use a continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitor (CGM) throughout the study. The study system will also use a study insulin&#xD;
      pump and a software algorithm to automatically give insulin and control blood glucose. This&#xD;
      system is also sometimes called a &quot;closed-loop&quot; system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take about 6-7 months for the child to complete. Study visits can be&#xD;
      completed from home via videoconference (e.g. Zoom) without visiting the clinic or in-person&#xD;
      at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of participants will be asked to join an ancillary study with Meal Bolus and&#xD;
      Exercise challenges during the extension phase. Data collected from the start of each of&#xD;
      these challenges until the following morning will be excluded from the analysis of the&#xD;
      extension phase.&#xD;

    <description>The Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ Technology Pro is an &quot;artificial pancreas&quot; (AP) application that uses advanced closed loop control algorithms to automatically manage blood glucose levels for people with Type 1 Diabetes. The system modulates insulin to keep blood glucose in a targeted range. The system components include the t:slim X2 with Control-IQ Technology and the Dexcom G6 CGM. The system is very similar to the commercially available t:sli X2 with Control-IQ but modified to accept the lower weight and Total Daily Insulin of the studied population.</description>
