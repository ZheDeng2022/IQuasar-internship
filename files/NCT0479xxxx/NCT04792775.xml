  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior research has found that Veterans with military sexual trauma (MST) who have more&#xD;
      difficulties with emotion regulation were more likely to drop out of PTSD treatment&#xD;
      prematurely. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine whether integrating&#xD;
      evidence-based emotion regulation skills training with a scientifically validated treatment&#xD;
      for PTSD called Prolonged Exposure (PE), will enhance PTSD treatment retention and 'dose&#xD;
      received' and subsequently improve treatment outcomes for MST-related PTSD and difficulties&#xD;
      with emotion regulation. Results from this project that examine the feasibility of&#xD;
      integrating these two treatments will provide methodological evidence and justification for a&#xD;
      randomized control trial, if warranted.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to learn ways to improve treatments for women with military&#xD;
      sexual trauma (MST). The researchers want to learn whether combining evidence-based emotion&#xD;
      regulation skills training with a trauma-focused therapy improves treatment outcomes. An&#xD;
      evidence-based trauma treatment known as Prolonged Exposure will be used. Emotion regulation&#xD;
      skills will also be included in treatment. Veterans with a positive or sub threshold&#xD;
      diagnosis of PTSD who experienced a military sexual trauma (MST) will be included.&#xD;
      Participants will complete up to twelve 90 minute sessions of PE with Dialectical Behavior&#xD;
      Therapy (DBT) Emotion Regulation Skills Training followed by a post-treatment assessment. All&#xD;
      aspects of the project including consent, baseline, treatment and follow-up will be completed&#xD;
      either in person or via videoconferencing. Fifteen participants will be enrolled.&#xD;

    <description>The Clinician Administered PTSD (Posttraumatic stress disorder) Scale (CAPS) is a 30-item structured interview that corresponds to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Version (DSM-V) criteria for PTSD. The CAPS can be used to make a current (past month) or lifetime diagnosis of PTSD or to assesses symptoms over the past week. CAPS-5 symptom cluster severity scores are calculated by summing the individual item severity scores for symptoms corresponding to a given DSM-5 cluster: Criterion B (items 1-5); Criterion C (items 6-7); Criterion D (items 8-14); and, Criterion E (items 15-20). A symptom cluster score may also be calculated for dissociation by summing items 19 and 20. Scores range from 0 to 80.</description>

    <measure>PTSD Checklist, 5th Version (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD. The PCL-5 has a variety of purposes, including, monitoring symptom change during and after treatment, screening individuals for PTSD, and making a provisional PTSD diagnosis.

    <intervention_name>PE+ER</intervention_name>
    <description>PE includes the following components: a) psychoeducation about the common reactions to traumatic events and presentation of the treatment rationale b) repeated in vivo exposure to traumatic stimuli, c) repeated, prolonged, imaginal exposure to traumatic memories, and d) relapse prevention strategies and further treatment planning (session 12). DBT Emotion Regulation Skills is integrated as part of this intervention. DBT training provides skills to understand, name, experience and tolerate emotions, as well as skills to change negative emotional responses and to reduce vulnerability to emotion dysregulation (Linehan et al., 2015). The current project includes an adapted 3- session individual emotion regulation skills training intervention to be implemented concurrently with PE which consists of initial teaching/instruction and brief skills review for the remainder of PE treatment.</description>
