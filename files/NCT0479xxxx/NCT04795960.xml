      This pilot study is being completed to determine whether a low-serine diet vs a high serine&#xD;
      diet will reduce inflammation and symptoms in Crohn's disease (CD), as well as determine&#xD;
      whether a low-serine diet (vs. a high serine diet) will improve responses in patients&#xD;
      initiating therapy with Ustekinumab (Stelara), an FDA-approved biologic therapy for Crohn's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      Eligible participants that will be given Ustekinumab as part of their standard of care will&#xD;
      be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypotheses include that a low serine diet (compared to a high serine diet) in&#xD;
      patients with active CD will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduce the relative abundance of Adherent invasive ecoli (AIEC), and increase the&#xD;
           relative abundance of Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium in stool of patients with Crohn's&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Make patients more likely to respond to ustekinumab (anti-Interleukin12/23) therapy with&#xD;
           control of inflammation as measured by the mean Simple endoscopic subscore Crohn's&#xD;
           disease (SES-CD) in each group at week 25.&#xD;
