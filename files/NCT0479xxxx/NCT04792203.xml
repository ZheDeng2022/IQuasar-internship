  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound is a non-radiated diagnostic tool that can be performed at the bedside in&#xD;
      emergency departments and critical care settings. Traditionally, junior residents learn from&#xD;
      patients by performing sonography on them. However, patient rights, patient safety, and&#xD;
      medical quality are raising concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How to enable junior doctors to be effectively familiar with ultrasound operations and to&#xD;
      effectively integrate them into daily practice has become a major challenge in medical&#xD;
      education. Also, the ultrasound-guided clinical procedure is included in the ultrasound core&#xD;
      applications in the American College of Emergency Physicians statements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This aim of this study is to establish an ultrasound-guided simulation curriculum and to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy. The subjects of the study are junior doctors who are interested in&#xD;
      clinical procedures in the emergency department or other relevant medical departments, and it&#xD;
      is estimated that 200 people will be enrolled.&#xD;
