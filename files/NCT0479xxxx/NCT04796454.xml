  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the activity of pamiparib plus low dose TMZ&#xD;
      as maintenance treatment in improving progression free survival (PFS) in patients with&#xD;
      advanced BTC who have received first line platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to test with a one-sided type I error of 10% whether pamiparib plus&#xD;
      low dose TMZ as maintenance treatment increases PFS according to RECIST (version 1.1) in the&#xD;
      entire study population as compared to standard treatment with Cisplatin-Gemcitabine&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen (or Gemcitabine-Oxaliplatin if cisplatin is contra-indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label randomized controlled multi-center phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must meet all the criteria to be eligible. Eligible patients will be centrally&#xD;
      randomized between the two arms in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified by the&#xD;
      following factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumour response CR/PR vs SD vs non-measurable/non-PD after previous platinum-based&#xD;
           chemotherapy as confirmed by central review&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumour location (intrahepatic bile ducts vs. gallbladder vs. perihilar bile ducts and&#xD;
           distal bile duct and /ampulla of Vater tumours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive treatment until progression or for a maximum period of 2 years.&#xD;

          -  The following local treatment modalities are allowed prior to enrollment within the&#xD;
             rules described (provided there has been a full recovery):&#xD;

                  [with macroscopic residual disease] or palliative bypass surgery only), performed&#xD;
                  at least 28 days before enrolment/randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiotherapy: patients may have received prior radiotherapy (with or without&#xD;
                  radiosensitising low-dose chemotherapy) for localised disease, provided the&#xD;
                  patient has fully recovered and at least 28 days have elapsed since the RT…and&#xD;
                  the measurable disease is outside of the previously-treated area&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Photodynamic therapy (PDT) for localized disease only with no evidence of&#xD;
                  metastatic disease - patients may have received prior PDT, provided the patient&#xD;
                  has fully recovered and at least 28 days have elapsed since the PDT and the&#xD;
                  measurable disease is outside of the previously-treated area&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other previous localised treatments targeting intrahepatic lesions such as&#xD;
                  selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), transarterial chemoembolisation&#xD;
                  (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are allowed, provided the patient has&#xD;
                  finished it at least 28 days prior to enrolment/randomization, with full recovery&#xD;
                  and the measurable disease is outside of the previously-treated area&#xD;

          -  Any toxicity from CisGem/GemOx should be resolved, except for alopecia (any grade),&#xD;
             grade 1 fatigue, grade 1 anorexia, grade 1 peripheral neurotoxicity, and grade 1&#xD;
             ototoxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If clinically indicated, adequate biliary drainage or stent insertion should have been&#xD;

        becoming pregnant (i.e. females who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months,&#xD;
        with the exception of those who had prior hysterectomy). However, women who have been&#xD;
        amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if&#xD;
        the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antioestrogens, low body weight,&#xD;
        ovarian suppression or other reasons.&#xD;
