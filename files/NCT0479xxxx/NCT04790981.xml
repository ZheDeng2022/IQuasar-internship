      Background: after resection of medulloblastoma in children they suffer from signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of ataxia which impedes their activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      purpose: to investigate the effect motor imagery training on balance, severity of ataxia and&#xD;
      gait parameters on children after resection of medulloblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Fifty children surfing from cerebellar ataxia after medulloblastoma resection were&#xD;
      selected from tumors hospital of Cairo University, their age ranged from seven to nine years&#xD;
      old, they were randomly assigned into two matched control and study groups. The control&#xD;
      groups received the selected physical therapy program while, the study group received motor&#xD;
      imaginary training in addition to the selected physical therapy program. Both groups were&#xD;
      evaluated by ataxic rating scale, pediatric berg balance scale and kinematic gait analysis by&#xD;
      kinovea software.&#xD;

      Motor imagery is an effective method to enhance motor performance applied in rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs it did not impose a physical load on patients, was confirmed through clinical&#xD;
      evidence from meta-analysis. Motor imagery means thinking in motor task with executing it to&#xD;
      activate motor cortical areas as 25% of the brain neurons are mirror neurons and fire by&#xD;
      thinking.&#xD;

    <measure>Pediatric berg balance scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>to assess balance all children were assessed by the 14 items of the scale including sitting to standing, standing to sitting, transfers, standing unsupported, sitting unsupported, stand with eye closed, stand with feet together, standing with one foot in front, standing on one foot, turning 360 degrees, turning to look behind, retrieving object from floor, placing alternate foot on stool, and reaching forward without stretched arm. The total scale score range from 0 to 56.</description>

    <description>Kinematic gait analysis: Temporo-spatial gait variables were measured using a 2D motion analysis system. The kin markers were placed at greater trochanter, lateral femoral epicondyle, lateral malleolus and 5th metatarsal head. The tripod fixed with a video camera placed at 3 meters away from the walkway and focused on the middle part to record around 3 gait cycles of sagittal plane motion. The Kinovea software version 8.15.0 used to measure step length, stride length, cadence and walking speed. The measurement involved one trial of walking at the preferred gait speed along the 4 meters walkway</description>
