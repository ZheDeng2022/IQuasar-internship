    <textblock>
      Lower Urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are widespread in the general population and their&#xD;
      prevalence is expected to increase in the coming years as the elderly population increases.&#xD;
      Indeed, overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is very frequent and increase with age. OAB has&#xD;
      numerous and various etiologies and can be caused by urologic, metabolic, neurogenic or&#xD;
      autonomic dysfunction. Treatments for OAB depends on etiology but first line treatment often&#xD;
      corresponds to lifestyle modification and antimuscarinics. Antimuscarinics allows improvement&#xD;
      for OAB symptoms, quality of life and urodynamic parameters. However, antimuscarinics&#xD;
      adherence is poor and anticholinergic drugs are often withdrawn few months after their&#xD;
      introduction. This low adherence to antimuscarinics can be explained by side effects as dry&#xD;
      mouth, blurred vision, constipation or cognitive impairment which are due to systemic&#xD;
      anticholinergic effects since specificity and receptor affinity of bladder antimuscarinics&#xD;
      are poor with a large distribution of acetylcholine receptors in all the body. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      there is no or a few questionnaires which evaluate side effects or constraints, except for&#xD;
      one published in 2019, but not specific for anticholinergics. This part of evaluation is&#xD;
      poorly reported in medical literature, whereas it seems to be clear that side effects should&#xD;
      be systematically evaluate and are in part responsible of treatment discontinuation. The&#xD;
      objective of the study is to develop and validate a new questionnaire to assess side effects&#xD;
      of antimuscarinic treatment in a patient with OAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in a Neuro-urology Department of a University Hospital. To allow a&#xD;
      full psychometric validation of the questionnaire, the study protocol included 3 steps:&#xD;
      qualitative interviews, feasibility study and validation study. The inclusion criteria were&#xD;
      to be aged &gt; 18 years and to have OAB symptoms according to the ICS definition and secondary&#xD;
      to a neurogenic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First step of the study consisted in a review literature on Pubmed to explore the different&#xD;
      side effects secondary to antimuscarinic treatment and do determine which tools were&#xD;
      available. In addition, we conducted semi-structured interviews on 30 patients suffering from&#xD;
      OAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility Study For this feasibility study, 30 patients were included. They had to rate&#xD;
      each item to evaluate comprehension, acceptation and pertinence with a three-points Likert&#xD;
      scale from response &quot;0: not at all or quite&quot; to &quot;2: perfectly&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation study: 100 patients Content validity was assessed by the panel of experts.&#xD;
      Internal consistency reliability was calculated using the α coefficient of Cronbach. Each&#xD;
      response has been transformed in a numeric value to perform this test. Alpha coefficient of&#xD;
      Cronbach was considered as very good if &gt; 0.7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test-retest reliability was tested using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) which&#xD;
      was significant over 0.7. The first questionnaire was filled at the end of the first&#xD;
      consultation and patients had to answer a second questionnaire (filled at home) 7 days after&#xD;
      the first consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective was to validate this questionnaire with good or very good psychometric properties.&#xD;
      Primary outcome was Alpha coefficient of Cronbach and ICC ≥ 0,7.&#xD;
