      Introduction: Neck pain causes disturbances in both proprioception and balance. The aim of&#xD;
      the present study is to determine the effect of mobilization applied to the cervical region&#xD;
      on static/dynamic balance and cervical proprioception in patients with nonspecific neck pain&#xD;
      (NSNP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: ... patients were randomly allovated into two groups. Both grups&#xD;
      received conventional physiotherapy program (hot pack with transcutaneous electrical nerve&#xD;
      stimulation); additionally, the experimental group received mobilization, and the control&#xD;
      group received placebo mobilization twice a week for 3 weeks. Before and 3 weeks later,&#xD;
      static/dynamic balance, cervical proprioception, cervical mobility and pain were evaluated&#xD;
      respectively with Kinesthetic Skill Training System 3000 device, joint position error test,&#xD;
      Cervical Joint Range of Motion Device, Visual Analogue Scale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonspecific neck pain (NSNP) is one of the most common causes of neck pain and it occurs as a&#xD;
      result of postural or mechanical causes without a specific musculoskeletal pathology or&#xD;
      injury history. Neck pain leads to a decrease in the activity of the deep cervical muscle&#xD;
      which contains a large amount of muscle spindles, with an increase in the activity of the&#xD;
      superficial cervical muscle. Depending on the pain, chemical changes occur in the cervical&#xD;
      receptors and differentiation in sensitivity of the muscle spindle is observed. These changes&#xD;
      in the structures of the cervical region predispose to deterioration in the sense of&#xD;
      proprioception, which is an important component of balance. The disruption in proprioceptive&#xD;
      abilities causes sensori-motor defects, muscle inhibition, muscle atrophy, and muscle&#xD;
      fatigue. Changing cervical afferent information can affect proprioception as well as balance.&#xD;
      Both the presence of neck pain and disruptions in the proprioceptive sense may reflect&#xD;
      negatively on balance and postural control. In a study comparing patients with neck pain with&#xD;
      asymptomatic individuals, increases in postural sway were found in patients with neck pain,&#xD;
      and it was stated that the increased sway was associated with the dysfunction of the postural&#xD;
      control system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the light of these informations, treatment approaches that can positively contribute to&#xD;
      proprioception and balance gain importance in patients with NSNP. Although manual therapy is&#xD;
      used both to reduce pain, and to increase cervical mobility in patients with NSNP, the number&#xD;
      of studies investigating the effects of manual therapy on balance and proprioception is quite&#xD;
      insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was thought that mobilization applied to the cervical region can improve cervical&#xD;
      proprioception and mobility, reduce pain and contribute positively to balance. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to examine the effect of mobilization applications on the balance and cervical&#xD;
      proprioception in patients with NSNP.&#xD;

    <description>Balance measured with the Kinesthetic Ability Training System 3000 (Med-Fit Systems Inc., Fallbrook, C.A., USA) for static and dynamic balance. The increase in the balance index indicates a deterioration in balance, while the decrease in the index represents an improvement in stability.</description>

    <measure>Cervical proprioception</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline-3rd week</time_frame>
    <description>Cervical joint position error test was conducted using the CROM device in transverse plane (right and left rotation). A travel eye mask was used to blindfold the patient. The examiner held the patient's head and moved slowly to the target head position, which is 50% of the maximum cervical range of motion. When patient reached actively the target position that memorized, the difference between the target position and the position obtained was recorded. Each direction of testing was performed three times and the mean error of these trials was used in the analysis.</description>

It is an inclinometer system that utilizes gravity and magnetic effects.</description>

Five series of 45-s mobilizations were performed with 15 s of rest. Each patient received 6 treatment sessions over a period of 3 week.</description>
