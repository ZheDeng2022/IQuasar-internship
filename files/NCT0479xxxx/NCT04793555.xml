  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The progression of neurodegenerative disorders and the increasing number of elderly people&#xD;
      intensifies the need of institutional care, which contrasts with the desire of most elderly&#xD;
      and patients to live independently at home. The rapid evolution of assistive technology&#xD;
      offers new possibilities in providing medical professionals preventive services in real-time.&#xD;
      Therefore, the main focus of this study is on the individual sensors and how they can be&#xD;
      combined to one unobtrusive system to assess the human behaviour and daily activities during&#xD;
      day and night in an instrumented apartment in healthy participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The higher prevalence of age-associated neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Parkinson,&#xD;
      Alzheimer), is in line with a steady increase of the average life expectancy in Switzerland.&#xD;
      With the progression of neurodegenerative disorders and the increasing number of elderly&#xD;
      people, the need for institutional care intensifies, which contrasts with the desire of most&#xD;
      elderly and patients to live independently. The rapid evolution of assistive technology&#xD;
      offers new possibilities in providing medical professionals preventive services in real-time.&#xD;
      An extended stay in the hospital could influence independent ageing negatively and thus,&#xD;
      monitoring has great potential to prevent critical events. In this study, the main focus is&#xD;
      on the individual sensors and how they can be combined to one unobtrusive system. In&#xD;
      addition, to get an understanding which parameters of the sensors are important and how the&#xD;
      data can be extracted and processed (algorithms). Therefore, the aim of this study is to&#xD;
      validate the accuracy to assess human behaviour and daily activities during day and night by&#xD;
      unobtrusive sensors in an instrumented apartment in healthy participants.&#xD;
