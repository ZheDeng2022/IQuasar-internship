  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disability is a dynamic, multidimensional and diverse public health problem. Although the&#xD;
      primary care burden of the disabled is mostly on mothers, caregivers cannot find little or no&#xD;
      support socially and they have a high risk of experiencing physical and psychological health&#xD;
      problems. In the studies carried out; Disabled caregivers reported higher and lower quality&#xD;
      of life than healthy individuals' relatives with physical ailments such as asthma, arthritis,&#xD;
      back pain, care burden, pain, insomnia, fatigue, depression, anxiety, stress. This study was&#xD;
      planned to determine the effect of an application based on research, education and&#xD;
      progressive relaxation exercises on the quality of life, perceived stress and coping&#xD;
      strategies of caregivers of mentally disabled individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES OF THE RESEARCH H1:Face to face education and PGE exercises applied to mentally&#xD;
      disabled individual caregivers have an effect on caregivers' quality of life, perceived&#xD;
      stress and ways of coping with stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2:Mobile application applied to mentally disabled caregivers and Education and PGE exercises&#xD;
      have an effect on the quality of life of caregivers, their perceived stress and ways of&#xD;
      coping with stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3:The Face to face + Mobile Application education and PGE exercises applied to mentally&#xD;
      disabled individual caregivers have an effect on the caregivers' quality of life, their&#xD;

      Disability, a dynamic, multidimensional and diverse public health problem, can be acquired&#xD;
      temporarily/chronicly or later in life due to congenital, acute illness and/or injury.&#xD;
      Although the primary care burden of the disabled is mostly on mothers, caregivers cannot find&#xD;
      little or no support socially and they have a high risk of experiencing physical and&#xD;
      psychological health problems. In the studies carried out; Disabled caregivers reported&#xD;
      higher and lower quality of life than healthy individuals' relatives with physical ailments&#xD;
      such as asthma, arthritis, back pain, care burden, pain, insomnia, fatigue, depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, stress. It was determined that 64.3% of mentally disabled caregivers experience&#xD;
      severe stress. The measure that improves family caregivers' knowledge about effective and&#xD;
      safe care strategies can reduce/prevent stress-related problems and improve their quality of&#xD;
      life. Roy's Adaptation model (RAM) is one of the most widely used nursing models to cope with&#xD;
      various diseases and problems, which is applied to improve the quality of life and reduce&#xD;
      stress in caregivers. Progressive relaxation exercise (PGE), which is an excellent step to&#xD;
      cope with stress and stress, has been recognized as an effective technique used in&#xD;
      controlling muscle tension. Stress (Novais et al., 2016; Wicaturatmashudi&amp;Erman,2020;&#xD;
      Özgündoğdu&amp;Metin, 2019; Fernández Sánchez et al., 2020) and quality of life (Ghezeljeh et&#xD;
      al., 2017; Bahrami-Eyvanekey et al., 2017). As a part of the holistic care of children with&#xD;
      mental disabilities, the needs and problems of their primary caregivers should be taken into&#xD;
      consideration and solutions should be developed. At the end of this study, the effectiveness&#xD;
      of structured interventions consisting of different learning styles (face-to-face, mobile&#xD;
      application, face-to-face and mobile application; education + PGE exercises) and relaxing&#xD;
      exercises that alleviate the physiological and psychological burden of care were tested, and&#xD;
      it was the most effective in increasing the quality of life and reducing stress of caregivers&#xD;
      of mentally disabled individuals. method will be determined. The method that has been proven&#xD;
      to be effective will be supported by mobile application for the widespread access of mentally&#xD;
      disabled individuals to their caregivers, to reach more target groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, randomized controlled, 3 experimental, 1 control group, pretest-posttest&#xD;
      experimental design will be used as research design. The study will be conducted with the&#xD;
      caregivers of mentally disabled individuals rehabilitated in rehabilitation centers. The&#xD;
      sample size was calculated as 34 individuals in each group (136 individuals) with the G-Power&#xD;
      3.1.9.2 power analysis program. The data will be obtained using the personal information&#xD;
      form, adult caregiver quality of life questionnaire, perceived stress scale, ways of coping&#xD;
      with stress questionnaire. The data will be evaluated using SPSS statistics 20 program and&#xD;
      Statistical significance will be accepted as p&lt;.05.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants were assigned to groups using the &quot;simple randomization method&quot;. Participants were not informed of which group they were in. Automated computer-based randomization resulted in the implementation of the experiment with the scheduling scenario and confidential allocation of participants to one of the four intervention branches. The researcher was blind to all conditions until the participants started the computer program and the intervention began. Participants were also unaware of whether the group they were assigned to was an experimental or a control condition. In addition, researchers coding and analyzing data will be blind to randomization and interventions.</masking_description>

    <measure>Adult Caregiver Quality of Life Questionnaire (AC-QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>ten weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Developed by Stephen Joseph et al. (2012), validity and reliability in Turkish by Gençer and Şengül, caregiver quality of life in 8 different areas (care giving, caring preference, patient care stress, financial issues, personal development, valuing, caregiving ability and caregiver satisfaction) is a questionnaire that provides the opportunity to evaluate. In scale evaluation, 0-40 points indicate &quot;low quality of life&quot;, 41-80 points &quot;average quality of life&quot; and 81-120 points indicate &quot;high quality of life&quot; (Joseph et al. 2012; Gençer, 2020).</description>

    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>ten weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Scale developed by Cohen, Kamarcık and Mermelstein (Cohen at al., 1983). A total of 14 items were designed to measure how stressful certain situations in a person's life are perceived. PSS scores are between 0 and 56. A high score indicates a person's high perception of stress (Eskin et al., 2013). In the original form of the scale, the internal consistency Cronbach alpha coefficient was 0.84, and the test-retest reliability coefficient was determined as 0.85 as a result of two measurements performed two days apart (Cohen at al., 1983). Cronbach coefficient alpha was found 0.87 (Eskin et al., 2013) and 0.722 (Yımaz 2020) in the Turkish validity and reliability study.</description>

    <measure>The Questionnaire of Ways to Cope with Stress (SBÇYA)</measure>
    <time_frame>ten weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Coping Ways Questionnaire (WCQ) developed by Folkman and Lazarus was adapted into Turkish by Şahin and Durak (1995). The scale consists of five sub-dimensions: &quot;confident&quot;, &quot;optimistic&quot;, &quot;helpless&quot;, &quot;obedient&quot; and &quot;seeking social support&quot;. In the 30-item scale, the answers given for each item are in four-order evaluation (0- 30-70-100%) ranging from 0 to 100%.</description>

In groups of 8-10 people, the first 4 sessions in rehabilitation centers will last for the first 4 sessions, and then PMR exercises will be taught and applied (between the 2nd and the 5th weeks, they will be encouraged to do PGE twice at home). The next 4 weeks will be provided with PMR consultancy (3 times a week application / total 24 sessions of PMR application). PMR exercises will be given a follow-up schedule and the caregivers will be followed up by the caregivers themselves and the researchers.</description>
