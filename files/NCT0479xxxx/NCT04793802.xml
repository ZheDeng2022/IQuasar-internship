  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This work consists, first of all, in making an inventory of the physiotherapy of the patient&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery under high flow oxygenation at the CHRU NANCY.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, in a second step, the impact of the physiotherapy on the lung ultrasound score&#xD;
      associated or not with the NIV of the patient under OHD after cardiac surgery will be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is therefore to answer the following research question: what is the impact of a&#xD;
      physiotherapy session with or without non-invasive ventilation in patients receiving high&#xD;
      flow oxygenation after cardiac surgery on the lung ultrasound score measured by ultrasound?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hypothesis: Physiotherapy is associated with NIV when it is prescribed in patients&#xD;
      undergoing high flow oxygenation after cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis: Physiotherapy + NIV further improves pulmonary aeration versus&#xD;
      physiotherapy + high flow oxygenation.&#xD;

    <measure>Lung ultrasound score</measure>
    <time_frame>The time of the event (the 2 measurements + the physiotherapy session) is estimated at 45 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Reliable and verified score, subject to international recommendations allowing the physiotherapist to deepen his diagnosis and evaluate the effectiveness of his techniques. Measured on 12 thoracic regions The score (N B1 B2 C) will therefore be calculated according to the level obtained in each zone to determine a score out of 36. The higher the score, the more the lung has a deficit of ventilation.&#xD;
A decrease in the objective lung ultrasound score will result in better lung aeration.&#xD;
Two lung ultrasound score measurements are realized on one patient. The first measurement is taken on the day of inclusion of the patient in the study at the time of the physiotherapist's assessment before the CPT session. (CPT = Chest Physiotherapy Treatment) The second and last measurement is taken after the CPT session (with or without NIV, depending on the medical prescription).</description>
