      The aim of this study was to compare the effects of three months' endurance training and&#xD;
      three months' endurance-strength training on selected psychological aspects in women with&#xD;
      abdominal obesity.&#xD;

      Study patients. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The study meets the&#xD;
      standards of the Declaration of Helsinki in its revised version of 1975 and its amendments of&#xD;
      1983, 1989, and 1996.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. The study was designed as a prospective randomized trial. Subjects were&#xD;
      randomly divided into two groups, A and B, using a randomization list. Both groups performed&#xD;
      three month of physical training. Group A underwent endurance training, while group B&#xD;
      performed endurance-strength training. Aside from the training, all subjects were instructed&#xD;
      to maintain the physical activity and diet that they had been practicing so far. At baseline&#xD;
      and after three months of physical training, anthropometric measurements were performed and&#xD;
      psychological questionnaires (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10); The Rosenberg Self-Esteem&#xD;
      Scale (SES); Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ - 34); Figure rating scale (FRS); The Three-Factor&#xD;
      Eating Questionnaire-18 (TFEQ-18)) were fulfilled for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. The exercise program lasted three months, with three sessions per week. Women&#xD;
      in both groups participated in a total of 36 training sessions. The women in group A&#xD;
      underwent endurance exercise on cycle ergometers (Schwinn Evolution, Schwinn Bicycle Company,&#xD;
      Boulder, Colorado, USA). Exercise sessions consisted of a five-minute warm-up (stretching&#xD;
      exercise) at low intensity (50%-60% of maximum heart rate), a 45-minute exercise (at 50%-80%&#xD;
      of maximum heart rate), five minutes of cycling without a load, and five minutes of closing&#xD;
      stretching and breathing exercise of low intensity. Group B performed endurance-strength&#xD;
      exercise consisting of a five-minute warm-up (stretching exercises) of low intensity (50%-60%&#xD;
      of maximum heart rate), a strength component, an endurance component, 5 minutes cycling&#xD;
      without a load, and a 5 minutes closing stretching and breathing exercise of low intensity.&#xD;
      The 20-minute-long strength component was performed using a neck barbell and a gymnastic&#xD;
      ball. Directly after the strength exercise, the women took part in a 25-minute endurance&#xD;
      exercise on cycle ergometers (Schwinn Evolution, Schwinn Bicycle Company, Boulder, Colorado,&#xD;
      USA) at 50%-80% of maximum heart rate. Both the endurance and endurance-strength training&#xD;
      were comparable in exercise volume; the only difference was the nature of the effort.&#xD;

    <description>The women in group A underwent endurance exercise on cycle ergometers (Schwinn Evolution, Schwinn Bicycle Company, Boulder, Colorado, USA). Exercise sessions consisted of a five-minute warm-up (stretching exercise) at low intensity (50%-60% of maximum heart rate), a 45-minute exercise (at 50%-80% of maximum heart rate), five minutes of cycling without a load, and five minutes of closing stretching and breathing exercise of low intensity.</description>

    <description>Group B performed endurance-strength exercise consisting of a five-minute warm-up (stretching exercises) of low intensity (50%-60% of maximum heart rate), a strength component, an endurance component, 5 minutes cycling without a load, and a 5 minutes closing stretching and breathing exercise of low intensity. The 20-minute-long strength component was performed using a neck barbell and a gymnastic ball. Directly after the strength exercise, the women took part in a 25-minute endurance exercise on cycle ergometers (Schwinn Evolution, Schwinn Bicycle Company, Boulder, Colorado, USA) at 50%-80% of maximum heart rate.</description>
