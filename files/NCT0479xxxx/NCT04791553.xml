      This study is designed investigate the effect of severe hepatic impairment on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of cenobamate.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, parallel group PK and safety&#xD;
      study of a single oral dose of cenobamate in male and female subjects with normal hepatic&#xD;
      function (Group 1, n = 8) and those with severe hepatic impairment (Group 2, n = 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a 28-day screening period, followed by single dose administration of&#xD;
      cenobamate (200mg) on Day 1, an assessment period of 35 days and follow-up visit. All&#xD;
      subjects will be confined to the clinical site from Day -1 (the day before dosing) until Day&#xD;
      5. Outpatient visits will be performed regularly until Day 35. The follow-up visit will occur&#xD;
      on Day 40 (±1 day).&#xD;
