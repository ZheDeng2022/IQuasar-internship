    <description>The main procedures of this study include educational sessions about melanoma and how to detect it at its earliest stages with the help of a community health worker, conducting a self-skin examination every three months, helping to perform a skin examination every three months for a family member or friend who would be selected as a &quot;partner&quot;, and completing short questionnaires at the beginning of the study, at month three during the study, and at completion of the study.</description>

        200 melanoma survivors drawn from the California Cancer Registry will be invited to&#xD;
        participate in the study. Assuming a 20% response rate, approximately 40 individuals will&#xD;
        be identified to participate in the study, including 20 in Southern California and 20 in&#xD;
        Northern California. Participants will be invited to identify up to four friends or&#xD;
        first-degree family members to also participate in the study, for a total of 200&#xD;
        participants.&#xD;
