  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Aim of this study is to investigate the amount of tissue required for the successful&#xD;
      culture of primary cells from human-derived pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma which obtained&#xD;
      by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy wet suction technique&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is one of the malignant tumors with the highest mortality rate in the&#xD;
      world, with a 5-year survival rate of only 7.2%-9%. Because some patients are resistant to&#xD;
      multiple chemotherapy drugs, and there are differences in drug sensitivity between&#xD;
      individuals, the current pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) chemotherapy effect is not&#xD;
      satisfactory. In order to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy and achieve precise treatment,&#xD;
      it is important to establish an accurate and individualized PDAC research model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because most of patients with PDAC have developed to advanced stage at the time of diagnosis,&#xD;
      it is not suitable for surgery. That limits our ability to obtain tumor cells seriously. With&#xD;
      the development of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) technique, it&#xD;
      can be used not only to diagnose diseases, but also to provide specimens for molecular&#xD;
      analysis and create valuable preclinical disease research models, so as to guide the&#xD;
      selection of the most appropriate individualized treatment. EUS-FNB can obtain lesions&#xD;
      without any treatment. Therefore, the preclinical disease research model established by&#xD;
      EUS-FNB is more representative of the original tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, compared with surgical specimens, the specimens obtained by EUS-FNB are smaller in&#xD;
      size, which may affect the successful construction of research models in vitro. Therefore,&#xD;
      the investigators plan to use EUS-FNB wet suction technique, a modified specimen acquisition&#xD;
      method, to obtain PDAC tissue, and use it for primary cell culture, to explore the amount of&#xD;
      tissue required for the successful cultivation of human-derived pancreatic cancer primary&#xD;
      cells, so as to provide a prerequisite for the successful establishment of human-derived&#xD;
      preclinical disease research model.&#xD;
