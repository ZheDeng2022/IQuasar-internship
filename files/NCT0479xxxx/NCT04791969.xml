      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b trial in which 54 MSM who use meth will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned (2:1) to receive 12 weeks of as-needed intermittent oral naltrexone 50&#xD;
      mg enhanced with an EMA-informed EMI platform, or receive as-needed placebo with EMA-informed&#xD;
      EMI. The 12-week treatment period is consistent with other pharmacotherapy trials for&#xD;
      substance use disorders. The proposed sample size is also consistent with other phase 2b&#xD;
      trials for substance use treatment. Upon enrollment, participants will complete daily EMA&#xD;
      assessments and weekly visits for behavioral surveys and urine testing for meth metabolites,&#xD;
      study drug dispensing and computer-based counseling for substance use. Safety laboratory&#xD;
      assessments and vital signs will be completed monthly. Efficacy (Specific Aims 1-3) will be&#xD;
      assessed upon trial completion as measured by proportion meth-positive urine samples; PrEP&#xD;
      and ART adherence by drug levels and viral load testing; and sexual risk behavior data&#xD;
      accounting for PrEP use and viral suppression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine (meth) use is very common among men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly&#xD;
      MSM living with HIV. Meth use among HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM is up to 13 and 34&#xD;
      times more prevalent than in the general U.S. adult population, respectively. Meth use is&#xD;
      independently associated with HIV-related sexual risk behaviors among MSM and can function as&#xD;
      a barrier to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence.&#xD;
      Thus, effective interventions to reduce meth use may also function as an important HIV&#xD;
      prevention and care intervention by reducing meth-related HIV risk behavior, and optimizing&#xD;
      ART and PrEP adherence. MSM comprise two-thirds of the new infections in the United States.&#xD;
      Despite this continued domestic HIV epidemic and the high prevalence of meth use among MSM,&#xD;
      few interventions have proven efficacious for MSM who use meth. The investigators seek to&#xD;
      address this gap by evaluating the efficacy of intermittent oral naltrexone enhanced with an&#xD;
      ecological momentary intervention (ION+EMI) for meth use treatment. Naltrexone, a µ-opioid&#xD;
      receptor antagonist, is a promising agent for MSM who use meth. Meth is rapidly metabolized&#xD;
      to amphetamine in the bloodstream and daily naltrexone has shown efficacy in reducing&#xD;
      amphetamine urine-positivity and relapse. Oral naltrexone is inexpensive and has few&#xD;
      toxicities, but the standard daily regimen for naltrexone hampers compliance as patients&#xD;
      frequently neglect to take the medication. Alternate regimen schedules have been proposed to&#xD;
      increase efficacy and expand the population that may benefit from this pharmacologic agent.&#xD;
      One alternative approach is the targeted administration of intermittent oral naltrexone&#xD;
      (ION), whereby individuals are instructed to take the medication as needed in anticipation of&#xD;
      substance use, after exposure to triggers of substance use, or during periods of craving.&#xD;
      Administration of naltrexone prior to exposure to amphetamines significantly attenuated&#xD;
      amphetamine craving in 4 trials. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that ecological&#xD;
      momentary interventions (EMI) that respond to in-the-moment contexts can lead to positive&#xD;
      health behaviors, such as increasing medication dosing. EMI are particularly well-suited to&#xD;
      enhancing as-needed dosing of naltrexone because anticipation of meth use and meth craving in&#xD;
      a natural setting changes within a person from moment to moment, and the detection of these&#xD;
      momentary fluctuations can support the delivery of just-in-time messages to encourage&#xD;
      medication use to prevent participants from proceeding from craving to meth use. A pilot&#xD;
      study led by our research team on ION found that meth-using MSM who use at least 1 day per&#xD;
      week had significantly greater reductions in meth-using days when treated with as-needed&#xD;
      naltrexone, compared to placebo. Moreover, naltrexone participants had greater reductions in&#xD;
      serodiscordant receptive anal intercourse and serodiscordant condomless receptive anal&#xD;
      intercourse, compared to placebo. In the pilot, participants reported taking study drug 64%&#xD;
      of the days that they craved or anticipated meth use. Participants also completed ecological&#xD;
      momentary assessments (EMA) with a 74% response rate, indicating that real-time assessments&#xD;
      are feasible and acceptable. To build on the results of this study and 4 other naltrexone&#xD;
      trials, the investigators propose to evaluate intermittent naltrexone to treat meth in a&#xD;
      phase 2b efficacy trial supplemented by an EMA-informed EMI that responds to a participant's&#xD;
      real-time craving levels or anticipated meth use to provide in-the-moment medication&#xD;
      reminders when participants would most benefit from naltrexone. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that pairing ION with EMI will further amplify reductions in meth use by providing&#xD;
      just-in-time reminders for naltrexone to optimize adherence, thereby interrupting the&#xD;
      progression from craving to meth use.&#xD;
