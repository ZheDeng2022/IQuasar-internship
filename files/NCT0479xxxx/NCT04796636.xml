  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite promising observational and phase 1 data, the therapeutic potential of vitamin C for&#xD;
      the management of septic shock has not borne out in recent large multi-centre randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials. There is biological plausibility for benefit with intravenous vitamin C,&#xD;
      and the investigators hypothesize that the doses used in these trials were insufficient to&#xD;
      demonstrate an effect. High-dose vitamin C has been trialed in patients with cancer and burns&#xD;
      and proven to be safe. The investigators have recently demonstrated a dramatic benefit of&#xD;
      high-dose intravenous vitamin C in reversing organ dysfunction in a large mammalian model of&#xD;
      sepsis. The proposed prospective interventional study will be the first to administer&#xD;
      high-dose intravenous vitamin C in critically ill patients with sepsis. The objectives of&#xD;
      this study will be to determine whether high-dose intravenous vitamin C (i) reduces&#xD;
      vasopressor requirement in critically ill patients with septic shock (ii) reverses organ&#xD;
      dysfunction and (iii) is well tolerated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to conduct a phase 1, feasibility, prospective, two-centre,&#xD;
      randomised, open-label, trial in 30 ICU patients with septic shock to test whether the&#xD;
      intravenous administration of two stepped doses of high-dose intravenous vitamin C for 48&#xD;
      hours leads to a reduction in duration of vasopressor requirement and an improvement in organ&#xD;
      failure scores and blood biomarkers of sepsis compared to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either 30 g of vitamin C twice daily for 48&#xD;
      hours (+ 30 g load) (n=10), 60 g of vitamin C twice daily for 48 hours (+ 30 g load) (n=10)&#xD;
      or usual care (no vitamin C) (n=10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin C is provided by the manufacturer (Orthomolecular Medisearch Laboratory P/L,&#xD;
      Braeside, Victoria, Australia) as 30 grams in 100 ml. At study commencement (T = 0) patients&#xD;
      randomized to either vitamin C arm will receive a loading dose of 30 grams of vitamin C&#xD;
      infused through central venous access via a dedicated line over 2 hours (50 ml/hr =15 g/hr).&#xD;
      In patients randomized to 60 g/day, this will be immediately followed by an infusion of 30&#xD;
      grams of vitamin C (100 ml) over 6 hours which will then be repeated at 14, 26 and 38 hours&#xD;
      (i.e., 2 days of treatment). In patients randomized to the higher dose, two vials (200 ml =&#xD;
      60 grams) will be infused through a central venous catheter over 6 hours immediately&#xD;
      following the 30 gram loading dose. This dose will be repeated at 14, 26 and 38 hours (i.e.,&#xD;
      2 days of treatment). Patients in the control arm will receive usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also plan to describe the pharmacokinetic parameters of high-dose&#xD;
      intravenous vitamin C in critically ill patients with septic shock. These results will inform&#xD;
      a subsequent multi-centre, blinded, parallel group randomized controlled trial to determine&#xD;
      the efficacy of high-dose intravenous vitamin C for the reversal of septic shock and&#xD;
      potentially improved survival.&#xD;

    <description>Time to cessation of vasopressor support (up to day 14). This will be defined as per the VITAMINS trial, as the patient being alive at discontinuation of all vasopressors for at least 4 hours in the presence of MAP &gt;65 mmHg for the same 4 hour period as reported in the ICU charts. Use of vasopressor will be defined as any use of noradrenaline, adrenaline, vasopressin, metaraminol, dopamine or phenylephrine. Data on doses will be obtained hourly and the doses summed for each study day. Vasopressor dose will be calculated as the sum of norepinephrine and 'norepinephrine equivalent' doses.</description>
