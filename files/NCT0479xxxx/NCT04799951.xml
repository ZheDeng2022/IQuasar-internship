  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With increasing evidence the management of breast cancer surgery has seen a paradigm shift&#xD;
      towards breast conservation, heralding an era of oncoplastic breast surgery. Despite data&#xD;
      supporting BCS(breast conservative surgeries) in suitable patients with early breast cancer,&#xD;
      a significant percentage of women in India who would be candidates for BCS still decide to&#xD;
      undergo mastectomy. The factors that influence these treatment decisions are complex and&#xD;
      involve issues regarding access to health care, concerns for cancer recurrence, and the&#xD;
      impact of surgery on body image and sexuality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgeon plays an important role in patient selection for breast conservation based on&#xD;
      clinico-pathological characters, explaining to patient regarding mandatory locoregional&#xD;
      radiotherapy and regular follow up, helping patient make an informed decision by providing&#xD;
      safety and outcome profile as compared to mastectomy. Surgeon's recommendations are&#xD;
      considered as important as patient's perception of body image issues, while making the&#xD;
      decision. Surgeon's recommendations are usually based on their knowledge and belief regarding&#xD;
      patient's disease characteristics and their perceptions regarding patient's socioeconomic&#xD;
      capabilities and perceived compliance to prescribed treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence we are conducting this web based e-survey in surgeons from Private hospitals (breast&#xD;
      specific practice) Medical colleges and Regional Cancer Centers (RCC) with an aim to evaluate&#xD;
      the to understand knowledge, attitude and practices of primary surgeons regarding breast&#xD;
      conservation surgery Vs mastectomy in treatment of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to administer the questionnaire to approximately 100 surgeons, equally distributed&#xD;
      within aforementioned sectors.&#xD;

      With increasing evidence the management of breast cancer surgery has seen a paradigm shift&#xD;
      towards breast conservation, heralding an era of oncoplastic breast surgery. Despite data&#xD;
      supporting BCS in suitable patients with early breast cancer, a significant percentage of&#xD;
      women in India who would be candidates for BCS still decide to undergo mastectomy. The&#xD;
      factors that influence these treatment decisions are complex and involve issues regarding&#xD;
      access to health care, concerns for cancer recurrence, and the impact of surgery on body&#xD;
      image and sexuality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, Barron Lerner observed the convergence of the women's liberation movement and&#xD;
      the rise of Breast Conservation Surgery as the standard of surgical care in the treatment of&#xD;
      early stage disease, implying that the felt need of breast conservation was important in&#xD;
      stimulating research into breast conservation. One celebrated example of such demand was,&#xD;
      writer Rosamond Babette who refused radical mastectomy when diagnosed with breast cancer in&#xD;
      1971 and sought Bernard Fisher's expertise, who, in that era was offering partial mastectomy&#xD;
      for early breast cancer. There is now Level I evidence favoring breast conservation surgery&#xD;
      for early breast cancer. Decision of breast conservation surgery or mastectomy for early&#xD;
      breast cancer, is based on the clinico-pathological factors, individual factors and physician&#xD;
      factors. Each has its influence on the decision; making the decision process complex one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age of patient at presentation is important factor and it appears logical that younger&#xD;
      patients would prefer breast conservation over mastectomy. Two reviews of the National Cancer&#xD;
      Database have demonstrated that on the background of increased numbers of breast conservation&#xD;
      younger patients are being treated with mastectomy at higher rates than their older&#xD;
      counterparts after adjusting for patient, facility, and tumor characteristics. The subset of&#xD;
      women aged â‰¤ 35 years were twice as likely to undergo mastectomy compared to women aged 61-64&#xD;
      years. These studies also reported similar trends with socioeconomic status, geography, and&#xD;
      cancer stage. It is unclear why younger women may be opting for more extensive surgery. This&#xD;
      may be due to a concern for locoregional recurrence in younger patients, although more&#xD;
      aggressive surgery does not appear to affect breast cancer-specific survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Availability of radiation facilities and patients' compliance has been studied in detail with&#xD;
      reference to breast conservation. It has been seen that breast conservation rates are higher&#xD;
      in tertiary care centers with easy accessibility to radiation facilities and within those&#xD;
      patients who stay close by to radiation facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      country of training, gender, or number of procedures. These studies suggested female gender,&#xD;
      higher case number, training, and individual surgeon practice were associated with increased&#xD;
      BCT rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMH Mumbai reports that the proportion of cases undergoing BCS has shown a significant upward&#xD;
      trend from 12.6% in 1997 to 70% at present. However at institutes across India BCS rates&#xD;
      quoted are less than 30%. Surgeon plays an important role in patient selection for breast&#xD;
      conservation based on clinicopathological characters, explaining to patient regarding&#xD;
      mandatory locoregional radiotherapy and regular follow up, helping patient make an informed&#xD;
      decision by providing safety and outcome profile as compared to mastectomy. Surgeon's&#xD;
      recommendations are considered as important as patient's perception of body image issues,&#xD;
      while making the decision. Surgeon's recommendations are usually based on their knowledge and&#xD;
      belief regarding patient's disease characteristics and their perceptions regarding patient's&#xD;
      socioeconomic capabilities and perceived compliance to prescribed treatment plan. We intend&#xD;
      to study surgeon's and patient's perspective regarding the decision making, by administering&#xD;
      a questionnaire to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an attempt to provide all valid information in easily understandable language and in&#xD;
      disambiguous manner various decision making aides have been prepared and studies. In one such&#xD;
      study, patients and surgeons were interviewed to identify key factors influencing breast&#xD;
      cancer surgery decisions. They were then incorporated into a decision board that could be&#xD;
      reviewed at the time of surgical consultation.Randomized trial comparing the decision board&#xD;
      to usual care demonstrated that patients who had surgical consultations with the decision&#xD;
      board had higher knowledge scores regarding treatment options; less decisional conflict and&#xD;
      were more satisfied with the decision-making process. In addition, patients in the decision&#xD;
      board group were more likely to undergo BCS (94 vs. 76%, P = 0.03). Recent meta-analysis of&#xD;
      studies using decision aids in breast cancer patients, demonstrated that women were 25% more&#xD;
      likely to choose BCS over mastectomy if a decision aid was utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nine studies examined how physician related factors influenced patient's choice of mastectomy&#xD;
      versus BCT. The variables reported included comparing individual surgeons' numbers of breast&#xD;
      conservations, medical oncology consultation, and specific surgeon demographics such as&#xD;
      degree,country of training, gender, or number of procedures. These studies suggested female&#xD;
      gender, higher case number, training, and individual surgeon practice were associated with&#xD;
      increased BCT rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMH Mumbai reports that the proportion of cases undergoing BCS has shown a significant upward&#xD;
      trend from 12.6% in 1997 to 70% at present. However at institutes across India BCS rates&#xD;

      questionnaire to them.Aim of this study is to understand knowledge, attitude and practices of&#xD;
      primary surgeons regarding breast conservation surgery vs mastectomy in treatment of breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
