      A brief, nurse-led educational intervention using motivational interviewing substantially&#xD;
      improved general and disease-specific self-management skills in youth with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;

      Introduction and Objectives: For youth with chronic health conditions, adolescence is&#xD;
      associated with a deterioration of disease self-management and poor health outcomes.&#xD;
      Effective interventions are needed to prepare youth for transition to adulthood and adult&#xD;
      care. To prospectively assess the impact of an education program based on motivational&#xD;
      interviewing on self-management skills and glycemic control in youth with Type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      (T1D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: After parental consent and youth assent, investigators prospectively randomized 66&#xD;
      adolescents 13-18 years old with type 1 diabetes to either usual care (regular medical&#xD;
      consultation) or usual care supplemented by sessions with a nurse educator using a&#xD;
      motivational interviewing (MI) approach and goal setting based on responses to the Transition&#xD;
      Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) and T1D specific self-management skills. Primary&#xD;
      outcomes were TRAQ change scores and HbA1c levels between baseline and 6 months.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline TRAQ score at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The TRAQ includes 20 items divided into five subscales: 1) Appointment keeping (7 questions; e.g., Do you call the doctor's office to make an appointment?) 2) Tracking health issues (4 questions; e.g., Do you keep a calendar or list of medical and other appointments?); 3) Managing medications (4 questions; e.g., Do you know what to do if you are having a bad reaction to your medications?); 4) Talking with healthcare providers (2 questions; e.g. Do you tell the doctor or nurse what you are feeling?); 5) Managing daily activities (3 questions; e.g. Do you help plan or prepare meals/food?). Each question has the same Liker response set from 1 to 5 using the Stages of Change Transtheoretical Model as a framework. A minimum score of ''1'' is assigned to the responses 'No, I don't know how' while a maximum score of '' 5 '' is assigned to responses labeled &quot;Yes, I always do it when I need it.&quot; Higher scores mean better outcome.</description>
