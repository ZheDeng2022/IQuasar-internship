  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will have a significant impact on the overall management of those cancer&#xD;
      patients and their family members who are at risk for hereditary cancer due to germline&#xD;
      inactivation of BAP1. Our study will ultimately facilitate the development of novel&#xD;
      screening, prevention and treatment strategies for these individuals with the syndrome.&#xD;
      Because the vast majority of UM develop in pre-existing nevi, characterization of individuals&#xD;
      at high risk for development of UM will allow closer screening and earlier intervention which&#xD;
      would improve the treatment outcome not only for retaining vision but also for overall&#xD;
      survival. Similarly in patients with germline BAP1 mutation CM develops in premalignant&#xD;
      atypical melanocytic lesions and careful follow up of these patients will improve the outcome&#xD;
      of their disease. In addition this study could have impact on the management of patients with&#xD;
      personal and/or family history of several other cancers reported in patients with germline&#xD;
      BAP1 mutation such as mesothelioma, renal cell carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma, meningioma and basal cell carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BAP1 (BRCA1-associated protein-1), is a deubiquitinating enzyme with a ubiquitin&#xD;
      carboxy-terminal hydrolase function that has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor gene&#xD;
      with a role in cell proliferation and growth inhibition. Recently germline mutations in BAP1&#xD;
      have been identified by our group and others in families with hereditary cancers. However,&#xD;
      the clinical spectrum of cancers in patients with germline BAP1 is still not clear. The&#xD;
      association of germline BAP1 mutations with increased risks for uveal melanoma (UM),&#xD;
      mesothelioma, cutaneous melanoma (CM), renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and BAP1-inactivated&#xD;
      melanocytic tumors is fairly well established. However, several other cancers have been&#xD;
      reported in these patients and their family members including cholangiocarcinoma,&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma, meningioma, basal cell carcinoma and other internal malignancies.&#xD;
      Identification of the clinical phenotype of BAP1-TPDS is important for proper counseling and&#xD;
      management of patients.&#xD;

        Providers at OSU will identify eligible participants through clinical practice. Providers&#xD;
        at other institutions who become aware of our research through presentations at&#xD;
        conferences, publications, etc. may identify one of their patients as eligible or&#xD;
        potentially eligible for the study and introduce the study to their patient.&#xD;
