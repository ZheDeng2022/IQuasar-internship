    <textblock>
      The recent ARRIVE trial conducted in United States of America in 2014-2017 demonstrates that&#xD;
      elective induction of labor at 39 weeks for nulliparous women did result in a significantly&#xD;
      lower frequency of cesarean delivery with no significant differences of adverse perinatal&#xD;
      outcomes. But the expected benefits of elective labor induction at 39 weeks have to be&#xD;
      confirmed in other settings outside US before considering routine induction of labor for all&#xD;
      low-risk nulliparous women at 39 weeks of gestation worldwide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The nadir of the neonatal risks seems to be at 39 weeks of gestation and there is an&#xD;
      augmentation of maternal complications after 39 weeks. Nonetheless, planned induction of&#xD;
      labor at 39 weeks was not encouraged in common practice due to a suspected higher risk of&#xD;
      frequency cesarean delivery and other adverse maternal outcomes, especially among nulliparous&#xD;
      women with unfavorable cervix, compared with expectant management. This suspected increased&#xD;
      maternal morbidity especially the cesarean rate associated with the induction of labor was&#xD;
      based on observational studies which suffer from methodological limitations or based on&#xD;
      underpowered small randomized clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent multicenter, randomized, controlled, unmasked trial conducted in United States of&#xD;
      America in 2014-2017 (ARRIVE trial), provides new results with a high level of evidence. This&#xD;
      trial conducted among 6,106 low-risk nulliparous women who were randomized, 3062 assigned to&#xD;
      labor induction at 39 weeks 0 day to 39 weeks 4 days and 3,044 assigned to expectant&#xD;
      management, demonstrates that induction of labor at 39 weeks did result in a trend but not&#xD;
      significant lower frequency of the primary outcome - a composite adverse perinatal outcome -&#xD;
      (relative risk [RR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-1.00), but did result in a&#xD;
      significantly lower frequency of cesarean delivery (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76-0.93).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the cesarean delivery rate was a secondary outcome of the study and the absence of&#xD;
      any comparison for women's characteristics of those who were eligible and declined to&#xD;
      participate and those who were randomized, the recommendations of the Society of&#xD;
      Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM), American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)&#xD;
      and numerous authors have already considered that induction of labor ≥ 39 weeks should be&#xD;
      proposed in low-risk nulliparous women. In other words, on the basis mainly on the results of&#xD;
      a secondary outcome from only one single randomized controlled trial, they have proposed to&#xD;
      modify the management of the pregnant women who reach 39 weeks gestation (i.e. the large&#xD;
      majority of the pregnant women) while until now induction of labor for those women was&#xD;
      proposed only if abnormal medical condition occurred or beyond 41 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the findings of the ARRIVE trial are so important because the reduction of the&#xD;
      cesarean rate is a worldwide goal and the elective induction of labor ≥ 39 weeks seems to be&#xD;
      today the most effective way to achieve it. However, French context and obstetrical practices&#xD;
      are different than USA, with a lower rate of cesarean. Women's characteristics are also&#xD;
      different (i.e. lower body mass index in France). Consequently, the external validity of the&#xD;
      ARRIVE trial needs to be confirmed. Moreover, in the ARRIVE trial, the labor management has&#xD;
      to respect American recent guidelines with a longer duration of the latent phase and&#xD;
      administration of oxytocin if needed for at least 12 hours after membrane rupture before&#xD;
      deeming the induction a failure. A generalization of labor induction at 39 weeks without a&#xD;
      strictly respect of the eligibility criteria or labor management could result to an increase&#xD;
      of unexpected adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the expected benefits of labor induction at 39 weeks have to be confirmed in other&#xD;
      context, in particular in French settings with a lower cesarean rate than in USA by&#xD;
      replicating the ARRIVE study conducting another randomized controlled trial for which the&#xD;
      primary outcome will be the cesarean section rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This replication is crucial before leading to a such important change in daily practice that&#xD;
      would be considering routine induction of labor for low-risk nulliparous women at 39 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation and consequently modifying the organization of all maternity wards in order to&#xD;
      achieve this policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the replication of the ARRIVE trial in a French context, a prospective&#xD;
      observational cohort with 4,200 women is associated with this trial to identify a potential&#xD;
      participant selection bias.&#xD;

    <description>Elective labor induction via oxytocin between 39 weeks of gestation and 0 day and 39 weeks of gestation and 4 days for women with favorable cervix. Those with an unfavorable cervix (Bishop score &lt; 6) will first undergo cervical ripening (method left to the discretion of the practitioner) in conjunction with or followed by oxytocin stimulation unless a contraindication arises. Except for elective induction of labor between 39 weeks of gestation and 0 day and 39 weeks of gestation and 4 days, the obstetrical management will not be modified compared to routine obstetrical management.</description>
