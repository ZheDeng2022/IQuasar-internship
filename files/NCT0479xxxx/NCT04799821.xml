  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Walnuts have a unique nutritional profile, including the sleep-regulating hormone melatonin,&#xD;
      tryptophan, and omega-3 fatty acids, the two latest nutrients involved in melatonin and&#xD;
      serotonin synthesis. Although it has been claimed that walnuts may improve sleep, to the&#xD;
      investigators' knowledge, no studies have been conducted to objectively determine the impact&#xD;
      of walnut consumption on sleep and overall well-being. Therefore, this study aims to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of daily walnut consumption on sleep parameters (such as quality and&#xD;
      duration). Secondarily, it aims to investigate the impact of daily walnut consumption on body&#xD;
      composition, eating behavior, and well-being.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study to investigate the effect of daily walnut consumption on sleep quality will be&#xD;
      conducted in an 18-week randomized crossover trial, in which participants will be initially&#xD;
      assigned to intervention or control conditions for 8-weeks. After 2 weeks of washout,&#xD;
      subjects will be crossed over to the alternate intervention and will continue for another 8&#xD;
      weeks. Note that throughout the whole study, each participant will attend 5 visits: 1 initial&#xD;
      visit (baseline) and 2 visits in each one of the study conditions (intervention and control).&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate changes in eating behavior, the Spanish version of the Food Cravings Questionnaire will be used (Cepeda-Benito et al, 2000).&#xD;
This questionnaire evaluates 10 dimensions of eating behavior:&#xD;
Having Intentions and Plans to Consume Food&#xD;
Anticipation of Positive Reinforcement that may Result from Eating&#xD;
Anticipation of Relief from Negative States and Feelings as a Result of Eating&#xD;
Lack of Control over Eating&#xD;
Thoughts or Preoccupation with Food&#xD;
Having Intentions and Plans to Consume Food&#xD;
Craving as a Physiological State&#xD;
Emotions that may be Experienced Before or During Food Cravings or Eating&#xD;
Cues that may Trigger Food Cravings&#xD;
Guilt from Cravings and/or for Giving in to Them&#xD;
For each subscale, scores range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating a stronger sensation of craving.</description>

Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher well-being.</description>
