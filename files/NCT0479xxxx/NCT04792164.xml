  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A hernia occurs when an organ 'like intestines' or fatty tissue protrude through a weak point&#xD;
      in muscle or connective tissue and one of the most common types of hernia is inguinal.&#xD;
      Inguinal hernia defined as a bulge in the inguinal region or scrotum, may be accompanied by&#xD;
      dull or burning pain, which worsens by exercise or cough. There are 2 types of inguinal&#xD;
      hernia: direct and indirect. Direct inguinal hernia occurs because of a defect or weakness in&#xD;
      the transversalis fascia area of the Hesselbach triangle. On the other hand, the indirect&#xD;
      inguinal hernia which is the most common inguinal hernia follows the tract of inguinal canal&#xD;
      and result from a persistent processus vaginalis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate pain after inguinal herniorrhaphy delays the ambulation which leads to delay in the&#xD;
      hospital discharge. Besides that, is the chronic pain that affect 50% of patients which is an&#xD;
      important issue that needs to be dealt with.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim of this study, is to compare between postoperative period in the patients who&#xD;
      received US guided nerve block and in patients who received infiltration only before open&#xD;
      inguinal hernia repair, and to show that pre-emptive local anaesthesia will result in better&#xD;
      pain control, less postoperative complication, earlier mobilisation, earlier recovery and&#xD;
      less analgesia consumption by patients.&#xD;

      In this study our aim in detail is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Asses the outcomes (early postoperative pain management in day case &quot;day 1,2,3, 30 and 3&#xD;
           month and 6 month&quot; , length of hospital stay, analgesia consumptionØŒ recovery to work,&#xD;
           driving and usual activity) of the US guided nerve block in patients who underwent&#xD;
           inguinal hernia repair comparing to patient who received only skin infiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the advantages of the US guided nerve block in postoperative inguinal hernia&#xD;
           repair patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Demonstrate its compatibly as a one day procedure (less length of hospital stay), with&#xD;
           earlier return to work and driving and recovery in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compare our result with other international studies result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study in details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      it is Randomised Control Trial, Double blinded (patients and recruiter), study will be&#xD;
      conducted in King Fahd University Hospital, Khobar, Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. It&#xD;
      contains 2 Arms ,Two Parallel groups. The experimental group will receive US guided nerve&#xD;
      block and the control group will receive usual infiltration. Lidocaine+ Marcaine will be used&#xD;
      in both group with same concentration (1%+.25%). The random allocation will be done using&#xD;
      simple random allocation with a help of the following software (random.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will compare the two groups regarding, a questionary with visual analogue will be distributed&#xD;
      and data will be collected by recruiters regarding pain scale, length of hospital stay,&#xD;
      return to work, return to driving and usual activity, and analgesia consumption post&#xD;
      operative, all in day 1,2,3,4,30,3 month and 6 month post operatives (details in outcome&#xD;
      section).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are expecting to have a reduction in pain score from severe to moderate, about 20% in&#xD;
      experimental group, and reducing the length of hospital stay from 1-2 days to one day&#xD;
      procedure. And reduction in consumption of Analgesia postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      our sample size will be 134 with a power of 80% and an effect size of 0.5, will include all&#xD;
      patients who will have inguinal hernia repair and meet our inclusion criteria, in period of&#xD;
      12-18 months starting after obtaining of IRB approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patients who underwent elective inguinal hernia repair (will consider the hernia&#xD;
                size).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Age from 18-70.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Their ASA score 1,2 or 3 (American Society of Anesthesia)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Operation under general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Open inguinal hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. All emergency inguinal hernia repair and recurrent hernia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Children and pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Patients having regional anaesthesia. (Spinal/Local).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Laparoscopic inguinal hernia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SPSS latest version will be used for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Summary statistic will be obtained as frequency, and percentage for qualitative data,&#xD;
           and means, medians and standard deviations from continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis will be done by epidemiologist and biostatistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Our study does not have any physical, psychological, social, legal, economic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be reviewed by IRB, ethics committee; then the approval will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written approval will be obtained from the patients prior to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preemptive analgesia and infiltration are usually used in our practice and aim to&#xD;
           compare.&#xD;
