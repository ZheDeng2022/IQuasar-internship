      The evolving reports form recent studies are creating a promise on the potential use of&#xD;
      dextrose injections for treating arthritis and replacing current method of treating early&#xD;
      osteoarthritis by corticosteroids by giving long standing effect and improving patients'&#xD;
      symptoms and function. Over the past 5 years, an increasing number of level I and level II&#xD;
      studies have emerged, examining the effect of intra-articular prolotherapy for the treatment&#xD;
      of both hip and knee osteoarthritis. On the contrary, there is limited data in small joints,&#xD;
      such as the temporomandibular joint.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Carpometacarpal osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative condition of the hand that causes pain,&#xD;
      stiffness and weakness. It is the second most common site of degenerative disease in the hand&#xD;
      after arthritis of the distal interphalangeal joints. The prevalence of symptomatic hand OA&#xD;
      in people over 70 years of age has been estimated as 13.4 % for men and 26.2 % for women. OA&#xD;
      is more frequent in older age groups, leading to considerable disability with a burden on&#xD;
      health services and on the economy. Risk factor for carpometacarpal osteoarthritis of the&#xD;
      thumb includes being female, middle age, previous trauma, repetitive use and inflammatory&#xD;
      joint disease. Lifetime prevalence of this condition approaches 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injections are a useful conservative treatment modality prior to considering surgical&#xD;
      treatment. Corticosteroid injection is helpful in the treatment of the disease, but some&#xD;
      patients gain only short-term benefits. Evolving reports are showing promising results for&#xD;
      the application of dextrose as an alternative method for the treatment of Carpometacarpal&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, based on their induction for growth factors and inflammatory mediators. For&#xD;
      instance, prolotherapy has been used as a treatment of musculoskeletal pain with various&#xD;
      etiologies. It has been suggested that prolotherapy induces little inflammation and&#xD;
      stimulates endogenous repair especially by prompting release of growth factors. Dextrose is&#xD;
      an agent commonly used for prolotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evolving reports form recent studies are creating a promise on the potential use of&#xD;
      dextrose injections for treating arthritis and replacing current method of treating early OA&#xD;
      by corticosteroids by giving long standing effect and improving patients' symptoms and&#xD;
