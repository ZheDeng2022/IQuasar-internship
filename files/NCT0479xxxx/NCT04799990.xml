  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a common, chronic, inflammatory disorder which primarily affects the skin and&#xD;
      joints and is associated with impairment of quality of life. The main objective of this study&#xD;
      is to assess how safe risankizumab is compared to other therapies in treating adult&#xD;
      participants with psoriasis in real world setting in the United States. Adverse events will&#xD;
      be assessed using secondary sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skyrizi (Risankizumab) is an approved drug for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis&#xD;
      in the United States. Participants who are prescribed risankizumab or other comparator drugs&#xD;
      in the real world setting will be included in this study. Data from approximately 3000&#xD;
      risankizumab new users and 12000 other comparator new users across the United States will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive subcutaneous risankizumab injection or other comparative drugs as&#xD;
      prescribed by their physician. Data from these participants will be collected for&#xD;
      approximately 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no additional burden for participants in this study compared to their standard&#xD;
      of care as secondary data sources will be used.&#xD;
