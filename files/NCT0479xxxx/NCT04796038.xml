  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single arm, prospective, multi-center, trial designed to enrol approximately 66 patients. All&#xD;
      patients will undergo PCI using at least one RISE SC balloon as per routine clinical practice&#xD;
      and will be followed until discharge for data collection. Patients will be enrolled in up to&#xD;
      5 investigational sites in Switzerland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be followed up until discharge or until 7 days, whichever comes first.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  General Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Subject must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subject or a legally authorised representative must provide written informed&#xD;
                  consent prior to any study related procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Subject must have stenotic lesion(s) in native coronary arteries or bypass grafts&#xD;
                  that are suitable for percutaneous coronary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Subject must agree to undergo all protocol-required follow-up procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Subject must agree not to participate in any other clinical study during&#xD;
                  hospitalisation for the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Angiographic Inclusion Criteria All angiographic inclusion criteria are based on&#xD;
             visual estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. De novo or restenotic lesions in native coronary arteries or bypass grafts.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A maximum of two lesions, with either both in one vessel or one lesion in each of&#xD;
                  two vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. The target lesion(s) must have a diameter stenosis of ≥ 50% by visual estimation&#xD;
                  or online quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and may include chronic total&#xD;
                  occlusions (CTO).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  General Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Planned use of a non-study angioplasty balloon during the procedure for&#xD;
                  pre-dilatation or dilatation of the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subject has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin,&#xD;
                  heparin/bivalirudin, other anti-platelet medications, or sensitivity to contrast&#xD;
                  media, which cannot be adequately pre-treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Subject has a platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Subject is currently participating in an investigational study that may confound&#xD;
                  the treatment or outcomes of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Subject is pregnant or nursing. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must&#xD;

                  per site standard test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Angiographic Exclusion Criteria All angiographic exclusion criteria are based on&#xD;
             visual estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Unprotected left main coronary artery disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. More than two lesions requiring treatment. Tandem lesions, defined as multiple,&#xD;
                  focal lesions that can be covered by one balloon, will be considered as a single&#xD;
                  lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Coronary artery spasm in the absence of significant stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Anticipated need for plaque modification using rotational/orbital atherectomy or&#xD;
                  intravascular lithotripsy. Note: The use of scoring or cutting balloons after&#xD;
                  (pre)-dilatation with the study device is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Additional clinically significant lesion(s) in any coronary arteries or bypass&#xD;
                  grafts for which PCI may be required during hospitalization for the index&#xD;
                  procedure (in-hospital staged PCI).&#xD;
