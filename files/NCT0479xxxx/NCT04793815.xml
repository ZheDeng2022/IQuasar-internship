      Cryo-activation involves the insertion of a cryoprobe in the tumor bed with subsequent cell&#xD;
      necrosis and tumor antigens release. Such technique has the potential to induce&#xD;
      immune-specific reactions influencing cancer cells outside of the ablated region. The&#xD;
      addition of cryo-activation to immune-checkpoint blockers (ICB) in the advanced NSCLC setting&#xD;
      could represent a synergistic therapeutic avenue in order to potentiate treatment responses&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Innovative ablation techniques have gained momentum in the last decade in order to offer&#xD;
      alternative approaches to patients not amenable to conventional surgery. Cryoablation, a&#xD;
      procedure by which tumor cell death is induced through cycles of freezing and thawing,&#xD;
      represents such a pioneering technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure involves the insertion of a cryoprobe in the tumor bed with subsequent&#xD;
      application of very low temperatures leading to cell necrosis and tumor antigens release. In&#xD;
      the absence of significant heat-related denaturation seen in other ablative therapy&#xD;
      techniques (microwave, radio frequency, steam, HIFU, etc.) and as intracellular content&#xD;
      remains in circulation following cryo-activation, it is hypothesized that such technique has&#xD;
      the potential to induce immune-specific reactions influencing cancer cells outside of the&#xD;
      ablated region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phenomenon would be reminiscent of the abscopal effect, a reaction mediated by&#xD;
      locoregional radiotherapy exposure with the potential to trigger a systemic immune response&#xD;
      prompting metastatic disease regression. While such immune activation would in itself be&#xD;
      insufficient to eradicate tumor cells at distant sites, the addition of immunotherapy through&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibition in the advanced setting could represent a synergistic therapeutic&#xD;
      avenue in order to potentiate treatment responses in patients with NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase I/II clinical trial will be conducted in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      cryo-activation therapy in patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC amenable to&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 monotherapy (i.e. PD-L1 ≥50%).&#xD;
