  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) of a&#xD;
      parent coaching intervention for parents of youth hospitalized for suicidal ideation, suicide&#xD;
      attempt(s), or non-suicidal self-injury. Parents will receive either the parent coaching&#xD;
      intervention (which includes safety planning and behavioral parenting skills training with a&#xD;
      clinician and assistance with linkage to follow-up care by a case manager) or treatment as&#xD;
      usual (TAU) for the inpatient unit. The long-term goal of the research is to determine if&#xD;
      augmenting standard inpatient treatment with additional parenting intervention improves youth&#xD;
      treatment response on suicide-related outcomes (i.e., suicidal ideation, non-suicidal&#xD;
      self-injury, and suicide attempts). The goal of this pilot RCT is to collect preliminary data&#xD;
      needed for a larger RCT, including feasibility, acceptability, safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      engagement of the presumed mechanism of change (changes in parent emotions and behaviors),&#xD;
      and signal detection of any changes in youth suicide-related outcomes.&#xD;

      The present study is a pilot parent coaching intervention (PI). The investigators will enroll&#xD;
      N = 40 pairs of youth and parents enrolled in an adolescent psychiatric inpatient program.&#xD;
      This program, called the Stanford at Mills-Peninsula Hospital (STAM), is jointly run by&#xD;
      Stanford and Mills-Peninsula Hospital. All research procedures will be conducted by Stanford&#xD;
      faculty and staff. Parents and youth who provide informed consent will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive the PI + standard Inpatient treatment or standard inpatient treatment only.&#xD;
      Parents assigned to the PI + inpatient treatment will be offered 4 sessions of DBT-based&#xD;
      parenting interventions which include safety planning, behavioral parenting interventions,&#xD;
      and support for care linkage. Youth will participate in study assessments only and will not&#xD;
      receive additional treatment as part of the study (i.e., they will receive treatment as&#xD;
      usual). Study participation is optional and will not impact the family's ability to&#xD;
      participate in the inpatient treatment. Youth will stay admitted to the inpatient program as&#xD;
      part of standard clinical practices, regardless of whether or not they choose to participate&#xD;
      in the study. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 3-month follow-up, 6 month&#xD;
      follow-up, and 12-month follow-up. Both parents will be encouraged to take part in the&#xD;
      intervention, however; the participation of only one parent will be required. The&#xD;
      intervention will consist of 4 individual parent sessions, to be completed within one month&#xD;
      of youth discharge from the hospital or of care linkage whichever coms first. Sessions will&#xD;
      be 60 to 90 minutes in length and will be offered weekly. Therapists may see parents more&#xD;
      than once a week if needed, as long as the total number of sessions does not exceed 4.&#xD;
      Sessions will focus on safety planning and care linkage, Parent skills building, parent&#xD;
      conflict resolution, and parent self-care using adolescent DBT handouts.&#xD;
