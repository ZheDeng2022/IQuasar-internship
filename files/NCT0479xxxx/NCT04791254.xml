  <brief_summary>

      The rationale for this study is to prospectively investigate the outcomes of patients&#xD;
      undergoing standard dietetic interventions alongside treatment for their advanced&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancers, and to further characterise the relationship with body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of patients will be enrolled in a sub-study investigating the&#xD;
      neuronal-enteroendocrine-hypothalamic axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut hormone study. Our hypothesis is that proinflammatory cytokines produced by the tumour&#xD;
      can not only affect appetite directly through the vagal and the central melanocortin system&#xD;
      but also indirectly though the enhanced EEC activity; either through increased number or&#xD;
      increased function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will explore and compare the pattern and levels&#xD;
      (pre-prandial and post prandial) of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and gut hormones between&#xD;
      stage-standardised anorexic and non-anorexic cancer patients and age-matched healthy&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor nutritional status contributes significantly to poor outcomes in patients with upper GI&#xD;
      cancers, in some patients, directly leading to death. Poor fitness, in terms of reduced&#xD;
      muscle mass (sarcopenia) or physical performance, is associated with higher treatment&#xD;
      toxicity and poor treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However the relationship between different markers of nutritional status and body composition&#xD;
      with fitness is not fully understood. It is also not known what impact dietetic interventions&#xD;
      have on the reduced survival seen in patients with weight loss at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the underlying interaction between the neuronal-enteroendocrine-hypothalamic axis&#xD;
      that regulates appetite is poorly understood but believed to be impaired in patients with&#xD;
      upper GI cancers because of a number of altered mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the rationale for this study is to prospectively investigate the outcomes of&#xD;
      patients undergoing standard dietetic interventions alongside treatment for their advanced&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancers, and to further characterise the relationship with body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of patients will be enrolled in a sub-study investigating the&#xD;
      neuronal-enteroendocrine-hypothalamic axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that proinflammatory cytokines produced by the tumour can not only affect&#xD;
      appetite directly through the vagal and the central melanocortin system but also indirectly&#xD;
      though the enhanced EEC activity; either through increased number or increased function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will explore and compare the pattern and levels&#xD;
      (pre-prandial and post prandial) of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and gut hormones between&#xD;
      stage-standardised anorexic and non-anorexic cancer patients and age-matched healthy&#xD;
