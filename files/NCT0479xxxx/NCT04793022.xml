      This study is comparing total intravenous anesthesia with propofol with a regional nerve&#xD;
      block against general anesthesia with a regional nerve block on the primary endpoint of time&#xD;
      to meet discharge criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if using Total Intravenous Anesthesia&#xD;
      with Propofol (TIVA-P sedation) with a regional nerve block will decrease the time to meet&#xD;
      discharge criteria. This will be done with patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopic&#xD;
      procedures at the Roanoke Ambulatory Surgical Center. Currently, inhaled general anesthesia&#xD;
      (GA) with a regional nerve block is utilized for these outpatient arthroscopic procedures.&#xD;
      This involves the patient receiving Propofol through an IV to put a patient to sleep,&#xD;
      followed by intubation (breathing tube in throat) and the administration of inhaled&#xD;
      anesthesia for the duration of the procedure. Another approach for anesthesia in these&#xD;
      procedures is TIVA-P sedation. In this protocol the patient receives the same initial amount&#xD;
      of Propofol through the IV as they would if they were getting general anesthesia. Once they&#xD;
      are asleep, it is maintained with a continuous intravenous administration of Propofol. With&#xD;
      this approach, the patient is not intubated and exposed to the same anesthetic agents as&#xD;
      general anesthesia. As a result, the patient may not experience the potential side effects&#xD;
      associated with general anesthesia. We believe that this will lead to a faster time to meet&#xD;
      discharge criteria and also fewer of anesthetic side effects.&#xD;
