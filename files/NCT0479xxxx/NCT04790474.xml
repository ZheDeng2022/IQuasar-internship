  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic and relapsed and/or refractory MM,&#xD;
      after receiving bortezomib, lenalidomide and daratumumab during first and second lines, will&#xD;
      be eligible to be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first three treatment cycles, patients will be seen twice (Days 1 and 15 of the&#xD;
      cycle). Starting from cycle 4 and on, patients will be assessed once per cycle (Day 1), until&#xD;
      disease progression, for disease response and progression according to the International&#xD;
      Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. After progression, all patients will be followed for&#xD;
      survival; for this purpose, patients will be contacted every 12 weeks until death or&#xD;
      termination of the study by the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may continue to receive treatment for 24 months or until disease progression (PD) or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, the earlier of the three. Dose modifications may be made based on&#xD;
      toxicities. Patients who complete study therapy will continue to receive treatment per&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;

      This phase 2, open-label, single-arm, prospective, multicenter study will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of ixazomib-pomalidomide-dexamethasone (IPD) as a second or&#xD;
      third-line combination treatment for patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple&#xD;
      myeloma (RRMM) who progressed after receiving bortezomib, lenalidomide and daratumumab during&#xD;
      first and second lines. The patient population will consist of adult men and women who have a&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of MM, who have received two prior lines of therapy, and who meet other&#xD;
      outlined eligibility criteria. Following confirmation of eligibility, enrolled patients will&#xD;
      be treated with pomalidomide plus dexamethasone as standard of care and will also receive&#xD;
      ixazomib as a study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment regimen will involve administration of the following drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycles 1-3: during each 21-day cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ixazomib 3 mg on Days 1, 4, 8 and 11&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pomalidomide 4 mg on Days 1 through 14&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dexamethasone 20 mg on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 4 and consequently: during each 28-day cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ixazomib 4 mg on Days 1, 8 and 15&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pomalidomide 4 mg on Days 1 through 21&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dexamethasone 20 mg on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22 and 23 Patients may continue to&#xD;
           receive treatment for 24 months or until disease progression (PD) or unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity, the earlier of the three. Dose modifications may be made based on toxicities.&#xD;
           Patients who complete study therapy will continue to receive treatment per standard of&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main efficacy outcome- Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from first&#xD;
      dose to the date of the first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause. PFS&#xD;
      will be determined by an investigator, based upon laboratory data, as defined by the IMWG&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:Objective response rate (ORR)is defined as the proportion of patients who&#xD;
      achieve a best overall response of stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR),&#xD;
      very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR), as defined using the IMWG&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Survival (OS) OS is defined as the time between the date of first dose and the date&#xD;
      of death due to any cause. OS will be censored on the last date a subject was known to be&#xD;
      alive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to Response (TTR) Time to Response is defined as the time from the first dose to the&#xD;
      date of the first sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR. TTR will be evaluated for responders Duration of&#xD;
      Response (DOR) Duration of Response is defined as the time between the date of first response&#xD;
      to the date of the first objectively documented tumor progression as assessed by study&#xD;
      steering committee according to modified IMWG criteria or death due to any cause prior to&#xD;
      subsequent anti-cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional Exploratory Analysis RNA sequencing (by Massive Parallel (MARS)-seq method) of fresh&#xD;
      or frozen cluster of differentiation 38+ (CD38+)/CD138+ plasma cells (normal and malignant)&#xD;
      in the bone marrow of patients&#xD;
