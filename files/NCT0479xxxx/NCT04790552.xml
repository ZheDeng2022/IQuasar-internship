  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates how Fast Bar(TM), a specially formulated energy bar, when consumed with&#xD;
      coffee or tea, affects the physiological condition in participants after an overnight&#xD;
      fasting. Participants will fast for 19 hours (Fast Group), consume a Fast Bar in the night&#xD;
      (Night Bar Group) or in the morning (Bar+Coffee and Bar+Tea Groups) after an approximately&#xD;
      15-hour overnight fasting. Participants will be assessed for physiological parameters&#xD;
      associated with fasting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interest in fasting-based programs (i.e. intermittent fasting) for improvement of health and&#xD;
      longevity continues to grow. The short-term fasting (e.g. 12 to 48 hours in duration)&#xD;
      utilized in many intermittent fasting programs are considered safe, but some individuals may&#xD;
      find them subjectively difficult. As such, the question of whether the benefits of fasting&#xD;
      can be obtained while small amounts of food are consumed is of substantial interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One commercially available product that is designed to be consumed during periods of&#xD;
      intermittent fasting is the Fast Bar™, which stems out of the well-researched&#xD;
      fasting-mimicking diet to assist prolonged fasting. The unique formulation of the Fast Bar™&#xD;
      is hypothesized to minimize deviations in metabolic biomarkers associated with a fasting&#xD;
      state. This may ease the burdens associated with extended period of fasting. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the metabolic and subjective effects of Fast Bar, when consumed&#xD;
      with coffee or tea, after a prolonged period of fasting.&#xD;
