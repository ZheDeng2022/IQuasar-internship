        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical and neurological examination,&#xD;
             medical history, vital signs, and 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (QT corrected&#xD;
             according to Fridericia's formula [QTcF] less than or equal to [&lt;=] 450 milliseconds&#xD;
             [msec]) performed at screening and admission to the clinical site. Minor abnormalities&#xD;
             in ECG, which are not considered to be of clinical significance by the investigator,&#xD;
             are acceptable. The presence of left bundle branch block, atrioventricular (AV) block&#xD;
             (second degree or higher), or a permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter&#xD;
             defibrillator will lead to exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at&#xD;
             screening and baseline (Day -1). If the results of the serum chemistry panel,&#xD;
             hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, retesting of an&#xD;
             abnormal lab value(s) that may lead to exclusion will be allowed once during the&#xD;
             screening phase upon discretion of the investigator. At screening and baseline (Day&#xD;
             -1), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase,&#xD;
             and bilirubin must be within normal ranges. The participant may be included only if&#xD;
             the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not&#xD;
             clinically significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under&#xD;
             study according to both the investigator and to the study responsible physician (SRP),&#xD;
             are acceptable. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source&#xD;
             documents and initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI; weight in kilogram divided by the square of height in meters&#xD;
             between 18 and 30 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2) (inclusive), and body weight not&#xD;
             less than 50 kg at screening and on Day -1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and have not had a&#xD;
             vasectomy must agree to use a barrier method of birth control example, a condom for&#xD;
             the duration of the study plus 3 months after receiving the last dose of study&#xD;
             intervention, and all men must not donate sperm during the study and for 3 months&#xD;
             after receiving the last dose of study intervention. In addition, their female&#xD;
             partners should also use an additional method of birth control (which may include a&#xD;
             hormonal method, an intrauterine device [IUD] or an intrauterine system [IUS]) for at&#xD;
             least the same duration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood pressure (after the participant is supine for 5 minutes) between 90 and 139&#xD;
             millimeters of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher than 89 mm Hg&#xD;
             diastolic at screening and on Day -1. If blood pressure is out of range, up to 2&#xD;
             repeated assessments are permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of or current clinically significant medical illness including (but not&#xD;
             limited to) cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematologic disease, lipid&#xD;
             abnormalities, bronchospastic respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal&#xD;
             insufficiency thyroid disease, Parkinson's disease, infection including participants&#xD;
             with a positive of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)&#xD;
             specific test on Day -8 to -1, or any other illness that the Investigator considers&#xD;
             should exclude the participant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to JNJ-67953964 and its excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of&#xD;
             Mental Disorders (5th edition) (DSM-5) criteria within 6 months before screening or&#xD;
             positive test result(s) for alcohol, nicotine metabolites and/or drugs of abuse&#xD;
             (opiates [including methadone], cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamines, cannabinoids,&#xD;
             barbiturates, ecstasy, and benzodiazepines) at screening or at admission to the study&#xD;
             center&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of clinically significant drug and/or food allergies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant acute illness within 7 days prior to study intervention&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
