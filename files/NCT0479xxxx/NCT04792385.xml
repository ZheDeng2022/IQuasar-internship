  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety, compliance, and pharmacokinetics profile of estetrol monohydrate (E4)&#xD;
      15 mg combined with drospirenone (DRSP) 3 mg in post-menarchal participants between the age&#xD;
      of 12 and 17 years + 2 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, open-label, non-controlled study in healthy post-menarchal female&#xD;
      participants who will be enrolled to receive once daily E4/DRSP 15/3 mg for six (6) 28-day&#xD;
      cycles in a 24/4-day regimen (i.e. 24 days of active tablets followed by 4 days of placebo&#xD;
      tablets [4-day hormone-free interval]). The study will include 6 visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening visit (Visit 1), informed consent will be signed by the participants and their&#xD;
      parent(s) or legal representative(s) and the screening procedures will be performed. The site&#xD;
      will also complete an Eligibility confirmation phone call to the participant after Visit 1.&#xD;
      During the enrollment visit (Visit 2, between Days 12 and 19 of the pre-treatment cycle),&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be reviewed and the participant participation will be confirmed.&#xD;
      Participants will be trained in the use of an electronic diary and will receive the study&#xD;
      drug. A follow-up call will be performed after Visit 2, within 7 days following the first&#xD;
      investigational product intake. Afterwards, the participants will attend 3 on-treatment&#xD;
      visits at the clinical site [between Days 14 and 21 of the Cycle 1(Visit 3), Cycle 3 (Visit&#xD;
      4), and Cycle 6 (Visit 5)] and one visit after end of Cycle 6 (Visit 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants who consent to participate in a pharmacokinetics sub-study, blood samples&#xD;
      for this sub-study will be taken at Visit 3 and Visit 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be followed throughout the study.&#xD;
