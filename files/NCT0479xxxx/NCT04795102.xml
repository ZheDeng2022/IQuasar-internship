  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immediate implant placement into fresh extraction sockets is gaining popularity because of&#xD;
      fewer clinical procedures and maintenance of bone architecture compared to conventional&#xD;
      methods, thus reducing the treatment time and increasing patient satisfaction. In addition,&#xD;
      the survival rate of the immediate implantation is comparable to that of the healed&#xD;
      implantation sites. Recently, ATBG made from compromised teeth was applied in bone defects&#xD;
      and resulted in a good clinical efficacy. Moreover, it is more accepted by patients to use&#xD;
      extracted teeth as a bone graft material, especially in the case of immediate implant&#xD;
      placement. In 2020, KizildaÄŸ and coworkers studied the outcome of PRF as an adjunct with ATBG&#xD;
      on bone healing in rabbit peri-implant osseous defects. They reported that combination of&#xD;
      ATBG with PRF contributed to significantly higher new bone formation and better bone/implant&#xD;
      contact in rabbits with peri-implant bone defects. The main hypothesis behind this study is&#xD;
      that using L-PRF with ATBG following immediate implant placement could promote stabilization&#xD;
      of graft particles and enhance new bone formation with a shorter time. Therefore, the purpose&#xD;
      of this study was to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of ATBG on bone formation&#xD;
      with or without L-PRF around immediately placed dental implants in periodontally compromised&#xD;
      teeth.&#xD;
