    <textblock>
      This is a multi-institutional, single arm, open label, Phase Ib/II study of abemaciclib in&#xD;
      combination with elacestrant in patients with HR+/Her2- breast cancer metastatic to the&#xD;
      brain. Patients may have received up to two prior lines of systemic chemotherapy for locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic disease. There will be no limit on prior use of endocrine therapy&#xD;
      including aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen and fulvestrant, given a documented clinical&#xD;
      benefit of elacestrant in this setting.&#xD;
