  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several web portals for patients are available, but an assessment of their performance is&#xD;
      scarce. This is of particular interest among candidates for kidney living donation. A crucial&#xD;
      aspect of living donation is to provide standardized information about the risks of the&#xD;
      procedure. In 2019 it was launched a personalized digital care path for kidney living&#xD;
      candidates, which contains information about the donation process and facilitates the&#xD;
      communication between clinicians, transplant coordinators, and patients, enabling&#xD;
      telemedicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to investigate living donor candidates' experience with the Health Village web portal&#xD;
      and the digital care path for living donor candidates. The secondary aim is to investigate&#xD;
      their attitude of living donor candidates to eHealth services.&#xD;

      Background. Several web portals for kidney patients are available, but an assessment of their&#xD;
      performance is scarce. This is of particular interest among candidates for kidney living&#xD;
      donation. A crucial aspect of living donation is to provide standardized information about&#xD;
      the risks of the procedure. In Finland, the web portal Health Village contains general&#xD;
      information about kidney diseases. In 2019 it was launched a personalized digital care path&#xD;
      for kidney living candidates, which contains information about the donation process and&#xD;
      facilitates the communication between clinicians, transplant coordinators, and patients,&#xD;
      enabling telemedicine. The performance of this eHealth service has not yet been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. to investigate living donor candidates' experience with the web portal Health&#xD;
      Village and the digital care path for living donor candidates. The secondary aim is to&#xD;
      investigate their attitude of living donor candidates to eHealth services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. A prospective cross sectional survey study. Participants will be all kidney donor&#xD;
      candidates who have used the digital care path since its implementation in January 2019 up to&#xD;
      1.3.2021 (N=122). The surveys will include general data, the type of electronic devices in&#xD;
      possession and the purpose of use. eHealth literacy will be assessed with the eHeals&#xD;
      questionnaire. Platform's ease of use will be assessed with the System Usability Scale, and&#xD;
      participants´ opinion about the digital path utility with six questions. These items will be&#xD;
      answered with a Likert-scale. Finally, we added an open question for qualitative analysis.&#xD;
