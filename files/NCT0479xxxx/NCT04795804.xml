  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigators hypothesize (1) that the SCFA/acetate metabolism differs between&#xD;
      metabolic phenotypes and (2) that using a mixture of fibres that differ in degree of&#xD;
      polymerization and branching namely a resistant starch and a human-like milk oligosaccharide&#xD;
      enhance the acetate availability in the distal colon and systemic circulation, consequently&#xD;
      leading to its metabolic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study this, the investigators will supplement lean, normoglycaemic vs. overweight/obese,&#xD;
      prediabetic men with the fibre mixture the day before the clinical investigation day (CID)&#xD;
      and study during the CID its effects on fasting and postprandial substrate and energy&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
