  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the difference in the success rate of culturing&#xD;
      primary cells derived from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma specimens of patients which&#xD;
      obtained by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy wet suction technique and&#xD;
      surgery, analyze whether the sensitive chemotherapeutic agents screened by the primary cells&#xD;
      cultured from the specimens obtained by the above two methods are consistent, and whether&#xD;
      they are consistent with the clinical treatment effect of patients, verify the accuracy of&#xD;
      laboratory drug sensitivity results, so as to provide the basis for pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma patients to choose the source of individual treatment samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is one of the malignant tumors with the highest mortality rate in the&#xD;
      world, with a 5-year survival rate of only 7.2%-9%. Because some patients are resistant to&#xD;
      multiple chemotherapy drugs, and there are differences in drug sensitivity between&#xD;
      individuals, the current pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) chemotherapy effect is not&#xD;
      satisfactory. In order to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy and achieve precise treatment,&#xD;
      it is important to establish an accurate and individualized PDAC research model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, several studies have reported that surgical specimens of pancreatic cancer are&#xD;
      successfully used to cultivate preclinical research models. However, most patients with PDAC&#xD;
      have developed to advanced stage at the time of diagnosis and are not suitable for surgery,&#xD;
      which limits our ability to obtain tumor cells. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle&#xD;
      biopsy (EUS-FNB) can procure specimens when patients have not receive any treatment, and can&#xD;
      also evaluate the therapeutic effect and tumor progression in the process of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, there is no study to compare the efficiency of the two methods in constructing&#xD;
      preclinical research model of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, the investigators intend to&#xD;
      investigate the difference in the success rate of culturing primary cells derived from PDAC&#xD;
      specimens of patients which obtained by EUS-FNB wet suction technique and surgery, analyze&#xD;
      whether the sensitive chemotherapeutic agents screened by the primary cells cultured from the&#xD;
      specimens obtained by the above two methods are consistent, and whether they are consistent&#xD;
      with the clinical treatment effect of patients, verify the accuracy of laboratory drug&#xD;
      sensitivity results, so as to provide the basis for PDAC patients to choose the source of&#xD;
      individual treatment samples.&#xD;

    <description>The primary cells cultured from PDAC which obtained by two methods, EUS-FNB and surgery, are used to screen sensitive chemotherapeutic drugs commonly used in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and to see if there are any differences between the two groups.</description>

    <description>The results of the commonly used sensitive chemotherapeutics for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma screened by the two groups of primary cells are fed back to the clinician. If the patients have not started chemotherapy, the drug will be used according to the results screened in vitro to observe whether the tumor markers improved and the tumor size decreased. If the patients have completed chemotherapy, the laboratory results are compared with the clinical results of chemotherapy, i.e., whether the in vitro screening results of sensitive/resistant drugs have the same effect in vivo.</description>

    <description>Each patient participated in the EUS-FNB group and the surgery group. The procedure of EUS-FNB with wet suction technique is as follow: before the needle was inserted into the biopsy channel, the stylet was removed, and the needle was flushed with saline solution until the fluid dripped out of the needle tip. The air column was replaced with the fluid. A 10-mL syringe was prefilled with 2 mL of saline solution, and the valve was closed. The syringe was loaded to the 5-mL position (i.e. a 3-mL vacuum) and then attached to the proximal port and used for biopsy after inserting into the biopsy channel and puncturing the lesion. Each patient was performed 1-2 passes to obtain specimens for subsequent experiments.</description>

    <description>Each patient participated in the EUS-FNB group and the surgery group. The patient underwent EUS-FNB with wet suction technique first, followed by surgery (palliative surgery without excising tumor is not included) for pancreatic cancer. According to the size of the specimen, 0.5cm3-1cm3 tumor specimen was used for subsequent experiments.</description>

    <description>After informed consent, the investigators use two methods to obtain specimens for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, who needs eus-fnb for auxiliary diagnosis and had the opportunity of surgery. One method is EUS-FNB with wet suction technique, the other is surgery (including radical operation and cytoreductive surgery). Both methods are used on the same patient to remove deviations in results caused by tumor heterogeneity.</description>
