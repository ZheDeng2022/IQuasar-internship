  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human speech is as unique as a fingerprint and analysing speech had advanced so much that&#xD;
      speech can now be used instead of PIN numbers in banking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to find out whether changes in everyday speech can signal the&#xD;
      worsening of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are planning to collect voice samples from people as their asthma gets&#xD;
      better and worse in order to analyse the changes in voice quality - if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants donating the voice samples will remain anonymous and the voice files will be&#xD;
      transferred securely to our analytic system.&#xD;

      Over 18 users of the Smart Asthma app (by Smart Respiratory Products Ltd) will be asked if&#xD;
      they wish to participate in the study by recording voice samples. The question will be posed&#xD;
      within the app and can be answered with a tap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those interested in participating will be shown a short plain English description of the&#xD;
      goals and methodology of the project before enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 9 voice sample recording session will be carried out on the phones of&#xD;
      participants and take less than 2 minutes each, so participants will spend a total of fewer&#xD;
      than 18 minutes during the entire trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions will be offered after participants have recorded their asthma symptoms, lung&#xD;
      function and inhaler use in the normal course of using the app. Participants may accept or&#xD;
      decline each individual offer to record their voice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a chance to play each voice recording before sharing it anonymously&#xD;
      with the investigators. Participants can discontinue their participation at any time and can&#xD;
      ask investigators to delete all their data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be analyse collected voice samples for changes in voice quality. The&#xD;
      changes in voice quality will be compared against changes in lung function and asthma&#xD;
      symptoms to determine what changes in voice quality, if any, are indicative of a change in&#xD;
      asthma control.&#xD;
