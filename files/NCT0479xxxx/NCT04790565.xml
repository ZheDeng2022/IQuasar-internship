    <textblock>
      Antibiotic resistance has emerged worldwide and is of major concern leading to multidrug&#xD;
      resistant (MDR) bacteria that are widely spread and are a major factor in morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in health-care settings. Among MDRs, carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)&#xD;
      are of special concern, receiving the highest classification of &quot;urgent threat level&quot; in the&#xD;
      US President Report. Consistent mortality rates of 40-50% are observed among inpatients with&#xD;
      infections caused by CRE in hospitals worldwide, related mainly to unavailable, delayed or&#xD;
      ineffective antibiotic treatment options. The extremely high mortality rates of patients with&#xD;
      CRE infections have driven efforts to prevent the acquisition and spread of these bacteria in&#xD;
      hospitals. These include screening for carriage, contact isolation of carriers, cohorting,&#xD;
      dedicated healthcare staff and other infection control measures. These strategies have been&#xD;
      proven as effective but are cumbersome and expensive. In most locations these strategies&#xD;
      failed to completely eradicate CRE endemicity. CRE decolonization (eradication of&#xD;
      colonization) might offer a double benefit: reducing the risk for the individual carrier to&#xD;
      develop an infection due to the resistant strain (by that, potentially lowering the mortality&#xD;
      risk) and preventing the bacteria from spreading to other patients, exposing them to the same&#xD;
      hazard. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), in which fecal material enriched with&#xD;
      commensal microorganisms is transferred from a healthy donor, have proven efficacy in the&#xD;
      treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in multiple trails. Major&#xD;
      adverse events that has been reported so far are mostly related to the route of&#xD;
      administration (aspiration during nasogastric tube administration/colonoscopy). Other adverse&#xD;
      events include mostly GI related symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, belching) and are self limited&#xD;
      and resolve in few hours. FMT seems to be safe and effective both in immunocompetent and&#xD;
      immunocompromised patients. The high efficacy of FMT in the treatment of a multi-drug&#xD;
      resistant pathogen such as Clostridium difficile, suggest that it might be an efficient tool&#xD;
      for other MDR pathogens (e.g. CRE). The potential of FMT to restore the gut microbiome and&#xD;
      compete with residual resistant strains offer a novel way to fight the current MDR epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to assess the effects of FMT on colonization and clinical infections&#xD;
      with CRE. The investigators will apply FMT on a cohort of CRE carriers in a single center in&#xD;
      Israel. FMT will be given by capsules for 2 consecutive days followed by rectal sampling at&#xD;
      predefined time-point in the following 6 months.&#xD;
