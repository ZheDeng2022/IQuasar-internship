      The purpose of the study is to determine the impact of the offer to participate in the&#xD;
      Momentary Affect Regulation - Safer Sex Intervention (treatment) relative to the offer to&#xD;
      participate in the control condition on participants' reported condom use, use of effective&#xD;
      contraception, and number of sexual partners three months after the end of the treatment&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

      The Policy &amp; Research Group (PRG) will be conducting a rigorous evaluation of an innovative&#xD;
      intervention designed to reduce unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections in&#xD;
      young women with depression, entitled Momentary Affect Regulation - Safer Sex Intervention&#xD;
      (MARSSI). MARSSI was developed by Dr. Lydia Shrier of Boston Children's Hospital. MARSSI has&#xD;
      three components. The first is a manualized session with a sexual and reproductive health&#xD;
      counselor, who uses motivational interviewing (MI) techniques to help the young woman&#xD;
      identify a risk-reducing goal for her sexual behavior, develop a change plan, and provide&#xD;
      depression education and skills, based on cognitive behavioral therapy. The second component&#xD;
      is a mobile health (mhealth) application that the young woman loads on her smartphone and,&#xD;
      for four weeks, uses to complete app-prompted reports 3 times a day and a scheduled report&#xD;
      once a day. When she reports poor affect, low contraceptive or condom self-efficacy,&#xD;
      pregnancy desire, or desire for sex to regulate affect, she receives personalized messages&#xD;
      prompting healthy behaviors and cognitive behavioral skill use. The third component is a&#xD;
      booster session that occurs after 4 weeks of app use. The young woman meets with the&#xD;
      counselor again to review her behavior and relationships, discuss progress toward her goal,&#xD;
      and learn a new skill. Through these components, MARSSI aims to enhance motivation to change&#xD;
      risk behaviors, provides skills to address depression's effects on behavior, and prompts and&#xD;
      reinforces healthy affect regulation, cognitive behavioral skill use, and behavior change in&#xD;
      daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Policy &amp; Research Group (PRG) will conduct an implementation evaluation and an impact&#xD;
      evaluation, using an individual randomized controlled trial, to test the efficacy of this new&#xD;
      intervention. The study will target young women ages 17-20 who have depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      are recent clients of sexual and reproductive health clinics. The primary focus of the study&#xD;
      will be to investigate the impact of the intervention on three self-reported sexual&#xD;
      behaviors: 1) condom use; 2) use of effective contraception; and 3) number of sexual&#xD;
      partners. The study will also include exploratory investigations of a number of other sexual&#xD;
      behaviors and theoretically relevant antecedents to change in behavior and sexual health,&#xD;
      including but not limited to: 1) engagement in protective sexual behavior; 2) condom use at&#xD;
      last vaginal sex; 3) effective contraceptive use at last vaginal sex; 4) dual methods of&#xD;
      protection; 5) frequency of vaginal, anal, and oral sex; 6) substance use before any type of&#xD;
      sex; 7) types of sexual partners/relationships; 8) depressive symptoms; 9) sexual&#xD;
      communication self-efficacy; 10) motivation to change risky sexual behaviors; 11)&#xD;
      contraceptive and condom knowledge; 12) contraceptive and condom planning self-efficacy; and&#xD;
      13) use of cognitive restructuring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be assessed using self-reported, participant-level data gathered (by way of a&#xD;
      questionnaire) at four time points: baseline (enrollment); post-program (immediately after&#xD;
      the end of the intervention period; 1 month post baseline); short-term (4 months&#xD;
      post-baseline) follow-up; and long-term (7 months post baseline) follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting in May 2021 and continuing for 17 months, 600 participants who have received sexual&#xD;
      or reproductive health care from partner implementation sites in Alaska, Idaho, Washington,&#xD;
      Hawaii, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Kentucky will be recruited and enrolled into the study. The&#xD;
      final year of the grant will be used to complete the following tasks: collect follow-up data&#xD;
      from study participants; conduct implementation and impact evaluation analysis, reporting,&#xD;
      and dissemination efforts; and manualize and package the curriculum and training materials.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>A dataset will be prepared at the conclusion of the study, which includes de-identified individual-level data on all study participants who contributed self-report data. Respondents will be represented only by a research ID number. Included in the dataset will be self-report data collected across all survey administrations (including demographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, and theoretical antecedents to those behaviors) and select information on program participation (e.g., which program components were completed). Basic data cleaning steps will be taken in order to ensure data are unidentifiable and to increase usability.</ipd_description>
