  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a disorder of one or more of the parathyroid glands.&#xD;
      The parathyroid gland(s) becomes overactive and secretes excess amounts of parathyroid&#xD;
      hormone (PTH). As a result, the blood calcium rises to a level that is higher than normal.&#xD;
      PHPT is associated with several other metabolic complications as osteoporosis, kidney stones,&#xD;
      hypertension, insulin resistance, cardiac calcifications, cardiac arrhythmias, and kidney&#xD;
      failure. Renal function deterioration over time has also been reported. However, the role of&#xD;
      parathyroidectomy on renal function remains controversial in patients with PHPT. In some&#xD;
      studies, surgical cure of PHPT has been shown to halt renal function deterioration in&#xD;
      patients with coexisting renal disease. On the other hand, other studies showed no&#xD;
      significant impact of parathyroidectomy on renal function. Consequently, the goal of this&#xD;
      study was to evaluate renal function before and after parathyroidectomy in a large cohort of&#xD;
      patients with pHPT.&#xD;
