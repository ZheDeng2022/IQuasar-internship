  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is an emerging field for diabetes management. CGMs are&#xD;
      small devices primarily placed on a patient's upper arm that allow providers and patients to&#xD;
      individualize therapy by looking at real time glucose levels. While the accuracy of these&#xD;
      devices is extensively researched, there are no large-scale studies evaluating the&#xD;
      differences between left and right arm glucose readings in the diabetic population.&#xD;
      Additionally cinnamon and aloe vera are supplements commonly used by diabetic patients to&#xD;
      help improve glycemic control. However, there remains a shortage of studies researching the&#xD;
      effects of cinnamon and aloe vera on diabetic patients' glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference between glucose levels in&#xD;
      the right arm and left arm in diabetic patients and to evaluate if cinnamon and aloe vera&#xD;
      supplements impact glycemic control in diabetic patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is an emerging field for diabetes management. CGMs allow&#xD;
      providers to individualize therapy by looking at real time glucose levels, detect changes in&#xD;
      glucose and raise awareness for hypo- and hyperglycemic events.[1] Some CGMs can be placed on&#xD;
      the patient's arm to monitor glucose at regular intervals. The data is downloaded onto a&#xD;
      reader where it can be viewed or sent to a computer for more in depth analysis. There are&#xD;
      multiple Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved CGM devices. The FDA considers a device&#xD;
      to be accurate if 99% of glucose measurements are within 20% of lab results and if 95% of&#xD;
      glucose measurements are within 15% of lab results.[2]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accuracy and precision of CGMs is improving with increased use and advancement of the&#xD;
      systems in use. CGM data has been deemed accurate for self use to adjust insulin dosage,&#xD;
      detection of hypoglycemia and determining the clinical response to therapy.[3] However, CGMs&#xD;
      are a new technology and while they have vastly improved since they originally came to&#xD;
      market, there are still many concerns over their accuracy and ability to inform clinical&#xD;
      treatment decisions.[3] An analysis conducted on the reports to the FDA Manufacturer and User&#xD;
      Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database since 2015 revealed over 25,000 complaints of CGM&#xD;
      inaccuracy.[4]&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2020 Guidelines on the Standards of Medical Care&#xD;
      in Diabetes, it is stated that glycemic goals are achieved through glucose monitoring and, as&#xD;
      such, self monitoring blood glucose is essential for reaching these goals.[5] CGMs are used&#xD;
      to guide the treatment of diabetes including pharmacologic intervention, recommendations for&#xD;
      hypoglycemia prevention and nutrition goals. The recommended time spent in range, time above&#xD;
      range and time below range are also outlined in these guidelines.[5] The significance of time&#xD;
      below range is associated with the risk of hypoglycemia. The more time spent below range is&#xD;
      going to increase the chance of experiencing a hypoglycemic event which, if experienced, will&#xD;
      have both negative physical and psychological effects on the person. In the most severe cases&#xD;
      it can also lead to seizures, coma and death.[5] Increased time spent above range has been&#xD;
      directly correlated with incidence and progression of microvascular complications associated&#xD;
      with diabetes like retinopathy, neuropathy and kidney disease.[5] Time spent in range is also&#xD;
      significant because in addition to informing treatment decisions, it has also been correlated&#xD;
      to improvements in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). In a recent analysis of 18 studies reporting&#xD;
      paired HbA1c and time in range (%), it was found that for every 10% change in time in range,&#xD;
      there was a corresponding 0.8% change in HbA1c.[6] This could mean that if a person spends&#xD;
      10% more time in range, their HbA1c may reduce up to 0.8%. This is significant since HbA1c is&#xD;
      a gold standard marker of glycemic control in the diabetic population.[5]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies, the evaluation of CGM readings in the left and right arms of&#xD;
      diabetic patients is needed. The information provided by CGMs outside of glucose levels such&#xD;
      as time range information, hyper- or hypoglycemic glucose levels, and even immediate phone&#xD;
      alerts for very low or very high readings in newer devices highlights the ever growing and&#xD;
      critical role these devices play in the care of diabetic patients, and as such their accuracy&#xD;
      and proper use is of the utmost importance.[7]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cinnamon and aloe vera supplements are available over the counter and are used by consumers&#xD;
      for many different ailments. Both cinnamon and aloe vera have been used for several centuries&#xD;
      across many different cultures for a wide range of medicinal purposes. Diabetes is an example&#xD;
      of one of the disease states commonly targeted by these two supplements. Patients with&#xD;
      diabetes frequently consume cinnamon and aloe vera dietary supplements in an effort to&#xD;
      improve their glycemic control. As research into the effects of these supplements has&#xD;
      expanded, the understanding of their safety and practical uses has become better understood&#xD;
      and is generally accepted.[8,9] There are many dietary supplements or food classified&#xD;
      cinnamon and aloe vera based products on the market. Both cinnamon and aloe vera are&#xD;
      Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS status). However there is a lack of long term evaluation&#xD;
      of the effects of these supplements in the diabetic patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a controlled, prospective trial that aims to evaluate the difference in glucose&#xD;
      readings between the right arm and left arm using continuous glucose monitors in diabetic&#xD;
      patients. In addition this study aims to evaluate the effect of cinnamon and aloe vera&#xD;
      supplementation on glycemic control in diabetic patients.&#xD;
