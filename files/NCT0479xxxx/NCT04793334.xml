  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a common risk factor for the development of obstructive sleep apnea. However, not&#xD;
      all subjects with obesity develop obstructive sleep apnea. This study will attempt to&#xD;
      determine the mechanistic drivers between obesity and obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent disease with major neurocognitive and&#xD;
      cardiovascular sequelae. Obesity is a major risk factor for OSA, but the underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms remain unclear. Given the rising prevalence of obesity and the lack of adequate&#xD;
      therapies for some afflicted patients, further mechanistic work is clearly required.&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery is being done increasingly with compelling outcome data emerging; however,&#xD;
      clinical response to weight loss is highly variable. In some patients, OSA is not present at&#xD;
      baseline, despite morbid obesity, in other patients, OSA resolves following bariatric&#xD;
      surgery, while other patients have persistence of OSA despite weight loss, and still other&#xD;
      patients can experience re-emergence of OSA in long term follow-up studies after bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. OSA can occur due to several major pathophysiological factors including pharyngeal&#xD;
      anatomy, pharyngeal dilator muscle dysfunction, unstable ventilatory control, end- expiratory&#xD;
      lung volume and arousal threshold. As a result considerable complexity exists in the&#xD;
      obesity/OSA relationship, suggesting the need for further research. First, the investigators&#xD;
      will perform a baseline evaluation of pathophysiological traits among obese people prior to&#xD;
      weight loss surgery. Because some people will have OSA and some will not, the investigators&#xD;
      will define the potential mechanisms underlying OSA and potential protective mechanisms among&#xD;
      obese people without OSA (pharyngeal critical closing pressure Pcrit primary outcome).&#xD;
      Second, the investigators will re-evaluate these same individuals from the standpoint of&#xD;
      sleep study and pathophysiological traits six months following bariatric surgery after a&#xD;
      variable degree of weight loss. The investigators anticipate that some OSA patients will have&#xD;
      resolution of OSA whereas others will have persistence of disease. For non-OSA patients&#xD;
      undergoing weight loss, the investigators will have a positive control group which will allow&#xD;
      the investigators to account for non-specific effects of weight loss. This aim will allow the&#xD;
      investigators to test the hypothesis that pharyngeal mechanics is the predominant mechanism&#xD;
      whereby weight loss leads to improvement in OSA. Third, the investigators will perform&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging during wakefulness at functional residual capacity, total lung&#xD;
      capacity and residual volume on participants at baseline and 6months following bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. This aim will allow the investigators to perform structure/function assessments in&#xD;
      our participants, to define the impact of weight loss on pharyngeal anatomy, and to quantify&#xD;
      the lung volume dependence of the upper airway before and after weight loss. The acquired&#xD;
      data will also be used for computational modeling including dynamic assessment of pharyngeal&#xD;
      function during tidal breathing. As a result of the proposed research, the investigators are&#xD;
      confident that the investigators will gain major insights into the as yet unanswered question&#xD;
      &quot;why does obesity (sometimes) cause sleep apnea&quot;. This research will have major therapeutic&#xD;
      implications as it will allow the investigators to individualize therapy for afflicted&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
