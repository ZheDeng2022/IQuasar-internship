      Investigators have designed a single-center randomized controlled trial to compare&#xD;
      chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG)-impregnated dressing and standard dressing with respect to&#xD;
      their effects on the infection outcomes. The study was condcuted in the pediatric intensive&#xD;
      care unit in the 18 months period.&#xD;

      The single-center randomized controlled trial study aimed to compare chlorhexidine gluconate&#xD;
      (CHG)-impregnated dressing and standard dressing with respect to their effects on the&#xD;
      frequency of central-line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), catheter related&#xD;
      bloodstream infection (CRBSI), primary bloodstream infection (BSI) and catheter colonization&#xD;
      in critically ill pediatric patients with short-term non-tunneled central venous catheter&#xD;
      (CVC) in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary referral hospital in Turkey..&#xD;
      Pediatric patients aged 1 month to 18 years admitted to our PICU between May 2018 and&#xD;
      December 2019, who had received placement of a short-term non-tunneled CVC which had stayed&#xD;
      in place for at least 48 hours were included into the study. The patients were grouped with&#xD;
      respect to the type of catheter fixation they had received, either with CHG-impregnated&#xD;
      dressing or standard dressing, which were assigned in a randomized fashion. The groups were&#xD;
      compared with regard to the frequencies of CLABSI, CRBSI, primary BSI and catheter&#xD;
      colonization, as well as microorganism etiology. Any adverse event related to catheter&#xD;
      dressing were recorded. Independent risk factors of CLABSI frequency were analyzed.&#xD;

Catheter-related bloodstream infection defined as bacteremia/fungemia in a patient with an intravascular catheter with at least 1 positive blood culture obtained from a peripheral vein sampled immediately before or within 48 hours after catheter removal, clinical manifestations of infections (ie, fever, chills, and/or hypotension), and no apparent source for the bloodstream infection except the catheter.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  being aged age less than 18 years old,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  providing informed consent to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  insertion of a short term non-tunneled, percutaneously inserted CVC (jugular,&#xD;
             subclavian, or femoral) that would remain in place for greater than 48 hours during&#xD;
             PICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients were excluded if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  had known allergies to CHG-impregnated or standard dressing,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  would receive insertion of any other type of CVC device (e.g., peripherally inserted&#xD;
             CVC, tunneled CVC), were included in the study previously,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  had a current BSI (positive blood culture within 48 hours),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  had received CVC insertion within the 30 days prior to PICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additionally, investigators also excluded patients in which&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  catheterization had not been performed by the PICU specialist,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  those that were discharged from the PICU with indwelling CVC,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals in which the following events were recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Accidental catheter removal,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CVC removal before 48 hours, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  death within 48 hours after CVC insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In the event that a patient required CVC re-insertion after the initial catheter was&#xD;
        removed (due to any reason), only the first application was included in the study -given&#xD;
        that any other exclusion criteria did not exclude the patient. Finally, if a patient&#xD;
        required catheter reinsertion before the completion of the 48-hour catheter-infection&#xD;
        monitoring of the initial application, the first catheterization was excluded from the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
