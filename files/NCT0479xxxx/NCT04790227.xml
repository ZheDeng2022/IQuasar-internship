  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for patients with T3 or T4 and/or node-positive rectal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma is to offer preoperative concomitant chemoradiotherapy(CRT) followed by total&#xD;
      mesorectal excision (TME). 1 In 10-24% of patients, no residual tumor is found at histology&#xD;
      after surgery.2 These complete responders are known to have a very good prognosis, in terms&#xD;
      of overall and disease-free survival.2 A complete response also raises the hotly debated&#xD;
      question of whether surgery is still necessary for these patients, especially because total&#xD;
      mesorectal excision (TME) may have associated morbidity and even mortality and has the&#xD;
      potential risk of a permanent colostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a more conservative treatment is advocated in patients who show a good or complete&#xD;
      response to neoadjuvant treatment. In 2006, Habr-Gama et al. Presented the long-term results&#xD;
      of a prospective trial that investigated a &quot;wait-and-see&quot; policy in a carefully selected&#xD;
      group of patients with clinical and radiological evidence of a complete response after&#xD;
      neoadjuvant CRT. Results at 5-year follow-up were favorable for the nonsurgical group, with&#xD;
      an overall and disease-free survival of 93% and 85%, respectively 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, A watch and wait policy avoids the morbidity associated with radical surgery and&#xD;
      preserves oncologic outcomes. It could be considered a therapeutic option in patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced rectal cancer following chemoradiotherapy with a complete clinical&#xD;
      response.4 To safely omit surgery, it is essential to select accurately the right candidates,&#xD;
      i.e., the true complete responders. This selection is mainly performed using digital&#xD;
      examination, endoscopy, and biopsy, but these methods are not infallible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to assess tumor response&#xD;
      before surgical resection. By applying the principals of histopathologic TRG and by&#xD;
      exploiting the characteristic MRI low-signal-intensity appearances of fibrosis, it has been&#xD;
      possible to develop a similar MRI-based TRG system. The MRI-assessed TRG (mrTRG) was found to&#xD;
      be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) and DFS.5 Complete pathologic&#xD;
      response (pCR) after CRT has led to the proposal of a nonoperative approach as an alternate&#xD;
      treatment for highly selected patients with a complete clinical response (CR). Habr-Gama et&#xD;
      al reported findings from 99 patients with a clinical CR who were treated with observation&#xD;
      alone. The 5-year OS and DFS rates were 93% and 85%, respectively.6 In a recent study,&#xD;
      MRI-assessed complete tumor response was strongly correlated with pathologic complete&#xD;
      response and, therefore, can be used as a surrogate marker to predict absence of viable tumor&#xD;
      cells.7 Recently, Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) could be useful for response evaluation after&#xD;
      chemoradiation treatment (8-10) In 2009, Kim et al. showed in a study of 40 patients that DWI&#xD;
      in addition to standard MRI significantly improved the performance of radiologists to select&#xD;
      complete responders compared with standard MRI only&#xD;
