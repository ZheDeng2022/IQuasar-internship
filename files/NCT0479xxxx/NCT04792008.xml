  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an early phase study to assess how safe and tolerable is the new study drug YQ23 and&#xD;
      to compare the effectiveness of YQ23 against normal saline to treat critical limb ischaemia.&#xD;
      The study also aims to understand how it affects the body and an optional substudy to assess&#xD;
      how the human body takes up, breaks down, and clears the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomised to have a 2:1 chance to receive a single, intravenous,&#xD;
      fixed dose of YQ23 or normal saline. Neither the patient nor the study site will know which&#xD;
      treatment has been given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of YQ23 administration, patients will be asked to stay in the study site for 3&#xD;
      days for safety observation. After discharge, they will be required to visit the study clinic&#xD;
      for 3 times in a year to continue safety monitoring and assessment of treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject's participation will be about 13 months after signing the informed consent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2a, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of an investigational product, YQ23, in patients with&#xD;
      Critical Limb Ischaemia (CLI) during a follow-up period of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty-one patients are planned for enrolment. The study consists of a screening period (up to&#xD;
      28 days), a double-blind treatment period, and a follow-up (12 months). Prior to&#xD;
      randomisation, patients diagnosed with CLI will be stratified into:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group of patients in whom revascularisation is not planned&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group of patients with planned revascularisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each group, patients will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive single intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of YQ23 120 mg/kg and normal saline, respectively at the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of YQ23 administration, the patient will be admitted to the study site on Day 1&#xD;
      and will be discharged on Day 3. The total duration of participation in the study for each&#xD;
      patient is approximately 13 months. Data on the study endpoints will be collected from&#xD;
      baseline (pre-dose on Day 1), Day 3, Month 1, 6 and up to 12 months after study treatment&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
