  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of sildenafil in men&#xD;
      and women with Scleroderma with mildly elevated pulmonary pressures (SSc-MEP) to determine&#xD;
      whether sildenafil may be an effective treatment for SSc-MEP.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data shows that sildenafil (SIL) is an effective therapy in SSc-PAH. SIL has been safely used&#xD;
      in many patients with various vascular and cardiovascular diseases over the past three&#xD;
      decades. Randomized controlled trial data for SIL shows improvement in 6MWD, hemodynamics,&#xD;
      and even evidence of cardiac remodeling in PAH and SSc-PAH patients. Based upon these data,&#xD;
      SIL may be an effective therapy in SSc-MEP. This study will help determine whether sildenafil&#xD;
      could be a good treatment for patients with scleroderma that have mildly elevated pulmonary&#xD;
      pressures.&#xD;

    <measure>Difference in change in health related quality of life as assessed by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF36) questionnaire</measure>

    <description>As assessed by changes in SF36 questionnaire between sildenafil and placebo groups at four months and twelve months. The SF36 yields a set of scaled scores in 8 domains, with higher numbers representing a better quality of life. Each scale is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. In step 2, items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores. Items that are left blank (missing data) are not taken into account when calculating the scale scores. Hence, scale scores represent the average for all items in the scale that the respondent answered.</description>
