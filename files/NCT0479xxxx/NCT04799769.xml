    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, multi-centred, non-randomized study to investigate the&#xD;
      safety and performance of the PerQseal® + in up to 90 patients in up to 8 European&#xD;
      investigational sites. The PerQseal® + shall be indicated for the percutaneous closure of&#xD;
      femoral artery punctures and to induce arterial haemostasis in patients undergoing&#xD;
      endovascular procedures requiring an arteriotomy created with 14 - 22F sheaths (arteriotomy&#xD;
      up to 26 F).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be designed to be a phased study with an initial enrolment of 25 subjects in&#xD;
      phase 1. An interim analysis may be performed after phase 1 and the remainder (up to 65&#xD;
      subjects) may be enrolled as part of phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study shall not be blinded prior to, during or post the procedure. All patients&#xD;
      undergoing an endovascular procedure requiring an arteriotomy created by 14 to 22 F sheaths,&#xD;
      via the common femoral artery will be screened against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If&#xD;
      the patient meets the requirements of the clinical investigation, they shall be invited to&#xD;
      participate, provide informed consent and shall subsequently be assigned a 'Subject Number'.&#xD;
      The closure will be percutaneous. An optional adjunctive endovascular balloon may be used to&#xD;
      control bleeding. All safety data from the study will be assessed by the Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee on a continuous basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Purpose of the Study is to assess safety and performance of the PerQseal® + Closure&#xD;
      Device when used with the L PerQseal® Introducer to percutaneously close femoral artery&#xD;
      punctures and to induce arterial haemostasis in patients undergoing endovascular procedures&#xD;
      requiring an arteriotomy created by 14 to 22 F sheaths.&#xD;
