  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oncology management has changed dramatically over the last decade with the approval and rapid&#xD;
      adoption of newly targeted oral oncology medications. The movement to oral oncology&#xD;
      medications has altered the balance of risks and adverse effects (AEs) in the treatment of&#xD;
      cancer care. These treatments are associated with a different constellation of AEs and drug&#xD;
      interactions. Patients receiving treatment with oral anticancer treatment (OAT) encounter&#xD;
      several barriers to adherence, which may include limited access to specialty medications,&#xD;
      severe adverse effects, complex medication regimens, and special handling precautions.&#xD;
      Medication nonadherence not only reduces the efficacy of drug therapy but also has the&#xD;
      potential to increase healthcare expenditures due to disease-related hospitalizations. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the drug adherence in cancer patients, using the&#xD;
      medication possession ratio (MPR), before and after the implementation of a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      consultation program (MCP), on initiation of OAT.&#xD;

    <description>The multidisciplinary consultation program (MCP) was divided into 3 steps: the first step involved a consultation with an oncologist, the second step involved a consultation with an oncology pharmacist, and the third step involved a meeting with a coordinating nurse (CN). The CN put in place a regular telephone follow-up with the patient, a few days later (7 to 15 days), to ensure adherence and tolerance of the oral anticancer treatment (OAT).</description>
