    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study using a study device currently being prescribed by doctors. This&#xD;
      means everyone involved in the study will know the name of the product, only one product will&#xD;
      be used, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the sale of this&#xD;
      product. Although this is called a device, the product is an emollient-type lotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare workers (HCW) often suffer from signs and symptoms of skin irritation, including&#xD;
      pain, redness, roughness, dryness, cracking and itching due to the extensive use of personal&#xD;
      protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves. These are thought to be due to changes&#xD;
      in the normal skin barrier function induced by repeated minor abrasion in the warm, moist&#xD;
      environment induced by extensive use of PPE required at work. EpiCeram® Controlled Skin&#xD;
      Barrier Emulsion (EpiCeram) is a prescription skin barrier repair product containing&#xD;
      ingredients specifically designed to improve skin barrier function in people with diseases&#xD;
      known to be associated with barrier defects such as atopic and contact dermatitis. However,&#xD;
      EpiCeram has not previously been studied in people with skin irritation due to extensive use&#xD;
      of PPE.&#xD;

      Description of Procedures At the screening visit, the study will be explained, and the&#xD;
      subject will have the opportunity to ask questions. If the subject decides to participate,&#xD;
      the subject will have to read, sign and date this Informed Consent Document. The study staff&#xD;
      will take the subjects pertinent medical history to evaluate the subjects eligibility for the&#xD;
      study. The subject will be asked about the kind of skin products the subject is using as well&#xD;
      as about the subjects use of PPE. The subject will rate the subject overall skin irritation&#xD;
      on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 (ten) being worst and 0 (zero) being none. The subject will&#xD;
      have to score at least 4 (four) on the overall skin irritation scale to continue in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject had not used any lotions or emollients for the previous one (1) week on the&#xD;
      face and hands, Visit 2 activities may be performed at the Screening visit. If the subject&#xD;
      had used any lotions or emollients on the face and hands, a washout period will be necessary,&#xD;
      and the subject will be asked to refrain from using any lotions and emollients for one (1)&#xD;
      week between Visits 1 and 2 and then, for the duration of the study. Visit 2 (Baseline) will&#xD;
      occur seven (7) days after Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject is accepted into the study, the subject will return to the study site one (1)&#xD;
      week later and 28-days later, at which times the subject will complete the same overall&#xD;
      irritation scale. The subject will have measurements of skin barrier function tested,&#xD;
      specimens of surface cells collected and special photographs taken, all described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photographs: Special 3-D photographs will be taken by a digital camera that records the skin&#xD;
      microstructure and wrinkles. This 3D photo will be analyzed and used to assign a number to&#xD;
      measure skin roughness and wrinkles and track changes over time. These are not conventional&#xD;
      photographs, and the subject cannot be identified. Additional privacy steps will include&#xD;
      assigning a number to all documents instead of the subject name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin Function Testing: Measurements of skin water loss and surface skin pH, also known as&#xD;
      acidity, will be taken on the skin between the subject knuckles. These measurements are&#xD;
      performed by a short, rod-type device, emitting light, placed lightly onto the subject skin.&#xD;
      There is no sensation felt and the result is available within seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Testing: Two types of specimens will be obtained: a swab and tape stripping. A&#xD;
      single skin swab (similar to cotton Q-tips®) will be wiped across the subject palm to collect&#xD;
      bacteria. Non-invasive tape stripping of surface cells will be performed at 2 places on the&#xD;
      back of the subject hand. This is done by laying a specially made piece of tape, gently on&#xD;
      the subject skin and removing it, 3 times, to lift the surface cells. The specimens will be&#xD;
      used to estimate the presence, type, and number of specific bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the subject will be asked to avoid applying any skin products (except make-up) to&#xD;
      the subject skin for the following week and for the duration of the study.&#xD;
