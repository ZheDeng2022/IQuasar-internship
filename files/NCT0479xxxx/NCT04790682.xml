  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient with histologically proven NSCLC in a metastatic stage, treatment naïve and eligible&#xD;
      for first-line treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor. Combination with chemotherapy is&#xD;
      possible. Presence of a mutation after NGS analysis is required for ctDNA follow-up.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pre-screening consent will be obtained for NGS analysis on tumor tissue. Only patients with&#xD;
      at least 1 mutation at NGS on the tumor tissue will ultimately be enrolled in the study, to&#xD;
      have the possibility to follow the mutation using ctDNA. Main consent will be obtained after&#xD;
      results of the NGS and before initiation of pembrolizumab. Computed Tomography (CT)-scan&#xD;
      imaging will be done every 9 weeks as part of routine care practice. Blood specimens will be&#xD;
      taken with EDTA tubes or streck tubes at the time of puncture for pembrolizumab infusion at&#xD;
      baseline before starting treatment, at 3 weeks, 6 weeks and then every 6 weeks. Blood&#xD;
      immunomonitoring will be done before starting the treatment, at 6 weeks and at 18 week. An&#xD;
      additional measurement will be performed if treatment is stopped before the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Optional blood samples will be realized to analyse the degree of activity of the plasmatic&#xD;
      lymphocytes.&#xD;
