      This study evaluates the effect of lavender aromatherapy and cold application on pain during&#xD;
      drain removal. The investigators hypothesize that there is no difference in pain prevention&#xD;
      between lavender oil inhalation and local cold application.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is common practice to place a drainage tube in the peritoneal cavity after abdominal&#xD;
      surgery. Although drain application is an important initiative, the severe pain caused during&#xD;
      the removal process should also be controlled . Pain and discomfort continue to be a problem&#xD;
      during the removal of surgical silicone drains. In the literature, patients describe silicone&#xD;
      drain removal as a very painful procedure. Analgesics applied during drain removal are among&#xD;
      the commonly used methods in the treatment of acute pain . However, the fact that the&#xD;
      response of the patient to pharmacological treatment is variable and the pain cannot be&#xD;
      completely controlled with these agents necessitates the use of non-pharmacological methods&#xD;
      in addition to pharmacological agents in the control of severe pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the non-pharmacological methods used in pain control is cold application. Cold&#xD;
      application reduces the oxygen and nutrient requirement of tissues by slowing down&#xD;
      metabolism, and eliminates pressure and tension on nerve endings by limiting inflammation,&#xD;
      spasm and edema; It creates an analgesic effect by slowing or blocking the conduction&#xD;
      velocity of peripheral nerves. In addition, it increases the release of endogenous opioids by&#xD;
      stimulating the touch receptors with the gate-control mechanism, thereby reducing pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aromatherapy using essential oils is now used by many healthcare professionals in the UK,&#xD;
      Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Germany and Switzerland as a part of patient care to reduce&#xD;
      pain and stress. When the effects of essential oils used for this purpose are examined; It is&#xD;
      seen that it accelerates blood and lymph circulation, relieves muscle spasm and has calming&#xD;
      effects. It is reported that these effects of essential oils are both absorbed from the skin&#xD;
      and stimulated the sense of smell. In the literature, it is emphasized that some known or&#xD;
      unknown analgesic components in oils affect the release of substances such as dopamine,&#xD;
      endorphin, noradrenaline and serotonin in the brain stem, and that they have analgesic&#xD;
      properties that are said to be formed as a result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiological and psychological effects of aromatherapy have long been known in&#xD;
      complementary medicine. Lavender oil has been associated with its mood enhancing and&#xD;
      analgesic properties in healthy subjects and experimental nociception. This therapy has been&#xD;
      successfully used in clinical settings to alleviate a wide variety of pain, such as dressing&#xD;
      change in the intensive care unit, palliative care, for the control of labor pain, and&#xD;
      chronic pain. There are numerous studies describing the use of this therapy to relieve&#xD;
      anxiety and improve mood. Limited studies have shown that aromatherapy is beneficial for&#xD;
      women who give birth and reduces the need for pain medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the potential positive effect of lavender oil on the physiological and&#xD;
      psychological state of the patient and the positive effect of cold application on the pain&#xD;
      mechanism, our study was planned to determine the effectiveness of lavender aromatherapy and&#xD;
      cold application in controlling the pain that occurs during the drain removal process.&#xD;

    <description>Pain scores of all patients (lavender oil, cold application and control group) before removal of the drain were evaluated using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). The Numeric Rating Scale is used to digitize the level of pain that cannot be measured numerically. In this scale, patients are asked to describe their pain by numbers, with &quot;0&quot; for painlessness and &quot;10&quot; for the highest unbearable pain. According to this scoring system, less than 3 points indicate mild pain, 3-6 points indicate moderate pain, and more than 6 points indicate severe pain.</description>

    <description>Before the drain removal oxygen saturation level (SPO2) (percent) of all patients (lavender oil, cold application and control group) were measured. The researcher measured the oxygen saturation in subcutaneous arterial blood with a &quot;Pulse oximeter&quot; device that is reliable, easy to use, does not require calibration and does not cause pain to the patient in its application. Normal value of oxygen saturation (SpO2) (percent) was accepted as 96-98%. After placing a probe in the periphery (on the patient's finger) by the investigator, the signal received from the periphery and the value on the image screen (monitor) where the pulse wave sample was projected was recorded as oxygen saturation.</description>
