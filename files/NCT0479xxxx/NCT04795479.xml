  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This dedicated T/QT study will investigate the effect of relacorilant on cardiac&#xD;
      repolarization in healthy participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This four-period crossover study with 12 treatment sequences includes relacorilant&#xD;
      administered at therapeutic (400 mg once daily [QD]) and supra-therapeutic (800 mg QD) doses,&#xD;
      placebo for relacorilant as a negative control, and oral moxifloxacin as a positive control.&#xD;
      The positive control will serve to determine the sensitivity of the assay to detect small&#xD;
      increases from baseline in the QTc interval. Each of the four treatment periods will last 5&#xD;
      days with a washout of at least 10 days between periods. Relacorilant and placebo to&#xD;
      relacorilant will be administered double-blind; moxifloxacin will be administered open label.&#xD;
