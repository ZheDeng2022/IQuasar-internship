    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if in preterm infants &lt; 34 weeks' gestation at&#xD;
      birth receiving respiratory support with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or nasal&#xD;
      cannula (NC), CPAP compared with NC will decrease the number of episodes with oxygen&#xD;
      saturations less than 85% of ≥10 seconds in a 24-hour randomized controlled trial. This will&#xD;
      be a randomized controlled trial with a 1:1 parallel allocation of infants to CPAP or NC&#xD;
      oxygen using stratified permuted block design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hope to determine whether in preterm infants &lt; 34 weeks' gestation at birth receiving&#xD;
      respiratory support with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or nasal cannula (NC),&#xD;
      CPAP compared with NC will decrease the number of episodes with oxygen saturations less than&#xD;
      85% of ≥10 seconds in a 24-hour randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include preterm infants &lt; 34 weeks' gestation on respiratory support via CPAP&#xD;
      with a PEEP ≤ 5 and FiO2 ≤ 30%. There will be three randomization strata [≥ 22+0/7 to ≤&#xD;
      25+6/7 weeks, ≥ 26+0/7 to ≤ 29+6/7 weeks, and ≥ 30+0/7 to ≤ 33+6/7 weeks. The purpose of&#xD;
      stratification is to ensure an appropriate distribution of risk between study arms. This&#xD;
      study will not be powered to detect outcome differences within or between strata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent, randomization, stratified by gestational age at delivery, will be&#xD;
      performed using sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes. Each envelope will indicate&#xD;
      either Treatment group (CPAP group) or Control group (NC group). The envelope will only be&#xD;
      opened after informed consent has been obtained and just before starting the study on each&#xD;
      infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single center randomized controlled trial with a 1:1 parallel allocation of&#xD;
      infants to CPAP or NC oxygen using stratified permuted block design. 15-30 minutes will be&#xD;
      provided as a washout period at the beginning of the intervention, followed by 24 hours on&#xD;
      the intervention. Infants enrolled must meet CPAP stability criteria that are based on prior&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials of weaning from CPAP to NC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All infants enrolled in the study will have routine monitoring, uniform target saturation&#xD;
      ranges of 91-95% with alarm limits set at 88-95%, and standard care for the duration of the&#xD;
      study. The high alarm limit will be increased to 100% if an infant is weaned to 21% FiO2.&#xD;
      Supplemental FiO2 will be titrated per unit routine to achieve goal target saturations. Pulse&#xD;
      oximetry recordings will be downloaded using ixTrend (iexcellence, Wildau, Germany) software&#xD;
      to a secure computer system or via Bedmaster software for later data analysis. The target&#xD;
      oxygen saturations (91 to 95%) are based on data from the meta-analysis of randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials of oxygen saturation targets which included data on 4911 infants from the&#xD;
      SUPPORT, COT, and BOOST II trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcomes are described below. Other safety outcomes include recordings&#xD;
      of episodes of bradycardia and circumstances surrounding the event. Pulse oximetry recordings&#xD;
      will be downloaded using ixTrend software to a secure computer system for later data&#xD;
      analysis. Abdominal and cerebral NIRS will also be performed with subsequent data analysis..&#xD;
