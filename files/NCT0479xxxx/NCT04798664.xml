    <textblock>
      To compare the effectiveness of four interventions to promote sustained, biochemically&#xD;
      confirmed smoking abstinence for 6 months among underserved smokers referred for lung cancer&#xD;
      screening at four large U.S. health systems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a 4-arm randomized trial comparing 4 interventions to promote sustained,&#xD;
      biochemically confirmed smoking abstinence for 6 months among smokers in underserved&#xD;
      demographic groups. The 3,200 participants to be enrolled will be current smokers who are&#xD;
      Black, Hispanic, and/or have low socioeconomic status (defined as household income &lt;200% of&#xD;
      the federal poverty line or a high school education or less) or rural residence who are&#xD;
      referred for low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening at 4 large health systems. All&#xD;
      adult patients with LDCT orders will be further screened for eligibility. Eligible patients&#xD;
      will enroll and complete the study using the NIH-funded Way to Health online research portal.&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be biochemically confirmed, sustained abstinence from smoking&#xD;
      tobacco for 6 months following participants' selected quit dates. Relapse rates will be&#xD;
      tracked at 12 months.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective randomized controlled trial with longitudinal follow-up of patients over 12 months. Based on the expected accrual at each of the four health systems, we expect that overall there will be 470 participants in basic usual care (Arm 1), and 910 participants in each of intervention arms 2-4.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The EuroQuol Group's quality of life (EQ-5D) scale is a 25-item validated scale used to assess patients' perceived health-related quality of life across the domains of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.</description>

    <description>The Challenges to Stopping Smoking Scale (CSS-21) is a validated 21-item measure to assess patients' perceived barriers to smoking cessation. The CSS-21 has two sub-scales: intrinsic factors (physical, psychological or cognitive aspects of quitting) and extrinsic factors (social or environmental aspects of quitting).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy related to cessation efforts</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the 10-item situational measure of self-efficacy related to smoking behavior. This scale measures how sure participants are that they can avoid smoking in different situations.</description>

    <description>Temporal discounting is a measure of impulsivity that reflects people's tendencies to discount the value of a reward as a function of how far in the future it would be received. We will use the 5-Trial Adjusting Delay Task to assess temporal discounting.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Basic Usual Care</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants receive the usual care approach, Ask-Advise-Refer (AAR), which is a standard approach in which non-study clinicians ask smokers about their desire to quit smoking, advise them to quit, and provide informational resources such as hotlines, specialized clinics, or smoking cessation classes.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Enhanced Usual Care</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants receive the basic usual care of Ask-Advise-Refer as well as free access to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and/or reimbursement of up to $300 for any smoking cessation medications (varenicline/Chantix or bupropion/Zyban) prescribed by non-study clinicians.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Enhanced Usual Care plus Financial Incentives</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants receive all aspects of enhanced usual care plus an incentive plan in which they will be informed of their eligibility to earn $100, $200, and $300 if they submit negative tests for nicotine metabolites at 2 weeks, 3 month and 6 months following their quit date, respectively.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Enhanced Usual Care plus Financial Incentives plus Mobile Health Application</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants receive all aspects of Arm 3 plus an intervention to promote episodic future thinking (EFT), called FutureMe. EFT has been shown to reliably reduce discounting of the future. Patients will practice using EFT cues to envision the &quot;future is now&quot; between the time of enrollment and the quit date, and will then receive cues from the quit date through the end of the intervention period, 6 months later, unless they ask to stop receiving cues sooner.</description>
