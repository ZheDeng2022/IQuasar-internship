    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease characterized by joint degeneration with subchondral and&#xD;
      periosteal lesions . Coxarthrosis (hip osteoarthritis) is an important cause of disability,&#xD;
      especially in the advanced age group. The risk of symptomatic coxarthrosis in persons up to&#xD;
      the age of 85 is approximately 25%. There is a possibility of total hip replacement at a rate&#xD;
      of approximately 10% due to advanced stage coxarthrosis. Kellgren-Lawrence staging system is&#xD;
      used to show disease severity in osteoarthritis staging. According to this, Stage 0: there is&#xD;
      no radiological change, Stage 1: there is a slight narrowing in the joint space, Stage 2:&#xD;
      osteophytes are formed in the joint space with stenosis in the anteroposterior radiography,&#xD;
      Stage 3: multiple osteophytes, significant narrowing of the joint space, sclerosis and Stage&#xD;
      4 It describes a situation accompanied by large osteophytes, severe stenosis in the joint&#xD;
      space, prominent sclerosis, and bone deformities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although coxarthrosis is often thought to be a non-inflammatory pathology, recent studies&#xD;
      have shown that joint degeneration correlates with the production of inflammatory factors and&#xD;
      cartilage destroying enzymes. At the cellular level, it has been found that macrophage and&#xD;
      perivascular T and B lymphocyte infiltration play a role in early and advanced stage OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neutrophils and lymphocytes are the main determinants of the inflammatory process. The&#xD;
      neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is obtained by dividing the absolute neutrophil count by&#xD;
      the number of lymphocytes obtained from the peripheral blood count. They are used as an&#xD;
      indicator of the inflammatory process in inflammatory conditions such as ankylosing&#xD;
      spondylitis, sarcoidosis, and cancers. In addition, platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) has also&#xD;
      been found to be associated with disease activity and severity in diseases such as rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. Its use in the diagnosis and follow-up of OA has not yet&#xD;
      been clearly demonstrated. However, changes in mean platelet volume are also used as an&#xD;
      indicator of disease severity in systemic inflammatory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are very few studies evaluating the correlation of Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio,&#xD;
      monocyte lymphocyte ratio and Platelet lymphocyte ratio with inflammatory parameters CRP and&#xD;
      ESR levels in hip osteoarthritis and its relation with the staging of hip osteoatritis. The&#xD;
      aim of this study to evaluate of the correlation of the inflammatory parameters with pain and&#xD;
      radiological findings in the patients with coxarthrosis.&#xD;

    <description>pain of the hip joints of the participants. It will be evaluated by using Visual Analog Scale(VAS). The scale is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity, which has been widely used in diverse adult populations. The pain range is from 1 to 10. The minimum value is 1 and it means the pain is so mild. The maximum value is 10, it means the pain is so much, like a knife stabs.</description>
