      This is an open label randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and treatment duration with&#xD;
      vedolizumab to patients with immune mediated colitis. The trial will include 82 patients&#xD;
      randomized into two arms, either standard treatment with prednisolone (plus infliximab in&#xD;
      severe cases) or vedolizumab treatment up front.&#xD;

      Background information Immune check point inhibitors (ICPI) have revolutionized the treatment&#xD;
      of a growing number of cancer forms resulting in a rapidly increasing number of patients&#xD;
      treated with these drugs within the very recent years. The aim is to allow and boost an&#xD;
      immune response towards the neoantigens of neoplastic cells, but the blockage of inhibitory&#xD;
      signals might also interfere with normal barriers against the development of autoimmunity or&#xD;
      autoimmune-like reactions and thus lead to a number of immune-related adverse events (IrAEs).&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal inflammation - typically colitis - is the most common IrAE among ICPI&#xD;
      treated patients. Vedolizumab, a integrin antibody, has been shown to be highly effective in&#xD;
      treating ICPI induced colitis with remission rates of 85%. Vedolizumab has a better safety&#xD;
      profile than anti-tumor necrosis factor antibodies, including infliximab, with lower risk of&#xD;
      infections and tumor development in inflammatory bowel disease patients. Moreover,&#xD;
      vedolizumab does not seem to inhibit tumor specific T cell responses in vitro, suggesting&#xD;
      that this treatment is also beneficial with regards to tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vedolizumab induction and maintenance treatment of patients with ICPI related intestinal&#xD;
      symptoms and evidence of colitis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is effective in inducing remission of the colitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduces the risk of progression from grade 2 to grade 3 or 4 colitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reduces the need of systemic corticosteroid&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is not associated with increased risk of tumor progression or other serious adverse&#xD;
           events including serious infections&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Allows reintroduction/continuation of ICPI treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further it is hypothesized that ICPI induced colitis can be diagnosed and monitored by&#xD;
      intestinal bowel ultrasound and treatment response is associated with multi-omics changes in&#xD;
      intestinal tissue, tumor tissue, feces, blood, and urine, e.g. peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells (PBMCs) RNAseq profiles, profiles of single cell RNAseq from isolated immune cells from&#xD;
      standard pinch biopsies from the inflamed colon and composition of the microbiota. Lastly, it&#xD;
      is hypothesized, that anti-tumor T-cell function is affected in vivo by the medication used&#xD;
      to treat ICPI induced colitis, and that this can be assessed by changes in single cell RNAseq&#xD;
      profiles of tumor resident T-cells (isolated from tumor biopsies).&#xD;
