    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess if melatonin given for three nights before wisdom tooth&#xD;
      surgery decreases post-operative pain and pain medication consumption. Patients will receive&#xD;
      either melatonin or a placebo for three nights prior to surgery and we will measure&#xD;
      pre-operative anxiety, preoperative sleep quality, post op pain medication consumption, post&#xD;
      op pain scores, and blood values.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will receive either melatonin or a placebo for three nights prior to surgery and the investigator will measure pre-operative anxiety, preoperative sleep quality, post op pain medication consumption, post op pain scores, and blood values. The investigators would like to determine if melatonin can prevent preoperative anxiety, improve preoperative sleep, prevent excess narcotic consumption, and decrease post operative inflammation.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative narcotic consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>We will measure this and participants will complete the above mentioned survey. From the time participants are enrolled in the study, to completion of these surveys will take about 2-4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure the postoperative consumption of narcotic pain medication consumption. The investigators will measure this for approximately 72 hours post operatively, there are three total surveys and each survey will take about 3 minutes to complete. The surveys will be received via text message or email and link to Surveymonkey. These surveys will come in the morning approximately 1 day after surgery, 2 days after surgery, and 3 days after surgery. The surveys will ask for the participant ID and will then ask how many tablets of ibuprofen 600mg and hydrocodone-acetaminophen have been taken since surgery or the previous survey depending on if the survey is received on day 1 versus 2 and 3.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inflammatory markers</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood draws at the consultation, surgery day, and at the 5 day post operative visit (~2-4 week window).</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure blood levels of IL6, IL8, TNF-alpha, and CRP to try and estimate the systemic inflammatory response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preoperative Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>On day of surgery the patients will fill out a short survey, described above. This survey will be given on the day of surgery, 2-4 weeks after enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will fill out a survey to estimate their anxiety levels immediately before surgery. The investigators will measure this immediately before surgery with a survey. The survey will ask a series of 4 questions about anxiety and 1 question about sleep quality. Participants will be asked to described their anxiety on a scale of approximately 1 to 5 (1 not at all, 5 extremely highly) in relation to how worried they are about the procedure and anesthetic as well as how often they think about the procedure and anesthetic. The last question about sleep asks the participants to describe their sleep quality during the three nights prior to surgery on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 most improved, 5 much worse).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post operative pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will fill out a short survey, described above. From the time participants are enrolled in the study, to completion of these surveys will take about 2-4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will complete a survey and describe their pain levels on a scale 0-100. The investigators will measure this for approximately 72 hours post operatively, there are four total surveys and each survey will take about 2 minutes to complete. The surveys will be received via text message or email and link to Surveymonkey. These surveys will come in the morning approximately 1 day after surgery, 2 days after surgery, 3 days after surgery and the last survey will be administered on paper at the postoperative follow up, day 5. The surveys will ask for the participant ID and will then ask the participant to describe their worst pain they have experienced since surgery or the previous survey depending on if the survey is received on day 1 versus 2, 3, and 5.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Heart rate will be measured two times, once at the consultation and again at the surgery appointment 2-4 weeks later.</time_frame>
    <description>The heart rate will be measured at the consultation and surgery appointment for comparison between groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>MAP will be measured two times, once at the consultation and again at the surgery appointment 2-4 weeks later.</time_frame>
    <description>The mean arterial pressure (MAP) will be measured at the consultation and surgery appointment for comparison between groups.</description>
