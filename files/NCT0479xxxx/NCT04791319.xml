    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)-75 (Greater Than or Equal to [&gt;=] 75 Percent (%) Improvement From Baseline) for Efficacy of Bermekimab at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD). The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72, with higher score indicative of more severe disease. Four AD disease characteristics (erythema, thickness [induration, papulation, edema], scratching [excoriation], and lichenification) will each be assessed for severity by the investigator or designee on a scale of &quot;0&quot; (absent) through &quot;3&quot; (severe). In addition, the area of AD involvement will be assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk, arms, and legs and converted to a score of 0 to 6.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Both Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) Score of 0 or 1 and a Reduction From Baseline of &gt;=2 Points for Additional Assessments of Bermekimab at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The vIGA-AD is an assessment instrument used in clinical studies to rate the severity of AD, based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). The IGA score is selected using the morphological descriptors that best describe the overall appearance of the AD lesions at a given time point.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Improvement (Reduction) of Eczema-Related Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Value of &gt;=4 From Baseline to Week 16 Among Participants With a Baseline Itch Value &gt;=4 for Additional Assessments of Bermekimab</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Itch NRS is a 2-item participant-reported outcome that participants will use to rate the severity of their eczema-related itch daily. Participants will be asked the following question: Please rate the severity of your eczema-related itch at its worst in the past 24 hours on a 0 to 10 NRS ranging from 0 &quot;none&quot; to 10 &quot;worst possible.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With EASI-90 (&gt;=90% improvement in EASI from Baseline) for Additional Assessments of Bermekimab at Week 16</measure>
