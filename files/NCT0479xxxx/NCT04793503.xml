      The aim of this study was to compare the MBF and chewing efficiency of complete denture bases&#xD;
      fabricated by conventional, 3D printing and milling techniques. The research hypothesis was&#xD;
      that, there are no signiﬁcant differences in MBF and chewing efﬁciency in complete dentures&#xD;
      fabricated by the three methods.&#xD;

      Participant selection and treatment This study will include a clinical experiment with a&#xD;
      cross-over clinical trial design. For this study, 27completely edentulous participants with&#xD;
      age range of 50-65 were selected from the outpatient clinic of the Removable Prosthodontic&#xD;
      Department, Faculty of dentistry, Kafr Elsheikh University, Egypt. All participants had Angle&#xD;
      class I jaw relation maxillomandibular relationship, normal alveolar ridge volume, no&#xD;
      temporomandibular joint disorders, no heart disease, and no systemic diseases that affect the&#xD;
      complete denture treatment procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reduce the effect of order of treatment on MBF, were successively given the following&#xD;
      prosthesis i) complete dentures fabricated by the conventional technique ii) 3D printed&#xD;
      complete dentures iii) milled complete dentures in a random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Construction of the CADCAM 3D printed denture The same steps of the conventional technique&#xD;
      will be performed till the adjustment of occlusion rims then in the dental laboratory, the&#xD;
      maxillary and mandibular definitive casts and the occlusal rims will be prepared for scanning&#xD;
      with scan spray. Scanning will be performed with an optical 3D scanner . The files from the&#xD;
      laser-scan will be translated into stereolithography (STL) files and the CDs are virtually&#xD;
      designed in ExoCad software. After minor modifications in the positions of teeth were made,&#xD;
      fabrication of the dentures will be approved and the digital denture base will be fabricated&#xD;
      using 3D printing technique from Dental Pink resin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Construction of the CAD/CAM milled denture Once the complete denture has been virtually&#xD;
      designed in CAD software (ExoCad software) a preview will be sent for evaluation using 3D&#xD;
      viewing software. After minor modifications in the positions of teeth were made, fabrication&#xD;
      of the dentures will be approved. The digital denture will be fabricated by the command&#xD;
      software of the milling machine (ExoCad 5x milling machine) from prepolymerized resin acrylic&#xD;
      pucks and the teeth (TSM Acetal Dental) were milled into template .After that the denture&#xD;
      will be finished and polished according to the traditional procedures For all groups, after&#xD;
      placement, clinical evaluations of the fit, retention, stability, occlusal relationship,&#xD;
      esthetics, and phonetics were performed. Assessment of the occlusion was made with&#xD;
      articulating paper, chairside adjustments were made and premature contacts were corrected.&#xD;
      The patient was given a proper program for denture insertion and oral hygiene measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of biting force&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This will be made by using a custom-made device composed of Flexiforce A 301® force&#xD;
           sensor and Arduino microcontroller with a crystal display. The sensor is calibrated by&#xD;
           known weight object for several times, and the sensor is covered by 3 mm layer of putty&#xD;
           rubber base material.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Readings will be performed at 1 week, 1 month and 3 months follow-up periods. Assessment&#xD;
           of chewing efficiency The chewing efﬁciency will be evaluated according to the procedure&#xD;
           described by Schimmel et al. (2007) using a chewing gum. Specimens will be prepared from&#xD;
           two colored gums one with the ﬂavor &quot;Sour Berry&quot; (white color) and the other with the&#xD;
           ﬂavor &quot;Fancy Fruit&quot; (orange color). Two strips of a standard size (30 9 18 9 3 mm) will&#xD;
           be cut from each gum and manually stuck together. Patients will be instructed to chew&#xD;
           ﬁve samples of gum on their preferred chewing side for 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 cycles,&#xD;
           respectively. Between the different tests, an interval of at least 1 min will be imposed&#xD;
           to reduce the effect of fatigue. The total duration of the experiments was approximately&#xD;
           8 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After chewing, the samples will be then spat into transparent plastic bags, which The samples&#xD;
      will be then scanned from both sides with a of resolution 500 dots per inch. The numbers of&#xD;
      selected pixels will be recorded from the histogram for each side, and mean of those ﬁgures&#xD;
      will be calculated. To assess the reproducibility of chewing, the subjects will be available&#xD;
      to repeat the experiments on a different day.&#xD;

• The device was placed between the upper and lower first molar. The patient then was instructed to bite as hard as possible for a period of 3 s three times in succession, with at least 20 s of resting between each bite. The readings were recorded, and the average bite force was calculated</description>
