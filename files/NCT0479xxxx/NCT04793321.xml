  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different baby carrying methods&#xD;
      (including carrying in arms and carrying in a baby carrier) in the females' balance during&#xD;
      standing and walking.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Babywearing is defined as using a supporting device that helps to keep an infant close to a&#xD;
      caregiver's trunk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practice of babywearing has many benefits to both children and caregivers as it is an&#xD;
      extension of &quot;skin-to-skin care (SSC)&quot; or &quot;kangaroo care&quot; which has well-known therapeutic&#xD;
      benefits. Such benefits for the infant include: improve physical and cognitive state, good&#xD;
      sleep, less likely to continuously cry, better breastfeeding, temperature stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For mothers, many benefits were found as well for example lower stress and anxiety levels,&#xD;
      decrease in heart rate HR and blood pressure BP, higher breastfeeding rates, increase&#xD;
      maternal satisfaction, increased bonding of mother with their neonate .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the great advantage of infant carrying, there are many adverse effects on the&#xD;
      musculoskeletal system and ergonomics of the mother. Women who carry their babies throughout&#xD;
      the day will probably have similar consequences as carrying an extra load so pain and&#xD;
      injuries will occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that infant carrying in-arms caused acute muscle soreness in the&#xD;
      ipsilateral upper limb that was used to support the infant over the left shoulder. While&#xD;
      during the front infant carrying methods (ICMs), the pressure of the infant carrier shoulder&#xD;
      straps caused shoulder discomfort and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The front infant carrying position has the next highest fatigue score as it results in lower&#xD;
      Metabolic equivalent (METS) and VO2max value which means that it places significant demand on&#xD;
      the metabolic system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It have been reported that the increased cost of carrying an infant in one's arms is the&#xD;
      cause for the development of infant carrying tools rapidly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infant carrying is a form of exterogestation, just like in pregnancy, there is an alteration&#xD;
      that swings the center of gravity of the body, shifts the postural balance, and increases the&#xD;
      risk of falls .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrariwise, the usage of the carrier resulted in more similar postural control variables to&#xD;
      the unloaded condition. Mannen and colleagues advised the use of babywearing as it provides a&#xD;
      mechanical advantage to the caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surprisingly, no study so far has quantified the actual balance changes with different&#xD;
      carrying methods (including carrying in arms and carrying in a baby carrier) during typical&#xD;
      movements of daily life, such as walking or standing upright.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research has indicated that carrying externals loads elicits an increase in the&#xD;
      center of pressure (COP) measures of postural sway during quiet standing .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mathew W. Hill &amp; Price reported that holding external loads during standing is an important&#xD;
      issue for many daily and occupational activities and these external loads can affect postural&#xD;
      stability, which is important for the mother's and fetus's safety. Also, holding a load in&#xD;
      the hand may have restricted and/or delayed postural reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From this perspective, both carrying methods are considered extra load and the question is&#xD;
      that there any carrying methods that have an advantage over others concerning balance?&#xD;

    <description>The Biodex Balance System SD (The Biodex Balance System SD Model 945-300, 115 VAC, Shirley, NY, USA) is used to assess the balance in this study.&#xD;
It is an objective device that measures dynamic postural stability. It uses a circular platform that allows up to 20˚of of platform tilt in a 360˚ range of motion.&#xD;
The measures of postural stability score for BBS are the Overall Stability Index (OSI), Medial-Lateral Stability Index (MLSI), and Anterior-Posterior Stability Index (APSI). These indices are standard deviations that assess the path of sway around the zero point from the center of the platform and are measured in degrees. A high score in these stability indices indicates poor balance.</description>
