  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The INTRUDE trial aims at assessing the efficacy of an fMRI-based neurofeedback procedure on&#xD;
      drug-resistant auditory hallucinations. Hallucinations are complex and transient mental&#xD;
      states associated with subtle and brain-wide patterns of activity for which we were recently&#xD;
      able to validate an fMRI multivariate decoder. Based on this progress, we can track patients'&#xD;
      hallucinatory status using real-time fMRI. We will test whether schizophrenia patients with&#xD;
      drug-resistant hallucinations can be trained to maintain the brain state associated with a&#xD;
      no-hallucination condition using appropriate strategies and thus reduce overall severity. We&#xD;
      will refer to a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled design. A total of 86 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled and equally split in an active neurofeedback group (n=43) and a sham group&#xD;
      (n=43), matched for sex, age and PANSS scores. Each patient will benefit from 4 runs of&#xD;
      either active or sham neurofeedback. The primary outcome measure will be the mean decrease of&#xD;
      AHRS scores relative to baseline, and at 1 month post-treatment. We expect significant&#xD;
      clinical benefits from fMRI-based neurofeedback on drug-resistant hallucinations compared&#xD;
      with the sham group.&#xD;
