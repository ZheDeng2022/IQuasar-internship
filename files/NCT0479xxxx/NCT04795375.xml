    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether providing physical activity counseling and guidance to&#xD;
      patients post bariatric surgery, along with long-term personal follow-up for six months after&#xD;
      the surgery, may increase the level of physical activity, and it's effect on anthropometric&#xD;
      and functional measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is considered to be most effective in treating morbid obesity for patients&#xD;
      with BMI≥40 or BMI≥35 with comorbidity for obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      postoperative weight loss following any type of bariatric surgery is largely dependent on the&#xD;
      extent to which patients can make and sustain changes in their eating habits and activity&#xD;
      level. Adopting physical activity habits can help to optimize outcomes after bariatric&#xD;
      surgery, such as contributing to the rate of weight loss after the surgery and maintain lean&#xD;
      body mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to successfully implement a behavioral change regarding the adaptation of healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle habits in obese patients, it is vital to promote physical activity counseling after&#xD;
      the surgery, and find an effective intervention that can support habitual physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this trial is to examine the effect physical activity counseling after bariatric&#xD;
      surgery on the amount and intensity of activity performed, quality of life, anthropometric&#xD;
      and functional measures during the first year after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to eighty Participants will be recruited for the trial, and will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of the two study arms (Control, Intervention). The intervention group will receive&#xD;
      physical activity counseling and guidelines for six months after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive a pedometer to track daily steps for 7 days at different time&#xD;
      points before and after the intervention. Additional Measurements will be taken at a&#xD;
      pre-surgical baseline assessment and throughout the trial, and will include anthropometric&#xD;
      measures (Weight, BMI, and body composition) and functional measures (Handgrip, 6-minute walk&#xD;
      test, chair stand-up test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will fill out a the 7-day international Physical Activity questionnaire,&#xD;
      Self-efficacy for physical exercise scale, and SF-36 questionnaire, before and after the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
