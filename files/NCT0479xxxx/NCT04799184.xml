      Currently there is no standardized management or single technique to manage postoperative&#xD;
      pain after Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS), there are many options available ranging&#xD;
      from intravenous opioids, morphine or fentanyl Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), peripheral&#xD;
      nerve blocks, intercostals, paravertebral and epidural blocks. Erector Spinal Block (ESP),&#xD;
      this blocks the ventral and dorsal branch of the unilateral thoracic roots. It corresponds to&#xD;
      an interfacial block that produces an extensive multidermatomal sensitive block with a single&#xD;
      puncture, covering the anterior, lateral and posterior aspect of the thorax. One of its main&#xD;
      advantages would be safety, possible less damage to nerves and pneumothorax, as well as the&#xD;
      simplicity of execution of this block. What has positioned it as another analgesic&#xD;
      alternative in this type of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetic profile that local anesthetics would have when injected into this&#xD;
      interfacial compartment has not yet been described, and what the real impact of the use of&#xD;
      vasoconstrictor will be in terms of plasma levels and duration of the block.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is one of the most common procedures performed in&#xD;
      thoracic surgery, mainly because it has made it possible to solve many pathologies that&#xD;
      previously required a thoracotomy with all the complications that that meant. VATS has been&#xD;
      shown to be beneficial for patients, for many reasons such as lower mortality, better&#xD;
      postoperative lung function, and shorter stay during hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Less invasive procedures such as VATS, where the surgical incision is small and avoids costal&#xD;
      resection, produces less postoperative pain when compared to a thoracotomy, this has been&#xD;
      objectified by numerous studies that have found lower scores on the numerical verbal scale&#xD;
      (NVE) and fewer requirements for pain relievers. Despite the fact that VATS produces less&#xD;
      acute postoperative pain (VNS 4-5 on the first postoperative day in VATS vs VNS 6 in&#xD;
      thoracotomies), the incidence of chronic postoperative pain ranges from 20 to 47%, which is&#xD;
      comparable to thoracotomy, mainly due to damage to the intercostal nerves and inadequate&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been seen that one of the factors associated with the appearance of chronic pain after&#xD;
      chest surgery is severe acute pain in the first three postoperative days. Acute pain in VATS&#xD;
      is caused by surgical trauma to muscular and bone structures of the thorax, achieving good&#xD;
      analgesia is important to maintain adequate respiratory function and avoid complications such&#xD;
      as atelectasis, hypoxemia and possible pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no standardized management or single technique to manage postoperative&#xD;
      pain after VATS, there are many options available ranging from intravenous opioids, morphine&#xD;
      or fentanyl Patient-controlled analgesia, peripheral nerve blocks, intercostals,&#xD;
      paravertebral and epidural blocks. Each of them with advantages and disadvantages, but&#xD;
      without being able to demonstrate a clear superiority between them, both the paravertebral&#xD;
      and epidural blocks are the ones that accumulate the most reports in the literature regarding&#xD;
      the management of postoperative pain, but at the same time they are not exempt from&#xD;
      complications such as technical failure, hypotension and difficulty of the procedure. In&#xD;
      addition to documenting a low use of thoracic epidurals in VATS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of 2016, the description of the Erector Spinal Block (ESP) by Forero was&#xD;
      published, it blocks the ventral and dorsal branch of the unilateral thoracic roots. It&#xD;
      corresponds to an interfacial block that produces an extensive multidermatomal sensitive&#xD;
      block with a single puncture, covering the anterior, lateral and posterior aspect of the&#xD;
      thorax. One of its main advantages would be safety, possible less nerve damage and&#xD;
      pneumothorax, as well as the simplicity of execution of this block. What has positioned it as&#xD;
      another analgesic alternative in this type of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ESP, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile that local anesthetics would have when injected into&#xD;
      this interfacial compartment has not yet been described, and what will be the real impact of&#xD;
      the use of vasoconstrictor in terms of plasma levels and duration of the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the above, it is important to know the pharmacodynamics of levobupivacaine after&#xD;
      performing an ESP block with ultrasonography in order to know the risks of toxicity from&#xD;
      local anesthetics as well as to clinically characterize this block in patients who will&#xD;
      undergo VATS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective of this study is to compare the plasma levels of levobupivacaine achieved&#xD;
      after performing an ESP Block with or without epinephrine. As secondary objectives, it is&#xD;
      proposed to characterize the block in terms of duration, pain, opioid requirements in the&#xD;
      first 24 hours and adverse events, in both groups.&#xD;
