    <measure>Change in provider knowledge of smoking cessation treatment as assessed by a 16-item scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge of evidence-based smoking cessation treatment: 16-item scale developed by our team. Items are true/false. A higher score signifies an increased knowledge of smoking cessation treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in provider self-efficacy to deliver evidence-based smoking cessation treatment as assessed by a 32-item instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>36 item instrument on a likert scale of 1-10, adapted version of Compeau and Higgins' task-focused self-efficacy scale. Higher scores signify greater self-efficacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in acceptability of evidence-based practices based on adaptation of Acceptability of Intervention Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use an instrument measuring acceptability, using an adaptation of the Acceptability of Intervention Measure. Each of the 16 items will be measured on a 5-point Likert scale, where 1=completely disagree and 5=completely agree. An average score is calculated by summing responses across all four items and dividing by the total number of items. The average score ranges from 1-5. A higher score signifies greater acceptability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in appropriateness of evidence-based practices based on adaptation of the Intervention Appropriateness Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use an instrument measuring appropriateness, using an adaptation of the Intervention Appropriateness Measure. Each of the 16 items will be measured on a 5-point Likert scale, where 1=completely disagree and 5=completely agree. An average score is calculated by summing responses across all four items and dividing by the total number of items. The average score ranges from 1-5. A higher score signifies greater appropriateness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in feasibility of evidence-based practices based on adaptation of the Feasibility of Intervention Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use an instrument measuring feasibility, using an adaptation of the Feasibility of Intervention Measure. Each of the 16 items will be measured on a 5-point Likert scale, where 1=completely disagree and 5=completely agree. An average score is calculated by summing responses across all four items and dividing by the total number of items. The average score ranges from 1-5. A higher score signifies greater appropriateness.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use an instrument measuring acceptability, using an adaptation of the Acceptability of Intervention Measure. Each of the 24 items will be measured on a 5-point Likert scale, where 1=completely disagree and 5=completely agree. An average score is calculated by summing responses across all four items and dividing by the total number of items. The average score ranges from 1-5. A higher score signifies greater acceptability.</description>
