  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to explore the clinical efficacy of SHR-1210 in combined with&#xD;
      Anlotinib in the treatment of second- or above- line advanced or metastatic esophageal&#xD;
      squamous cell cancer patients, in order to find a better therapy strategy for esophageal&#xD;
      squamous cell cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, phase II, single-arm clinical trial. Advanced or metastatic esophageal&#xD;
      squamous cell cancer(ESCC) patients progressed after 1st systematic treatment are treated&#xD;
      with SHR-1210 and Anlotinib. SHR-1210 was given intravenously(200mg d1 Q2w), combined with&#xD;
      Anlotinib orally, 12 mg d1-14 Q3w. The hypothesis: The objective response rate in SHR-1210&#xD;
      combined with Anlotinib can reach 40% as second-line or above treatment of advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic ESCC patients. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) and the&#xD;
      secondary endpoint is disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS), and safety of this regimen.&#xD;
