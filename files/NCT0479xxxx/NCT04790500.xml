      The aim is to describe the severity of pain in postpartum female and management of sacroiliac&#xD;
      joint pain and disability and define the effects of manual therapy on sacroiliac joint&#xD;
      dysfunction and pain in postpartum females and to check whether the amount of gaining range&#xD;
      of movement is similar among postpartum female undergoing with mobilization therapy and with&#xD;
      muscle energy technique.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>o The 11-point (numeric pain rating scale) NPRS will use to capture the patient's level of pain. The scale is anchored on the left with the phrase ''no pain'' and on the right with the phrase ''worst imaginable pain.'' Patients rate their current level of pain and their worst and least amount of pain in the last 24 hours. The average of the 3 ratings or any single rating may be used to represent the patient's level of pain. Numeric pain scales have been shown to be reliable and valid. The reliability of numeric pain rating scale is 0.74</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Oswestry disability index</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-report questionnaire of a patient's perceived disability based on 10 areas of pain and daily activities (pain intensity, personal hygiene, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sexual activity, social activity and travelling). Each section is scored on a6-point scale (0-5), with 0 representing no limitation and 5 representing maximal limitation. The subscales combined add up to a total maximal score of 50. The score is then doubled and interpreted as a percentage of the patient-perceived disability (the higher the score, the greater the disability). In cases where patients did not answer all the 10 sections, the sum score of the answered sections were divided by the number of completed sections. The reliability of modified oswestry disability index is 0.88.</description>
