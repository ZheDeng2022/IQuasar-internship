  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy of vonoprazan (10 mg, 20 mg,&#xD;
      and 40 mg On-Demand) compared to placebo (On-Demand) in relief of episodic heartburn over 6&#xD;
      weeks in participants with symptomatic non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (NERD),&#xD;
      and to assess the safety of vonoprazan (10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg On-Demand) compared to&#xD;
      placebo (On-Demand) in participants with symptomatic NERD.&#xD;
