  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-phase study that compares performance growth pre-implant with current hearing&#xD;
      aid (HA) technology versus post-implant with a cochlear implant (CI) in children with either&#xD;
      asymmetric hearing loss (AHL) or single-sided deafness (SSD). Post-implant performance with a&#xD;
      CI alone is expected to outperform pre-implant performance with a HA. The study also&#xD;
      evaluates the effectiveness of bimodal hearing defined as a CI in the poor ear and a HA in&#xD;
      the better ear for AHL or a CI in the poor ear and normal hearing in the better ear for SSD&#xD;
      compared to pre-implant performance. The study examines factors contributing to CI outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is conducted as a multicenter, prospective, two-phase clinical trial, evaluating&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of cochlear implantation in children with asymmetric hearing loss&#xD;
      (AHL) or single-sided deafness (SSD). A hearing aid (HA) phase occurs over a minimum of 4 mos&#xD;
      prior to obtaining a cochlear implant (CI). A CI phase occurs over the 15-month period after&#xD;
      initial activation of the CI. The AHL/SSD groups are tested for change in performance pre- to&#xD;
      post-implant. Investigators also collect longitudinal data over 12 months (matching the 3 to&#xD;
      15 month post-implant timeframe) from normal hearing (NH) participants to provide additional&#xD;
      information about outcome trajectory due to development alone. The NH participants are&#xD;
      matched to AHL/SSD participants on age, gender and parent education. Post-implant performance&#xD;
      with a CI alone is expected to outperform pre-implant performance with a HA. The study&#xD;
      evaluates the effectiveness of bimodal hearing defined as a CI in the poor ear and a HA in&#xD;
      the better ear for AHL or a CI in the poor ear and normal hearing in the better ear for SSD&#xD;
      compared to pre-implant performance. The study examines factors contributing to CI outcomes.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Parents and child fluent in English. Parents desire bilateral hearing for their child,&#xD;
             are willing to comply with study requirements, including the pre-implant HA phase, and&#xD;
             are able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poor ear (AHL/SSD): PTA at .5, 1, 2 kHz &gt; 70 dB HL; Aided CNC word recognition score&#xD;
             at 60 dB SPL &lt; 40%; SPHL duration ≥ 6 mos and ≤ 10 yrs at time of CI surgery; If &gt; 5&#xD;
             yrs of age, evidence of non-congenital SPHL onset (e.g., passed newborn hearing&#xD;

             defined as thresholds that have not declined by more than 20 dB at three or more&#xD;
             octave-interval audiometric frequencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SSD: PTA at .5, 1, 2, 4 kHz ≤ 25 dB HL; CNC word score at 60 dB SPL ≥ 70%; Stable&#xD;
