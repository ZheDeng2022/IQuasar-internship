      The study aims to investigate acute effects of ballistic hamstring stretching, hamstring&#xD;
      extender exercise, and kinesiotaping application on viscoelasticity of hamstrings and&#xD;
      standing long jump performance on rowers. A total of 60 professional rowing athletes were&#xD;
      included. Viscoelasticity of hamstrings were assessed by MyotonPRO, Tallinn, Estonia.&#xD;
      Athletic performance was assessed by Standing Long Jump Test (SLJT). The athletes were&#xD;
      randomly divided into Ballistic Hamstring Stretching Group (n= 20), Hamstring Extender&#xD;
      Exercise Group (n= 20), and Kinesiotape Group (n= 20). For balistic hamstring stretching,&#xD;
      athletes were asked to reach the floor in the BS group by leaning over in the standing&#xD;
      posture without knee flexion. When they feel the tension in hamstring muscle groups, athletes&#xD;
      were requested to make small rebounding motion at degrees between 3°-5° for half a minute.&#xD;
      For hamstring extender exercise, athletes were asked to apply the exercise 12 repetitions and&#xD;
      3 sets. Kinesiotaping was applied on the hamstring muscle with Y shape and 25% tension force.&#xD;

    <measure>Frequency of Muscle (F)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The tones of muscle is described by frequency of muscle or oscillation frequency (Hz). It is examined by the MyotonPro, Tallinn, Estonia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stiffness of Muscle (S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Stiffness of Muscle is described by reaction to contraction or forces from outside of tissue that may cause the original form to deteriorate. It is examined by the MyotonPro, Tallinn, Estonia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decrement of Muscle (D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The elasticity of a muscle is described by a logarithmic reduction of tissue's normal amplitude. It is more related with the dissipation of mechanical energy that arises between the deformation of the tissue and its recovery. It is a biomechanical feature of tissue that is called as elasticity. It is examined by the MyotonPro, Tallinn, Estonia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Relaxation of Muscle (R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>It is the time which is called as Mechanical Stress Relaxation Time (ms) between the deformation of the normal shape of the tissue and its return to its original shape. It is examined by the MyotonPro, Tallinn, Estonia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Creep of Muscle (C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>It is defined as ratio of deterioration and relaxation time of tissue. In case of a continuous stress, tissue regularly stretches over time. This is called as creep. It is examined by the MyotonPro, Tallinn, Estonia.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Athletic Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Athletic Performance is assessed by Standing Long Jump Test. It is a horizontal jump test that measures anaerobic performance.</description>

    <description>Athletes were asked to applied 12 repetitions and 3 sets of hamstring extender exercise. Firstly athlete lies on his/her back. Then, athlete is asked to do 90 degrees of knee and hip flexion at the same time. Finally, the person is expected to perform slow repetitive knee extension to the point of maximal possible extension.</description>
