      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of providing patient medication&#xD;
      education about Eliquis and Xarelto through an Amazon Alexa based voice recording.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anticoagulants are considered high-risk medications due to the risk of major bleeding. The&#xD;
      Federal Drug and Food Administration (FDA) MedWatch reporting system found that&#xD;
      anticoagulants had the most adverse drug event (ADE) reports in 2011. Anticoagulants have&#xD;
      also been reported as one of the leading drug classes contributing to emergency department&#xD;
      visits3. Given the potential for serious adverse events, providing effective education to&#xD;
      increase patient knowledge and awareness of those risks are essential. Incorporating&#xD;
      technology into health care is becoming increasingly popular and has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective for patient education. One reason is that technology can consistently provide&#xD;
      complete patient education and is not subject to educator variability in providing this&#xD;
      education.&#xD;
