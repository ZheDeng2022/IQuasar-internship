  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spain is the country with the second-highest rate of population amputation due to the&#xD;
      development of ulcers, behind the United States, where 2 out of 3 non-traumatic amputations&#xD;
      derive from diabetes. This is why the main objective of this project is to establish a study&#xD;
      protocol for alterations in plantar pressures and gait abnormalities in diabetic patients,&#xD;
      parallel to the preventive orthopedic treatment of major complications such as Charcot's&#xD;
      foot, ulcers in the plantar support surface, and amputations. The study methodology will be&#xD;
      based on the evaluation prior to the personalized orthopedic treatment for each patient and&#xD;
      the evaluation after the orthopedic treatment, specifically at one week, one month, three&#xD;
      months, and six months after the treatment. At each evaluation time, plantar pressure and&#xD;
      reaction forces during walking and local infrared thermography will be analyzed. In the basal&#xD;
      and final evaluation at six months, the muscular strength and range of motion of the lower&#xD;
      limbs will also be evaluated. The orthopedic intervention is personalized to the requirements&#xD;
      of the patients and is based on the use of an insole with the possible inclusion of&#xD;
      orthopedic footwear in order to reduce plantar pressure.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic foot is the syndrome characterized by tissue changes (skin, joint, and/or bone) of&#xD;
      the feet of diabetic patients as a result of peripheral neuropathy induced by high glucose&#xD;
      levels, which can be aggravated by the coexistence of microcirculation alterations blood and&#xD;
      whose production involves micro-traumas as a result of support during walking. When tissue&#xD;
      repair or regeneration mechanisms are not effective, these initial lesions can evolve into&#xD;
      ulcerations, superficial and/or deep infections, osteomyelitis or dislocations of the foot&#xD;
      joints (Charcot's foot), with serious consequences for the patient such as limb amputation,&#xD;
      whose costs for Public Health are high. It should be taken into account that Spain is the&#xD;
      country with the second-highest rate of population amputation due to the development of&#xD;
      ulcers, behind the United States, where 2 out of 3 non-traumatic amputations derive from&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is why the main objective of this project is to establish a study protocol for&#xD;
      alterations in plantar pressures and gait abnormalities in diabetic patients, parallel to the&#xD;
      preventive orthopedic treatment of major complications such as Charcot's foot, ulcers in the&#xD;
      plantar support surface, and amputations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As specific objectives proposed are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate and objectify the clinical and biomechanical alterations of people with&#xD;
           Diabetic foot before orthopedic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To analyze the effects of immediate orthopedic treatment in the medium and long term in&#xD;
           people with Diabetic foot through biomechanical and clinical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if the biomechanical analysis influences the decisions of the trauma&#xD;
           doctors and rehabilitators treating the study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General organization&#xD;
&#xD;
           The traumatologists (3) and the rehabilitation physician (1) who are part of the&#xD;
           research team of the study will recruit the participants from the medical consultation&#xD;
           that they maintain at the participating hospital in this study. Through compliance with&#xD;
           the inclusion criteria, patients will be invited to enter the study. Those who agree to&#xD;
           participate will sign the corresponding informed consent and will be referred for the&#xD;
           baseline evaluation. The assessment times are as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Baseline evaluation after signing the informed consent Orthopedic evaluation and&#xD;
                implementation of orthopedic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluation at one week after starting orthopedic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluation at one month after starting orthopedic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluation at three months after starting orthopedic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluation at six months after starting orthopedic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Session assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each of the evaluation sessions mentioned above, the following data and outcomes will be&#xD;
      recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Clinical assessment: The clinical evaluation will consist of determining the main&#xD;
      anatomical variables that describe the foot of the participants. These variables will be&#xD;
      determined in consultation with a traumatologist or rehabilitation physician at the time of&#xD;
      patient recruitment. It will be determined: a) arch of the foot: this polytomous variable&#xD;
      determines whether the patient has cavus or flat feet; b) Moreau-Costa-Bartani angle (ยบ); c)&#xD;
      Astragalus-calcaneus angle (ยบ); d) Hindfoot alignment: this polytomous variable indicates&#xD;
      whether the patient has a valgus, varus or neutral hindfoot; e) Toe position: this polytomous&#xD;
      variable describes whether the subjects present any of the toes in hyperextension of the&#xD;
      metatarsophalangeal joint with proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal flexion&#xD;
      (claw), or have normal anatomy and position; f) Posterior tibial pulse: explores the&#xD;
      posterior tibial artery, palpated at the ankle at the level of the posterior area of the&#xD;
      external malleolus (internal retro-malleolar canal); g) Pedic pulse: explores the pediatric&#xD;
      artery, palpates at the level of the dorsal aspect of the foot between the extensor tendons&#xD;
      of the 1st and 2nd toes, it can also frequently be palpated between the 2nd and 3rd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Anthropometric assessment: A series of essential preliminary measurements will be carried&#xD;
      out for the normalization of biomechanical data and its subsequent comparison between&#xD;
      subjects. The following will be evaluated: a) Weight measurement on the force platform (Kg);&#xD;
      b) Height measurement on stadiometer (Cm); c) Measurement of the arm, leg, and waist contour&#xD;
      measured with a tape measure (Cm); d) Measurement of BMI, body water percentage (%) and body&#xD;
      fat percentage (%) will be extracted with an analytical scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Range of motion assessment: Joint range measurements will be measured with the NeDSGE 4.1&#xD;
      electronic goniometer and NedDiscapacidad / IBV V4.1.1 software (Institute of Biomechanics of&#xD;
      Valencia, Spain) that allows data to be recorded and stored digitally. a) Measurements in the&#xD;
      hip joint: flexion and extension, internal and external rotation, abduction and adduction; b)&#xD;
      Measurements in the knee joint: flexion and extension; c) Measurements in the ankle joint:&#xD;
      dorsal flexion, plantar flexion, inversion, and eversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Muscular strength assessment: To evaluate the degree of muscular force (Newton), an&#xD;
      electronic dynamometer NedDFM/IBV and software NedDiscapacidad/IBV V4.1.1 will be used&#xD;
      (Institute of Biomechanics of Valencia, Spain), which allows the evaluation and recording of&#xD;
      muscular force performed digitally. Three measurements of maximum strength will be obtained&#xD;
      for each gesture, without these differing by more than 10% from each other. a) Muscle&#xD;
      strength measured from the hip flexors, extensors, abductors, adductors, and internal and&#xD;
      external rotators; b) Measured muscle strength of the knee flexor and extensor muscles; c)&#xD;
      Muscle strength measured from the plantar flexor and dorsiflexor muscles of the foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 Assessment of speed and ground reaction forces during walking: During the evaluation, the&#xD;
      patient should walk in a 10-meter long corridor, in a straight line at a comfortable or&#xD;
      self-selected speed. Two dynamometric platforms will be used to record the ground reaction&#xD;
      forces during the tread, and two pairs of infrared sensors to record the speed. The software&#xD;
      we use for this evaluation is AMH / IBV 4.0.4. The outcomes obtained from the gait analysis&#xD;
      are; a) Walking speed (m / s); b) Support time (s): proportion of total time spent during the&#xD;
      support phase. Initiated in the contact of a hindfoot and ending in the detachment of the&#xD;
      toes of the same foot. c) Braking force: minimum registered anterior-posterior ground&#xD;
      reaction force corresponding to heel strike (N), d) Propulsive force: maximum registered&#xD;
      anterior-posterior ground reaction force corresponding to takeoff (N), e) Swing force:&#xD;
      minimum registered vertical ground reaction force occurring during contralateral foot&#xD;
      oscillation (N), f) Push-off force: second highest register of the vertical component of&#xD;
      ground reaction force that occurs between heel-off and toe-off (N).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6 Assessment of plantar pressure during standing position and walking: The evaluation of&#xD;
      plantar pressures will be carried out during standing position and walking in a straight line&#xD;
      at a comfortable speed. The measuring instrument consists of instrumented insoles with&#xD;
      pressure sensors, which will go inside the patient's footwear. The software used is the&#xD;
      Biofoot/IBV Version 6b. The corridor to be covered by the patient is 10 meters, on which they&#xD;
      can be recorded in five and six strides according to the different lengths of the&#xD;
      participants' stride. The main outcomes obtained from plantar pressure assessment are: a)&#xD;
      Support time (s): total duration of foot contact with the ground; b) cadence (step / min); c)&#xD;
      Maximum pressure (%): maximum pressure value obtained in the analyzed area; d) Maximum&#xD;
      pressure time (%): moment in the support phase in which the maximum pressure value is&#xD;
      reached, expressed as a percentage of time in relation to the total duration of the footfall;&#xD;
      e) Maximum mean pressure (kpa): Maximum value of the mean pressure of the analyzed area&#xD;
      expressed in kilopascals; f) Maximum time of the average pressure (%): instance of the&#xD;
      support phase in which the maximum of the average pressure occurs, expressed as a percentage&#xD;
      of time in relation to the total duration of the tread; g) Integral of Mean Pressure: area&#xD;
      under the curve described by mean pressure over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.7 Thermographic assessment: Thermographic images were recorded before and after of gait&#xD;
      measurements. Before walking, the change in temperature was also observed when a cold&#xD;
      stimulus was applied to the plantar of both foot. All thermographic images were recorded&#xD;
      digitally by a thermography camera with an infrared resolution of 320ร240 pixels, thermal&#xD;
      sensitivity &lt;0.05 ยฐC, and accuracy of ยฑ2 ยฐC (FLIR E60, FLIR, Wilsonville, Oregon, USA). A&#xD;
      black body (BX-500 IR Infrared Calibrator, CEM, Shenzhen, China) was used before the study to&#xD;
      ensure a correct calibration of the camera. The camera was positioned 1 m far from the&#xD;
      subjects and kept perpendicular to body areas of interest. Images were recorded in a&#xD;
      controlled environment (e.g. light and temperature controlled room) with no person (apart&#xD;
      from the infrared operator and the participant) or equipment in a range of 5 m that could&#xD;
      disturbed in the measure. An anti-reflective panel was used behind the participant to&#xD;
      minimize effects from infrared radiation reflected by the participant in the wall. Images&#xD;
      were stored for offline analysis using a commercial software (Thermacam Researcher Pro 2.10&#xD;
      software, FLIR, Wilsonville, Oregon, USA). All images were processed using an emissivity&#xD;
      factor of 0.98 to obtain skin temperatures, and for all measures, air temperature, humidity,&#xD;
      and reflected temperature were informed in the camera setup using a weather station (Digital&#xD;
      thermo-hygrometer, TFA Dostmann, Wertheim-Reicholzheim, Germany).&#xD;
