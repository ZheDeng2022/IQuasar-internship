  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab in combination&#xD;
      with SOX and/or apatinib in the treatment of locally advanced gastric cancer or&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.The primary endpoint was pathologic complete&#xD;
      response (PCR).In addition, secondary efficacy endpoints include R0 resection rate, objective&#xD;
      response rate (ORR), and 1-year progression-free survival rate (PFSR) . They were set to&#xD;
      demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of camrelizumab combined with SOX in patients 。&#xD;

      Screening period Subjects will enter the study screening period after signing the informed&#xD;
      consent, and the maximum screening period will be 28 days. Those who meet all the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and do not meet the exclusion criteria will be allowed to enter the study treatment&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period Patients received 2-4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with camrelizumab&#xD;
      +SOX regimen, and then received adjuvant chemotherapy with camrelizumab +SOX regimen after&#xD;
      surgery, with a total of 8 cycles before and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Camrelizumab: every 3 weeks (21 days) was given as one administration cycle. 200mg was given&#xD;
      intravenously on the first day of each cycle. Dose adjustment is not allowed. Delayed&#xD;
      administration is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apatinib mesylate: 250mg, qd, stopped 28 days before surgery, and can be used by the&#xD;
      investigator according to the patient's recovery 28 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy: The SOX regimen consisted of one cycle every 3 weeks (21 days).Dose adjustment&#xD;
      is allowed. Delayed administration is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin (OXA) : 130mg/m2, intravenous infusion, d1, infusion more than 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tigio Capsules (S-1) : Take orally after breakfast and dinner, twice daily, d1-14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosing time window is ±3 days, but within 72 hours before each dosing, subjects must&#xD;
      complete an examination that includes all clinical requirements to assess tolerance for&#xD;
      continued dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will continue to receive study therapy until disease progression (PD) occurs,&#xD;
      intolerable toxicity occurs, a new antitumor therapy is initiated, treatment is terminated&#xD;
      after careful consideration by the patient or investigator, or they die, or are lost to&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical tumor evaluation during the screening period and throughout the study period will be&#xD;
      based on RECIST version 1.1.Baseline tumor assessment was performed 28 days prior to the&#xD;
      start of treatment.Enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is&#xD;
      recommended for tumor evaluation.Tumor efficacy evaluation was conducted every 2 cycles (±3&#xD;
      days) from the beginning of the first dose study until the occurrence of PD. The visit time&#xD;
      for efficacy evaluation was fixed, regardless of whether the treatment cycle delay&#xD;
      occurred.If treatment is discontinued for reasons other than PD, subjects will continue to&#xD;
      undergo tumor evaluation until PD occurs, initiation of new antitumor therapy, withdrawal of&#xD;
      informed consent, death, or loss of follow-up, whichever occurs first.In the event of&#xD;
      clinical symptoms suggestive of PD, imaging methods should be used for subsequent evaluation&#xD;
      in order to record and confirm tumor efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the beginning of the first dose study treatment, a systematic safety assessment was&#xD;
      carried out for each administration cycle.During the study treatment, a basic safety&#xD;
      assessment was performed before each administration cycle, including completion of a physical&#xD;
      examination, vital signs, and basic laboratory tests (ECG, blood routine, urine routine,&#xD;
      fecal occult blood, blood biochemistry, coagulation function, etc.).&#xD;
