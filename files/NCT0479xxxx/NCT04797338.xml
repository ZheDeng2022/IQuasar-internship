    <textblock>
      Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone agonist (GnRHa) triggering is used as an alternative to human&#xD;
      chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in GnRH antagonist protocol to eliminate the risk of ovarian&#xD;
      hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). However, its main disadvantage is a significantly lower&#xD;
      pregnancy rate, hypothesized to result from a process called &quot;luteolysis&quot; (demise of the&#xD;
      corpora lutea). In order to preserve a high pregnancy rates, several luteal support regimens&#xD;
      were investigated, including an intensive estrogen and progesterone supplementation and a&#xD;
      daily GnRHa treatment. However, no study, so far, compared the efficacy of these two&#xD;
      regimens. Our aim is to compare the efficacy of GnRHa versus estrogen and progesterone&#xD;
      supplementation for luteal phase support in high responders following GnRHa triggering.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for final oocyte maturation is an&#xD;
      accepted practice in in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments. However, in high-responder&#xD;
      patients, it increases the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) due to its longer&#xD;
      half-life compared to the naturally secreted Luteinizing Hormone (LH) as well as increased&#xD;
      synthesis and secretion of vasoactive substances. Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist&#xD;
      (GnRHa) triggering, as an alternative to hCG triggering for final oocyte maturation in&#xD;
      antagonist protocols, enables substantial decrease of this complication in high responders.&#xD;
      However, the main disadvantage of using GnRHa for induction of oocyte maturation is&#xD;
      significantly lower pregnancy rates compared with hCG triggering. The primary hypothesis is&#xD;
      luteal insufficiency due to increased luteolysis. In order to preserve a high pregnancy rates&#xD;
      after GnRHa triggering, several approaches for luteal-phase rescue have been investigated,&#xD;
      including low-dose hCG boluses, intensive P and E2 supplementation, and a ''freeze-all''&#xD;
      approach with frozen-thawed embryo transfers at subsequent cycles. Several previous case&#xD;
      reports have demonstrated that inadvertent administration of GnRH agonists during the luteal&#xD;
      phase doesn't harm pregnancies achieved through IVF and moreover might even support&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism by which GnRH agonist improve implantation rates is unknown. Several hypotheses&#xD;
      were suggested including promoting corpus luteum maintenance by secretion of LH from&#xD;
      pituitary gonadotropin cells, a direct effect on the endometrium and the embryo through GnRH&#xD;
      receptors and regulatory effect on hCG secretion by the placenta at the preimplantation&#xD;
      phase. In 2004, Tesarik et al, conducted a prospective randomized trial including 276 oocyte&#xD;
      recipients. Oocytes from each individual donor were divided to two recipients, one of whom&#xD;
      received a single dose of a GnRH agonist (0.1 mg triptorelin) 3 days after embryo transfer&#xD;
      and the other received placebo at the same time. Of note, the endometrium was prepared by&#xD;
      oral estradiol valerate treatment following by vaginal progesterone (Utrogestan) as widely&#xD;
      accepted. The results demonstrated significantly higher implantation and live birth rate in&#xD;
      the group treated with GnRH agonist compared to the control group with significantly higher&#xD;
      twin pregnancy rates while no difference in miscarriage and abortion rates was observed&#xD;
      between the two study groups. The authors concluded that GnRH agonist administration at the&#xD;
      time of implantation has a positive effect on embryo developmental potential. It's important&#xD;
      to note that this study evaluated the effect of a single dose of GnRH agonist in addition to&#xD;
      a conventional luteal support in a population of oocyte recipients that are not at risk for&#xD;
      OHSS and tend to have higher implantation and pregnancy rates also without GnRH agonist&#xD;
      supplementation. A study by Pirard et al. was the first to evaluate the administration of&#xD;
      GnRH agonist alone for luteal support compared to compared to the standard treatment with&#xD;
      vaginal progesterone. The study group included 35 patients who were treated with antagonist&#xD;
      protocol. Intranasal GnRH agonist (Buserilin) was given for final oocyte maturation and&#xD;
      luteal support was achieved by administration of intranasal GnRH agonist for up to 16 days&#xD;
      after the oocytes retrieval. The control group included 18 women treated with a long GnRH&#xD;
      protocol for pituitary suppression. Final oocytes maturation was achieved by administration&#xD;
      of 10000 units of hCG and vaginal progesterone was used for luteal support. Implantation and&#xD;
      pregnancy rates were higher among the study group compared to the control group however, no&#xD;
      statistical significance was achieved. Progesterone levels on day 5 were significantly lower&#xD;
      while LH levels were significantly higher during all the luteal phase in the study group&#xD;
      compared to the control group. The authors concluded that intranasal administration of&#xD;
      Buserelin is as effective as standard progesterone treatment for providing luteal phase&#xD;
      support in IVF/ICSI antagonist protocols. To our knowledge, the only study, so far that&#xD;
      evaluated the efficacy of GnRH agonist treatment for luteal support in high responder&#xD;
      patients with increased risk for OHSS was conducted by Bar-Hava et al. It included 46 women&#xD;
      at risk for OHSS that were treated with GnRH antagonist protocol for pituitary suppression.&#xD;
      The final oocyte maturation was achieved by GnRH agonist (Triptorelin) and a daily intranasal&#xD;
      GnRH agonist (Nafarelin 200 micrograms twice daily) was administered for luteal support for&#xD;
      two weeks following the oocytes retrieval. 52% clinical pregnancy rates were obtained while&#xD;
      no cases od OHSS or other substantial adverse effects were observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main disadvantage of the study is the lack of a comparison to a control group. To the&#xD;
      best of our knowledge, no study so far compared administration of GnRH agonist at the same&#xD;
      protocol described by Bar-Hava et al. to intensive estrogen and progesterone treatment for&#xD;
      luteal support among women treated with GnRH antagonist protocol and GnRH agonist triggering&#xD;
      for final oocytes maturation. A randomized controlled trial in an infertility population at&#xD;
      increased risk for OHSS, will enable us to evaluate the efficacy of GnRH agonist treatment&#xD;
      compared to standard treatment for luteal support and to determine the best treatment&#xD;
      approach in the high responder population undergoing a fresh embryo transfer new approach&#xD;
      undergoing a fresh embryo transfer following GnRHa triggering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study isto compare the efficacy of GnRH agonist versus estrogen and&#xD;
      progesterone supplementation for luteal support in high responders undergoing fresh embryo&#xD;
      transfer following GnRHa triggering.&#xD;
