      This study was aimed to look at the effect of lactose free formula milk in comparison with&#xD;
      home-made plain yogurt in children with acute watery diarrhea.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial using non probability consecutive sampling was carried out on&#xD;
      60 children (30 in each group) in Department of Paediatrics Unit I, Services Hospital Lahore.&#xD;
      An informed written consent was taken from parents of the children. Ethical issues considered&#xD;
      and maintained throughout the study. Then all children were randomly divided in two groups by&#xD;
      using lottery method. In group 1; children were given yogurt while in group 2, children were&#xD;
      given lactose free formula milk. In both groups, feed was given 5-8 times per day. Patients&#xD;
      were followed-up till resolution of symptoms and discharge from hospital.&#xD;

    <measure>Effect of home-made yogurt versus lactose-free milk on mean duration of diarrhea in children with acute diarrhea</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of home-made yogurt and lactose-free milk in children with acute diarrhea was compared i.e. to check out which one is more suitable to treat diarrhea by measuring the mean duration of diarrhea in hours. The reason behind the effectiveness of yogurt against lactose-free milk is the presence of probiotics within it, which help in recovering of good bacteria population in intestine and so may help in decreasing duration and severity of diarrhea.</description>
