  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second cause of cancer-related death in western countries. CRC&#xD;
      prevention and screening are major public health issues. Better knowledge of colorectal&#xD;
      carcinogenesis could lead to better prevention. Gut microbiota (GM) is a complex community of&#xD;
      bacteria, fungi, protozoa, viruses and bacteriophages which live in a symbiotic and&#xD;
      epigenetic relationship with the host. GM can promote either digestive health or CRC through&#xD;
      inflammatory and proliferative effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common familial CRC syndrome with a lifetime CRC risk of 52%&#xD;
      in women and 69% in men. The risk of CRC depends upon type of altered mismatch-repair gene&#xD;
      and environmental factors (diet, exercise, obesity, tobacco and alcohol intake, etc.).&#xD;
      Regular surveillance including annual or biannual colonoscopy is recommended in LS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemoprevention has the potential to represent a cost-effective intervention in these&#xD;
      high-risk patients and could allow a delay in colonoscopy surveillance. Regular low dose&#xD;
      aspirin use is associated with a 20 to 30% reduction in the risk of sporadic colonic adenomas&#xD;
      and CRC. The real benefit of aspirin is still to be consolidated. AAS-Lynch trial is an&#xD;
      ongoing prospective multicenter (n=37), double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial, designed to investigate whether daily aspirin, at a dose of 100 or 300 mg compared&#xD;
      with placebo, would decrease the occurrence or recurrence of colorectal adenomas in LS&#xD;
      patients. The primary endpoint is the number of patients with at least one adenoma detected&#xD;
      by chromo-endoscopy 48 months after initial colon clearance. At randomization and at the end&#xD;
      of study, stool collection, blood collection, quality of life questionnaire, validated food&#xD;
      frequency questionnaire (SU-VI-MAX2) and physical activity questionnaire are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ongoing AAS-Lynch study allow accessing to a unique fecal collection in very well&#xD;
      characterized LS patients including a comprehensive dietary evaluation at high risk for&#xD;
      colorectal neoplasia and planned colonoscopy surveillance during a 48 months follow-up,&#xD;
      exposed or not exposed to chronic low dose aspirin. The expertise of the scientific&#xD;
      consortium with state of the art microbiota analysis, the comprehensive collection of data&#xD;
      and the prospective design of the study will allow the evaluation of the true role of gut&#xD;
      microbiota in CRC carcinogenesis.&#xD;

      Background and originality of the project with regards to the state of the art :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in western&#xD;
      countries and the third most prevalent cancer worlwide. CRC prevention and screening are&#xD;
      major public health issues. Better knowledge of colorectal carcinogenesis could lead to&#xD;
      better prevention and screening. Recent observational data in human and experimental data in&#xD;
      vitro or in rodents showed that gut microbiota could contribute to CRC pathogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposal will allow the evaluation of the role of gut microbiota in CRC carcinogenesis in&#xD;
      a cohort of Lynch syndrome (LS) patients at high risk for colorectal neoplasia and with well&#xD;
      characterized environmental risk factors particularly dietary factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiota and CRC Gut microbiota is a complex community consisting of bacteria, fungi,&#xD;
      protozoa, viruses and bacteriophages which live in a symbiotic and epigenetic relationship&#xD;
      with the host. Gut microbiota can promote either health or tumor progression through its&#xD;
      inflammatory and proliferative effects likely dependent on the context and genetic factors of&#xD;
      the host. Specific microorganisms or variability of the microbiome have been associated with&#xD;
      CRC over the past years. Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis sequences are&#xD;
      over represented in CRC versus matched normal control tissue, and a positive association with&#xD;
      lymph node metastasis has been characterized. In patients with sporadic CRC, Fusobacterium&#xD;
      nucleatum overexpression is associated with specific CRC carcinogenesis pathways. Studies&#xD;
      have also identified several other bacteria as Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and&#xD;
      Enterococcus faecalis increase in CRC patients, whereas the Clostridiales, Faecalibacterium,&#xD;
      Blautia, Bifidobacterium, or Lactobacillus genus were low or absent. In vitro, Fusobacterium&#xD;
      nucleatum promotes CRC cell proliferation; in mice, the presence of F. nucleatum&#xD;
      inpatient-derived CRC xenografts (where patient CRC samples are implanted in mice) increases&#xD;
      tumor growth rates. A possible mechanism to explain these findings is that the F. nucleatum&#xD;
      adhesin, FadA, binds to E-cadherin on the CRC cell surface and activates oncogenic&#xD;
      Wnt/β-catenin signaling. F. nucleatum can also alter the function of tumor-infiltrating&#xD;
      lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells by binding to the inhibitory immune receptor TIGIT&#xD;
      (T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITI Mdomains) through another adhesin, Fap2. Fap2 also&#xD;
      binds a disaccharide sugar motif [galactoseN-acetyl-D-galactosamine (Gal-GalNAc)] which is&#xD;
      expressed at high levels on the surface of many tumor cell types, as well as other cell&#xD;
      types, and facilitates F. nucleatum binding to CRC cells. Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides&#xD;
      fragilis (ETBF) potentiates colorectal carcinogenesis in mice, and ETBF was detected in&#xD;
      biofilms coating human CRCs and precancerous colonic lesions. Escherichia coli expressing the&#xD;
      genomic island polyketide synthase (pks+) enhance tumorigenesis in preclinical CRC models and&#xD;
      are enriched in human CRC tissues. pks+ E. coli produce the genotoxin colibactin, which&#xD;
      alkylates DNA, resulting in DNA adducts in colonic epithelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial metabolites have also been seen to have an effect. Butyrate which can only be&#xD;
      produced by specific members of the Firmicutes phylum through the fermentation of dietary&#xD;
      fiber and resistant starches can modulate inflammation, epithelial proliferation, and&#xD;
      apoptosis. Hydrogen sulfide is also an important regulatory metabolite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complexity of microbiota and the relationship between microorganisms in the gut does not&#xD;
      underline yet a particular bacterial signature for tumor progression so far. Then, how gut&#xD;
      microbiota really contributes to CRC pathogenesis in the host is not fully understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRC and Lynch syndrome LS is the most common familial CRC syndrome. Cancer family history is&#xD;
      an important way to identify these at-high risk individuals. Inheritance of a germline&#xD;
      alteration in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or in EPCAM&#xD;
      genes causes a high risk of CRC and other extra-colonic related cancers. Recent studies have&#xD;
      suggested a median age of CRC diagnosis of 61 years and a lifetime CRC risk of 52% in women&#xD;
      and 69% in men. Specific carcinogenesis pathways are characterized in LS neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LS patients presents precancerous lesion as non-advanced or advanced adenomas and serrated&#xD;
      polyps that should be detected and removed. The risk of CRC depends upon which&#xD;
      mismatch-repair gene is mutated. MSH6 and PMS2 germline mutations are associated with a lower&#xD;
      risk with late onset of CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental factors (dietary factors, exercise, obesity, tobacco and alcohol intake, etc.)&#xD;
      are also involved in LS carcinogenesis. Regular surveillance including annual or biannual&#xD;
      colonoscopy is recommended in LS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirin CRC chemoprevention Chemoprevention has the potential to represent a cost-effective&#xD;
      intervention in these high-risk patients and could allow a delay in colonoscopy surveillance.&#xD;
      Several epidemiological studies have shown that regular use of low dose aspirin (75 to 300&#xD;
      mg/d) is associated with a 20 to 30 % reduction in the risk of sporadic colonic polyps and&#xD;
      CRC. Five out of seven randomized controlled trials (RCT) showed a significant decrease in&#xD;
      neoplasia recurrence and a meta-analysis of four of these studies shown a decrease in&#xD;
      sporadic colorectal polyp recurrence. However, in a recent large randomized study in diabetic&#xD;
      patients, aspirin was not associated with a lower CRC incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An observational large study suggests also a preventive aspirin effect in LS. The primary&#xD;
      analysis of the Colorectal Adenoma/Carcinoma Prevention Program 2 (CAPP2) study in LS&#xD;
      patients receiving 600-mg daily aspirin (300 mg b.i.d) showed no significant decrease in CCR&#xD;
      neoplasia. However, a preplanned secondary analysis after extended follow-up (mean 56 months)&#xD;
      showed a reduced risk of CRC in the aspirin group (HR=0.41; 95% CI, 0.32-0.99). In this&#xD;
      study, the endoscopic follow-up was not optimal with a low detection rate of colorectal&#xD;
      neoplasia. Therefore the real effect and clinical benefit of aspirin are still to be&#xD;
      consolidated in LS patients since aspirin chronic use is associated with possible&#xD;
      side-effects (bleeding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AAS-Lynch Study AAS-Lynch trial is an ongoing prospective multicenter (n=37), double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, designed to investigate whether daily aspirin,&#xD;
      at a dose of 100 or 300 mg compared with placebo, would decrease the occurrence or recurrence&#xD;
      of colorectal adenomas in LS patients under 75 years of age. The primary endpoint is the&#xD;
      number of patients with at least one adenoma detected by chromo-endoscopy 48 months after&#xD;
      initial colon clearance with complete polyp removal and after treatment onset. The secondary&#xD;
      end-points are the delay between the appearance of the first adenoma and treatment onset,&#xD;
      adenomatous polyp burden measured by chromo-endoscopy, the number of patients who presented&#xD;
      an adenoma during follow-up according to the affected gene (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or other),&#xD;
      sessile serrated adenoma burden, colon cancers diagnosed at scheduled surveillance&#xD;
      colonoscopies, interval colon cancer (diagnosed between two colonoscopies). The number of&#xD;
      colonoscopies performed during follow-up, the quality of bowel cleansing, the observance&#xD;
      assessed by remaining tablets in blisters and adverse events are monitored. At randomization&#xD;
      and at the end of study, stool collection, blood drops collection on blotting paper, quality&#xD;
      of life using the SF36 questionnaire, validated food frequency questionnaire (SU-VI-MAX2,&#xD;
      U557 INSERM) and physical activity questionnaire are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis, main objective(s) and endpoint(s) Gut microbiota seems to be a major player in&#xD;
      CRC carcinogenesis. Better knowledge on microbiota role in CRC carcinogenesis could lead to&#xD;
      better prevention and surveillance particularly in high risk LS patients but also in standard&#xD;
      risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the role of the gut microbiota using&#xD;
      metagenomic analysis in CRC carcinogenesis in LS patients. The AAS-LYNCH study design design&#xD;
      will allow evaluation of the role of the gut microbiota in adenoma apparition or recurrence&#xD;
      in patients according to well characterized associated dietary risk factors and other life&#xD;
      style factors, involved genes and neoplasia involved pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective To compare fecal microbiota diversity in LS patients with no previous&#xD;
      adenoma vs LS patients with an history of adenoma or adenoma at inclusion in AAS-Lynch study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe differences in the gut microbiota diversity using metagenomic analysis according&#xD;
      to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  involved LS genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or in EPCAM genes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adenoma type (advanced or non-advanced adenoma) and presence of serrated polyp&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diet, using dietary patterns (a priori and a posteriori patterns)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  other life style factors : BMI, physical activity, alcohol, tobacco&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives (not included in the present application) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      With an expected 30% adenoma recurrence after colon initial clearance, the 48 months&#xD;
      follow-up will allow to explore differences in gut microbiota characterized by metagenomic&#xD;
      analysis according adenoma recurrence. The 48 months follow-up with new fecal collection will&#xD;
      also allow describing differences in gut microbiota according to aspirin exposition. No&#xD;
      additional funding will be required for these evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study evaluating the chemopreventive aspirin effect in LS patients coordinated by the&#xD;
      UK-CAPP group is ongoing with a similar design but without placebo group and different&#xD;
      endpoints. Final shared analysis was discussed. An evaluation of international variation in&#xD;
      fecal microbiota in relation with LS will be discussed with this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint (linked to the primary objective) This study will compare fecal microbiota&#xD;
      richness and composition differences between LS patients with no previous adenoma at&#xD;
      inclusion in AAS-Lynch study and LS patients with history of adenoma or adenoma at inclusion&#xD;
      in AAS-Lynch study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints (linked to the secondary objectives)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut microbiota composition(taxonomic, functional and richness assessed by metagenomic&#xD;
      analysis) will be described according to :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  involved LS genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or in EPCAM genes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adenoma type (advanced or non-advanced adenoma) and presence of serrated polyp&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diet, using dietary patterns (a priori and a posteriori patterns)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  other life style factors : BMI, physical activity, alcohol, tobacco&#xD;

&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in western&#xD;
      countries. CRC prevention and screening are major public health issues. Better knowledge of&#xD;

      CRC risk with at a putative better surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional therapies as prebiotic or probiotic therapies using specific microbes or&#xD;
      genetically modified microbes could also be considered as preventive tools in near future.&#xD;
