    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine patient effectiveness outcomes of a transdiagnostic&#xD;
      treatment for youth emotional disorders, implemented in a partial hospitalization program&#xD;
      (PHP). Participants will be youth between ages 6 to 17 and their families, as well as&#xD;
      clinicians, participating in the PHP program at Children's Hospital Colorado. Additionally,&#xD;
      the research team will study modifications to the transdiagnostic intervention that are&#xD;
      required to feasibly and effectively deliver it in a PHP setting.&#xD;
