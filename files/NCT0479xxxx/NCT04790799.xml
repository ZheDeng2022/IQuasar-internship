  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomised controlled trial examining the effect of decreased waiting time for the first&#xD;
      doctors' appointment, patient education, glove counselling and counselling at departments of&#xD;
      social or occupational medicine on severity of hand eczema, quality of life, use of&#xD;
      corticosteroids, and jobsituation 3-12 months after intervention in patients with suspected&#xD;
      occupational contact dermatitis of the hands.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with suspected occupational hand eczema are recruited to the study on basis of their&#xD;
      referral from general practitioner to dermatologist. Patients are randomised to either&#xD;
      control or intervention group. The control group is treated and followed-up by the&#xD;
      dermatologist they have been referred to, while the intervention group is treated and&#xD;
      followed-up at Gentofte Hospital skin department with a maximum waiting time of 3 weeks. At&#xD;
      the skin department at Gentofte Hospital, the patients in the intervention group receive&#xD;
      patient education in prevention and treatment of hand eczema, glove counselling, personal&#xD;
      product screening by a chemistry engineer, extended allergy testing and the standard&#xD;
      treatment of hand eczema. Patients in both the control and intervention group are asked to&#xD;
      fill out a questionnaire at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after inclusion in the study. The&#xD;
      questionnaire contains questions about quality of life, severity of hand exzema,&#xD;
      jobsituation, use of healthcare service and use of medicine. Furthermore, prescriptions of&#xD;
      medicine are registered in both control and intervention group at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.&#xD;
