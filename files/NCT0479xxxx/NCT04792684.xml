  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective multi-center observational study. The study will enroll eligible subjects from&#xD;
      the United States to optimize the biomarker panel and evaluate the performance of a cfDNA&#xD;
      marker panel selected by the Sponsor for CRC and advanced adenoma detection.&#xD;

      This study is designed to prospectively collect blood samples and clinical data from subjects&#xD;
      that have a suspected advanced adenoma or have been newly diagnosed with CRC scheduled for&#xD;
      resection surgery, as well as subjects who are at average-risk of colorectal cancer and who&#xD;
      are scheduled for routine colonoscopy examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects interested in participation and who meet inclusion criteria and provide written&#xD;
      informed consent will be enrolled in the study. By accepting participation in the study,&#xD;
      subjects will consent to provide up to 40 ml of blood at the study visit.&#xD;

        Two cohorts of patients aged between 45 and 84, who have a suspected advanced adenoma or&#xD;
        have been newly diagnosed with CRC, still not resected and scheduled for surgery, and&#xD;
        patients who are at average risk of developing colorectal cancer, scheduled for a&#xD;
        standard-of-care screening colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be considered enrolled after understanding and signing the ICF and a&#xD;
        determination is made by the Investigator that the subject is eligible to participate&#xD;
        according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Enrollment will be stopped when a sufficient number of confirmed cases of colorectal&#xD;
        cancer, advanced adenomas, and matching control subjects have been enrolled. Under the&#xD;
        current assumptions, 1,200 subjects will need to be enrolled.&#xD;
