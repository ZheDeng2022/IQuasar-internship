  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resin composites, the first choice of material for the restoration of posterior teeth, still&#xD;
      have several drawbacks including their polymerization shrinkage and potential failure of the&#xD;
      resin-dentin interface leading to secondary caries. Time-saving and simplified restorative&#xD;
      procedures are an ongoing demand for posterior applications.The bulk-fill resin based&#xD;
      composites (BF-RBCs), has been developed with an attempt to speed up the restoration process&#xD;
      by enabling up to 4- or 5-mm thick increments to be cured in one step. The photo-polymerized&#xD;
      single-step BF-RBC materials seem to have some limitations in terms of adequate&#xD;
      polymerization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, recently, the use of dual-polymeritzed RBCs that are also suitable for bulk-fill&#xD;
      application with additional bioactive properties such as acid-neutralizing ion release has&#xD;
      been offered as an alternative to photo-polymerized ones. Cention N (Ivoclar Vivadent,&#xD;
      Schaan, Liechtenstein) restorative material is one approach that has been introduced as a new&#xD;
      material category for this purpose. The hand mixed form is named as Cention N whereas&#xD;
      auto-mixed capsule form is Cention. Both of them are resin based composite materials&#xD;
      categorised as 'alkasite'. They are self-curing composites with optional photo-polymerzation&#xD;
      for full volume (bulk) placement. Their composition is same with only exception of the&#xD;
      concentration of the initiators and the powder liquid proportion. Cention is delivered&#xD;
      together with Cention Primer to ensures the retention of the filling independent of the&#xD;
      preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this prospective clinical trial is to evaluate the clinical performance of&#xD;
      Cention and Cention Primer in restoration of Class I and II cavities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to place at least 90 posterior restorations with Cention (in at least&#xD;
      45 patients). The patients will be informed about the study and ask to sign the Informed&#xD;
      Consent. After having the initial radiographs and images, the preperation will be performed&#xD;
      by standard procedures. As the cavity preparation is finished the measurement of the cavity&#xD;
      dimensions will be performed by using a periodontal probe. After having the cavity images the&#xD;
      cavity will be restored by Cention according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following&#xD;
      the occlusal adjustment final image of the restoration will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 2 weeks the patient will be recalled in order to asses the baseline FDI criteria by two&#xD;
      observers. This recall appointment will be done annually up to 3 years.&#xD;

    <description>2 independent evaluators The primary outcome will consist in the FDI (World Dental Federation) instrument for dental restorations assessment, as it was published after consensus in 2007 and updated in 2010 . This instrument is composed of three dimensions (biological, functional and esthetic), each consisting of several items that are assessed by clinical and radiographic examination according to Likert scales of 5 terms. Some items are evaluated quantitatively, others visually.The worst score of all items is retained as the overall score of the restoration, thus resulting in a single (ordinal) primary outcome.</description>
