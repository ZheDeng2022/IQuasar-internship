  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a disease that affects a large number of people.&#xD;
      To date, no adequate treatment is available. This is partially due to the heterogeneity of&#xD;
      the patients and the complicated pathology in which not all mechanisms are understood. Based&#xD;
      on results of in vitro screening within the IBSQUtrition project, we selected promising&#xD;
      dietary supplements for validation of their potential beneficial effects on stool pattern in&#xD;
      IBS-Constipation (IBS-C) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective is to determine the effects of a 4-week intervention with&#xD;
      either a prebiotic supplement or a probiotic supplement on stool pattern (including stool&#xD;
      frequency, consistency, and volume) in IBS-C patients. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      determine the effects if this intervention on GI complaints and quality of life in IBS-C&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial will be conducted with&#xD;
      three parallel intervention arms Study population: 180 adult (18-70 yrs) IBS patients with a&#xD;
      constipation-predominant subtype Intervention: A 4 week run-in period will be followed by a&#xD;
      4-week intervention period with three parallel arms: 1) prebiotic supplement, 2) probiotic&#xD;
      supplement, and 3) Placebo supplement, during which the study participants consume the&#xD;
      respective supplement twice per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary study parameter is stool pattern: stool&#xD;
      frequency, stool consistency; and stool volume. The secondary study parameters are&#xD;
      gastrointestinal complaints, Quality of Life, and HADS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Study participants have to invest about 14.5 hours of their time in this study&#xD;
      mainly to complete several questionnaires (short daily questionnaire, longer questionnaires&#xD;
      at three occasions), which is conveniently all possible from home. They have to comply to&#xD;
      consume a supplement twice daily for four weeks. At two time points they have to collect&#xD;
      their stool for five consecutive days. There are limited risks for the study participants.&#xD;
