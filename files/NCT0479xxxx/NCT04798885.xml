  <brief_summary>

      The study tests the promising results of a previous study (GAIN 1.0) in a larger RCT (GAIN&#xD;
      2.0) which takes place in the municipalities of Central Denmark Region where citizens live&#xD;
      their daily lives and whose health- and social care systems support citizens who experience&#xD;
      persisting PCS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concussion, the mildest form of traumatic brain injury, is an important public health&#xD;
      concern. Recent studies estimate that persistent post-concussion symptoms (PCS) are present&#xD;
      in almost half of the affected citizens at one year post-injury. Prospective studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that these citizens are at risk of developing long-lasting symptoms which are&#xD;
      associated with high societal burden due to long-term impact on labour market attachment and&#xD;
      increased use of health care and social benefits. In Denmark, there has in recent years been&#xD;
      an increasing awareness on societal impact and personal consequences of PCS. Accordingly,&#xD;
      clinicians as well as social workers and therapists in the municipalities point to the gab in&#xD;
      knowledge concerning PCS and advocate urgently for evidence-based treatment for these&#xD;
      citizens. Recently, the research group behind this application developed a novel early&#xD;
      intervention - &quot;Get going After concussIoN&quot; (GAIN 1.0) - for citizens who experience&#xD;
      persistent PCS three to six months post-concussion. The intervention was tested in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) with promising results. However, it was delivered in a&#xD;
      single hospital setting in which these citizens are normally not cared for. In this study the&#xD;
      intention is to test the results of GAIN 1.0 in a larger RCT (GAIN 2.0) which takes place in&#xD;
      the municipalities of Central Denmark Region where citizens live their daily lives and whose&#xD;
      health- and social care systems support citizens who experience persisting PCS.&#xD;
