      The purpose of this study is to look at the best ways to prevent cognitive decline (loss of&#xD;
      memory and/or functioning) in midlife and older Latino adults living with HIV. It assesses&#xD;
      the feasibility of running a health promotion program, led by a community health worker (CHW)&#xD;
      intended to help prevent cognitive decline (loss of memory and/or functioning) through a&#xD;
      culturally tailored health promotion intervention . Eligible participants will be&#xD;
      Latino/Hispanic individuals 50 years of age or older, living with HIV, who may be at risk of&#xD;
      developing chronic diseases such as dementia and Alzherimer's.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Trail Making Test (TMT). Time to accurately complete Part A and Part B. The TMT measures neurocognitive functioning and consists of two parts; the first part requires participants to connect numbers in ascending order, while the second part requires individuals to connect numbers and letters in sequence. The test is scored by the time it takes to accurately complete each test. Increases in time correlate with greater impairment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) asks participants to repeat 2-9 numbers forward, backward and in ascending order to assess attention, processing speed, and working memory. The scores are summarized with lower scores indicating increased cognitive impairment.</description>

    <description>HOLA is a multicomponent health promotion intervention. First component is a one-on-one social and physical activation with the participant and the community health worker (CHW). Each session will last approximately 30 minutes at day 1 and week 8. The second component is a group walk led by a CHW for 45 minutes, 3 times a week, for 16 weeks. The third component consists of scheduling pleasant events at the end of each group walk session.</description>
