  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Non-infectious uveitis (NIUs) include a heterogeneous group of&#xD;
      sight-threatening conditions. NIUs can be highly disabling and be associated with a profound&#xD;
      impact in the quality-of-life (QoL) and wellbeing. Their correct management sometimes&#xD;
      requires the use of immunosuppressive drugs (ISDs), which can be prescribed in monotherapy or&#xD;
      in combination. Several observational studies have provided evidence that the use of ISDs in&#xD;
      combination could be more effective than and as safe as their use in monotherapy. However, a&#xD;
      direct comparison between these two treatment strategies has not been carried out yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: The Combination THerapy with mEthotrexate and adalImumAb for uveitis&#xD;
      (CoTHEIA) study is a phase III, multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blinded with&#xD;
      masked outcome assessment, parallel three arms with 1:1:1 allocation, active-controlled,&#xD;
      superiority study design, comparing the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      methotrexate (MTX), adalimumab (ADA), or their combination in non-infectious non-anterior&#xD;
      uveitis. The duration of the treatment and follow-up will last up to 52 weeks. The complete&#xD;
      and maintained resolution of the ocular inflammation will be assessed by masked evaluators&#xD;
      (primary outcome). In addition to other secundray measures of efficacy (QoL, visual acuity,&#xD;
      costs) and safety, we will identify subjects' subgroups with different treatment responses by&#xD;
      developing prediction models based on machine learning techniques using genetic and proteomic&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
