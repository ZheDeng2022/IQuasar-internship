  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Anxiety is common in critically ill patients, and has likely become more prevalent&#xD;
      in the recent decade due to the imperative of the recent PADIS guidelines to use low levels&#xD;
      of sedation and strive for wakefulness. Administration of sedative and analgesic medication&#xD;
      is often chosen to reduce anxiety, especially when associated with agitation, but especially&#xD;
      sedatives are associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, delirium and muscle wasting&#xD;
      and are therefore preferably minimized. Previous studies have suggested positive effects of&#xD;
      music interventions on anxiety in the critically ill, next to other physiological signs such&#xD;
      as pain. However, management of anxiety has not been included in the PADIS guidelines, and&#xD;
      there is lack of evidence to treat it in spite of its growing importance. Therefore, we aim&#xD;
      to study the effect of music intervention on anxiety in adult critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective is to assess the effect of music intervention on the level&#xD;
      of anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A randomized controlled trial. Study population: Adult patients admitted to the&#xD;
      intensive care unit, with whom communication is possible (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale&#xD;
      of -2 or higher).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): The music group will be offered to listen to music two times&#xD;
      per day for three days after inclusion, during 30-60 minutes per session. Chosen music will&#xD;
      be based on the preference of the patient. The control group will receive standard of care&#xD;
      during the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is the effect of music on the Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale for anxiety (VAS-A). Secondary outcomes include effect of music on sedation&#xD;
      and agitation level, medication requirement, pain, sleep, delirium, heart rate, mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure, and ICU memory and experience.&#xD;
