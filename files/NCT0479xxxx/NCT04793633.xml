  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to develop a method to detect pancreatic cancer (ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma) using ultrasound technology. It is called the LINFU™ Technique and done by&#xD;
      analysis of pancreatic fluid collected with the help of ultrasound. This is an&#xD;
      investigational way to detect pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The results of this procedure&#xD;
      will not be used to guide medical care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will undergo collection of pancreatic fluid by the LINFU™ Technique as part of this&#xD;
      study. This procedure takes about 30-45 minutes. This procedure will be done in the beginning&#xD;
      of the participant's standard of care endoscopic ultrasound procedure (EUS). The details for&#xD;
      the procedure are listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LINFU™ Technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Once the participant is sedated or under anesthesia, low intensity non-focused&#xD;
           ultrasound excitation of the pancreas will be implemented. This means the sound waves&#xD;
           from the ultrasound on the top of the stomach will be used to stimulate the pancreas to&#xD;
           release juice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During the ultrasound, the Investigator will administer Lumason through a vein in the&#xD;
           participant's arm (IV). Lumason is a contrast agent that was frequently used to create&#xD;
           bubbles that allows a better visualization of images. In this study, Lumason will be&#xD;
           used to create bubbles and possibly increase the number of pancreatic cells collected&#xD;
           for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. After 25 minutes of ultrasound, the participant will receive an IV dose of secretin over&#xD;
           1 minute. Naturally, secretin is a hormone released into the bloodstream by a part of&#xD;
           the small intestine, namely duodenum, (especially in response to acidity) to stimulate&#xD;
           secretion by the liver and pancreas. In this study, Secretin is used to increase the&#xD;
           number of pancreatic cell excretion to maximize the number of cells collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The participant will then undergo clinically indicated EGD (insertion of a tube down the&#xD;
           throat and past the stomach). EGD stands for esophagogastroduodenoscopy. This procedure&#xD;
           would be done regardless of participating in the study. The Investigator who is doing&#xD;
           EGD will discuss all risks and explain how the procedure will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The pancreatic juice will be collected immediately. About 15 minutes after the EGD&#xD;
           procedure has begun, a second dose of secretin will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The pancreatic juice will continue to be collected for a total of 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will then continue with the standard evaluation of the suspected malignancy&#xD;
      with endoscopic ultrasound, with or without fine-needle aspiration (FNA). This is not part of&#xD;
      the study and the Investigator has already determined that this test is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LINFU technique won't be used to guide medical care. This is an experimental technique so&#xD;
      participants won't receive the results. Participants will undergo clinical diagnostic&#xD;
      procedures as part of the standard medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be called 24 hours after the study procedure and 30 days after the&#xD;
      procedure to see if any symptoms of pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas have&#xD;
      developed). If so, participants will be asked to come back to the clinic for further&#xD;
      evaluation as would be done as part of the standard medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any identifiable private information or specimens collected and/or used for the purposes of&#xD;
      this research will not be used or distributed for future research studies.&#xD;
