  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NG SI IMT (Next Generation Small Incision Implantable Miniature Telescope) 3X implant is&#xD;
      intended to improve vision in patients with end-stage Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an interventional, prospective, multicenter, open label, single group assignment&#xD;
      Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) study in men and women &gt;55 years with central vision&#xD;
      impairment associated with end-stage AMD. After signing an informed consent, subjects will be&#xD;
      prescreened for eligibility in the study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Baseline visual acuity of the study subjects will be assessed with a 2.7X external telescope&#xD;
      simulator (ETS) using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Trial (ETDRS) charts. To be&#xD;
      included in the study and to proceed with the surgery, subjects must achieve, using the ETS,&#xD;
      at least a one line (5 or more letters) improvement in distance on the ETDRS chart in the eye&#xD;
      scheduled for surgery. Visual acuity must be at least one line (5 or more letters) better&#xD;
      with the ETS than Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the fellow eye without the ETS.&#xD;
      Subjects not meeting these criteria will be excluded from the study. Following this&#xD;
      assessment, eligible subjects will undergo three pre-op visits with the low vision&#xD;
      rehabilitation/training specialist prior to continuation of testing for inclusion in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once it will be determined that the subject experiences improvement in visual acuity with the&#xD;
      use of the ETS, he/she will be further evaluated for eligibility, with near and distance&#xD;
      BCVA, manifest refraction, intraocular pressure (IOP), slit lamp examination, non-contact&#xD;
      specular microscopy (before or after home use of ETS), Anterior Chamber Depth (ACD) profile&#xD;
      by Ultrasound Biomicroscopy (UBM), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), or another applicable&#xD;
      test method, and axial eye length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be implanted with the Tsert System model NG SI IMT 3X. Postoperatively,&#xD;
      the surgeon will complete a usability and satisfaction questionnaire after each implantation&#xD;
      procedure. The patients will undergo ophthalmic evaluations in both eyes at regular intervals&#xD;
      for up to 12 months to determine the change in visual acuity and Endothelial Cell Density&#xD;
      (ECD) in the both eyes. The subjects will also be required to undergo 6 to 10 additional&#xD;
      visits for vision training with a low vision specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical complications, as well as all Adverse Event (AEs) and use of medications will be&#xD;
      monitored from baseline to the end of the study.&#xD;
