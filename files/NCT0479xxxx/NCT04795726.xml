  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes complication caused by damage to the small blood&#xD;
      vessels inside the retina at the back of the eye. Diabetic retinopathy may cause mild vision&#xD;
      problems or eventually blindness. Diabetes is a condition that makes your blood sugar levels&#xD;
      higher than they should be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the early stages of diabetic retinopathy - called non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
      (NPDR)- increased blood sugar levels lead to damage to the tiny blood vessels of the retina.&#xD;
      This damage results in small outpouchings of the vessel lumens leading to rupture. At the&#xD;
      same time the blood vessels can leak and making the retina swell and can cause so called&#xD;
      macula edema. In these early stages of DR current treatment to reduce the risk of this eye&#xD;
      complication is focused on controlling blood sugar levels and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study have NPDR, Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD),&#xD;
      a condition in which the kidneys become damaged and do not work as they should. These&#xD;
      participants are already taking part in one of the phase 3 studies (FIDELIO-DKD and&#xD;
      FIGARO-DKD). They study the effect of Finerenone on delaying kidney disease progression and&#xD;
      reducing the risk of events that may cause damage to the heart and blood vessels To learn&#xD;
      more about the effect of Finerenone on diabetic retinopathy, data from routine eye&#xD;
      examinations performed during the two phase 3 studies will be collected and analyzed. All&#xD;
      male and female participants included in this study are at least 18 years.&#xD;
