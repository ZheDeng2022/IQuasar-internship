  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant Pleural Effusions (MPE) are a common problem with around 40,000 new cases in the UK&#xD;
      each year. The presence of an MPE suggests a poor prognosis of on average of 3-12 months. It&#xD;
      is therefore vital that the investigators consider how respiratory and palliative care&#xD;
      physicians can best support patients with MPEs to have the best quality of life possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathlessness is the most common presenting symptom of an MPE and so impact on this has&#xD;
      previously been studied . Cancer-related fatigue is very common with evidence suggesting&#xD;
      around 40% of patients experience fatigue at diagnosis and up to 90% during anti-cancer&#xD;
      treatment such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Review of the literature suggests that&#xD;
      whether interventions to manage MPEs can improve patient fatigue has not previously been&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess if interventions for MPEs could potentially improve&#xD;
      patient fatigue as this information will be valuable for both patients and referring&#xD;
      health-care professionals when making the decision of whether to have a procedure or not and&#xD;
      build on the current evidence base around management of MPEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be part of a Masters in Clinical Research and will be within a single trust.&#xD;
      It will be a pilot study for a potentially larger multi-center study. With this in mind,&#xD;
      aspects of how the study runs and notes on how it could be improved upon will be carefully&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess if the interventions for MPEs have an impact on fatigue&#xD;
      levels. There are multiple different possible interventions to treat a pleural effusion and&#xD;
      the most appropriate is decided on a case-by-case basis after discussion between the patient&#xD;
      and doctor. The study will have no impact on which intervention the participant receives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue is extreme tiredness unrelieved by rest. It is how the patient feels and so there is&#xD;
      no specific test for it. However there are a number of tools that help record a patients&#xD;
      self-reported fatigue levels and how this changes over time. The FACIT-fatigue tool has been&#xD;
      studied in patients with cancer-related fatigue and has the strongest evidence base and&#xD;
      validation in this patient group. It involves the patient answering 13 questions related to&#xD;
      fatigue and its impact on their activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are multiple contributing factors associated with malignancy-related fatigue and so&#xD;
      consent will be gained to gather data on potential confounding factors. This will include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient diagnosis (site/type of cancer and whether metastatic)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidities (esp. lung disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time since cancer diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time since last anti-cancer therapy/if currently having chemotherapy or radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BEDS&amp;GADS score for anxiety/depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient Outcome Score (POS) indicating whether high symptom burden&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Size of pleural effusion &amp; if unilateral/bilateral&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood markers- Haemoglobin level &amp; Creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve a single pleural service in Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation&#xD;
      Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both inpatients and outpatients are referred to the pleural service. They are assessed in&#xD;
      clinic and a decision made on the most appropriate treatment of the Malignant Pleural&#xD;
      Effusion. The study will have no impact on which intervention is chosen. Once the decision is&#xD;
      made the patient will be asked by the doctor in clinic if they are potentially interested in&#xD;
      being involved in the study. If they are interested then they will be seen by the researcher&#xD;
      who will take them through the Participant Information Sheet (PIS) and give them the&#xD;
      opportunity to ask questions. If they agree then they will be invited to provide written&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher is a consultant with training in assessing patients capacity and so it will be&#xD;
      ensured that all participants are able to give valid written consent. Those unable to give&#xD;
      consent will be excluded from the study. Reasonable adjustments will be made to cater for&#xD;
      patients with hearing or visual impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be made clear that the decision to take part in the study or not will have no impact&#xD;
      on the patient's care. It will also be explained that the patient is free to withdraw from&#xD;
      the study at any time and under no obligation to give reason for doing so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be made clear to the potential participants that taking part in the study will have&#xD;
      no impact on their treatment. There will be no direct benefit to the participant other than&#xD;
      for altruistic reasons such as knowing that their involvement is contributing to the research&#xD;
      base which may improve care for patients of the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is fairly low burden as it is a short questionnaire about fatigue levels (13&#xD;
      questions) and permission to gather further data about the patient (age, sex, disease site,&#xD;
      performance status, last Hb result- see list above). The participant will give permission for&#xD;
      the researcher to telephone them to repeat the questions after 7,14 &amp; 30 days. The question&#xD;
      takes less than 5 minutes to answer and so is of low burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no direct risk to staff or patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that the patient becomes more unwell or dies during the 30-day study period.&#xD;
      It may therefore be upsetting to the patient or family to be contacted if this was the case.&#xD;
      To try and avoid this then the patient's electronic records will be consulted prior to making&#xD;
      contact via telephone. However, it may occasionally be possible that the death is not yet&#xD;
      recorded in the electronic records and so all calls will be handled in a sensitive manner.&#xD;
      The researcher is a Palliative Medicine consultant with advanced communication skills&#xD;
      training and many years experience of having discussions with patients approaching the end of&#xD;
      life as well as bereaved families.&#xD;
