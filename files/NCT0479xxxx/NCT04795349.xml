    <textblock>
      The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer is well established. Increasing&#xD;
      rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) has increased de-escalation of surgical&#xD;
      techniques. The objective of the study is to evaluate new radiologic techniques that can&#xD;
      accurately detect complete response in order to eliminate breast surgery. . . Currently,&#xD;
      there are several imaging techniques for NAC response assessment (magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      -MRI-, mammography and ultrasound), with good correlation in partial response, but they lack&#xD;
      power in predicting complete pathological response. The investigators propose to use IVIM&#xD;
      (Intravoxel incoherent motion), Kurtosis (DKI by Diffusion Kurtosis imaging) and diffusion&#xD;
      tensor image (DTI) in MRI, contrast enhancement mammography and shear wave elastography for&#xD;
      the evaluation of the response to systemic treatment in breast cancer patients. In order to&#xD;
      validate the technique, in those patients with a radiological complete response by all the&#xD;
      radiological imaging methods, a vacuum-assisted biopsy will be performed before surgery.&#xD;
      After that, a comparison will be done between the results of the pre surgical biopsy and the&#xD;
      definitive pathology of the specimen. So the investigators can evaluate if patients with&#xD;
      complete radiological response after NAC, can be spared breast surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer is well established. In&#xD;
      inoperable patients at the time of diagnosis, the goal of NAC is to achieve a pathologic&#xD;
      complete response (pCR) which has shown that it improves disease-free survival when compared&#xD;
      to those cases with residual tumoral cells. Detection of the presence of residual disease is&#xD;
      crucial for surgical planning; the ultimate goal would be to avoid surgery in those patients&#xD;
      who achieve a pCR, though nowadays validated techniques with power enough to detect this&#xD;
      residual disease are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, several imaging techniques for NAC response assessment are being used (magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging -MRI-, mammography and ultrasound), with good correlation in partial&#xD;
      response, but they lack power in predicting complete pathological response; among them,&#xD;
      nowadays the most accurate is MRI. In recent years, the use of the diffusion-enhanced images&#xD;
      have been proposed for the quantitative characterization and for helping to improve the&#xD;
      specificity of dynamic contrast study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to use a bi-exponential model, IVIM (Intravoxel incoherent motion),&#xD;
      which differentiates between microperfusion used by microvascular blood flow from the&#xD;
      diffusion of water. Kurtosis (DKI by Diffusion Kurtosis imaging) which quantifies the&#xD;
      deviation from the Gaussian pattern and diffusion tensor image (DTI) which provides&#xD;
      information on the microstructure and pathophysiology tumor, presenting a statistically&#xD;
      significant relationship with tumor cellularity. Preliminary studies have reported promising&#xD;
      results for the evaluation of the early response to systemic treatment in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients. Its utility for NAC response assessment in these patients will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have evaluated the application of contrast mammography in the assessment of&#xD;
      the response to NAC, with MRI-like results. It is a faster and cheaper technique compared to&#xD;
      MRI radiological evaluation of the response after NAC through this technique will be assessed&#xD;
      and compared its results with the different techniques used in previous studies / in daily&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shear wave elastography is a very useful tool for the quantitative assessment of the tissue&#xD;
      hardness that is widely used for differentiating benign lesions from malignant ones. Nowadays&#xD;
      some studies are investigating its usefulness in the assessment of the radiological&#xD;
      evaluation after NAC, with promising results in terms of early evaluation. In this study, the&#xD;
      elastography will be performed on pre surgical evaluation and its correlation with&#xD;
      pathological anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to validate the technique, in those patients with a radiological complete response&#xD;
      by all the radiological imaging methods, a stereotactic biopsy will be performed before&#xD;
      surgery. After that, a comparison will be done between the results of the pre surgical biopsy&#xD;
      and the definitive pathology of the specimen. If the false negative rate of the presurgical&#xD;
      assessment including the biopsy are below 5%, patients could spare surgery when there is a&#xD;
      complete radiological response. Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate if patients with complete radiological response after NAC, in this setting can be&#xD;
      spared breast surgery. . - To determine if IVIM, KURTOSIS or DTI diffusion sequences in MRI&#xD;
      can assess the response to NAC better than conventional sequences and, thus, be able to avoid&#xD;
      the use of intravenous contrast in the MRI study in the future. - To determine whether the&#xD;
      study of breast elastography with shear wave technology, is more sensitive or specific in the&#xD;
      detection of residual tumor after NAC in breast cancer. - To determining whether contrast&#xD;
      enhanced mammography helps us to assess the response to NAC in breast cancer, compared to MRI&#xD;
      standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected results are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      False negative rate of pre-surgery biopsy &lt;5%. Achieve a sensitivity &gt;80% for the&#xD;
      radiological tests in predicting pCR for selected tumoral subtypes (Triple Negative and HER2&#xD;
      enriched tumors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninferiority of contrast mammography compared to breast MRI in determining the response to&#xD;
      NAC.&#xD;
