  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent microperfusion alterations after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) are&#xD;
      associated with poor survival. To our knowledge, no human studies evaluating microperfusion&#xD;
      during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with simple and pre-hospital available tests have&#xD;
      been published. Capillary refill time (CRT) and skin-mottling-score (SMS) are parameters for&#xD;
      microperfusion and evaluated in septic and cardiogenic shock. In animal studies,&#xD;
      microperfusion was impaired during cardiac arrest, although not correlating with systemic&#xD;
      blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between impaired microcirculation (as&#xD;
      measured with CRT and SMS) during resuscitation and ROSC resp. neurological outcome. Our&#xD;
      clinical impression in daily routine is, that the appearance of a patient undergoing CPR is&#xD;
      often linked to the outcome. We hypothesize, that this is due to changes in microperfusion of&#xD;
      the skin.&#xD;
