      SYNOPSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION Adults in good general health ≥18 and &lt;51 years of age who meet all protocol&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and do not meet any protocol exclusion criteria and who understand the&#xD;
      study and provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS Approximately 105 participants (84 active product and 21 placebo&#xD;
      recipients) will be included in the study. An over-enrollment of up to 5 participants will be&#xD;
      permitted to facilitate rapid enrollment. Participants who leave the study for any reason&#xD;
      will not be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE-ESCALATION This is a dose-escalation study as indicated in the study design table. The&#xD;
      first 3 enrollments in Groups 1 through 4 will be on consecutive days with no more than 1&#xD;
      participant allowed on each day across all sites. Safety and tolerability of the IP will be&#xD;
      evaluated by the Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) over 7 days after vaccination (Days 1&#xD;
      through 8) for the first 6 participants in the lower dose group (Group 1) before enrollment&#xD;
      proceeds to the next dose level (Group 2). Similar PSRT reviews, including cumulative data as&#xD;
      it is obtained, will be repeated before enrollment is initiated in Groups 3 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to opening enrollment in Groups 5 through 7, an independent Safety Monitoring Committee&#xD;
      (SMC) will review 14-day post-vaccination safety data at a minimum for all participants in&#xD;
      Groups 1 through 4. In addition, they will review shedding data to rule out excessive&#xD;
      shedding of rVSV∆G LASV-glycoprotein precursor complex (GPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE GROUP EXPANSION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups 5 through 7 will provide additional safety data for the 3 highest dose groups provided&#xD;
      data from the earlier part of the study warrant further study of each dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FORMULATIONS, VOLUMES AND ROUTES OF INJECTIONS Single-dose vaccine vials at a nominal&#xD;
      concentration of 2x107 pfu/0.5mL will be provided frozen at ≤ -65oC for intramuscular (IM)&#xD;
      administration. Single use matched diluent will also be provided at 2-8oC to be used as&#xD;
      vaccine diluent or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION Participants will be screened up to 42 days before IP&#xD;
      administration and will be followed for 12 months after IP administration. It is anticipated&#xD;
      that it will take approximately 3 months to enroll Groups 1 through 4 and 2 months to enroll&#xD;
      Groups 5, 6, and 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated study duration for each participant in Groups 1 through 7 is approximately&#xD;
      13.5 months from screening through last study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING Participants will randomly be assigned to vaccine or placebo in a&#xD;
      4:1 ratio as described in the study design table above. Groups 1 through 4 will be enrolled&#xD;
      sequentially in the dose-escalation phase of the trial. For Groups 5 through 7, randomization&#xD;
      will occur across groups rather than be performed sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An unblinded study pharmacist at each site will be responsible for IP preparation and&#xD;
      accountability. All other study site staff and participants will be blinded in terms of&#xD;
      active product versus placebo. For the dose group expansion phase, study site staff and&#xD;
      participants will also be blinded to the dose of vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY MONITORING Safety will be monitored by the Investigators, the Sponsor's Medical&#xD;
      Monitor, and a PSRT on a regular basis and between enrollment of dosage groups during&#xD;
      dose-escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a favorable PSRT safety review of the first 6 participants in Group 1 and the&#xD;
      completion of Group 1 enrollment, enrollment will be initiated in Group 2. Similar PSRT&#xD;
      safety reviews will occur before progressing to Groups 3 and 4. Prior to opening enrollment&#xD;
      into Groups 5, 6, and 7, the SMC will review safety data for all participants in Groups 1&#xD;
      through 4, which include safety data from, at minimum, the first 14 days after IP&#xD;
      administration (Days 1 through 15). In addition, shedding data will be reviewed to rule out&#xD;
      excessive shedding of rVSV∆G-LASV-GPC. A second SMC review will take place after at least 45&#xD;
      (75%) of participants in the Dose Group Expansion portion of the study have reached the Day&#xD;
      15 timepoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ad hoc safety review by the SMC may be specifically requested by the Sponsor, the Principal&#xD;
      Investigators (PIs), Institutional Review Board(s) (IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committees&#xD;
      (IECs), Regulatory Authorities, or by the SMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have audiometry testing at timepoints as per the Schedule of Activities&#xD;
      (SOA). If the audiometry is abnormal, participants will have immediate referral for further&#xD;
      audiological evaluation. In the interim periods, the participant will be prompted to contact&#xD;
      the site for immediate evaluation if the participant notes a clinical change in hearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS A full data analysis will be prepared according to a pre specified&#xD;
      statistical analysis plan (SAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical and routine laboratory data will be included in the safety analysis.&#xD;
      Immunogenicity analyses will be performed according to a pre defined SAP.&#xD;

             approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Prior receipt of VSV-vectored vaccine (e.g. VSV-ZEBOV and VSV-HIV) Note: receipt of&#xD;
             placebo in a previous VSV-ZEBOV or VSV-HIVvaccine trial will not exclude a participant&#xD;
             from participation if documentation is available and the Medical Monitor gives&#xD;
             approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Receipt of blood transfusion or blood-derived products within the previous 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Prior exposure to LASV as documented by history (all groups). For participants&#xD;
             enrolled in an endemic area, NP antibody test will be performed. If positive results&#xD;
             are available prior to enrollment, participant will be excluded. If positive results&#xD;
             are obtained after enrollment, participant will be followed per protocol, but data&#xD;
             will be analyzed separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Participation in another clinical trial currently, within the previous 3 months, or&#xD;
             expected participation during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Concurrent participation in an observational study not requiring any blood or&#xD;
             tissue sample collection is not an exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. History of severe local or systemic reactogenicity to any vaccine (eg, anaphylaxis,&#xD;
             respiratory difficulties, angioedema, injection site necrosis, or ulceration)&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Psychiatric condition or substance abuse that compromises safety of the participant&#xD;
             and precludes compliance with the protocol. Specifically excluded are persons with&#xD;
             psychoses in the last 3 years prior to screening, ongoing risk for suicide, or history&#xD;
             of suicide attempt or gesture in the last 3 years prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Seizure disorder: A participant who has had a seizure in the last 3 years prior to&#xD;
             screening is excluded. (Not excluded: a participant with a history of seizures who has&#xD;
             neither required medications nor had a seizure in the last 3 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. A history of malignancy in the past 5 years (prior to screening) or ongoing&#xD;
             malignancy. (A history of a completely excised malignancy that is considered cured is&#xD;
             not an exclusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Active, serious infections requiring parenteral antibiotic, antiviral or antifungal&#xD;
             therapy within 30 days prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Body mass index (BMI) ≥35&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Mild or greater hearing loss defined as ≥26dB loss in the better hearing ear&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Otorrhea within the past 90 days, sudden or rapid hearing loss within the past 90&#xD;
             days, acute or chronic dizziness, otalgia. (External ear otalgia is not an exclusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. History of chronic or acute severe neurologic condition (e.g., diagnosis of&#xD;
             Guillain-Barré syndrome, epilepsy, Bell's palsy, meningitis or disease with any focal&#xD;
             neurologic deficits).&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. History of any condition associated with sensorineural hearing loss that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the detection of changes in hearing&#xD;
             during the study (e.g. occupational noise exposure, congenital infection, Meniere's&#xD;
             disease, acoustic neuroma).&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Clinically relevant abnormal otoscopy, that in the opinion of the investigator, may&#xD;
             interfere with the detection of changes in hearing&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. For study participants in the dose-escalation phase of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Current or planned occupational (medical care, child care) or household contact&#xD;
             (residing in the same household) from screening through 3 months after IP&#xD;
             administration with any individual at increased risk from exposure to a live viral&#xD;
             vaccine including infants less than 1 year of age, adults over 65 years of age, or&#xD;
             immunocompromised individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. If, in the opinion of the PI, it is not in the best interest of the participant to&#xD;
             participate in the trial&#xD;
