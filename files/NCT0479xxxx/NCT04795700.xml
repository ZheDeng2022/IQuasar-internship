  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence and mortality of lung cancer ranks first among cancers in the world, and the&#xD;
      five-year survival rate of lung cancer patients is only 15% to 30%. Lung cancer patients bear&#xD;
      a great psychological pressure, prone to anger, isolation, anxiety, depression, self-esteem&#xD;
      and other psychological problems. The incidence of psychological disorders in lung cancer&#xD;
      patients was 24.2 to 73.4%. A diagnosis of cancer not only causes physical and mental pain to&#xD;
      the patient, but also has a huge impact on the family and their caregivers. As&#xD;
      patients'primary coping resources, caregivers have to bear both physical and mental&#xD;
      pressures. Therefore, it is worth to attention the mental health of lung cancer patients and&#xD;
      their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the further deepening of self-concept research and the integration of Buddhist thought&#xD;
      and psychology, the new concept of 'self-compassion' was proposed and developed.&#xD;
      Self-compassion means that individuals treat themselves like their friends, with a friendly&#xD;
      and tolerant attitude; maintains an objective and rational attitude towards the individual's&#xD;
      own situation at all times; thinks that pain is a common experience shared by others, and&#xD;
      everyone should be understood and sympathized. At the same time, self-compassion not only&#xD;
      includes acceptance and affirmation of oneself, but also connects oneself with others,&#xD;
      advocating that one should sympathize with oneself as sympathizing with others, providing the&#xD;
      possibility of emotional connection between patients and their caregivers. Therefore, the&#xD;
      study of mindfulness and self-compassion is expected to provide a reference for improving the&#xD;
      dyadic mental health of lung cancer patient-caregiver dyads in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness Self-Compassion (MSC) is a positive psychology intervention method that covers&#xD;
      the concept of self-compassion developed by Neff and Germer on the basis of Mindfulness-based&#xD;
      Stress Reduction. MSC is a 2.5-hour weekly, 8-week standardized training course. Some studies&#xD;
      have shown that MSC can promote the emotional health of cancer patients and buffer their&#xD;
      mental symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To sum up, the current mindfulness self-compassion training program has been applied to some&#xD;
      cancer patients, and shows that the intervention has a positive effect, while the research in&#xD;
      China has only been initially applied in the student population, and has not been applied in&#xD;
      the field of cancer. Therefore, for lung cancer patient-caregiver dyad, the researchers can&#xD;
      learn from the experience of mindfulness self-compassion training and develop a dyadic mental&#xD;
      health intervention program based on Chinese condition. The current study aims to verify the&#xD;
      effect of the dyadic mindfulness self-compassion intervention program for lung cancer&#xD;
      patients and their caregivers, and explore its mechanism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was a single blind, follow-up, randomized, controlled trial. Researchers recruited&#xD;
      subjects from two general tertiary hospitals in Changsha, Hunan province, China. And the&#xD;
      whole trail was on the basis of the CONSORT statements. The two hospitals provided similar&#xD;
      conventional care for lung cancer patients. Study procedures were approved by the&#xD;
      institutional review boards of all participating centers before data collection began. All&#xD;
      patients were screened by researchers for eligibility and then enrolled in the study if&#xD;
      eligible and if the provided consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential eligible participants were identified by researchers according to medical records&#xD;
      at the colorectal surgery unit in each hospital. The participants were recruited with&#xD;
      informed consent, and researchers explained the study purposes, procedures, benefits, and&#xD;
      risks involved orally. The participants were then randomly allocated to the intervention or&#xD;
      the control group according to a computer-generated block randomization list. A sequentially&#xD;
      numbered and opaque , sealed envelope system was used by a non-investigator. The generated&#xD;
      random numbers were put into consecutively numbered and opaque sealed envelopes. When&#xD;
      enrolling and randomising a new participant, the enrolling investigators opened the sealed&#xD;
      envelope after participant's name was written on next available envelopes; the enrolling&#xD;
      investigators were blinded to the trial design and study hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will recruit 74 lung cancer patient-caregiver dyads and randomly divide them&#xD;
      into 2 groups: the control group, the dyadic intervention group. Among them, patients in the&#xD;
      control group and caregivers received routine psychological care programs; patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group had access to conventional care, in addition to receiving the 8-week&#xD;
      dyadic MSC intervention sessions. The intervention was provided by trained nurses, including&#xD;
      one researcher and one MSC therapist. The researcher was regarded as primary leader of the&#xD;
      intervention sessions. The leader informed patients of the schedule for each session using&#xD;
      the educational manual'Caring for ourselves, we are together' (developed by psychologists,&#xD;
      nursing managers, experienced MSC therapist, oncology Nurse, and researchers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MSC techniques include body scanning, breathing meditation, sitting meditation, walking&#xD;
      meditation, loving-kindness practice, and self-compassion writing expression. Intensive&#xD;
      training once a week, 1 hour each time, encourage students to use 15-20 minutes a day to&#xD;
      learn these skills, the total training time per week is 2.5 hours. The intervention is mainly&#xD;
      out-of-hospital intervention, supplemented by short-term in-hospital intervention (1-2 weeks,&#xD;
      adjusted according to the patient's hospital stay). The in-hospital stage focuses on guiding&#xD;
      the research subjects to understand the content of mindful self-compassion and emotions, and&#xD;
      conduct basic mindful self-compassion training; the outside of the hospital focuses on the&#xD;
      maintenance of mindful self-compassion training and the promotion of mindful life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were collected by a research assistant who was blind to the study design and allocation&#xD;
      of participants. At baseline, before randomization, sociodemographic and clinical&#xD;
      characteristics were collected from medical records and personal interviews. The two groups&#xD;
      of participants completed surveys after each follow-up via face to face interviews at&#xD;
      baseline (T0) and immediately after intervention (T1). The next two evaluations were&#xD;
      performed at 1-month (T2) and 3-months (T3) after intervention via telephone contact.&#xD;
