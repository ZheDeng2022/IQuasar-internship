  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an established technology for ophthalmic diagnosis&#xD;
      which can perform noncontact, noninvasive, real time, cross-sectional imaging of the retina&#xD;
      and anterior eye. OCT has displaced ophthalmoscopy and stereo-photography as the&#xD;
      gold-standard for clinical assessment and documentation of retinal microanatomy including&#xD;
      thickness, cystoid structures, subretinal fluid and retinal traction. Despite these benefits,&#xD;
      new technologies can still benefit patients including increasing the resolution, imaging&#xD;
      speed, and contrast of OCT technologies. Since 2013, Dr. Tao's group has worked to develop&#xD;
      and translate new ophthalmic imaging technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this proposal is to develop novel OCT technology for improved diagnostic&#xD;
      sensitivity in ophthalmology. Specifically, we will develop novel OCT imaging and&#xD;
      image-processing methods to improve imaging speed and quality. Successful completion of this&#xD;
      project will improve clinical diagnostics of ophthalmic diseases. Pre-clinical validation of&#xD;
      system performance and ergonomics is a valuable step is clinical imaging technology&#xD;
      development. The aim of this project is to performance system iterations on next-generation&#xD;
      ophthalmic OCT imaging technologies over current-generation imaging systems on healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers prior to clinical translation. While system resolution, contrast, and speed can be&#xD;
      (and will be) evaluated using calibration standards and phantoms, in vivo human imaging in&#xD;
      healthy subjects is necessary to establish a baseline for system performance and image&#xD;
      quality prior to clinical translation.&#xD;

        The subject population includes both males and females. All study subjects will be &gt;18&#xD;
        years with no pre-existing ophthalmic conditions. All subjects included in the study will&#xD;
        be informed of their rights and voluntary nature of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study and informed consent form will be reviewed with subjects by the principal&#xD;
        investigator (Dr. Yuankai Kenny Tao).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will have the opportunity to read and review the consent form and ask any&#xD;
        questions. Informed consent will be obtained for all subjects.&#xD;
