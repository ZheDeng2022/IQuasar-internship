      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag monotherapy in&#xD;
      Japanese adult patients with platelet transfusion-dependent lower-risk Myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndromes (LR-MDS).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Japanese local phase II study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag monotherapy in Japanese adult patients with&#xD;
      platelet transfusion-dependent lower-risk MDS (IPSS-R very low, low, intermediate risk with&#xD;
      bone marrow blast count &lt; 5% and cytogenetic very good, good or intermediate risk). Platelet&#xD;
      transfusion dependence at baseline is defined as receiving platelet transfusion regularly&#xD;
      with a frequency of 2 or more times within 4 weeks prior to randomization. Platelet&#xD;
      transfusion should be performed for a patient with platelet counts &lt; 20 X 10^9/L, or with&#xD;
      hemorrhagic symptoms and platelet counts &lt; 30 X 10^9/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate superiority of eltrombopag versus placebo in terms of&#xD;
      the proportion of participants who achieve platelet transfusion independence at Week 24.&#xD;

And the responses to 2 questions about health-related QoL are scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very poor to 7=Excellent), a high score indicates a high / healthy level of functioning.&#xD;
Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100.</description>
