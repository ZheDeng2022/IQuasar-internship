  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with some long-standing rheumatic diseases have stated that they want to be fully&#xD;
      informed about their disease as they find it 'more scary not to know' about possible&#xD;
      complications and consequences. Patients who have the information they want about their&#xD;
      disease can fully take part in decisions about their own health creating a partnership with&#xD;
      their doctor. Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) is a multi-system, long-standing rheumatic disease that&#xD;
      has a negative impact on the daily life of patients. A common presentation of this disease is&#xD;
      dry mouth, which can make talking, eating and swallowing more difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project aims: We aim to ask patients with SS what information they think it would be&#xD;
      important to know about SS. We plan to create a questionnaire that can be used by doctors to&#xD;
      help deliver the right information to patients at hospital visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timescale: This project will take 36 months to complete. Clinical relevance: This&#xD;
      questionnaire could be used in daily practice. It could help patients cope with their&#xD;
      disease, take part in treatment decision and reduced uncertainty and distress.&#xD;

      This is a PhD student project that will be undertaken in 2 distinct phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Informational Needs (Months 0- 9)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative interviews with patients with SS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interview transcriptions and thematic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects The perspective of the patient is critical in the determination of the informational&#xD;
      needs of patients with SS. Qualitative interviews will be conducted patients with SS. Due to&#xD;
      the depth of rich data that can be derived from focus groups we plan on using this method of&#xD;
      qualitative interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Streiner and Norman proposed that each focus groups would contain 6 to 12 patients.&#xD;
      Approximately 40-50 patients with SS will be recruited for the qualitative interviews. These&#xD;
      patients will be identified from the Oral Medicine clinics of the UCLH Eastman Dental&#xD;
      Hospital. Inclusion criteria will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult patients with a diagnosis of primary SS as per the 2002 American-European&#xD;
           Consensus Group (AECG) classification criteria, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult patients with a diagnosis of primary SS as per the 2016 American College of&#xD;
           Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult patients who are able to consent to being involved in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willingness to participate in focus groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluency of the English language to allow participation in focus groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These focus groups will take the form of semi-structured interviews, using a topic guide as a&#xD;
      general framework during the interview. The topic guide will consist of a list of topics of&#xD;
      interest, developed by -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  informal interviews / discussions with patients and clinicians&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical observation The order of the items on the list will not be fixed and,&#xD;
           therefore, will allow for flow of the conversation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the qualitative interviews data collection is carried out and analysed in stages. This&#xD;
      process continues until data saturation has been achieved. Data saturation is deemed to have&#xD;
      been achieved when no new information or themes emerge. Once data saturation has been&#xD;
      achieved the digital recordings of the focus groups will then be transcribed to allow&#xD;
      analysis of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although multiple approaches to qualitative data analysis exist, three are more commonly&#xD;
      used, namely thematic analysis, grounded theory and framework analysis. Thematic analysis&#xD;
      will be used and the emergent themes will allow for the determination of the informational&#xD;
      needs of patients with SS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 Development of the informational need instrument for SS [SS-INQ] (Months 9-32)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adaptation of TINQ-BC for use in patients with SS - generation of relevant questions&#xD;
           using themes from Phase 1 qualitative study (removal of those solely related to breast&#xD;
           cancer from TINQ-BC) by the expert group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pilot testing of SS-INQ for content and readability will be done via focus groups whilst&#xD;
           structural validity will be explored using factor analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing of SS-INQ for reliability - internal consistency reliability and test-retest&#xD;
           reliability Subjects (including justification for sample size) The number of experts&#xD;
           involved in item generation of a new instrument varies widely in the literature, from as&#xD;
           few a 3 to as many as 24. With no established consensus on the critical number of&#xD;
           persons involved it is our intention to establish a 5 to 7 person expert group,&#xD;
           consisting of Rheumatologists, Oral Medicine Clinicians and Ophthalmologists, to be&#xD;
           involved in the generation of questionnaire items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previously mentioned we propose to hold focus groups with 6 to 12 patients per group.&#xD;
      Approximately 12 to 24 patients with SS will be recruited for content validity and&#xD;
      readability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tinsley and Tinsley (48) suggest a ratio of about 5 - 10 subjects per question in the&#xD;
      instrument up to 300 subjects when carrying out factor analysis. TINQ-BC consists of 52&#xD;
      items, therefore assuming that the SS-INQ will consist of a similar number of items a minimum&#xD;
      of 260 patients will be required to determine the structural validity of the newly developed&#xD;
      instrument using factor analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN)&#xD;
      checklist can be used to determine the methodological quality of measurement tools. According&#xD;
      to Mokkink et al 50-100 patients to achieve a good to excellent quality assessment rating&#xD;
      when determining internal consistency reliability and test-retest reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methods and data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the importance of an underlying structural framework in the development of a&#xD;
      questionnaire we plan to adapt an existing informational needs questionnaire, which was&#xD;
      developed used Lazarus and Folkman's Theory of Stress and Coping conceptual framework.&#xD;
      TINQ-BC was developed in the late 1990s due to a lack of knowledge about the amount and type&#xD;
      of information patients with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer may require. In a recent&#xD;
      review TINQ- BC was deemed to be a tool that should be used as a model in the development of&#xD;
      future informational needs questionnaires. The themes derived from the qualitative interviews&#xD;
      will be used to populate the instrument ensuring it is specific to SS and reflective of the&#xD;
      patients' informational needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SS-INQ instrument will then be tested for content and structural validity, readability&#xD;
      and reliability as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Content validity and readability: content validity refers to the extent to which the&#xD;
           items in the questionnaire reflect the facets of the domain or construct they are&#xD;
           proposed to represent. Each facet of the domain should therefore be represented by at&#xD;
           least one item in the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Structural validity: factor analysis will be conducted to determine the dimensionality&#xD;
           of the instrument. The goal of factor analysis, according to Kin and Mueller, is 'to&#xD;
           represent a set of variables in terms of a smaller number of hypothetical variables'.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Internal consistency reliability: defined as 'the precision of a scale, based on the&#xD;
           homogeneity of the scale's items at one point in time', will be determined by&#xD;
           calculating Cronbach's Alpha coefficient. Alpha values can range from 0.0 to 1.0. It&#xD;
           refers to the degree to which statements in SSINQ correlate with each other. According&#xD;
           to De Vellis and Streiner and Norman levels between 0.7 and 0.9 are desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test-retest Reliability: Test-retest reliability measures reliability of the instrument&#xD;
           selected over time. In general instruments are administered at two points in time. A&#xD;
           period of 12 to 14 days is generally considered an acceptable retest interval. Anastasi&#xD;
           and Urbina suggested that the value of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)&#xD;
           should generally be &gt; 0.8 . We will administer the chosen instrument at two time points&#xD;
           14 days apart. The ICC will then be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final analysis 32-36 months.&#xD;
