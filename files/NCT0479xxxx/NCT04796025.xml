      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization (TACE) combined with pd-1 antibody immunotherapy (Sintilimab) and anti-VEGF&#xD;
      (Bevacizumab Biosimilar) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (BCLC-C Stage).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE&#xD;
      combined with Sintilimab and Bevacizumab Biosimilar (T-Double Therapy) in patients with HCC&#xD;
      (BCLC-C Stage). Subjects who meet the admission criteria will be treated with Sintilimab and&#xD;
      Bevacizumab Biosimilar after TACE until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death,&#xD;
      withdrawal of the patient or the researchers determined that the drug must be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of T-Double&#xD;
      Therapy for advanced HCC (BCLC C-stage). The secondary outcome measures include the duration&#xD;
      of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival rate (PFSR) in 6-&#xD;
      and 12-months, overall survival rate (OSR) in 6- and 12-months, the median progression-free&#xD;
      survival time (mPFS) and median overall survival time (mOS) of T-Double Therapy for advanced&#xD;
      HCC. This study also aims to assess the safety and adverse reactions of T-Double Therapy for&#xD;
      advanced HCC.&#xD;
