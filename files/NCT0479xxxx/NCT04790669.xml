    <textblock>
      This project was a Randomized clinical trial conducted on extensor lag in post-operative knee&#xD;
      stiffness patient to compare the effects of The Daily Adjustable Progressive Resistive&#xD;
      Exercise (DAPRE) technique versus Close kinetic chain (CKC) exercise training in people who&#xD;
      had undergone knee stiffness, m so that we can have best treatment option for patients with&#xD;
      extensor lag.&#xD;

      Probability Convenient sampling was done. Patients following eligibility criteria from&#xD;
      Physiotherapy department of PSRD, Lahore, were considered. Sample size was calculated with&#xD;
      Epi-tool calculator. 22 Participants were randomly allocated in two groups equally via&#xD;
      convenient sampling method. Baseline assessment was done initially. Group A, 11 participants&#xD;
      will receive Conventional physiotherapy treatment in addition to DAPRE technique by leg&#xD;
      extension machine. In DAPRE technique, four sets of exercises were performed. The first two&#xD;
      sets of exercise consisted of ten and then six repetitions, per- formed against one-half and&#xD;
      three-fourths of the previously established working weight. Working weight is the amount of&#xD;
      weight a patient uses during an individual session. The full working weight was used on the&#xD;
      third set, and the patient performed as many repetitions as possible. After performing each&#xD;
      of the third and fourth sets, patients rested for 1 min. 6 weeks (3 sessions per week)• Hot&#xD;
      pack: 10 min• Stretching of calf and hamstring muscle: 10 min. Group B, 11 participants will&#xD;
      receive Conventional physiotherapy treatment in addition to close kinetic chain exercises.&#xD;
      Close kinetic chain exercises for extensor lag is seated leg press, double or single one&#xD;
      third knee bend, step up and down exercise, wall slide with weight. Treatment time will be 30&#xD;
      minutes and three session per week will be applied on alternate day for up to 6 weeks. Pre&#xD;
      interventional readings will be taken at baseline &amp; post interventional readings at 6th week.&#xD;
      6 weeks (3 sessions per week) • Hot pack: 10 min • Stretching of calf and hamstring muscle:&#xD;
      10 min. All participants were provided written informed consent prior to commencement of the&#xD;
      procedures. They were free to quit the treatment at any stage of research. Data was analyzed&#xD;
      by using SPSS version 23.&#xD;
