      Research Design This study adopted randomized clinical trials design, with two groups of&#xD;
      pre-tests and post-tests, a single-blind test, a single-blind test, and intentional sampling.&#xD;
      Four well-organized community care centers with the proper number of elderly people and the&#xD;
      willingness to participate in Taipei City were selected to carry out the pre-test to screen&#xD;
      out the qualified research subjects, and then, they were randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      experimental group or control group. The experimental group received music therapy and&#xD;
      routine activities, while the control group only received routine activities, and the&#xD;
      researchers were the leaders of the music therapy activities. Data collection and fitness&#xD;
      testing were performed by trained, certified, and qualified personnel. Before program&#xD;
      implementation, a consensus meeting on testing consistency was conducted for the testers to&#xD;
      obtain consistency in testing technology and scale questionnaires. The researchers were not&#xD;
      involved in the testing, in order to ensure the independent position and blindness of the&#xD;
      fitness testers. The study intervention was conducted for 12 weeks, once a week, 90 minutes&#xD;
      each time. In the 13th week, the two groups performed the first post-test, while the second&#xD;
      post-test was in the 16th week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Structure The independent variables include demographic data, and one or more of the&#xD;
      five indicators of disease state and physical status decline. The intervention measures&#xD;
      include various music therapy activities, and the dependent variables are the performance&#xD;
      indicators including: frailty indicators (BMI, grip strength, 2.44 meters of timed&#xD;
      get-up-and-go, 30 seconds of sit-to-stand, 2 minutes of knee bending and leg raising),&#xD;
      physical activity, conscious health status, and depression. This study explores the&#xD;
      effectiveness of music therapy in improving the physical fitness, degree of activity, and&#xD;
      depression of elderly in the community.&#xD;

      completed training in music therapy courses and obtained a senior music activity leadership&#xD;
      certificate and qualification, such as books and internship certificates. The course design&#xD;
      uses the percussion music theory and Dalcroze and Orpff music pedagogy to plan activities, as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each class in the music therapy activity course design has a fixed process. The 90-minute&#xD;
      course includes 10-15 minutes of warm-up activities, 50-60 minutes of main activities, 10-15&#xD;
      minutes of recovery activities, and 10 minutes of rest for the elders in the middle. The&#xD;
      content of the weekly main activities uses different music, musical instruments, props, or&#xD;
      rhythms to lead the rhythm music activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. The case acceptance conditions of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The case should be at least 65 years old. The case should meet one or more of Fried Frailty's&#xD;
      5 screening conditions or have a depression index ≥ 15 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The case should be capable of language expression and freedom of movement. 2. The exclusion&#xD;
      conditions are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1). Those who do not meet the frailty condition and depression tendency (2). Those who&#xD;
      cannot participate in the study in the scheduled time. (3). Those with difficulty in language&#xD;
      expression and mobility. Research Structure The independent variables include demographic&#xD;
      data, and one or more of the five indicators of disease state and physical status decline.&#xD;
      The intervention measures are various activities of music therapy, and the dependent&#xD;
      variables are the performance indicators including: frailty indicators (BMI, grip strength,&#xD;
      2.44 meters of time get-up-and-go, 30 seconds of sit-to-stand, 2 minutes of knee bending and&#xD;
      leg raising), physical activity, conscious health status and depression. Explore the&#xD;
      effectiveness of music therapy in improving the physical fitness, activity and depression of&#xD;
      the elderly in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of terms and use of tools&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic variables refer to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic data of the research subjects including 8 items such as age, gender, education&#xD;
      level, marital status, living situation, economic source, economic status, and food&#xD;
      preparation methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease state refers to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study the physical health status of the research subjects, including types of chronic&#xD;
      diseases, types of drugs taken daily, conscious health status and emotional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It refers to the music activities led by the medical staff who had completed training in&#xD;
      music therapy courses during the entire research program, with the curriculum designed to&#xD;
      suit the health needs of the elder group. The researchers in this study are the leaders of&#xD;
      the activities and also the nurses who had completed training in music therapy courses and&#xD;
      obtained a senior music activity leadership certificate and qualifications such as books and&#xD;
      internship certificates. The course design uses percussion music theory and Dalcroze and&#xD;
      Orpff music pedagogy to plan activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical fitness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical fitness in this study mainly includes cardiopulmonary endurance, muscle power,&#xD;
      and body mass index. Muscle power test measures the grip strength of the dominant hand and&#xD;
      lower limb muscle power. This study uses Smedlay Dynamometer 100Kg YOII model grip strength&#xD;
      meter, its retest reliability is based on the highest retest reliability using the average of&#xD;
      2 rounds of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (ICC = 0.88). This study is based on&#xD;
      the Fried Frailty Standard, and the grip strength of the dominant hand is calculated by the&#xD;
      BMI of the elderly. Lower extremity muscle power is the ability to assess the individual's&#xD;
      movement capacity and is tested with the &quot;30-second sit-to-stand&quot; test in Senior Fitness Test&#xD;
      (SFT) published by Rikil and Jones in 1999 to mainly access the lower extremity muscle power&#xD;
      and daily life movement capacity of the elderly. The physical fitness of the elderly in this&#xD;
      study is determined by the Health Promotion Administration fitness test. The normal value of&#xD;
      &quot;30-second sit-and-stand&quot; should be greater than 12 times for men and 10 times for women;&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary endurance is measured by &quot;2.44 meters of time get-up-and-go&quot; and &quot;2-minute&#xD;
      knee bending and leg raising&quot;. The norm of men and women's &quot;2.44 meters of time&#xD;
      get-up-and-go&quot; in Taiwan is ≦ 8 seconds or walking speed &lt;0.8 meters/second &quot;2-minute knee&#xD;
      bending and leg raising&quot; is an indicator of the endurance of systemic exercise. The normal&#xD;
      value is more than 90 times for men and more than 80 times for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the activity test scale-International Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire-Self-filled short version of Taiwan Chinese version, International Physical&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF) translated and developed by Professor Liu Yingmei in&#xD;
      cooperation with Ministry of Health and Welfare was adopted. In the self-filled Chinese&#xD;
      version, the English and Chinese language conformity, and the content validity index of&#xD;
      similarity of meaning are .994, and .992; the intrinsic level correlation coefficient of the&#xD;
      Chinese and English versions is .704, which has good reliability and validity as well as&#xD;
      cultural sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study uses the Taiwan Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS-30). The scale has a total of 30&#xD;
      questions. The question is answered based on the condition of the last week. It can be&#xD;
      self-filled or structured. The answer is dichotomous (yes/no), with a total score of 0-30&#xD;
      points. A total score of more than 15 points means one is suspected of suffering from&#xD;
      depression. A higher score indicates a higher degree of depression. Therefore, the standard&#xD;
      for accepting cases in this study is TGDS-30 depression index ≥ 15 points. In terms of&#xD;
      reliability of this scale, the Cronbachα value of the overall scale is 0.94, the retest&#xD;
      reliability is 0.82, and the halving reliability is 0.95; in terms of validity, the validity&#xD;
      and reliability have 93.3% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity, so it is a test scale with good&#xD;
      reliability and validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frailty:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It refers to the Health Promotion Administration Assessment Standards for Physical Fitness of&#xD;
      the Elderly and the criteria for five indicators of frailty proposed by Fried in 2001 for the&#xD;
      indicators of frailty. Failure to meet any of the indicators means no frailty, meeting one or&#xD;
      two indicators are pre-frailty, and meeting three or more indicators are frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study accepts the case who meets one or more indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conscious health status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher draws a 10 cm straight line on the white paper, with 1 marked on the left end&#xD;
      and 10 on the right end, explains the meaning of 1 and 10 to the elders, and asks the elders&#xD;
      to point out the conscious health status on the line. Then the researcher measures the score&#xD;
      with a ruler, and the data is calculated to the first decimal point. From 1-10, 1 means poor&#xD;
      conscious health, 10 means very good conscious health, and ≦ 5 cm or less means that the&#xD;
      conscious health status is not good.&#xD;
