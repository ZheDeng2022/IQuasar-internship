  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of LTLD with MR-HIFU hyperthermia followed by ablation in subjects with&#xD;
      refractory/relapsed solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LTLD is a heat-activated formulation of liposomal doxorubicin that releases the drug when&#xD;
      exposed to hyperthermic conditions (40-45°C). This novel agent has been well tolerated in&#xD;
      adults with similar toxicity profile to doxorubicin. MR-HIFU offers a non-invasive and&#xD;
      non-ionizing ability to selectively heat large tissue volumes. Thus, MR-HIFU is a promising&#xD;
      technology for triggering doxorubicin release from LTLD. The investigator's approach involves&#xD;
      continuous maintenance of the target at mild hyperthermia with MR-HIFU following LTLD&#xD;
      infusion. Following hyperthermia, the investigators will deliver ablation therapy (&gt;55°C) to&#xD;
      targeted areas of tumor where feasible and safe. Addition of this ablation therapy after&#xD;
      mild-hyperthermia-triggered drug delivery with LTLD has the potential to significantly&#xD;
      potentiate chemotherapy with minimal additional adverse effects to improve local control and&#xD;
      drug delivery without increasing toxicity.&#xD;

    <description>LTLD 50 mg/m2 will be administered intravenously over 30 minutes on day 1 of every 21-day cycle. MR-HIFU hyperthermia will follow infusion (+/- 30 minutes) for one hour to a target area with a target temperature of 40-45°C followed by ablation therapy (&gt;55°C). The HIFU hyperthermia regimen will have a duration of at least 60 minutes and will then be followed by ablation therapy. Patients may receive up to a total of 6 cycles. Subsequent treatment cycles may treat alternative target lesions. Disease status will be evaluated using standard imaging techniques (CT/MR) post each cycle.</description>

    <intervention_name>Magnetic Resonance-Guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound</intervention_name>
    <description>Magnetic resonance (MR)-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) provides precise and controlled delivery of heat by focusing ultrasound energy inside a lesion using an external applicator without the need for a scalpel or needle.&#xD;
Additional therapeutic advantages of this modality include its range of bioeffects, including both high temperature tumor ablation via coagulative necrosis, and effects of lower temperature, mild hyperthermia that can help to enhance local drug delivery to tumors. Both tumor ablation and hyperthermia may be employed to potentiate the effects of chemotherapy.</description>

    <intervention_name>Lyso-thermosensitive Liposomal Doxorubicin</intervention_name>
    <description>LTLD combines doxorubicin with lyso-thermosensitive liposomes that can selectively deliver drug to tumors and when exposed to temperatures greater than 40°C, rapidly and locally releases doxorubicin in high concentrations from systemically administered LTLD.&#xD;
If combined with hyperthermia, doxorubicin will be released in the heated tumor margins and in any areas within the tumor that were not completely ablated and increase the likelihood of complete tumor necrosis. LTLD will extend tumor cell death to the hyperthermic regions in the peri-ablation zones and minimize the possibility of incomplete ablation or tumor recurrence.</description>
