  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arteriopathy of the lower limbs (ALL) is defined by a decreased ankle perfusion pressure with&#xD;
      a systolic pressure index (SPI) &lt;0.9, and constitutes the most advanced situation in terms of&#xD;
      cardiovascular prognosis with in 20 % of cases of lesions associated with the heart and / or&#xD;
      coronary heart. The severity of ALL is linked to the risk of a cardiovascular event, hence&#xD;
      the need for a hemodynamic evaluation which is mainly based on the measurement of SPI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      However, the presence of mediacalcosis, making the arteries incompressible, limits the&#xD;
      interpretation of IPS. However, ALL affects 50% of diabetic patients after 20 years of&#xD;
      disease with predominant involvement in the infra-popliteal gland consisting mainly of&#xD;
      mediacalcosis, but often respecting the arteries of the foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommendations of the French-speaking Association for the Study of Diabetes and&#xD;
      Metabolic Diseases in 1997 and of the American Diabetes Association in 2001, recommended the&#xD;
      SPI and the realization of ultrasound for the diagnosis of ALL. Some authors have shown that&#xD;
      SPI can be falsely normal with 4.3 times more false negative ankle SPI in diabetics compared&#xD;
      to the general population. This is why this measurement of the SPI is coupled with the&#xD;
      measurement of the pressure of the big toe (PGT) or even the transcutaneous measurement of&#xD;
      the oxygen pressure (TcPO2) as recommended by the American Heart Association (AHA) and the&#xD;
      American College of Cardiology (ACC) in 2005, in case of uninterpretable IPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects at risk of mediacalcosis are: diabetics, renal insufficiency and the very&#xD;
      elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent thesis work confirmed that the SPI alone was not reliable as a screening tool in&#xD;
      diabetic patients, with good sensitivity of the measurement of PGT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What about a population over the age of 70, without diabetes and without kidney failure?&#xD;
