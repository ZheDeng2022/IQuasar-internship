    <textblock>
      This is an observational cohort study, using data from Folia Health and the Cystic Fibrosis&#xD;
      Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR). Individuals taking elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor&#xD;
      (ETI) may be enrolled through the Folia application. During the 12-month study period,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to track their routine treatment and medication usage, daily&#xD;
      symptoms, and monthly review with validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires.&#xD;
      Participants will also be asked to self-report instances of changes to their treatment plan,&#xD;
      and pulmonary exacerbations. There are no study-associated site visits.&#xD;

      This study will be a prospective, observational cohort study to investigate the changes in&#xD;
      lung function among individuals who have made treatment changes after initiating treatment&#xD;
      with elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI). Data will be collected from Folia Health, and&#xD;
      the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) for participants who are registered.&#xD;
      Participation in the study will occur through the Folia application where study participants&#xD;
      will be directed to a specific HERO-2 study dashboard. Individuals (n=860) taking ETI may be&#xD;
      enrolled at participating sites, through social media recruitment or from existing users of&#xD;
      Folia Health. During the 12-month study period, participants will be asked to track their&#xD;
      routine treatment and medication usage, daily symptoms, and monthly review with validated CF&#xD;
      patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires. Participants will also be asked to self-report&#xD;
      instances of changes to their treatment plan, and pulmonary exacerbations. Data collected&#xD;
      within Folia will be linked to the CFFPR for individual outcomes with regards to clinical&#xD;
      data including anthropometric measures, lung function, complications, and IV-treated&#xD;
      pulmonary exacerbations. This study will not provide or recommend any treatment&#xD;
      recommendations. All direction for medication usage is solely at the discretion of the&#xD;
      patient's physician in accordance with their usual practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective for the study will be to evaluate changes in lung function as measured&#xD;
      by FEV1 percent predicted in individuals who report making at least one change to chronic&#xD;
      daily respiratory therapies upon study entry and during the 12 month follow up compared to&#xD;
      those who do not make changes to chronic daily therapies. Secondary endpoints will include a&#xD;
      measurement of the proportion of individuals making changes to chronic daily therapy, the&#xD;
      need to resume chronic daily therapy, health-related quality of life, symptom severity and&#xD;
      symptom frequency, and pulmonary exacerbations requiring IV antibiotics.&#xD;
