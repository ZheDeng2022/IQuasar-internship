  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the targeted objectives of Healthy People 2020 is to reduce iron deficiency among&#xD;
      women of reproductive age (WRA). Consuming foods rich in iron and/or oral iron&#xD;
      supplementation is typically recommended to improve iron status; however, global rates of&#xD;
      iron deficiency remain high. Thus, nutritional strategies to improve/maintain iron status are&#xD;
      warranted. Dietary iron is found in two different forms: heme and non-heme iron. Non-heme&#xD;
      iron is found in plant-based sources and is commonly used as a supplement and food&#xD;
      fortificant. Absorption of non-heme iron is low compared to heme iron, which is found in&#xD;
      animal sources, such as beef. Studies have also demonstrated that beef contains an&#xD;
      unidentified factor that stimulates the absorption of non-heme iron. The primary objective of&#xD;
      the proposed study is to determine the effects of incorporating daily meals containing beef&#xD;
      or plant-based alternative with or without an iron supplement on indicators of iron status in&#xD;
      iron-deficient WRA.&#xD;
