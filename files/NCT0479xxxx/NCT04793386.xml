  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR) guidelines recommend that the heart rhythm be&#xD;
      checked every two minutes during CPR for cardiac arrest patients. Also it is very important&#xD;
      to stop compressing the chest in less than 10 seconds when checking heart rhythm and pulse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, manual palpation, which is used as a standard for return of spontaneous&#xD;
      circulation(ROSC), has been reported that the accuracy is not high in several studies. It is&#xD;
      quite often necessary to perform pulse palpation for longer than the 10 second recommended by&#xD;
      the guidelines to make a judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a case study was published in which the presence of spontaneous circulation was&#xD;
      confirmed by evaluating the carotid artery compressibility and pulsatility with an ultrasound&#xD;
      probe when checking the rhythm of cardiac arrest patients. However, there has been no&#xD;
      clinical study on actual cardiac arrest patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Ultrasound is a key technique that guides to discern and treat causes of cardiac arrest&#xD;
      patients. Recently, a case study was published in which the presence of spontaneous&#xD;
      circulation was confirmed by evaluating the carotid artery compressibility and pulsatility&#xD;
      with an ultrasound probe when checking the rhythm of cardiac arrest patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this is just a case study. There has been no clinical study on actual cardiac arrest&#xD;
      patients whether it is possible to accurately determine the ROSC by evaluating the carotid&#xD;
      artery compressibility and pulsatility by ultrasound. Also there has been no clinical studies&#xD;
      on actual cardiac arrest patients comparing the time taken to evaluate the ROSC of carotid&#xD;
      ultrasound and manual palpation.&#xD;

    <description>Compare the agreement between two methods (manual pulse palpation and carotid ultrasound) for evaluation of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).&#xD;
The gold standard is arterial blood pressure by arterial catheter. The ROSC is judged when pulsation is detected by manual palpation. The ROSC is judged when carotid artery is not totally compressed or has pulsatility by carotid artery ultrasound.</description>

    <description>When stopping chest compressions to check manual palpation every 2 minutes, an ultrasound scan of the carotid artery is performed. Whether or not return of spontaneous circulation is determined based on the compressibility and pulsatility of the carotid artery, and the time taken from the start of the ultrasound scan to the determination is recorded.</description>
