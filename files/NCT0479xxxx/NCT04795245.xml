  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to confirm Time on Treatment (TOT) related to afatinib treatment as&#xD;
      first-line therapy in patients with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive&#xD;
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observation in the real-world setting of the time from the start of the first-line&#xD;
      afatinib until the end of subsequent treatment in this study will provide insights on the&#xD;
      sequence of treatment for patients. The Japanese healthcare system will enable this study to&#xD;
      evaluate multiple treatment options after afatinib treatment.&#xD;
