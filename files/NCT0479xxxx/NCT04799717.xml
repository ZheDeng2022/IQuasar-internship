  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to provide combination of 2 hours of weekly game based telehealth therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention along with CBT-P for children identified with first onset psychosis or to be&#xD;
      clinically high risk for psychosis thus widening therapeutic services offered. Target outcome&#xD;
      measures are improvement in clinical symptoms, treatment engagement, and reduced&#xD;
      hospitalization rates.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with first onset psychosis or clinical high risk for psychosis often have&#xD;
      significant functional decline affecting social, academic, and daily living skills. Given&#xD;
      their constellation of new onset psychotic symptoms of paranoia, delusions, hallucinations,&#xD;
      and additionally co-morbid anxiety, or depression, patients most often present with school&#xD;
      refusal, social withdrawal, aggression, poor self-care, and treatment noncompliance. This&#xD;
      leads to decline in quality of life for both patients and families, along with increased sick&#xD;
      days, recurrent hospitalizations, residential treatment center admissions which aren't always&#xD;
      covered by insurance. Families are often left with very little to intervene and they carry&#xD;
      the long-term disease burden of a significant diagnosis in addition to pocketing out of&#xD;
      network costs for therapy. Further clinical programs like intensive outpatient programs or&#xD;
      partial hospitalization programs often reject candidates with psychosis due to severity of&#xD;
      symptoms and low levels of engagement when compared to their counterparts. County services&#xD;
      offering in home therapeutic support services like rehabilitation, family therapy, peer&#xD;
      support and wrap around services do not apply to insured patients thus causing huge gap in&#xD;
      need for services. Early treatment with therapy and medications in first onset psychosis is&#xD;
      very valuable as repeatedly shown clinically and in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: 10 patients in the 10-18 year age group meeting criteria for clinical high risk&#xD;
      psychosis and schizophrenia spectrum disorders will be selected using DSM 5 criteria.&#xD;
      Patients will be seen twice weekly for 15 weeks. They will be offered weekly individual&#xD;
      telehealth therapy using game-based approach for first half of their visit to encourage&#xD;
      engagement with therapist. Safe online videogames of their choice will be chosen, allowing&#xD;
      usage of computer or electronics during session as needed to serve treatment purposes. The&#xD;
      other half of the visit will focus on psychoeducation and utilizing CBT-P components&#xD;
      targeting symptoms of psychosis. Patients will be assessed once a month clinically by&#xD;
      treating psychiatrist in INSPIRE clinic to track symptom reduction, treatment engagement and&#xD;
      hospitalization. Outcome measures will be tracked each month and data compiled between&#xD;
      4/2021-6/2021.&#xD;
