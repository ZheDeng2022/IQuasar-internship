  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the experiences of subjects who drain malignant&#xD;
      (cancerous) pleural effusions (fluid) from around their lung(s) in a more frequent manner&#xD;
      using a talc instilled via tunneled pleural catheter combined with daily drainage and those&#xD;
      subjects who drain this fluid in a daily standard manner.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study Activities: Patients will be randomized to either the standard daily drainage group or&#xD;
      the talc instilled via tunneled pleural catheter combined with standard daily drainage group.&#xD;
      Patients will complete questionnaires regarding their health. If you are randomized to the&#xD;
      talc group, you will receive talc infused through the tunneled pleural catheter. If you are&#xD;
      randomized to the standard daily drainage group, you will not receive any additional therapy.&#xD;
      Patients will complete a drainage diary for everyday they drain fluid which will provide&#xD;
      information on drainage volume, fluid color, pain, and complications. At 30 days and 90 days&#xD;
      post randomization, patients will return to clinic for follow-up, at which time they will&#xD;
      have a physical exam, chest x-ray, and complete questionnaires regarding their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks/Safety Issues: Risks associated with talc include fever and pain. Less likely risks&#xD;
      associated with talc include infection, dyspnea, hypoxemia, pneumonia, unilateral pulmonary&#xD;
      edema, hemoptysis, pulmonary emboli, and bronchopleural fistula.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female, at least 18 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has a symptomatic MPE requiring intervention. For an effusion to be defined as&#xD;
             malignant, at least one of the following must be true:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. There is histocytological confirmation of pleural malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. The effusion is an exudate (per Light's criteria) in the context of&#xD;
                  histocytologically proven malignancy elsewhere, with no other clear cause for&#xD;
                  fluid identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has a history of at least 1 ipsilateral pleural effusion causing dyspnea that&#xD;
             responded to thoracentesis where the lung expanded and the dyspnea was improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is willing and able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is willing and able to meet all study requirements, including follow-up visits&#xD;
             and receiving study-related telephone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has sufficient pleural fluid to allow safe insertion of an IPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has negative pregnancy test if appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject or caregiver is able to perform home drainage of the pleural effusion (a&#xD;
             caregiver can be a friend, family member, or paid healthcare professional).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has significant trapped lung, or a proximal bronchial obstruction which is&#xD;
             likely to lead to trapped lung. For a subject to be eligible for this study, two&#xD;
             separate study center clinicians must agree that there is no significant trapped lung&#xD;
             on the same CXR using visual estimation (reference guide). The CXR used to make this&#xD;
             decision must have been performed ≤30 days preceding the consent form being signed,&#xD;
             and must have been performed preferably on the same day, but no more than 7 calendar&#xD;
             days after tunneled pleural catheter insertion. Significant trapped lung is deemed&#xD;
             present if any 1 of the following criteria is met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A CXR shows hydropneumothorax other than small (&lt; 1 cm between chest wall and&#xD;
                  pleural line) apical pneumothoraces.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A CXR shows ≥20% of the affected hemithorax to be free of the expected lung&#xD;
                  parenchymal markings and there is no suggestion of pleural fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. A CXR shows ≥20% of the affected hemithorax to be occupied with pleural fluid&#xD;
                  AFTER a pleural aspiration which resulted in symptoms suggestive of trapped lung&#xD;
                  (e.g., chest pain or cough).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has a Karnofsky score &lt;50, or a World Health Organization (WHO)/ Eastern&#xD;
             Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≥3. Subjects who have a&#xD;
             performance status of 3 may be considered for the study if the removal of their fluid&#xD;
             would likely improve their performance score by 1 or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or is lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has a history of empyema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has a history of chylothorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has an uncorrected coagulopathy.&#xD;
