      Prospective observational study with 5-year follow up. 55 patients are included with moderate&#xD;
      to severe tooth wear, whereby through informed consent the decision was taking to monitor the&#xD;
      patients. At the baseline and the 5-year recall digital 3D scans will be made, which will be&#xD;
      compared and subtracted.&#xD;

      Prospective observational study with 5-year follow up. 55 patients are included with moderate&#xD;
      to severe tooth wear, whereby through informed consent the decision was taking to monitor the&#xD;
      patients. At the baseline and the 5-year recall digital 3D scans will be made, which will be&#xD;
      compared and subtracted. Per tooth the loss of material is measured in maximum loss in height&#xD;
      (µm) and volume (mm3) per year, using best fit alignment and 3D subtraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a multivariate statistical model the loss of tooth material per tooth type will be tested&#xD;
      against possible individual risk factors such as bruxism and reflux. An interim analysis will&#xD;
      be performed to test the feasibility of the research.&#xD;

    <description>Patients that present themselves at the clinic through referral from their dentist with tooth wear, who have no request for help, receive a non-restorative 'counseling &amp; monitoring' strategy , in which appropriate preventive measures are recommended and wear and tear is monitored and recorded by periodically taking intra-oral photographs and 3D scans</description>

        The participants in this research will be drawn from the RTWP (Radboud Tooth Wear Project)&#xD;
        patient sample which consists of nearly 200 tooth wear patients. Patients are included&#xD;
        through dentist referral or of their own volition. Out of this population, 50 patients are&#xD;
        managed non-restoratively, because they do not experience problems in regards to their&#xD;
        tooth wear, and have no restorative treatment need in their perception&#xD;
