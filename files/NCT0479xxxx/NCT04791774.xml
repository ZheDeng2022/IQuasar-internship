      In the current study, we willquantitate the difference in digestion and absorption kinetics&#xD;
      of dietary whole protein versus free amino acids in vivo in critically ill patients admitted&#xD;
      to the intensive care unit suffering from malabsorption. 16 adult, mechanically ventilated&#xD;
      ICU patients with clinical signs of malabsorption (faecal weight &gt;350 g/day) will be&#xD;
      included. All patients will receive a primed continuous intravenous infusion of&#xD;
      L-[ring2H5]-phenylalanine and L-[3,5-2H2]-Tyrosine for the duration of the study period.&#xD;
      After reaching an isotopic steady state (1.5 hours), patients will receive either [1-13C]-&#xD;
      phenylalanine labelled milk protein or free amino acids with an identical constitution and&#xD;
      [1-13C]-phenylalanine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study endpoint will be the splanchnic extraction of phenylalanine, calculated from&#xD;
      systemic [1-13C]- and L-[ring2H5]-phenylalanine enrichment.&#xD;

      Background of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of the provision of sufficient protein in critical illness is increasingly&#xD;
      recognized. Protein malabsorption seems to be an underestimated but substantial problem in&#xD;
      critically ill patients, limiting the amount of this important nutrient that actually becomes&#xD;
      available within the systemic circulation. Among several contributors to malabsorption in&#xD;
      critical illness, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency has recently emerged as a regularly&#xD;
      occurring phenomenon during critical illness. Pancreatic insufficiency could lead to reduced&#xD;
      digestion and subsequent uptake of enteral provided proteins. A proposed solution to this&#xD;
      problem could be the use of elementary feeds containing free amino acids instead of whole&#xD;
      protein. Due to the lack of easy applicable and reproducible tests for protein malabsorption&#xD;
      the true efficacy of these feeds is still unknown. We hypothesize that enteral nutrition&#xD;
      containing free amino acids leads to higher systemic levels of amino acids and will therefore&#xD;
      increase the amount of dietary amino acids available for protein synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To quantitate the difference in digestion and absorption kinetics of dietary whole protein&#xD;
      versus free amino acids in vivo in patients admitted to the ICU suffering from malabsorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, single-blind controlled, single-centre, intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      16 adult, mechanically ventilated ICU patients with clinical signs of malabsorption (faecal&#xD;
      weight &gt;350 g/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal enteral nutrition will be ceased 8 hours before the start of study participation. All&#xD;
      patients will receive a primed continuous intravenous infusion of L-[ring2H5]-phenylalanine&#xD;
      and L-[3,5-2H2]-Tyrosine for the duration of the study period. After reaching an isotopic&#xD;
      steady state (1.5 hours), patients will receive either [1-13C]- phenylalanine labelled milk&#xD;
      protein or free amino acids with an identical constitution and [1-13C]-phenylalanine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study endpoint will be the splanchnic extraction of phenylalanine, calculated from&#xD;
      systemic [1-13C]- and L-[ring2H5]-phenylalanine enrichment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secundary study parameters/outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include the impact of enteral nutrition on whole body protein balance,&#xD;
      glucose and insulin concentrations and faecal energy and protein loss as a measure of&#xD;
      malabsorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study participation will take 16 hours, including 8 hours of fasting. Arterial blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected regularly, with 50 ml of blood being sampled in total, amounting to&#xD;
      a maximum of 1.0% of total circulating volume. All infusions, as well as blood sample&#xD;
      collection, will be performed through indwelling catheters necessary for normal ICU&#xD;
      treatment, meaning no lines or nasogastric tubes will have to be placed for the purposes of&#xD;
      the study. Both isotopically labelled protein and free amino acids have been proven safe for&#xD;
      use in humans and carry no harmful risks for the study participant. Changes in protein&#xD;
      digestion, absorption and metabolism are specific to critical illness and their impact on the&#xD;
      clinical condition and recovery of patients is severe. Investigating new strategies to&#xD;
      modulate these effects are therefore essential, but require experimental studies in a&#xD;
      vulnerable population. The risks in the present study are minimal whereas the results could&#xD;
      help improve nutritional management in the intensive care.&#xD;
