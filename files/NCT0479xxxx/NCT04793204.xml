    <description>Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA). An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical product whether or not considered related to the medical product. An AE is considered &quot;serious&quot; if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, the event: results in death, is life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, results in congenital anomaly or birth defect, requires hospitalization or prolongation to hospitalization, or other medically important event.</description>
