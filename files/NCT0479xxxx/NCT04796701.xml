  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of a transitional care intervention on&#xD;
      readmissions among older medical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of older people is rapidly growing. These changes represent a challenge for&#xD;
      healthcare systems. 20% of all hospital admitted patients ≥ 65 years are readmitted within&#xD;
      the first 30 days after discharge. Prior transitional care research has mainly focused on&#xD;
      either hospital-based or community-based interventions with no or little intervention&#xD;
      elements in both settings. The results show different effects on readmission rates. This&#xD;
      calls for new research on trans-sectorial interventions with both pre- and post-discharge&#xD;
      elements.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants For eligibility criteria - see elsewhere. Intervention group • Patients living&#xD;
      in Odder, Skanderborg or Hedensted municipality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Patients living in Horsens municipality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Home Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group receives following intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If possible, all included participants are physically followed home by a hospital-based&#xD;
      project worker on the day of discharge. During the visit, the focus is on: basic human needs,&#xD;
      medication review reconciliation, and a comprehensive geriatric assessment. Problems,&#xD;
      challenges and concerns are discussed. Finally, a conference for the following working day is&#xD;
      arranged either as a physical visit or a video conference. The patient, relatives,&#xD;
      community-based nurse and project worker are invited to participate and health status and&#xD;
      challenges are discussed They are recommended to contact the project worker about health and&#xD;
      practical issues up to 7 days after discharge where the intervention ends. Subsequently, the&#xD;
      responsibility for treatment and care is assigned to the GP and home healthcare provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the control group recieves the following usual discharge procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of discharge, the hospital-based nurse digitally sends a summery of the hospital&#xD;
      stay and a treatment and care plan to the community-based nurse. If needed, the&#xD;
      hospital-based nurse contacts the community-based nurse by phone as a supplement to the plan.&#xD;
      Finally, a discharge letter conducted by the hospital-based doctor is digitally sent to the&#xD;
      GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of participants is consecutive. Inclusion period was between 01/02/17 to 31/12/19.&#xD;
      In total, approximately 1200 patients were included .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Outcome data will be retrieved from CROSS-TRACKS database at 30 days after&#xD;
      discharge from index admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and Control group will be matched on 3 variables on individual level:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CCI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Index admission period: +/- 3-4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
      All readmissions are included in the analysis (not only first time readmissions). That means&#xD;
      that one patient can be included several times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic regression adjusted for possible confounders will be used when analysing the&#xD;
      outcomes. Confounders are chosen through a study specific DAG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-group analysis will be conducted according to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Housing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Civil status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospital stay in index admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ect.&#xD;
