  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injection of Botox into the bladder is a procedure used to treat neurogenic overactive&#xD;
      bladder at the Dianne and Irving Kipnes Urology Centre in the Kaye Edmonton Clinic. A common&#xD;
      complication following bladder Botox is bladder infection. There are no well-studied&#xD;
      preventative antibiotics given at the time of bladder Botox for the reduction of&#xD;
      post-operative bladder infection. We are proposing a research study that will randomize&#xD;
      participants into two groups - one receiving antibiotics and the other receiving placebo&#xD;
      pills following bladder Botox. The main goal of our study is to determine if preventative&#xD;
      antibiotics at the time of bladder Botox injection reduces post-operative bladder infection.&#xD;
      It will provide a valuable learning opportunity for a trainee starting their academic career&#xD;
      through working closely with established researchers across two disciplines. We hope the&#xD;
      results of our study can ultimately be used to improve outcomes and safety for a common&#xD;
      Urologic procedure. In addition, findings from our study could help reduce unnecessary use of&#xD;
      antibiotics resulting in cost savings in the health care system and reduction in the risk of&#xD;
      antibiotic resistance.&#xD;

      This study will be a single-centred, double-blinded, randomized, placebo- controlled trial.&#xD;
      Recruitment will be undertaken in the Urology clinic in the Urology Centre at the Kaye&#xD;
      Edmonton Clinic in Edmonton, AB. Participants will be randomized to treatment or placebo arm&#xD;
      with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Patients and surgeons will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the procedure, a urine culture will be collected preoperatively to identify&#xD;
      pre-existing bacteriuria. Technique and dose of Botox injection will be at the discretion of&#xD;
      the operating physician. Trigone-sparing technique with injection of 200 units of Botox&#xD;
      distributed across 10 to 20 sites is generally used at our centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will occur over a six-week postoperative period. A questionnaire will be used at&#xD;
      each follow-up encounter to screen patients for urinary tract infection symptoms, voiding&#xD;
      dysfunction, and other adverse events potentially related to the prophylactic antibiotics.&#xD;
      Urine cultures will be collected to confirm infection for patients developing postoperative&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
