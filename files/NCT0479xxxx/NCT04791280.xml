  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The term gut microbiota describes the entire intestinal microbial communities. Studies have&#xD;
      established the important role played by the gut microbiome in modulating vital functions of&#xD;
      the healthy host. The physiological effects of the microbiota for the host are, for the most&#xD;
      part, beneficial. In several pathologies, an imbalance in the composition of the microbiota&#xD;
      has been demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic sclerosis is an autoimmune, disorder of the connective tissue, characterized by&#xD;
      vascular lesions, immunological abnormalities, and fibrosis of skin and internal organs As in&#xD;
      many inflammatory diseases, there are painful digestive manifestations in systemic&#xD;
      scleroderma that affect up to 90% of patients. The exact pathophysiology of the digestive&#xD;
      involvement in systemic sclerosis is uncertain. The digestive manifestations of systemic&#xD;
      sclerosis are frequent and can affect the entire digestive system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are few studies of the intestinal microbiota in this disease, which seems to&#xD;
      be part of the same continuum of diseases with abnormalities of innate immunity. By analogy&#xD;
      with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, particularly Crohn's disease, we have raised the&#xD;
      question of the existence of dysbiosis during scleroderma which could lead to episodes of&#xD;
      acute, severe and recurrent inflammation of the peritoneum under the influence of triggering&#xD;
      factors. The long-term prospects would be to look for ways to prevent attacks or to treat&#xD;
      them more rapidly and effectively by using therapeutic targets in the intestinal microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be seen in the usual care setting, identically to all patients with&#xD;
      systemic sclerosis treated in the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of an inflammatory disease outbreak, and depending on its severity, the patient will&#xD;
      be seen again in consultation or hospitalized. Appropriate complementary examinations&#xD;
      (biology, imaging, endoscopy) will be carried out and the treatment adapted.&#xD;

    <description>On the day of inclusion, the faeces collection will be carried out by the patient using adapted equipment, either at the hospital or at home. In the case of a home collection, it will be carried out on the day of a planned hospital and preserved using equipment provided and tested to maintain the quality of the collection before storage.&#xD;
6 months after inclusion (+/- 2 months) a follow-up visit will be carried out and the patient will perform a second faecal sample.&#xD;
At the inclusion visit and at M6 the UCLA SCTC GIT 2.0 questionnaire will be completed by the patient.</description>
