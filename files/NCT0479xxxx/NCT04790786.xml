  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple monoclonal antibodies (mABs) have been shown to reduce viral burden and improve&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, have been granted FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in select&#xD;
      populations, and are routinely used in the UPMC Health System, which has made expanded access&#xD;
      a priority. However, the comparative effectiveness of these mABS is unknown. The National&#xD;
      Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has called for expanded access and clinical&#xD;
      use of mABs, noting it is &quot;critical to collect data and evaluate whether they are working as&#xD;
      predicted&quot;. This pragmatic evaluation will determine the relative effects of the EUA-governed&#xD;
      mABs versus each other. When U.S. government mAB policies change (e.g., FDA grants or revokes&#xD;
      EUAs), UPMC Health System policies and the evaluated mABs will accordingly change.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While COVID-19 vaccination will reduce COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality, the learned&#xD;
      immune response may vary between individuals. This means interventions such as monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies (mAB) will still be needed to prevent progression of COVID-19 illness. Monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies seek to mimic or enhance the natural immune system response against a pathogen and&#xD;
      are often used in the care of patients with cancer or infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For viral infections, mABs are created by exposing a white blood cell to a particular viral&#xD;
      protein, which is then cloned to mass produce antibodies to target that virus. For&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, IgG1 mABs target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      and block viral attachment and entry into cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SARS-CoV-2 mABs bamlanivimab and etesevimab, and the REGN-COV2 combination (casirivimab +&#xD;
      imdevimab) reduce nasopharyngeal viral burden plus clinical outcomes including future&#xD;
      emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Each received FDA Emergency Use&#xD;
      Authorization (EUA) for use in selected populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of February 2021, there are over 60,000 new cases of COVID-19 diagnosed daily in the US,&#xD;
      with over 7000 daily COVID-19 related hospital admissions. Although case volumes are&#xD;
      currently declining, COVID-19 remains a significant public health threat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the EUAs, the clinical use of mABs is low due in part to lack of patient access,&#xD;
      complexities in drug allocation, and lack of knowledge among providers are contributing&#xD;
      factors. Further, the comparative effectiveness of different mABs is unknown and not yet&#xD;
      directly studied. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recently&#xD;
      called for expanded access and clinical use of mABs, noting it is &quot;critical to collect data&#xD;
      and evaluate whether they are working as predicted&quot;. This evaluation seeks to determine their&#xD;
      relative effects versus each other, starting with those governed by EUAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPTIMISE-C19 is a quality improvement (QI) study, governed by approvals from both the UPMC QI&#xD;
      committee and the University of Pittsburgh IRB. Currently, mAB therapy is approved for use&#xD;
      under EUA issued by the FDA. There are no data on the relative benefits of one mAB versus any&#xD;
      other. mABs are ordered by UPMC physicians as a generic referral order and the order is&#xD;
      filled by UPMC pharmacy via therapeutic interchange. The selection of mABs available within&#xD;
      pharmacy is overseen by the UPMC pharmacy and therapeutics committee. OPTIMISE-C19 provides&#xD;
      the therapeutic interchange via random allocation. The UPMC Quality Improvement Committee&#xD;
      approved the OPTIMISE-C19 study, including the random therapeutic interchange. The University&#xD;
      of Pittsburgh IRB considered the randomized therapeutic interchange to be quality improvement&#xD;
      and approved the additional data collection and analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients provide verbal consent to receive mAB therapy. UPMC requires physicians to provide&#xD;
      and review with patients the EUA Fact Sheet for each mAB, and explain that the patient could&#xD;
      receive any of the EUA-governed mABs. As per EUA requirements, physicians discuss the risks&#xD;
      and benefits of mABs with patients, and patients consent to receive a mAB as part of routine&#xD;
      care, should they desire mAB treatment. Patients are told which mAB they are receiving, and&#xD;
      physicians and patients can agree to the assigned mAB or request a specific mAB. It is the&#xD;
      treating physicians' and patients' choice to accept the assigned mAB or not. The QI committee&#xD;
      considered these steps to represent adequate consent to participate. The IRB considered that&#xD;
      the provision of mAB therapy therefore fell under quality improvement and only the additional&#xD;
      data collection and analyses represented research. The IRB waived any additional consent&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
