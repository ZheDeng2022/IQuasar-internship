  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded, controlled, randomized clinical trial (RCT) to establish the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of a non-invasive neuromodulation device for treating symptoms associated with&#xD;
      PD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 220 participants will first enter the double-blinded, controlled, randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial (RCT) and will self-administer treatments twice daily in the home setting over a period&#xD;
      of 12 weeks (84 days). The RCT will have 6 study visits completed at both the study center&#xD;
      and the participant's home by video call.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants must have demonstrated a positive response to medications to treat the&#xD;
             motor symptoms of PD and have been treated with these medications for minimum of three&#xD;
             years prior to the screening visit.&#xD;

             on a stable regimen of concomitant therapies used for the management of PD motor and&#xD;
             non-motor symptoms and not to introduce new medications used to treat motor or&#xD;
             non-motor symptoms associated with PD during the trial.&#xD;
