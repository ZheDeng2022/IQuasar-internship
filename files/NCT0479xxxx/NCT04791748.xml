  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vestibular information is important in establishing a child's static and dynamic postural&#xD;
      control. Any vestibular deficit can have major consequences on development, spatial cognition&#xD;
      and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to interact with the world around us, we must simultaneously integrate different&#xD;
      sources of sensory informations (vision, hearing, perception of the body...). The brain&#xD;
      integrates these different sensory components to form a unified and coherent perception: this&#xD;
      is multisensory integration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multisensory integration has been studied using virtual reality in adults, in the &quot;spatial&#xD;
      orientation&quot; team of the Center for Integrative Neurosciences and Cognition. These&#xD;
      experiments were carried out on healthy subjects and in weightless situations (international&#xD;
      space station or parabolic flight). However, no protocol has been developed in children or in&#xD;
      subjects with vestibular deficit. Virtual reality is interesting for developing such a&#xD;
      protocol because it creates multisensory stimulation capable of promoting visual and&#xD;
      proprioceptive compensation of the vestibular deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It induces an immersion of the patient in a virtual spatial and temporal environment&#xD;
      difficult to carry out with traditional vestibular rehabilitation techniques. Its main&#xD;
      advantage is that it is a fun and safe interactive diagnostic and therapeutic tool, which is&#xD;
      particularly suitable for children. Being able to modulate certain sensory information using&#xD;
      virtual reality, in children without vestibular function deficit and in children with&#xD;
      vestibular function deficit, will make it possible to better understand the role of the&#xD;
      vestibule in the construction of the self in relation to space and environment. In addition&#xD;
      to the scientific aspect, the diagnostic and therapeutic benefits are potentially numerous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to determine a reliable, well-tolerated and age-appropriate&#xD;
      virtual reality protocol in children without vestibular deficit and in children with chronic&#xD;
      vestibular deficit, making it possible to study the hand-eye coordination.&#xD;

&#xD;
      It is particularly important in children for the acquisition of sitting, standing and then&#xD;
      walking. When a congenital vestibular deficit exists, adaptive behaviors using visual and&#xD;
      proprioceptive inputs are set up.&#xD;
