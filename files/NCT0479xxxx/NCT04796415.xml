  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 4.4 million patients receive home health services following discharge from the&#xD;
      hospital or rehabilitation facility. A substantial number (70%) are older adults with&#xD;
      subjective cognitive decline (SCD), an early clinical sign of Alzheimer's disease and related&#xD;
      dementia. SCD is associated with diminished activity performance, poor quality-of-life and&#xD;
      other adverse health outcomes (e.g., depressive symptoms). Home health patients with SCD&#xD;
      often require more time, structure, and guidance to complete tasks and adjust to new skills&#xD;
      and environments. Support is especially important during this high-risk period of transition&#xD;
      between care settings. We propose a new home health care delivery model in partnership with&#xD;
      Kindred at Home (KAH), a division of Humana that encompasses 400 programs across 40 states.&#xD;
      DEMA-Pro builds on five preliminary studies that demonstrated high feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and positive preliminary effects on health outcomes (physical function, mood,&#xD;
      and QoL). DEMA-Pro will be refined for delivery by home health services staff to patients&#xD;
      with SCD and their informal caregivers. The overall goal of this research will be to conduct&#xD;
      a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of DEMA-Pro to improve outcomes in-home&#xD;
      health service patients with SCD. In the current R61 pilot phase, we will establish the&#xD;
      trial's organizational structure and processes and pilot test DEMA-Pro in 4 home health&#xD;
      services sites. In a subsequent trial, we plan to conduct a full pragmatic RCT in a group of&#xD;
      Kindred KAH sites comparing DEMA-Pro to usual care. Consistent with the spirit of a pragmatic&#xD;
      trial, we will use existing data sources including electronic Medicare OASIS (Outcome and&#xD;
      Assessment Information Set) data, and QoL to characterize the cohort and measure outcomes.&#xD;
      Thus, the focus of the pilot phase will be to ensure all processes are in place to conduct&#xD;
      the subsequent RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Establish the organizational infrastructure and programmatic processes needed to&#xD;
      conduct a pragmatic cluster-randomized control trial of the DEMA-Pro intervention versus&#xD;
      usual care. A Steering Committee will lead the project and coordinate the activities of 3&#xD;
      Work Groups: Regulatory and Operations; DEMA-Pro Intervention Protocol; and Data Management&#xD;
      and Analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Pilot test the DEMA-Pro training protocol in 4 KAH North Region locations and refine&#xD;
      as indicated.&#xD;

    <description>Trained DEMA-Pro coaches will deliver six weekly, 1-hour telephone sessions. The first session is an orientation to the DEMA-Pro intervention and development of the initial Weekly Activity Plan based on the patient's self-identified meaningful activity. Over the next five weekly sessions, the coach uses problem-solving strategies to facilitate dyad collaboration to mutually identify meaningful activities and make a realist plan to achieve the patient-identified meaning activity goals. In each session, the patient and caregiver also select, review, and discuss one of six topics in the Self-Management Toolkit (e.g., planning meaningful activities; learning strategies for living with subjective cognitive impairment; finding resources, planning for the future).</description>
