      To assess the role of myocardial oedema on CMR (T2 mapping) after radiation therapy and&#xD;
      cardiotoxic systemic therapy in predicting the incidence of cardiotoxicity, defined as by&#xD;
      consensus guidelines* (decline of LVEF ≥10% points with a final LVEF &lt;53%) measured on CMR&#xD;
      and ECHO over the time window of 12 months from the end of radiation therapy.&#xD;

      Overall study schedule The Overall Study Schedule is summarized in the assessment schedule&#xD;
      (appendix 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is composed of three subsequent phases: a Run-In Phase, a RT/Systemic Therapy&#xD;
      Phase, a Follow-Up Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-In Phase The Run-In Phase starts with the first visit (before any cancer treatment), when&#xD;
      Screening/Enrollment procedure is performed. This phase will start once a patient has&#xD;
      provided WIC to participate in the study and ends the day of treatment start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening / Enrolment Visit Visit will be performed before the expected starting date of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a WIC has been obtained from the patient, the patient will be visited by the&#xD;
      Investigators and the following information will be gathered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic Data (age, height, weight, BMI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history (previous and concomitant diseases, previous therapies, family history&#xD;
           of CVD);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant Medication;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination &amp; overall health assessment (including vital signs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test (pre- and perimenopausal women). The inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
           will be checked and, if the patient complies with all the Inclusion and Exclusion&#xD;
           criteria, she will be enrolled into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline assessment will be performed by the Investigator:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMR, ECG and ECHO will be done at the participating centers The patient will be assigned to&#xD;
      specific treatment (chemo/immunotherapy and adjuvant radiation therapy +/- aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitor/tamoxifen/LhRh agonist). A standard of care treatment will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy/Systemic therapy Treatment Phase (specific Visit descriptions) SYSTEMIC&#xD;
      TREATMENT Blood sample will be scheduled before and, if possible, 24 hours after chemotherapy&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients treated with antracyclines regimens will be checked with ECG and ECHO at the&#xD;
           end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample will be scheduled before Trastuzumab administration every three weeks and&#xD;
           ECHO will be done after every 4 cycles (3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RADIOTHERAPY For Technical details see appendix 3. Before starting RT patients will be&#xD;
      checked clinically the first day of treatment and baseline tests will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers will be checked the first day and in the middle of RT. If a patient gets&#xD;
      symptomatic heart failure during the treatment, or if LVEF decline greater than 10% points&#xD;
      with a final LVEF &lt;53% measured on Echo, the patient will be referred to the cardiologist for&#xD;
      a specific treatment as described by guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of RT Group Patients treated with trastuzumab, will continue the treatment up to 1 year.&#xD;
      Blood tests will be taken every three weeks and Echos will be done after every 4 cycles&#xD;
      (3-week cycles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Phase 2 weeks+/-3 days after the end of RT, blood sample will be taken. An ECHO and&#xD;
      CMR will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be checked 6 weeks after the end of radiotherapy for the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following activities will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample for biomarkers. If hs-CRP ≥3mg/l, ECHO will be done. All patients will be&#xD;
      followed at least until 10 years after the end of RT. Blood samples for measuring biomarkers&#xD;
      and ECHO and CMR will be done 12 months after the end of RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unscheduled Visit An unscheduled visit may occur at any time during the study, only for&#xD;
      safety reason or for a premature discontinuation from the study.&#xD;
