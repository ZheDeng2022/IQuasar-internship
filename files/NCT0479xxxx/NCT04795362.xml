  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly half of the survivors of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) retain irreversible&#xD;
      neurological damage resulting from the early lesions associated with the initial bleeding,&#xD;
      and the occurrence of possible delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI). The early diagnosis of the&#xD;
      occurrence of an DCI is therefore a major challenge in order to optimise management before&#xD;
      irreversible lesions are formed. However, the means of diagnosis are often not available, and&#xD;
      up to a third of DCI are discovered on follow-up images when the lesions are already present.&#xD;
      Among the markers of brain injury, S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) is an astrocyte&#xD;
      protein released into the bloodstream at the time of the appearance of a brain lesion. Its&#xD;
      short half-life makes it a prime candidate for patient follow-up to diagnose a new ischemic&#xD;
      lesion and assess the effectiveness of its management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the elements at the origin of DCI, the occurrence of proximal vasospasm is the main&#xD;
      element on which we can have a therapeutic action. The strategy implemented in the department&#xD;
      consists of performing a mechanical angioplasty when proximal vasospasm is detected with a&#xD;
      decrease in downstream cerebral perfusion. Nevertheless the benefit of this therapeutic&#xD;
      action is discussed and there is currently no early marker of the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
