    <textblock>
      This study aims to estimate the effect of a 3-month High Intensity Interval Training on&#xD;
      antipsychotic-induced weight gain in patients with a first episode of psychosis, as well as&#xD;
      to determine whether these effects are maintained 9 months after the intervention has ended.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Weight gain associated with antipsychotic medication has been recognized for years as a very&#xD;
      common side effect, occurring mainly during the first months after the start of antipsychotic&#xD;
      treatment. Patients with schizophrenia have a risk of obesity 1.5-2 times higher than the&#xD;
      general population and the chances of developing physical problems such as hypertension,&#xD;
      diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and coronary heart disease are also higher. Patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with schizophrenia have a life expectancy of up to 25 years lower than the general&#xD;
      population, with cardiovascular disease being the main cause of premature death. The first&#xD;
      months of treatment constitute a critical period for the implementation of strategies that&#xD;
      could prevent or mitigate this side effect of the medication, as well as the adverse&#xD;
      consequences derived from weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is the response to the need to implement physical exercise interventions to&#xD;
      prevent weight gain in patients with a first psychotic episode.To date, there is little&#xD;
      evidence from randomized clinical trials that have used physical exercise as the only&#xD;
      intervention to prevent weight gain in the first weeks from the start of antipsychotic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have evaluated non-pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions to reduce weight in people with severe mental illness, including chronic&#xD;
      psychotic disorders. However, there is little research on this type of intervention in&#xD;
      patients with a first episode of psychosis. Studies are needed that implement physical&#xD;
      exercise programs from the initial phases of antipsychotic treatment, and that are capable of&#xD;
      defining the parameters used in the design of an effective physical exercise intervention for&#xD;
      the prevention of weight gain in first psychotic episodes.&#xD;

    <description>Dyslipidemia is an abnormal amount of lipids (e.g.,triglycerides, cholesterol and/or fat phospholipids) in the blood.&#xD;
The normal triglyceride level is between 30 and 150 mg/dL. The normal HDL cholesterol level is between 40 and 60 mg/dL.</description>

    <measure>Change in abdominal obesity measured by waist circumference.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks and 9 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Abdominal obesity, also known as central obesity, is when excessive abdominal fat around the stomach and abdomen has built up to the extent that it is likely to have a negative impact on health.&#xD;
Men are considered to be at high risk from abdominal obesity if their waist measurements are 102 cm or higher, while women are considered to be at high risk if their waist measurements are 88 cm or higher.</description>

    <measure>Change in glycemic measured by fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin HbA1c and insulin.</measure>

    <description>Hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar (also spelled hyperglycaemia) is a condition in which an excessive amount of glucose circulates in the blood plasma.&#xD;
A subject with a consistent range between 100-126 mg/dl is considered hyperglycemic, while above 126 mg/dl is generally held to have diabetes.</description>

    <measure>Change in hypertension measured by blood pressure.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks and 9 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Hypertension (HTN or HT), also known as high blood pressure (HBP), is a long term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated.&#xD;
Blood pressure is expressed by two measurements, the systolic and diastolic pressures, which are the maximum and minimum pressures, respectively. Normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100-130 millimeters mercury (mmHg) systolic and 60-85 mmHg diastolic.</description>

    <description>The experimental group will receive, in addition to the conventional treatment, a physical exercise intervention along 12 weeks, which will consist of complying with the general recommendations for physical activity: 75 minutes weekly of high intensity physical exercise. The therapeutic exercise intervention will be supervised by a physiotherapist and designed in a progressive, structured and personalized way.</description>

    <description>The control group will only receive the conventional treatment offered in the clinical program. For 12 weeks, parients will attend 8 visits with mental health specialist nurse, where they will receive information, oral and written, to comply with the recommendations for physical exercise: 150-300 min/week of moderate physical activity or 75-150 min/week of vigorous physical activity.&#xD;
In both groups (experimental and control), patients will be informed of the risk of weight gain, and they will be advised, regardless of the group assigned, to watch their diet and increase physical exercise until they meet the weekly recommendations.</description>
