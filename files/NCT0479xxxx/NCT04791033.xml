  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenomyosis is a disease where ectopic endometrial-like glands affect the muscular wall of&#xD;
      the uterus. About 70% of women affected by adenomyosis suffer from dysmenorrhea and&#xD;
      menorrhagia. A levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) is the first-choice&#xD;
      treatment of adenomyosis, but is not always sufficiently effective in all women. Those women&#xD;
      often end up removing the uterus (hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hysterectomy is clinically regarded to be an efficient and final treatment of adenomyosis,&#xD;
      but pelvic pain may also prevail after removal of the uterus. This study aimes to investigate&#xD;
      the short - and long-term impact of hysterectomy on quality of life (QOL) and sexual function&#xD;
      in women with adenomyosis, and further to evaluate if there is any difference compared to&#xD;
      women that are removing their uterus due to other benign gynecological conditions.&#xD;

    <measure>The impact of hysterectomy on health related quality of life assessed by SF-36 sub scale bodily pain</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) measures eight sub scales including bodily pain (BP) which in this study is used as primary outcome. The scales ranges from 0-100, a higher score indicates a better quality of life.</description>

    <description>The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) measures eight subscales. In this study seven sub scales is used as secondary outcomes: Physical functioning (PF), role physical (RP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotional (RE) and mental health (MH). The scales ranges from 0-100, a higher score indicates a better quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) use a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1-5 with higher scores indicating greater levels of sexual functioning. To score the measure the sum of each domain score (sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain) is multiplied by a domain factor and summed to derive a total FSFI score.</description>
