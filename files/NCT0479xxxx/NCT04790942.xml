  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a progressive cardiovascular syndrome caused by multiple causes, which can&#xD;
      lead to changes in the function and structure of the heart and blood vessels. It is the&#xD;
      leading risk factor of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Berberine (BBR) hydrochloride is an isoquinoline alkaloid (chemical formula: C20H18NO4)&#xD;
      extracted from traditional Chinese herb Coptis chinensis. It has been widely used to treat&#xD;
      diarrhea and enteritis for hundreds of years in China. BBR has extremely high clinical&#xD;
      application value. It is an over-the-counter drug with low price, good safety and few adverse&#xD;
      reactions in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We found that Berberine (BBR) hydrochloride tablets have a hypotensive effect in clinical&#xD;
      practice. However, there are few clinical studies on the treatment of hypertensive patients&#xD;
      with BBR tablets. In addition, the clinical dosage of BBR tablets is not uniform, and its&#xD;
      molecular mechanism is still unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to further evaluate the clinical efficacy of BBR in reducing blood pressure and&#xD;
      improving vascular endothelial injury, we carried out this clinical trial of drug&#xD;
      intervention for hypertensive population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signed the informed consent, the subjects are assigned to the lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      group (CON) and berberine hydrochloride group (BBR). The berberine hydrochloride group (BBR)&#xD;
      take berberine hydrochloride tablets (0.4g, 3 times/day, 3 months) . We will follow up blood&#xD;
      pressure and vascular endothelial function in 1 month and 3 months after taking the medicine.&#xD;

    <measure>Office blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>BP measurement was in accordance with the method recommended by clinical guidelines. After rest for at least 5 minutes, subjects were examined while seated in a quiet, temperature-controlled room, with the feet on the floor and arm supported at heart level. BP was measured using an automated device at least 2 measurements spaced 2 minutes apart, and additional measurements if the Ô¨Årst 2 are quite different. Average BP readings were recorded.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>baPWV was measured by using an automatic device as reported previously and was expressed as centimeters per second (cm/sec). The measurement of baPWV is generally accepted as the simplest, robust, and reproducible method to represent arterial stiffness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>We record the 24 h ABPM results before recruitment and during the follow-up period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>brachial arterial flow-mediated dilation (FMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were recommended to rest for 10 min or longer and were examined in a quiet, temperature-controlled room. FMD was examined through noninvasive ultrasound scan; it could dynamically record artery diameter, at rest (baseline) and reactive hyperemia period produced by using the cuff inflated to the greater of 50 mmHg above systolic pressure or 200 mmHg for 5 min as previously described.</description>
