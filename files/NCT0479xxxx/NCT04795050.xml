  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study explored the effects of the cardiovascular disease risk reduction intervention on&#xD;
      diabetes fatalism, self-care activities, social support, knowledge, perceived self-managment&#xD;
      among a rural population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An experimental pretest-posttest control group design was used to assess the effects of a&#xD;
      diabetes health promotion intervention among participants recruited from rural churches&#xD;
      located in the southern United States. The intervention, called Project Power, is a&#xD;
      culturally relevant, church-based diabetes education program that was developed by the&#xD;
      American Diabetes Association (ADA). Participating churches were randomized to experimental&#xD;
      and control groups using random numbers tables having numerical parity no greater than 2.&#xD;
      Since an individual church is the unit of randomization, all of the participants in that&#xD;
      church received the same treatment condition. Churches randomized to the intervention group&#xD;
      received the health promotion program, and those designated to the control group received an&#xD;
      educational brochure. Recruitment, data collection and intervention delivery, for the&#xD;
      intervention group, occurred on the church grounds.&#xD;

    <measure>Diabetes Self-care Activities</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Summary of Diabetes Self-care Activities (SDSCA) (Toobert, Hampson, &amp; Glascow, 2000) includes multiple choice questions and items about self-care behaviors answered in days per week. The internal consistency of the instrument is adequate (α = .71). The scores ranged from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 105. Higher scores indicated better diabetes self-care.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Diabetes Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Revised Diabetes Knowledge Test: Michigan Diabetes Research Center (Fitzgerald et al., 2016) is a 23-item multiple choice diabetes knowledge test. The scale has good reliability for both the general test (α = .77) and the insulin use subscale (α = .84). The twenty scored items were worth 5 points each for a maximum of 100 points total. Higher scores indicated higher knowledge levels.</description>

    <measure>Diabetes Fatalism</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and three weeks later</time_frame>
    <description>The Diabetes Fatalism Scale (Egede &amp; Ellis, 2010) is a 12-item, 6-point Likert scale that measures the three constructs associated with diabetes fatalism: emotional distress, coping, and self-efficacy. The measure has excellent internal consistency (α = .83). The total score ranged from a minimum of 12 points and maximum of 72 points. Higher scores indicated greater diabetes fatalism.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Diabetes Self-Management</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and three weeks later</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Diabetes Self-Management Scale (PDSMS) (Wallston, Rothman, &amp; Cherrington, 2007) is an 8-item, Likert scale-type tool with responses that range from &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; (1) to &quot;Strongly Agree&quot; (5) for each of the 8 items. The tool measures self-care perceptions and has excellent internal consistency (α = .83). The total score ranged from a minimum of 8 points and maximum of 40. Higher scores indicate greater perceptions of diabetes self-management.</description>

    <measure>Social Support</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and three weeks later</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (Sherbourne &amp; Stewart, 1991) is a instrument that has one fill-in-the-blank and 19 Likert scale, 5-point items that range from &quot;None of the Time&quot; (1) to &quot;All of the Time&quot; (5). The four social support subscales have excellent reliabilities (α = .91 - .97). The possibility of ranges were between 19 and 95, and higher scores indicated higher social support.</description>
