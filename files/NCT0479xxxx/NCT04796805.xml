    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to determine the effects of topical application of black pepper&#xD;
      essential oil on peripheral intravenous catheter insertion success.This randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial was carried out on 60 patients randomly assigned to either the experimental group&#xD;
      (n=30) or the control group (n=30) reporting to the endoscopy unit of the clinic between May&#xD;
      2019 and October 2019. In the experimental group, black pepper essential oil was used to&#xD;
      increase vein degree before the procedure, while in the control group, no extra interventions&#xD;
      were applied. The time taken in determining an appropriate vein, time taken for successful&#xD;
      catheter insertion, and the patient's and nurse's satisfaction after the process were&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;

      Introduction: The literature describes many techniques to increase vein visibility and&#xD;
      palpability that facilitate peripheral intravenous catheter insertion. However, there is only&#xD;
      one study examining the effect of topical essential black pepper oil on veins. The&#xD;
      investigators aimed to determine the effects of topical application of black pepper essential&#xD;
      oil on peripheral intravenous catheter insertion success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This randomized controlled trial was carried out on 60 patients randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either the experimental group (n=30) or the control group (n=30) reporting to the endoscopy&#xD;
      unit of the clinic between May 2019 and October 2019. The study results were evaluated using&#xD;
      an information form, a catheter insertion form, and a visual analog scale (VAS). In the&#xD;
      experimental group, black pepper essential oil was used to increase vein degree before the&#xD;
      procedure, while in the control group, no extra interventions were applied. The time taken in&#xD;
      determining an appropriate vein, time taken for successful catheter insertion, and the&#xD;
      patient's and nurse's satisfaction after the process were recorded via a chronometer.&#xD;

    <description>The experimental group received 20% black pepper essential oil in a base of aloe vera gel applied topically to the forearm using a rollerball 10 min before venipuncture. Twelve swipes were applied using the rollerball applicator. The maximum dose of the black pepper/aloe vera gel mixture was 3 mL. Sphygmomanometer cuff was placed on the right arm, and the cuff was inflated until it reached the patient's diastolic blood pressure level. When the pointer reached the desired value, the period was commenced by the researcher. The nurse determined the right vein. After selecting the right vein, the period was ended as the nurse successfully placed a catheter.</description>

    <description>Diastolic blood pressure and body temperature of the patients in the control group were measured. A sphygmomanometer cuff was placed on the arm that was not actively used by the patient. Until the cuff's pointer reached the diastolic blood pressure level of the patient, it was inflated. When the tip came to the desired value, the period was noted by the researcher. Without any extra attempts being made, the catheter was placed by the nurse. The period ended with the successful catheter placement by the nurse. Period of appropriate vein selection, the period of placing the catheter successfully, patient and nurse satisfaction were recorded.</description>
