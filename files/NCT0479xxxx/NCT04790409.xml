  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a single-arm, open-label, phase II study of PD-1 monoclonal antibody combined&#xD;
      with anlotinib in the treatment of advanced rare-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
      Thirty patients enrolled in the study who underwent platinum-containing systemic chemotherapy&#xD;
      and/or TKI failure were enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study was the objective response rate (ORR) based on RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
      Secondary goals included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease&#xD;
      control rate (DCR) based on RECIST 1.1; safety Sex and tolerance. Exploratory objectives&#xD;
      include the use of tumor tissue and plasma specimens to detect biomarkers predicting the&#xD;
      efficacy of sidilimumab: including but not limited to tumor mutation burden (TMB), PD-L1&#xD;
      expression, etc.; exploring potential predictions in peripheral blood. Biomarkers for&#xD;
      anti-group efficacy, including but not limited to TCR.&#xD;
