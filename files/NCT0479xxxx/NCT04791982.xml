  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted as a pre-test-post-test, control group and quasi-experimental&#xD;
      intervention research design in order to evaluate the effects of education applied to family&#xD;
      members who provide care for patients with colorectal cancer on their healthy lifestyle&#xD;
      behaviors and reactions towards caregiving. The study population consisted of 100 caregiver&#xD;
      who provide primary care to patients with colorectal cancer. The study data were collected&#xD;
      using the &quot;Socio-Demographic Characteristics Data Collection Form&quot;, &quot;Healthy Lifestyle&#xD;
      Behaviors Scale II (HPLP-II)&quot; and the &quot;Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA)&quot;. The pre-test was&#xD;
      applied to the experimental and control groups at the first interview. The preferred&#xD;
      interview format was a booklet. Three times face to-face individual educational sessions were&#xD;
      provided to the experimental group, accompanied by a education booklet. After the third&#xD;
      educational session the post-test was applied to the caregivers in the experimental and&#xD;
      control groups.&#xD;

The booklet was included colorectal cancer treatment, symptoms that may develop due to chemotherapy and information on their control, psychosocial support of caregiving family members. Interviews and educational sessions with family members who agreed to participate in the study were held in one-on-one and face-to-face meeting room. These interviews lasted approximately 45 to 60 minutes for each family member. In the interviews, a educational booklet containing information on nutrition, exercise, symptom management, physical aspects of care and disease-specific care was used to present information to caregivers.
