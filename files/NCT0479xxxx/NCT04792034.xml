  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and dosing of GOPRELTO® as an anesthetic for diagnostic procedures and&#xD;
      surgeries on or through the mucous membranes of the nasal cavities in pediatric adolescent&#xD;

    <textblock>
      GOPRELTO® (cocaine hydrochloride nasal solution, 4%) is an approved product in adults. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and dosing of GOPRELTO® as an anesthetic for diagnostic procedures and surgeries on or&#xD;
      through the mucous membranes of the nasal cavities in pediatric adolescent subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of GOPRELTO® nasal solution in pediatric&#xD;
           adolescent subjects as an anesthetic for diagnostic procedures and surgeries on or&#xD;
           through the mucous membranes of the nasal cavities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the PK properties and define the dosing for GOPRELTO® nasal solution in&#xD;
           pediatric adolescent subjects as an anesthetic for diagnostic procedures and surgeries&#xD;
           on or through the mucous membranes of the nasal cavities.&#xD;

         16. Has an ECG finding of any abnormality at the Screening Visit. Generally, these&#xD;
             exclusionary abnormalities are current or prior myocardial ischemia or infarction,&#xD;
             dysrhythmia, or risk of serious dysrhythmia (such as prolonged QT interval). An&#xD;
             exception to this would be if sinus bradycardia or sinus tachycardia is present. The&#xD;

         17. Has a known personal or family history of hereditary pseudocholinesterase deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;

             participants will be specifically asked if they have been treated for a&#xD;
             pheochromocytoma previously or if they have a family member who has been diagnosed&#xD;
             with pheochromocytoma (as 10% of these are familial).&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Has any laboratory result outside the normal laboratory reference range deemed&#xD;
             clinically significant by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Has a history of or current, hepatic, or renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Is not suitable for entry into the study, in the opinion of the Investigator. Note: A&#xD;
             one-time retest is permitted for any blood test if the original sample was hemolyzed.&#xD;
