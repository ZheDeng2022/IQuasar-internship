    <measure>2011 Knee Society Score (KSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>from pre-operative visit up to 12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee Society Score (KSS) is a validated tool combining objective physician-derived component with a subjective subject-derived component consisting of 36 questions &amp; provides sub-scores across 4 dimensions. The Objective Knee Score rated by clinician assesses UKA alignment, stability, Range of Motion (ROM) and symptoms. The Subject Satisfaction Score assesses 5 daily activities: sitting, lying in bed, getting out of bed, light household duties, &amp; leisure activities). The Subject Expectation Score evaluates the subject's expectations prior to surgery. Post-operative questions differ from pre-operative questions and ask if the subject's pre-operative expectations were met. Pre-op &amp; post-op scores because they are based on different questions. The Functional Knee Score is derived from assessments of walking and standing, standard activities, advanced activities, and discretionary activities.</description>

    <measure>Oxford Knee Score (OKS)</measure>
    <time_frame>from pre-operative visit up to 12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) is a Patient Reported Outcome questionnaire that was developed to assess perceived function and pain answered on a Likert scale after Total Knee Arthroplasty. Responses to each question ranges from 0-4 with a range of a possible overall score from 0-48. A score of 0 is the worst possible outcome while a score of 48 is the best possible outcome.</description>

    <measure>Forgotten Joint Score (FJS)</measure>
    <time_frame>from operative visit up to 12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) comprises measures for the assessment of joint-specific patient reported outcomes. Subjects are asked to rate their awareness of their knee arthroplasty in 12 questions with a five point Likert response format: &quot;Never&quot;, &quot;almost never&quot;, &quot;seldom&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot; and &quot;mostly&quot;. The item scores are summed and linearly transformed in a 0 to 100 scale with a high value reflecting the ability of the subject to forget about the replaced knee joint during the activities of daily living.</description>

    <measure>Five-level EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D-5L) VAS and index scores</measure>
    <time_frame>from pre-operative visit up to 12 months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L score consists of two parts: a descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (VAS). The descriptive system is used to describe the subject's health state and consists of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels to choose the most appropriate answer: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The subject is asked to indicate his/her health state by marking the most appropriate statement in each of the five areas.&#xD;
The visual analogue scale records the subject's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. The endpoints on the scale are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents.</description>

    <measure>CORI system time and cutting time of the robotic drill</measure>
    <time_frame>During Operation</time_frame>
    <description>In the case logs, the following time stamps will be recorded in the log file of the CORI Case Report:&#xD;
State-Machine transition : [ Adjust Camera ] --&gt; [ Checkpoint Definition ]&#xD;
State-Machine transition : [ Checkpoint Verification ] --&gt; [ Remove Bone ]&#xD;
State-Machine transition : [ Remove Bone ] --&gt; [ Baseline Stress ROM Collection ] CORI System Time CORI System starts with the checkpoint definition until the bone is removed. This is calculated by the time difference between #3 and #1.&#xD;
Cutting Time The Cutting Time of the robotic drill is the time from the start until the end of bone removal and is calculated by the time difference between #3 and #2.</description>
