  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, parallel controlled, open-label study. The&#xD;
      primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Huaier Granule on postoperative&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy of high-risk early-stage triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma. The&#xD;
      Secondary purposes are to evaluate the safety of long-term use of Huaier granules as&#xD;
      postoperative adjuvant treatment of high-risk early-stage triple-negative invasive ductal&#xD;
      carcinoma, and the changes of quality of life score after treatment with Huaier granule.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Triple-negative breast cancer（TNBC） accounts for 10% to 20% of breast cancer. TNBC is more&#xD;
      likely to show lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and biologically more aggressive. Women&#xD;
      with TNBC have a higher rate of distant recurrence at early-stage and a worse 5-year&#xD;
      prognosis than women of other molecular types. Although PARP inhibitors and immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors are showing promise to patients with advanced TNBC, however, these targeted&#xD;
      therapies and immunotherapy for TNBC can not increase the clinical benefits of early-stage&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As adjuvant therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma after curative liver resection, a&#xD;
      multicentre study demonstrated a significant prolongation of RFS and reduced extrahepatic&#xD;
      recurrence in Huaier group. Retrospective studies have shown that Huaier granules can improve&#xD;
      the rates of disease-free survival（DFS） and overall survival（OS）, and reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      adverse events among operable patients with TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 1072 high-risk early-stage triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma&#xD;
      participants (536 cases in the observation group and 536 cases in the control group) from 30&#xD;
      research centers will be included. The block randomization was adopted, participants will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into the experimental group (Huaier granule plus conventional&#xD;
      treatment/visit) and control group (conventional treatment/visit only). All participants will&#xD;
      be followed up for 5 years, including 2-year treatment follow-up and 3-year survival&#xD;
      follow-up. During the treatment period, the participants will be followed up every 3 months,&#xD;
      and the survival follow-up period will be followed up every 6 months.&#xD;
