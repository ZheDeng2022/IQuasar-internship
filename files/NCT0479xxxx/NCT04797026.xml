      The purpose of this research is to study whether sending letters helps reduce loneliness for&#xD;
      either the facility resident or the teenager.&#xD;

      Hypothesis: Our hypothesis is that a social program connecting patients in residential care&#xD;
      facilities with high school students through monthly letter writing would positively impact&#xD;
      quality of life for both, reducing quantitative and qualitiative measures of loneliness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims, purpose, or objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to reduce loneliness and increase quality of life for patients residing in&#xD;
      residential care facilities and for high school students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background (Include relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc.):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to the Covid pandemic, to protect their residents, residential care facilities&#xD;
      have implemented restrictions limiting visitors as well as social activities. Anecdoctally&#xD;
      this has negative impacted the quality of life of those residents, increasing their&#xD;
      loneliness. Previous studies have shown positive impact of intergenerational programs&#xD;
      including penpal programs.&#xD;
