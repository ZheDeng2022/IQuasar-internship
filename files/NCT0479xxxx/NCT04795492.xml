      Objective: This study is intended to verify the effect of a remote intervention on adherence&#xD;
      to drugs and risk factors control in patients with stable coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study was a multicenter, two-arm, parallel, open-label, prospective&#xD;
      clinical trial that evaluated the effect of a remote intervention on adherence to drugs and&#xD;
      risk factors control in patients with stable coronary artery disease with 1 year of&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention: Participants in the experimental group received remote guidance from the&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation team in the community hospital every month after enrollment. The&#xD;
      control group had no special intervention. All patients received follow-up at 6 months and&#xD;
      1-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcome was medication adherence. Secondary outcomes included&#xD;
      smoking, drinking, blood pressure, body mass index, LDL cholesterol, HbA1c, and major adverse&#xD;
      cerebral cardiovascular events(MACCE). Medication compliance consists of the following five&#xD;
      medications: aspirin, P2Y12 receptor antagonist, statin, ACEI/ARB and beta-blocker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Values of analyzed endpoints between intervention group and control&#xD;
      group will be compared according to the analysis plan. We'll follow a prespecified analysis&#xD;
      plan and subgroup analysis will be conducted accordingly.&#xD;

    <description>Medication adherence and risk factor modification status were assessed, then individualized feedback, encouragement and recommendations were provided. Risk factor modification included lipid control, smoking and drinking cessation, BP monitoring, dietary change keeping a healthy weight and in our trial. There were also a lot of educational materials about coronary heart disease knowledge that were reviewed by cardiologists, and participants were free to provide them whenever and wherever they want.</description>
