  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy of the addition of a therapeutic education program combined with&#xD;
      nursing phone follow-up, compared to conventional management alone, on the management of&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs) related to adjuvant hormone therapy during the first year of treatment&#xD;
      in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the ETAPH project is to offer breast cancer patients multidisciplinary&#xD;
      care that will limit the impact of adverse effects related to hormone therapy treatment and&#xD;
      improve their quality of life. The achievement of this objective is based on therapeutic&#xD;
      education and nursing follow-up throughout the first year of treatment, which, thanks to&#xD;
      active listening and coordination of the various players, will enable global and personalized&#xD;
      patient care.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From date of first Hormone Therapy intake to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The INN name,the daily dosage and duration (number of days) of medication taken between Day 0 and 12 months, will be assessed to compare between the experimental ans the control group in term of medication use</description>
