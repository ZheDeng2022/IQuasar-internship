  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brachial plexus block is a regional anaesthesia technique employed as a safe and valuable&#xD;
      alternative to general anaesthesia for upper limb surgery. In recent practices of day care&#xD;
      surgeries, brachial plexus block seems to be a better alternative to general anesthesia with&#xD;
      minimal hospital stay and better analgesic effect. Among several techniques of brachial&#xD;
      plexus block, supraclavicular approach is considered as easiest, effective and can be&#xD;
      performed much more quickly than other approaches. Various local anaesthetic agents and&#xD;
      adjuvants are used for this purpose. Among them, bupivacaine has been the most widely used&#xD;
      long-acting local anaesthetic agent. Combining local anesthetics with different adjuncts can&#xD;
      prolong the duration of analgesia associated with brachial plexus block. Among various&#xD;
      adjuncts, dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine have been identified as clinically effective&#xD;
      adjuncts. Several metaanalyses have convincingly demonstrated their efficacy in prolonging&#xD;
      the analgesic duration of brachial plexus block. However, there has been limited research&#xD;
      conducted to compare the effects of dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine added as adjuvants to&#xD;
      the local anesthetics for BPB. Studies have demonstrated benefits of one agent over other&#xD;
      without any definitive conclusion as which is the best agent for this purpose. Therefore,&#xD;
      there is a need of study to compare the onset and duration of bupivacaine when&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine or dexamethasone is used as an adjuvant to bupivacaine for ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      supraclavicular BPB&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral nerve block (PNB), as an integral part of regional anesthetic technique, remains a&#xD;
      well-accepted component of comprehensive anesthetic care. William Halstead (1852-1922) was&#xD;
      first to perform Brachial Plexus Block (BPB) in 1884 by surgically exposing the roots of the&#xD;
      brachial plexus and injecting each nerve directly. Kulenkampff described the first&#xD;
      percutaneous supraclavicular approach in 1911. BPB provides both intraoperative anaesthesia&#xD;
      as well as postoperative analgesia. Being a regional anaesthestic technique, it has many&#xD;
      advantages over general anaesthesia like effective analgesia with good motor blockade, awake&#xD;
      patient, extended postoperative analgesia, early mobilization, no airway manipulation,&#xD;
      avoidance of polypharmacy and decreased incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
      Advantages of supraclavicular approach include rapid onset and reliable blockade with a small&#xD;
      volume of local anaesthetic and produced a more intense motor blockade and reduced the&#xD;
      incidence of Horner's syndrome compared with Interscalene BPB. The clinical indications of&#xD;
      supraclavicular BPB have been confined to upper limb surgeries below the midshaft of humerus&#xD;
      because of concerns that it is performed too distally from the cervical nerve roots to block&#xD;
      the suprascapular nerve which innervates 70% of the shoulder joint in addition to the&#xD;
      subacromial bursa, coracoclavicular ligament, and acromioclavicular joint. There is evidence&#xD;
      that peripheral nerve blocks performed by ultrasound guidance alone, or in combination with&#xD;
      Peripheral Nerve Stimulator (PNS), are superior in terms of improved sensory and motor block,&#xD;
      reduced need for supplementation and fewer minor complications reported. Using ultrasound&#xD;
      alone shortens performance time when compared with nerve stimulation, but when used in&#xD;
      combination with PNS it increases performance time. Many local anaesthetics have been used to&#xD;
      produce brachial plexus block. Most common among them is bupivacaine, because of its higher&#xD;
      potency and prolonged duration of action. Bupivacaine is an amide local anaesthetic. It&#xD;
      prevents transmission of nerve impulses by inhibiting passage of sodium ions through&#xD;
      selective ion channel in nerve membranes. This slows the rate of depolarization such that&#xD;
      threshold potential is not reached and action potential not propagated. The half life of&#xD;
      bupivacaine in adults is 3.5 hours. The commonly used concentrations in brachial plexus block&#xD;
      are 0.25%, 0.375% and 0.5%. Studies have shown that mass of bupivacaine rather than&#xD;
      concentration is the major determinant of the Effective Dose 50 (ED50) for achieving&#xD;
      supraclavicular brachial plexus block. The concentration of bupivacaine that will be used in&#xD;
      our study is 0.5% and volume is 20 ml. Adjuvants or additives are often used with local&#xD;
      anaesthetics for its synergistic effect by prolonging the duration of sensory-motor block and&#xD;
      limiting its cumulative dose requirement. Various drugs like opioids, epinephrine, alpha-2&#xD;
      adrenergic antagonists, steroids, anti-inflammatory drugs, midazolam, ketamine, magnesium&#xD;
      sulfate and neostigmine have been used to potentiate the effect of local anesthetics. Due to&#xD;
      its potential adverse effects, current researches are exploring newer drugs and delivery&#xD;
      mechanisms to prolong the duration of action of local anesthetics. Recently, dexamethasone&#xD;
      and dexmedetomidine have been identified as clinically effective adjuncts; several&#xD;
      metaanalyses have convincingly demonstrated their efficacy and prolonging the analgesic&#xD;
      duration of PNB. Dexmedetomidine, a potent α2 adrenoceptor agonist, is approximately&#xD;
      eight-times more selective towards the α2 adrenoceptor than clonidine. Dexmedetomidine is&#xD;
      also reportedly safe and effective when administered with long-acting local anesthetics in&#xD;
      PNBs. No significant histopathologic abnormalities were reported after intrathecal or&#xD;
      perineural administration of dexmedetomidine. There have been four proposed mechanisms for&#xD;
      the action of alpha 2 adrenergic agonists in peripheral nerve blocks. These mechanisms&#xD;
      include centrally mediated analgesia, ∝2B-adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstrictive effects,&#xD;
      attenuation of the inflammatory response, and direct action on the peripheral nerve. In this&#xD;
      study we are adding 1mcg/kg dexemedetomidine as adjunct to bupivacaine as previous studies&#xD;
      have shown that 1 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine added perineurally to levobupivacaine in&#xD;
      Supraclavicular BPB is a safer dose than 2 mcg/kg with less sedation, bradycardia, and&#xD;
      comparable analgesia. Dexamethasone is a very potent and highly selective glucocorticoid.&#xD;
      Various studies have been done using dexamethasone as an adjuvant to local anaesthetics&#xD;
      mixture in brachial plexus block resulting in variable effects on onset but prolonged&#xD;
      duration of analgesia and motor block. Dexamethasone produces analgesia by blocking pain&#xD;
      signal transmission in nociceptive c-fibers, suppressing ectopic neural discharge and by&#xD;
      inhibiting the action of phospholipase A2. The block prolonging effect of peripherally&#xD;
      applied dexamethasone could be due to alteration in the function of potassium channels in the&#xD;
      excitable cells by dexamethasone via glucocorticoid receptors present in the brachial plexus.&#xD;
      It may also be due to the local vasoconstrictive effect of dexamethasone via glucocorticoid&#xD;
      receptors. In this study we are using 4 mg dexamethasone as articles have shown that&#xD;
      perineural dexamethasone at a dose of 4 mg prolongs the duration of analgesia after local&#xD;
      anaesthetic PNB with efficacy similar to a dose of 8 mg and without any reported serious&#xD;
      adverse effects. However, each of these molecules is associated with undesirable side&#xD;
      effects: increased glycemia, neurotoxicity and risk of precipitation may occur after use of&#xD;
      dexamethasone but studies show that these toxicities are very unlikely with peripheral use&#xD;
      and at the low dose of 4mg which will be used in this study; bradycardia, hypotension, and&#xD;
      sedation for dexmedetomidine. Importantly, most published trials of dexamethasone and&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine have compared these adjuncts to control, with very scant head-to-head&#xD;
      comparison. Notably, literature is characterized by conflicting results and inconsistent&#xD;
      reporting of side effects.&#xD;
