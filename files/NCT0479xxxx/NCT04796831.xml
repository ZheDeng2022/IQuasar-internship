  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quizartinib, a selective FLT3 inhibitor, is being developed as a treatment for acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The absolute oral bioavailability of&#xD;
      quizartinib has not yet been studied. This study is designed to estimate quizartinib&#xD;
      bioavailability of quizartinib following oral and intravenous (IV) administration.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Quizartinib bioavailability based on the dose-adjusted exposure of quizartinib following oral&#xD;
      and IV administration will be assessed in healthy male subjects. The primary objective of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the absolute oral bioavailability of quizartinib. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives will include characterizing the plasma PK of quizartinib and radiolabeled&#xD;
      quizartinib, major circulating metabolites, and total radioactivity after a single oral dose&#xD;
      and IV administration. Safety and tolerability of quizartinib will also be assessed.&#xD;

             the normal range, if considered clinically significant by the Investigator at&#xD;
             screening or admission (Day -1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt;90 mL/min (calculated using Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
             Equation) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of drugs with a risk of QT interval prolongation or Torsades de Pointes (TdP)&#xD;
             within 14 days of admission (Day -1) (or 5 drug half-lives, if 5 drug half-lives are&#xD;
