    <textblock>
      Study is to investigate drug levels in the blood after taking single or multiple doses of the&#xD;
      study drug, MT-7117, in healthy adults when taken together with another drug. This study will&#xD;
      also look at the safety and the body's ability to tolerate MT-7117&#xD;
