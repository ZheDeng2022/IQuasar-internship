  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-myeloablative allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (NMA-HSCT) is&#xD;
      associated with innumerable complications and side-effects and a high treatment-related&#xD;
      mortality. Maintaining quality of life, physical and psychosocial functioning and&#xD;
      participation in society is therefore challenging for patients undergoing treatment with&#xD;
      NMA-HSCT. This situation creates an urgent need for rehabilitation for patients to return to&#xD;
      a meaningful everyday life, and for knowledge about how to best help this group of patients&#xD;
      return to everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims to develop and examine the feasibility and safety of a multimodal&#xD;
      interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme targeted patients undergoing treatment with&#xD;
      NMA-HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three studies are planned. Study I is a qualitative interview study to get a profound insight&#xD;
      into patients' experiences and challenges after NMA-HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study II has a single arm longitudinal design with both a feasibility and an outcome&#xD;
      component. Patients (N=30) are consecutively recruited at the Department of Haematology,&#xD;
      Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark and enrolled in the 6-month HAPPY programme as soon as&#xD;
      the decision about NMA-HSCT is final. Data is collected pre-NMA-HSCT, at 3-month, 6-month and&#xD;
      12-month after NMA-HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study III is a qualitative interview study, where patients who participated in the&#xD;
      rehabilitation programme evaluate the programme's influence on their return to everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project contributes with knowledge about the feasibility of a rehabilitation programme&#xD;
      targeted at a vulnerable group of chronic cancer patients with rare diseases. We will&#xD;
      document the impact of an interdisciplinary intervention anchored in the hospital setting but&#xD;
      aimed at reaching patients at home. If the intervention enhances quality of life, patient&#xD;
      activation and functioning, it may not only reduce the number of hospitalizations and use of&#xD;
      healthcare services, but may also allow more patients to maintain contact with the labour&#xD;
      market and resume participation in society.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation is becoming increasingly important in the face of growing diversity and&#xD;
      intensity of cancer treatment and so is treatment with haematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation from a donor. Non-myeloablative allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (NMA-HSCT) is associated with innumerable complications and side-effects and&#xD;
      a high treatment-related mortality. Maintaining quality of life, physical and psychosocial&#xD;
      functioning, and participation in society is therefore challenging for patients undergoing&#xD;
      treatment with NMA-HSCT. This situation creates an urgent need for rehabilitation for&#xD;
      patients to return to a meaningful everyday life, and for knowledge about how to best support&#xD;
      this group of patients' return to everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim is to develop and evaluate the feasibility of a targeted multimodal&#xD;
      interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme by involving patients undergoing NMA-HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three studies were planned in accordance with the theoretical framework of Complex&#xD;
      Interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study I is a qualitative focus group interview study using the Interpretive Description&#xD;
      methodology. The purpose was to explore the experiences and perspectives of NMA-HSCT patients&#xD;
      regarding their challenges and needs during their return to everyday life after HSCT&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study II has a single arm longitudinal design with both a feasibility component and an&#xD;
      outcome component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim was to develop and to assess feasibility of the multimodal interdisciplinary&#xD;
      rehabilitation programme HAPPY in patients with haematological cancers undergoing NMA-HSCT.&#xD;
      Furthermore, to report health related quality of life, Patient Activation Measurement,&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory capacity (VO2peak), muscle extension power, lean body mass, days at&#xD;
      hospital, return to work and survival. A 6-month multimodal interdisciplinary rehabilitation&#xD;
      programme was tested. The programme consisted of motivating interviewing technique,&#xD;
      individual supervised physical exercise training, relaxation exercises, nutritional&#xD;
      counselling, and group sessions (a combination of topics and exchange of experiences) with&#xD;
      patients and relatives. To reach patients at home, the team phoned patients, who were also&#xD;
      given tablets with access to the project's homepage and a digital physical exercise&#xD;
      programme. Feasibility parameters were acceptability, exposure, fidelity, practicality,&#xD;
      safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study III is a qualitative interview study using the Interpretive Description methodology.&#xD;
      The aim was to explore patients' experiences and perspectives on relevance and meaning of&#xD;
      participating in the multimodal interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme HAPPY, and the&#xD;
      programme's influence on handling everyday life, during and after NMA-HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project contributes with knowledge about the feasibility of a rehabilitation programme&#xD;
      targeted at a vulnerable group of chronic cancer patients with rare diseases. We will&#xD;
      document the impact of an interdisciplinary intervention anchored in the hospital setting but&#xD;
      aimed at reaching patients at home. If the intervention enhances health related quality of&#xD;
      life, patient activation and functioning, it may not only reduce the number of&#xD;
      hospitalizations and use of healthcare services, but may also allow more patients to maintain&#xD;
      contact with the labour market and resume participation in society.&#xD;
