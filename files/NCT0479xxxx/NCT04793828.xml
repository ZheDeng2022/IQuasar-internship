  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project's aim is to investigate the effect of a transdiagnostic, self-guided,&#xD;
      internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy program in waitlist patients with anxiety&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria and are interested in psychotherapy are offered&#xD;
      participation in the study to bridge the waiting time for face-to-face psychotherapy. After&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent, a pre-treatment assessment is conducted. Then, participants are&#xD;
      provided access to velibra, an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy program which they&#xD;
      can work through at their own pace. While velibra is a self-guided program, participants are&#xD;
      supported by study personnel during four assessments at four time points: pre-treatment,&#xD;
      mid-treatment (after the first three velibra modules), post-treatment and at the one-month&#xD;
      follow-up. The investigators expect improvements on the primary as well as the secondary&#xD;
      outcomes. Furthermore, the investigators are interested in studying the acceptability of&#xD;
      velibra and whether positive changes already become observable after the first three modules,&#xD;
      i.e., at the mid-treatment assessment.&#xD;

    <description>Velibra is an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy program developed by GAIA AG. It consists of six modules which are meant to be completed over a span of 6 weeks. The first module educates participants about anxiety and the treatment program. The second module focuses on cognitive techniques for dealing with anxiety. In the third module, relaxation techniques are practiced. The fourth module encourages the participant to practice non-anxious behaviors. In the fifth module, the central topic is the experience of social situations in non-anxious ways. The sixth and final module consists of a summary and recapitulation of the most important content.</description>
