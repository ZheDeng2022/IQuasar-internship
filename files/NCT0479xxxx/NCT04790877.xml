  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to explore the glycemic index and glycemic load&#xD;
      induced by an alcohol-free beer with modified composition (including almost full fermentation&#xD;
      of carbohydrates and the addition of isomaltulose and a resistant maltodextrin), as well as&#xD;
      its postprandial metabolic response, compared to the effect induced by: a) an alcohol-free&#xD;
      beer with a usual composition; b) an alcohol-free beer with modified composition (including&#xD;
      almost full fermentation of carbohydrates and the addition of a resistant maltodextrin). This&#xD;
      study includes two cross-over sub-studies recruiting healthy participants. In the first one,&#xD;
      10 healthy volunteers receive 25 g of carbohydrates coming from: regular alcohol-free beer&#xD;
      (RB), alcohol-free beer with almost completely eliminated maltose and enriched with&#xD;
      isomaltulose (2.5 g/100 mL) and a resistant maltodextrin (0.8 g/100 mL) (IMB), alcohol-free&#xD;
      beer with the same maltose removal enriched with resistant maltodextrin (2.0 g/100 mL) (MB)&#xD;
      and glucose solution. In the second study, 20 healthy volunteers are provided with 50 g of&#xD;
      carbohydrates from white bread and water and the same meal plus 14.3 g of carbohydrates&#xD;
      coming from: RB, IMB, MB and extra white bread. Blood is sampled at baseline and for 2 h,&#xD;
      every 15 min, after ingestion.&#xD;
