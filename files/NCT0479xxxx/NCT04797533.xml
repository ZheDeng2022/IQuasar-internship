      Monitoring of Biologic Signals of Elderly Patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Body Information Management Systems (BIMS) are advanced biological sensors which monitor&#xD;
      human behaviour, activity and basic vital signs. There is a combination of four separate&#xD;
      ultra-sensitive weighing scales attached to each of the individual legs of a hospital bed&#xD;
      measuring:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Micro-changes in weight distribution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activity/sleep pattern&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the bed-based system, there will be a wrist worn wearable (Samsung fit gear)&#xD;
      that will monitor participants when they are both in and out of bed. These are about the size&#xD;
      of a small watch, light weight, water resistant, and will be worn 24/7 by participants. These&#xD;
      measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Movement and sleep&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate The set up will remain flexible throughout the study allowing re-design to&#xD;
           accommodate the needs of participants and staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Devices (BIMS &amp; wearables) have been tested at the UoS (University of Surrey) 'living lab', a&#xD;
      mock 'real world' environment created to test reliability and communication interfacing&#xD;
      between the device, gateway, servers and user interface. The BIMS device itself has been&#xD;
      tested to ensure reliability and sensitivity of measurement and communication of data. As&#xD;
      part of this pilot, further testing of the sensitivity and specificity of the BIMS system&#xD;
      will be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bed sensor system does not have CE certification. MinebeaMitsumi acknowledge and confirm&#xD;
      they retain responsibility for the functionality and safety of the BIMS systems and&#xD;
      associated equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of the present project, the devices are not intended to investigate,&#xD;
      diagnose or treat any disease, injury or condition, thus are not defined as a medical device.&#xD;
      They collect data for informational purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is interested in the quality of the data produced in an inpatient environment,&#xD;
      user experience and workforce impact. The study shall assess the utility of the data in an&#xD;
      inpatient environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Samsung fit gear wearable is a mass produced activity tracker product that has been CE&#xD;
      marked. Twenty of these wearables have been purchased by SABP to be deployed in technology&#xD;
      based projects and are covered by the project's insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.2 The User Interface&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collated via the Internet of Things to a dashboard view (the user interface)&#xD;
      which will be monitored by staff on the ward and the research workers on the ward involved in&#xD;
      this specific project, including the study specific Research Assistant (RA), Research nurse&#xD;
      (RN) and Health Care Assistant (HCA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study progresses, clinical and technical knowledge gained will facilitate the&#xD;
      development of algorithms that may in the future have the potential to inform clinical&#xD;
      decision-making. Actual changes to any care pathway would be beyond the current scope of this&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The User Interface&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part of the research aim is to develop a user interface with which to present the data. This&#xD;
      is likely to take the form of a user interface that shows the relevant bed being monitored&#xD;
      and the relevant biometrics based on changes in weight distribution. Alongside this&#xD;
      representation will be additional data derived from any wearable worn by the patient&#xD;
      occupying that particular bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.3 Deployment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the testing of the devices and data flow has been completed within the UoS living lab,&#xD;
      the devices will be deployed onto the ward. Members of UoS Technical Team will deploy the&#xD;
      devices on the ward and provide any maintenance or trouble-shooting as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mock ward set-ups have been conducted to assess any requirements for changes to the&#xD;
      infrastructure and to ensure risk and safety issues have been considered. As a part of this&#xD;
      process of continual development, electric leads between the devices are being housed within&#xD;
      the structure of the beds, and the device control unit is being secured to the underside or&#xD;
      headboard of the bed so it cannot be removed by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the investigators are in a position to deploy, the Consultant Psychiatrist and Ward&#xD;
      Manager will advise on which patients will be appropriate for the project. Prospective&#xD;
      participants will be informed about the project, provided accessible information, and consent&#xD;
      will be sought. Deployment will occur within 2 weeks of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.4 Reporting Issues&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BIMS system will be configured in such a way so as to send an automatic communication to&#xD;
      the UoS Technical Team when there is a device or data sending issue. User interface issues or&#xD;
      suggested developments will be recorded by the Clinical Project Coordinator, Researcher&#xD;
      Assistant and Ward staff involved in the project, and transferred to the UoS Technical Team&#xD;
      for discussion. There will also be a regular Project Board and Steering Board to update on&#xD;
      progress and address any ongoing issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.5 BIMS Development&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part of the present project is to develop the BIMS systems alongside feedback provided during&#xD;
      the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Machine learning algorithms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Requirements and insights will be provided throughout the project. The clinical team will&#xD;
      review received data and advise the UoS Technical Team on development of algorithms and&#xD;
      Machine Learning to advance the monitoring and alert functionality. Data from initial stages&#xD;
      of the project will facilitate the design of clinically-led and patient/psychiatric&#xD;
      condition-driven algorithms. The main work will focus on developing adaptive Machine Learning&#xD;
      solutions to assist in extracting and identifying changes in health status, associated&#xD;
      patterns and anomalies from the raw data (or pre-processed signals). Over the course of the&#xD;
      project it is hoped that the system will indicate data patterns relevant to specific&#xD;
      conditions, and detect trends and changes using personalised patient specific algorithms.&#xD;
      MinebeaMitsurni will provide the initial signal processing work to UoS, based on prior&#xD;
      testing, and SABP will provide clinical expertise to develop how the data is presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New algorithms will be tested, deployed and refined based on a review of their impact on&#xD;
      understanding of participant presentation and treatment decision-making. Evaluation feedback&#xD;
      will be provided to UoS by clinicians and service users. The research nurse will gather the&#xD;
      data which will be fed back to UoS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where algorithms monitoring certain data fields highlight a change in health status or&#xD;
      activity levels, an alert may present on the user interface to indicate to clinicians a&#xD;
      change has occurred. These alerts, and their associated algorithms, will be continually&#xD;
      developed and refined as the project progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1.7 Naturalistic data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Naturalistic data will be gathered with which to make comparisons with those using the BIMS&#xD;
      technology. This shall comprise of information regarding the average time of ward stays over&#xD;
      the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Service Users will be approached for consent to the study if they are allocated one of the&#xD;
      five beds where devices are installed. They will be given the participant information sheet&#xD;
      and given verbal information about the study and given the opportunity to ask questions. If&#xD;
      they wish to proceed, they will be asked to sign an informed consent form and baseline&#xD;
      information will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the service user allocated to the device bed does not wish to participate in the study,&#xD;
      other service users on the ward will be approached to participate. If another individual&#xD;
      wishes to provide consent for the study, the devices will be moved onto their bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
      A participant may withdraw from the study at any point without giving a reason. They may also&#xD;
      be withdrawn from the study for reasons including, but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Withdrawal of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Serious Adverse events affecting participation in the study. This decision will be made&#xD;
           between the PI, ward staff, monitors and research worker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participant becomes ineligible (see Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Inability to continue participation due to loss of physical capacity&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Participants fail to comply with protocol requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Service users (BIMS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics (including diagnosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HADS - Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (weekly) (Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PSQI - Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Weekly) (Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman &amp; Kupfer,&#xD;
           1989)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HADS is a 14-item scale with 7 questions on anxiety and 7 on depression. A meta- analysis&#xD;
      found it to have good internal consistency for the depression scale and anxiety scale with&#xD;
      mean Cronbach's alphas of .82 and .83 respectively (Bjelland, Dahl, Haug &amp; Neckelmann, 2002).&#xD;
      This scale was chosen as includes both anxiety and depression so negates the need for&#xD;
      separate, longer scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PSQI is a 24-item scale measuring sleep disturbance. It has been shown to have good&#xD;
      test-retest reliability (.87) and good validity (Backhaus, Junghanns, Broocks, Riemann &amp;&#xD;
      Hohagen, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical information will also be gathered to assess the potential impact of the BIMS system&#xD;
      on treatment pathways. This may include medication changes, and severity and progression of&#xD;
      illness. Clinical information will also be collected to help explore the future utility of&#xD;
      the systems in an inpatient environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total length of stay of each participant will be recorded at the point of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the developmental nature of the study, the information gathered at each interview may&#xD;
      vary due to the present requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff will have two main semi-structured interviews, one at the beginning (their expectations&#xD;
      of the devices) and one at the end of the study (their actual experience of the devices).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview schedule at the end of the project is subject to change depending on the&#xD;
      development of the system during the project. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed for&#xD;
      analysis by a member of the sponsors research team. Participants will be informed of this.&#xD;
      Interviews have been chosen as the method of data collection to gain as much depth as&#xD;
      possible in the data which is necessary for the small sample size of the pilot&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to this, staff will be consulted on a fortnightly basis regarding the impact of&#xD;
      the BIMS system. If staff leave their role during the study the final interview will happen&#xD;
      before they leave and their length of time in the study will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chief investigator or an appointed individual will be interviewed on a fortnightly basis&#xD;
      regarding the use of the BIMS on the ward including its use by staff any issues encountered&#xD;
      and any developments that are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the impact on service users and staff the present project also aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the cost of care, resource management and quality of care. This will be derived from&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative analysis on the semi-structured data.&#xD;
