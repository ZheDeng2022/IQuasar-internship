    <textblock>
      The project is a descriptive cohort study with a retrospective and a prospective group where&#xD;
      pregnancy and childbirth data will be studied. Mothers with DM1, DM2, GDM hand-milk 2&#xD;
      times/day from v.36+0, freeze the colostrum they receive and bring it to delivery ward. The&#xD;
      colostrum will then be given instead of milk substitutes for their children postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary questions are whether there is any statistical difference between a group that&#xD;
      provides only colostrum compared to an equal retrospective group, which has only been given&#xD;
      milk substitutes, in the case of neonatal hypoglycemia in the first 24 hours postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly: 10 healthy women and 10women with DM1 will provide analysis of colostrum at week 36&#xD;
      of pregnancy. The secondary question is if there is any differences in colostrum whether the&#xD;
      mother is healthy or has DMtype1&#xD;

      The project is a descriptive cohort study with a retrospective and a prospective group where&#xD;
      pregnancy and childbirth data will be studied. 93 mothers with DM1, DM2, GDM will hand-milk 2&#xD;
      times/day from v.36+0, freeze the colostrum they receive and bring it to delivery ward. The&#xD;
      colostrum will then be given instead of milk substitutes for their children postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: 93 women with DM1, DM2 and medically treated GDM who are patients in specialist&#xD;
      maternity care at Soderhospital in Stockholm, and who plan to hand milk, are the prospective&#xD;
      group. A retrospective group of 93 diabetic women is then selected from 1 April 2021 and back&#xD;
      from the medical database used in the clinic and they represent the retrospective group where&#xD;
      milk substitutes has been given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary question of the study is whether there is any statistical difference between a&#xD;
      group of diabetic newborn that provides only colostrum compared to an equal retrospective&#xD;
      group, which has only given milk substitutes, in the case of neonatal hypoglycemia in the&#xD;
      first 24 hours postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second question in the study is to study the difference in developing sun-treatment-demanding&#xD;
      icterus between the children who received colostrum or milk substitutes first 24h and&#xD;
      possible transfer of them to neonatal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal outcome and background data will be retrieved from the maternal medical files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The woman's diabetes status will also be retrieved: what type of diabetes, duration of&#xD;
      diabetes, blood sugar levels + Hba1c values and possibly treatment (insulin and/or&#xD;
      metformin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery data such as: Labor onset ( spontaneous, induction, cesarean sectio). Progress and&#xD;
      outcome (normal delivery, VE, sectio). Oxytocin stimulation. Pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about the newborn like: - Gestational age at birth. Gender, Height and weight.&#xD;
      Apgar scores at 1', 5' and 10' min. - The child's blood sugar levels during the first 24&#xD;
      hours (at least three occasions). Number of occasions of hypoglycemia in the child in the&#xD;
      first 24 hours (limit value &lt;2.6 mmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bilirubin values and possible sun treatment of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible transfer of the child to the neonatal ward, and its cause,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the child has been fed with milk substitute and if so with what.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the second part of the project, breast milk from 10 of the pregnant women with DM1,&#xD;
      included in the prospective group, as well as 10 pregnant women who do not have diabetes will&#xD;
      be asked for participation in that part of the study aimed to analyzing the content of&#xD;
      colostrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will hand-milk at least 10ml of colostrum at pregnancy weeks 36, 37,&#xD;
      38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and freeze it and she will take all the milk in a freezer-clad cooler when&#xD;
      she goes into childbirth. At postpartum days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, breast milk will also be&#xD;
      collected. After that, the raw milk contains are analyzed on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fats&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proteins&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calories&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carbohydrates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total Solids Any differences between the two groups will be presented in logistical&#xD;
           regressions.&#xD;
