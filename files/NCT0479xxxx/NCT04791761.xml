  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if non-opioid pain control is a safe way to manage&#xD;
      pain after intracapsular adenotonsillectomy surgery in children. This study is the second&#xD;
      part of our randomized clinical trials of assessing pain after adenotonsillectomy (T&amp;A), the&#xD;
      first being total T&amp;A. The investigators will repeat the methodology in the first clinical&#xD;
      trial by randomly assigning children aged 3-17 to one of two groups: one group will receive&#xD;
      non-opioid pain medication only, and the other group will receive opioid and non-opioid&#xD;
      medications for pain control. The investigators will analyze the data and determine if there&#xD;
      is a difference in pain control between the two drug regimens, and if there are any other&#xD;
      associated complications between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is important because if we can demonstrate that there is little difference in&#xD;
      outcomes and pain control between the two groups, a strong argument can be made for reducing&#xD;
      or eliminating opioid prescription after intracapsular adenotonsillectomy. This may protect&#xD;
      future children from the risks of taking opioid medications and help to reduce the scope of&#xD;
      the opioid epidemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To determine if non-opioid pain control is a safe and effective option in the&#xD;
      treatment of post-operative pain following intracapsular adenotonsillectomy in various&#xD;
      pediatric age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The subject population will be patients between the ages of 3 and 17 who will&#xD;
      undergo intracapsular adenotonsillectomy (T&amp;A). Intracapsular versus total T&amp;A technique will&#xD;
      be predetermined by the child's physician and will not be a part of the study. The study will&#xD;
      consist of two unblinded arms - patients receiving standard pain control regimen which&#xD;
      include opioids and non-opioids, and patients receiving non-opioid pain medications only. In&#xD;
      the diary they will receive, patients or caregivers will record frequency of pain medication&#xD;
      taken each day with daily symptoms, a survey, and pain ratings measured by the Wong-Baker&#xD;
      FACES Pain Rating Scale. Within 4-8 weeks post-operatively the patients will return for a&#xD;
      follow up appointment along with their diary. If the patient does not have a follow-up&#xD;
      appointment, the families may return the pain diary by email to the research coordinator or&#xD;
      by mail with the given postage paid envelope. Demographic information such as age, race,&#xD;
      gender, household income will be extracted from the diary and the electronic medical record.&#xD;
      Information such as surgical technique, concurrent operations, post-operative pain&#xD;
      prescription (types, weight based dosage, and total days prescribed) will be extracted from&#xD;
      the electronic medical record and recorded as well. Outcomes measured will include pain scale&#xD;
      rating and rates of complications between the two groups. We will also be investigating&#xD;
      whether or not an opioid disposal pouch helps the process of disposing any leftover opioids&#xD;
      from the trial. We will be providing all patients in the opioid arm an opioid disposal&#xD;
      education document and randomizing half to receive the opioid disposal pouch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: If it can be demonstrated that non-opioid pain control after intracapsular&#xD;
      adenotonsillectomy does not lead to increased pain or worse outcomes in certain pediatric age&#xD;
      groups, a strong argument can be made for the cessation of opioid prescription for these ages&#xD;
      following this technique. Given the widespread opioid epidemic, this would be a significant&#xD;
      step in curbing the massive opioid problem, as well as reducing the adverse effects of opioid&#xD;
      usage in pediatric populations.&#xD;

    <description>Average pain over 14 post-operative days before and after medications. This is quantified using the validated Wong-Baker FACES pain metric. The scale is from 0 to 10 with 10 being worse outcome. Patients receive a take-home pain diary and for 14 days report their maximum pain both before and after taking each pain medication. The mean of these pain ratings will be the primary outcome measure.</description>

    <description>In the take-home pain diary, patients will place an 'x' on each time block every day that medication was given for each of the three medications.

    <time_frame>14 days post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Using the results of the take-home pain diary, we will calculate the average number of days of use of each analgesic for each group. The last day after which there is no subsequent use of analgesic will define the end-point of the duration of use.</description>

    <description>Score assigned by the patient at the end of 14 post-operative days in the take-home pain diary using a 5-point Likert scale of 0 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Patients will respond to the following statement &quot;I am happy with the pain relief I received in the last 14 days&quot; with responses ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree.
