  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry aims is to collect a large number of patients with mild and&#xD;
      moderate asthma in a real-word conditions for a perspective observation of epidemiological&#xD;
      evolution of the disease in relation to the therapeutic interventions available currently and&#xD;
      in the near future.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To represent real-world mild moderate Italian asthmatics, all adults with diagnosed asthma by&#xD;
      specialist, according GINA document, attending respiratory or allergy clinic for a scheduled&#xD;
      visit are eligible for study enrollment. If inclusion/exclusion criteria are satisfied, a&#xD;
      written consent to participate in the study will be obtained and an informative leaflet for&#xD;
      the patient and his/her GPs will be delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects follow up will be scheduled according with GINA document and center plan (6 or 12&#xD;
      months follow up visit).&#xD;
