    <textblock>
      In this phase III study, the primary objective is to test with a one-sided significance of 5%&#xD;
      whether for the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients, brain MRI surveillance&#xD;
      alone is non-inferior in terms of overall survival compared to prophylactic cranial&#xD;
      irradiation (PCI) combined with brain MRI surveillance in the entire study population.&#xD;

      The primary objective is to test with a one-sided significance of 5% whether for the&#xD;
      treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients, brain MRI surveillance alone is&#xD;
      non-inferior in terms of overall survival compared to prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI)&#xD;
      combined with brain MRI surveillance in the entire study population under the treatment&#xD;
      policy strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test with a one-sided type I error of 2.5% whether brain MRI surveillance is superior&#xD;
           in terms of cognitive failure free survival (CFFS) compared to prophylactic cranial&#xD;
           irradiation (PCI) combined with brain MRI surveillance in the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test with a one-sided type I error of 2.5% whether brain MRI surveillance is superior&#xD;
           in terms of global health status/QoL and cognitive functioning according to EORTC&#xD;
           QLQ-C30 questionnaire compared to prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) combined with&#xD;
           brain MRI surveillance in the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities according to CTCAE v5.0 in the two&#xD;
           arms in the treated population (i.e. patients who have started treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare OS and CFFS between the arms within the subgroups of patients with LS and ES&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare OS and CFFS between the arms within the subgroups: HA-PCI or not, first-line&#xD;
           immunotherapy or not, memantine or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare cognitive failure free survival (CFFS) rate at 12 months after randomization&#xD;
           between the arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the cumulative incidence of cognitive failures with death as a competing risk&#xD;
           between the arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare brain-metastasis-free survival (BMFS) between the arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare progression free survival (PFS) between the arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare time to brain-metastasis-attributed death (TBMAD) between the arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare other QoL scales according to EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BN20 questionnaires&#xD;
           between arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of MRI surveillance alone versus MRI surveillance&#xD;
           combined with PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect blood for biobanking.&#xD;

             be safely treated with definitive radiation doses. Excludes T3-4 due to multiple lung&#xD;
             nodules that are too extensive or have tumour/nodal volume that is too large to be&#xD;
             encompassed in a tolerable radiation plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ES SCLC: Stage IV (T any, N any, M 1a/b), or T3-4 due to multiple lung nodules that&#xD;
             are too extensive or have tumour/nodal volume that is too large to be encompassed in a&#xD;
             tolerable radiation plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed standard therapy prior to randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with LS-SCLC, this includes a combination of 4-6 cycles of platinum-based&#xD;
             doublet chemotherapy and either definitive thoracic radiotherapy (including SBRT for&#xD;
             early-stage T1-2 N0 M0 disease who do not undergo surgery) or definitive surgical&#xD;
             resection; thoracic radiation in addition to definitive surgical resection is allowed&#xD;
             at the discretion of the treating physician, but is not mandated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with ES-SCLC, this includes 4-6 cycles of platinum-based doublet&#xD;
             chemotherapy either with or without thoracic radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             o Immunotherapy concurrent with and/or adjuvant to standard therapy is allowed at the&#xD;
             discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of progressive disease after completed standard therapy on systemic imaging&#xD;
             (computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis&#xD;
             and brain MRI), 28 days before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease after completed standard therapy&#xD;
             on systemic imaging (computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of&#xD;
             Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis and brain MRI), within 28 days before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Interval from day 1 of last cycle of chemotherapy to randomization of â‰¤8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG PS â‰¤ 2&#xD;

          -  Estimated creatinine clearance â‰¥ 30 mL/min as calculated using the MDRD formula&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 3 days prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: women of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal females capable of&#xD;
        becoming pregnant (i.e. females who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months,&#xD;
        with the exception of those who had prior hysterectomy). However, women who have been&#xD;
        amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if&#xD;
        the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antioestrogens, low body weight,&#xD;
        ovarian suppression or other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients Women of childbearing / reproductive potential should use adequate birth&#xD;
             control measures, as defined by the investigator, during the entire period of the&#xD;
             radiotherapy treatment study participation and for at least 30 days after the last&#xD;
             dose of radiotherapy. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as a&#xD;
             method which results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used&#xD;
             consistently and correctly. Such methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with&#xD;
             inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral,&#xD;
             injectable, implantable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Vasectomized partner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexual abstinence (the reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in&#xD;
             relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
             of the patient)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects who are breast feeding should discontinue nursing prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of radiotherapy and during the entire period of the radiotherapy treatmentuntil&#xD;
             30 days after the administration of the last dose of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study&#xD;
             including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow&#xD;
