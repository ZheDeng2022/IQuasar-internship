  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abionic SA has developed a novel point-of-care (POC) platform, the abioSCOPE, and an in vitro&#xD;
      diagnostic kit for the quantification of the pancreatic stone protein (PSP) to be analyzed&#xD;
      specifically with the abioSCOPEÂ® device. This test is intended to be used to aid in the early&#xD;
      recognition of sepsis. The test is extremely easy to use and has a total turnaround time of&#xD;
      approximately 8 minutes. This test uses only 30 microliters of K2/K3-EDTA anticoagulated&#xD;
      whole blood or plasma. Results are quantitative (ng/ml). The product is for Investigational&#xD;
      Use Only in the US and bears CE-marking. It is commercially available in selected European&#xD;
      and non-European countries. The test has also been clinically validated in a multicentric,&#xD;
      prospective, observational study performed (AB-PSP-001, clinicaltrials.gov identifier&#xD;
      NCT03474809).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goals of this study are to evaluate certain analytical performances components of&#xD;
      this product in a point-of-care environment, in particular the precision, sample type&#xD;
      comparability and specimen stability of the product. Such data will support regulatory filing&#xD;
      of a US FDA 510(k) premarket notification file and of a European IVD Regulation technical&#xD;
      file to continue product commercialization in 2022, when this novel regulation will be&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;
