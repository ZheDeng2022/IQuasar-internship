  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators propose to study pediatric subjects who are diagnosed with cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      (CF) and patients with non-CF bronchiectasis, with the goal of developing markers of CF lung&#xD;
      disease severity, progression, and therapy response. The Investigator's central hypothesis is&#xD;
      that image-based markers can forecast pathophysiology prior to spirometric changes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: Validate functional imaging markers in CF patients with normal spirometry but&#xD;
      abnormal ventilation. The Investigators hypothesize imaging phenotype can predict lung&#xD;
      function decline, even in CF patients with normal spirometry. The Investigators will test&#xD;
      this hypothesis by performing annual HP 129Xe ventilation MRI in a cohort of CF patients of&#xD;
      which a subset has normal FEV1 (≥85% predicted) at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Determine the sensitivity and specificity of early structural remodeling in&#xD;
      CF lung disease. The Investigator's preliminary studies show that imaging markers of&#xD;
      structural lung remodeling can be measured via radiation-free MRI (as opposed to x-ray CT).&#xD;
      We assess the sensitivity to identify subjects with irreversible remodeling by performing&#xD;
      serial ultra-short UTE MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first arm (Aims 1 &amp; 2) Up to 50 subjects will be recruited-approximately 25 with&#xD;
      normal FEV1 (&gt;85% predicted) and 25 with mild to moderate disease. All subjects will be asked&#xD;
      to undergo longitudinal (i.e., approximately annually) 129Xe and UTE MRI, spirometry, and&#xD;
      lung clearance index (LCI) measurement. If possible, studies will be coordinated with&#xD;
      clinical visits to maximize recruitment and retention. Up to 50 age and sex matched control&#xD;
      subjects (i.e., subjects with no known cardiopulmonary disorders) may also be recruited to&#xD;
      provide a reference data set from healthy subjects for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults, including CCHMC employees) and children &gt;5 years old may be recruited as&#xD;
      needed for MRI sequence development and validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second arm (Aim 3), 50 CF patients with bronchiectasis and 50 with non-CF&#xD;
      bronchiectasis will be recruited from patients already undergoing clinical bronchoscopies.&#xD;
      Before bronchoscopy, subjects will undergo UTE. BAL will be obtained from radiologically&#xD;
      normal areas and regions with abnormalities. (Note, image-guided sampling from multiple sites&#xD;
      is routine practice at CCHMC in patients with CF and non-CF bronchiectasis. As such, the&#xD;
      proposed studies will not alter the sampling pattern in a clinically significant way or&#xD;
      increase procedure time, and will thus add no patient risk.) Clinical BAL will be collected&#xD;
      from these regions, and small aliquots (~500 µL) will be stored separately for proteomics.&#xD;
      The remaining fluid will be pooled and submitted for routine clinical testing, with ~500 µL&#xD;
      reserved for pooled proteomics. The Investigators will recruit ~10 subjects/yr from both CF&#xD;
      and non-CF groups, who will be followed annually with UTE and proteomic analysis that will be&#xD;
      collected under Dr. Ziady's companion protocol, titled Proteomic biomarkers of CF disease and&#xD;
      non-CF bronchiectasis to measure prognostic markers of disease-in particular of persistent&#xD;
      bronchiectasis. For all subjects, clinical data (e.g., age, gender, CF genotype,&#xD;
      microbiology, therapies-including CFTR modulators-and exacerbation frequency) will be&#xD;
      captured in a REDcap database.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will be scanned on a commercial 3T whole-body MRI scanner equipped with high-performance gradient systems. Natural isotopic abundance or isotopically-enriched xenon gas (~86% 129Xe, Linde Inc.) will be used for all studies. Subjects will be positioned supine in the scanner with a 129Xe RF coil around their chests. Using conventional proton MRI and a breath-hold acquisition, &quot;scout&quot; images will be obtained to localize the subject for subsequent 129Xe acquisitions. 129Xe images will be acquired using the same breath-hold maneuver and a pulse sequence, covering the entire lung (acquisition time &lt;10 s, approximately 3-mm in-plane resolution, 15-mm slice thickness or less). Additional scans (sequences) may be performed. A maximum of 4 doses of 129Xe will be given throughout the study following the calibration dose.</description>
