      Design A multi-centre pilot study investigating the acceptability and adherence of a&#xD;
      prehabilitation on patients requiring abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting 3 NHS Hospital Vascular Surgery Clinics in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mid and South Essex NHS Trust&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population Patients referred to secondary/tertiary vascular clinic for the repair of&#xD;
      asymptomatic infrarenal Aneurysm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (conducted face-to-face): After providing written informed consent, participants&#xD;
      will be provided with information about the prehabilitation programme. The following data&#xD;
      will also be collected: baseline demographic characteristics (including age, sex and&#xD;
      ethnicity), body mass index (BMI), medical history (including time since diagnosis), current&#xD;
      medication, aneurysm diameter, health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS), smoking&#xD;
      status and psychological wellbeing (using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS)&#xD;
      and Frailty assessments( QMortality Index, Electronic Frailty Index, Rockall score).&#xD;
      Participants will also complete a 6-minute walking test(6MWT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 1 to 5 (conducted remotely via telephone, email or completion of an online survey):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The programme has been developed with experts in the field of sports therapy, physiotherapy&#xD;
      and biomechanics, based on robust literature in other fields. The course plan is to start&#xD;
      with 3 sessions every week for 6 weeks where participants would complete a tailored home&#xD;
      exercise programme or until the expected surgical intervention. In the first week of this&#xD;
      programme, the patient will receive three sessions with a total of 150 minutes of exercise&#xD;
      according to UK Chief Medical Officers' Physical Activity Guidelines. After each week, we&#xD;
      will assess patient tolerance to the exercise regime using Borg scale. We will either&#xD;
      increase or decrease exercise intensity according to their feedback. We will also be&#xD;
      assessing patients' preference for how and when they would like to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Programme (conducted remotely via telephone, email or completion of an online survey):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by a member of the study team for the reassessment of&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, psychological wellbeing and smoking status. Participants will&#xD;
      also be required to provide their self-reported weight. On admission for surgery, they will&#xD;
      be assessed for frailty using frailty score assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post - Operative Morbidity score(POMS) will be assessed during admission ( Day1, Day 3, Day&#xD;
      5, Day 7, etc) after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge: (conducted either remotely or face to face):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a reassessment of health-related quality of life, disease-specific&#xD;
      quality of life, psychological wellbeing and smoking status. Participants will also complete&#xD;
      the 6-MWT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 weeks post-surgery (conducted remotely or face-to-face): Participants will complete a&#xD;
      reassessment of health-related quality of life, disease-specific quality of life,&#xD;
      psychological wellbeing and smoking status. Participants will also complete the 6-MWT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      90-days post-surgery (conducted remotely or face-to-face): Participants will complete&#xD;
      reassessment of health-related quality of life, disease-specific quality of life,&#xD;
      psychological wellbeing and smoking status. Participants will also complete the 6-MWT.&#xD;
      Participants will also complete a frailty assessment score (Rockall)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments Standard national and local practice will be followed for the repair of&#xD;
      infra-renal aortic aneurysm. Patients will receive any type of repair as decided by the local&#xD;
      Vascular Multi-Disciplinary Team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Prehabilitation Programme compliance, attendance and acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In-Hospital Complication Rate - Composite of Cardiac, Respiratory, Renal, Haemorrhage,&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Length of stay and readmission rates (30 days post-surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30-day Composite Outcome: Death and Defined complication (Cardiac, respiratory,&#xD;
           haemorrhage, limb ischaemia, renal failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) at end of programme, Discharge, 6-weeks (Post&#xD;
           discharge) and 3 months (Post Discharge)&#xD;

           questionnaire [EQ-5D] and visual analogue scale [EQ-VAS]) at end of programme,&#xD;
           Discharge, 6-weeks (Post discharge) and 3 months (Post Discharge)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-Operative Morbidity score (POMS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in aneurysm specific quality of life scores at end of programme, Discharge,&#xD;
           6-weeks (Post discharge) and 3 months (Post Discharge)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS) at 6-weeks post enrolment and 30&#xD;
           and 90-days post-surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in cigarettes per day at 6-weeks post enrolment and 30 and 90-days&#xD;
           post-surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in weight (in kg) 6-weeks post enrolment and 30 and 90-days post-surgery&#xD;
