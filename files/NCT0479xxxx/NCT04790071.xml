  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The myofascial trigger point is an overlooked issue in hemiplegic shoulder pain. Our aim in&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate whether dry needling treatment contributes to the conventional&#xD;
      treatment approach.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in visual analog scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It grades pain of the patients between 0 and 10 points. Higher scores represent a worse outcome</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder range of motion of the patients is evaluated in abduction, flexion, and external rotation. Higher measurements represent a better outcome</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quick The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Questionnaire score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Quick DASH is an 11-item measure of the magnitude of disability and symptoms specific to the upper extremity. The first 6 items measure the degree of difficulty in performing various physical activities because of a shoulder, arm, and hand problem, and the other 5 items related to quality of sleeping, social activities, and daily activities, and the intensity of pain and numbness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FM scale is a 226-point multi-item Likert-type scale developed as an evaluative measure of recovery from hemiplegic stroke. It is divided into 5 domains: motor function, sensory function, balance, joint range of motion, and joint pain. Each domain contains multiple items, each scored on a 3-point ordinal scale (0 = cannot perform, 1 = performs partially, 2 = performs fully).</description>
