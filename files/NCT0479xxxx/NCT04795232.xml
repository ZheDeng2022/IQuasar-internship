  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at investigating the recovery kinetics of skeletal muscle damage,&#xD;
      neuromuscular fatigue and performance following a single change of direction (COD) training&#xD;
      session in competitive soccer players. The impact of COD degrees will be also examined by&#xD;
      comparing a 45o vs. 90o COD training session. Ten male soccer players will perform a COD45 [A&#xD;
      single training session including 2x(10x ~27.6m) sprints with two 45o COD in each sprint], a&#xD;
      COD90 [A single training session including 2x(10x ~21.2m) sprints with two 90o COD in each&#xD;
      sprint] and a Control trial (No intervention included, only daily measurements) in&#xD;
      randomized, repeated measures, crossover design. Assessments related to skeletal muscle&#xD;
      damage, neuromuscular fatigue and performance will be performed prior to training session and&#xD;
      daily for three consecutive days post-training, in each trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ten male soccer players will be included in this study. Participants will be initially&#xD;
      informed about the aim of study as well as the associated risks and benefits and subsequently&#xD;
      will provide their signed consent form. At baseline, they will undergo assessment of their&#xD;
      anthropometrics (i.e. body mass and body height), body composition (by DXA), physical&#xD;
      conditioning status [maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), Yo-Yo Intermittent Endurance test&#xD;
      level 2 and Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery test level 2] and daily dietary intake. Thereafter,&#xD;
      they will participate in two experimental trials and one control trial in a randomized,&#xD;
      crossover, repeated measures design: i) COD45: Participants in this trial will perform a COD&#xD;
      training session consisted of 2 sets of 10 x ~27.6m sprints with two 45o COD in each sprint&#xD;
      and a resting period of 16 sec and 2:20 min between sprints and sets, respectively, ii)&#xD;
      COD90: Participants in this trial will perform a COD training session consisted of 2 sets of&#xD;
      10 x ~21.2m sprints with two 90o COD in each sprint and a resting period of 16 sec and 2:20&#xD;
      min between sprints and sets, respectively, iii) Control: Participants in this trial will&#xD;
      only participate in daily assessments to control for day to day variability in the depended&#xD;
      variables (they will not receive any intervention). Prior to each trial, participants will&#xD;
      provide a resting blood sample (for the determination of blood lactate, white blood cell&#xD;
      count and creatine kinase activity) and undergo assessment of their delayed onset of muscle&#xD;
      soreness (DOMS), maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), countermovement jump [will&#xD;
      be assessed using two force platforms at 1000 Hz and electromyography instrumentation (EMG)],&#xD;
      isokinetic peak torque of knee extensors and flexors (will be assessed on an isokinetic&#xD;
      dynamometer), agility (will be assessed using the Illinois test), 10m and 30m sprint time&#xD;
      (will be assessed by using light cells) and repeated sprint ability (5x30m sprints will be&#xD;
      performed with 25 sec rest in-between). In COD45 and COD90 experimental trials, a blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected immediately post-training for the determination of blood lactate&#xD;
      concentration while assessment of DOMS, MVIC and countermovement jump will be performed at 1,&#xD;
      2 and 3 hours post-training. In all trials assessment of DOMS, MVIC, countermovement jump&#xD;
      (CMJ), isokinetic peak torque, agility and sprinting performance as well as determination of&#xD;
      creatine kinase activity and white blood cell count will be performed at 24, 48 and 72 hours&#xD;
      post-training. A 7-day wash out period will applied between trials.&#xD;
