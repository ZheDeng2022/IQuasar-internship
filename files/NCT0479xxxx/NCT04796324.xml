  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to investigate anti-tumor effect of ixabepilone in patients with locally&#xD;
      recurrent or metastatic breast cancer (mBC) selected by the Ixabepilone DRP after failure of&#xD;
      an anthracycline and taxanes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be screened with the Ixabepilone DRP. If the tumor tissue has a DRP( Dose&#xD;
      Response Prediction) score of &gt;67% the patient can be included in the clinical study.&#xD;
      Ixabepilone 40 mg/m2 is administered as a 3-h intravenous infusion Day 1 in a 3-week cycle.&#xD;
