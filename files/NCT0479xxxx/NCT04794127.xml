      This is a phase 2 study conducted in two sequential stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first stage is an Italian single institution, single arm, pilot study, aimed at exploring&#xD;
      the activity of the combination T and P in myxoid liposarcoma patients who achieved a stable&#xD;
      disease after a minimum of 4 cycles of T alone. If a minimum required activity will be&#xD;
      demonstrated from the first stage, the second stage of the study will be conducted;otherwise,&#xD;
      the study will be stopped. The second stage is an Italian open-label, multicenter,&#xD;
      randomized, double arm, phase II trial, aimed at evaluating the combination of T and P in&#xD;
      myxoid liposarcoma and G1 or G2 dedifferentiated liposarcomas compared to the standard&#xD;
      treatment with T alone. Patients will be randomized with a 1:1 ratio to treatments arms as&#xD;
      specified below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control arm (A): T alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental arm (B): T in combination with P&#xD;

      In the specific the first stage will be an Italian mono-institutional, single arm, pilot&#xD;
      study exploring the activity of the combination of T and P in myxoid liposarcoma patients who&#xD;
      achieved a stable disease after a minimum of 4 cycles of T alone. If a minimum required&#xD;
      activity will be demonstrated from the first stage, the second stage of the study will be&#xD;
      conducted; otherwise, the study will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second stage will be an Italian multicenter, open-label, randomized, double arm, phase II&#xD;
      trial, aimed at evaluating the combination of T and P in myxoid liposarcoma and G1 or G2&#xD;
      dedifferentiated liposarcomas compared to the standard treatment. Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      by a centralized computer system with a 1:1 ratio to one of the following two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control arm (A): T alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental arm (B): T in combination with P The pilot study will be conducted in Italy&#xD;
           at Istituto Nazionale Tumori Milano in order to recruit 10 evaluable patients. The&#xD;
           second stage will be conducted in approximately 10 italian centers in order to recruit&#xD;
           80 evaluable patients.&#xD;

Since Trabectedin has no cumulative toxicities, and Pioglitazone as well, the combination will be administered until progressive disease, major toxicity, patient's intolerance or unwillingness to continue treatment, or medical decision by the responsible physician.</description>
