  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HCC is the most common malignant liver tumor for which liver transplantation is one of the&#xD;
      pivotal curative treatments. The best possible selection of patients who are candidates for&#xD;
      transplantation is essential in the current context of a shortage of transplants. Performing&#xD;
      a PET CT scan is not currently recommended in the pre-liver transplant workup for HCC.&#xD;
      However, PET CT using in a complementary manner the FDG and Choline tracers appears promising&#xD;
      in the management of HCC in view of its wide use in oncology and its major diagnostic and&#xD;
      prognostic contribution compared to conventional imaging. In order to address this issue, a&#xD;
      prospective cohort study including patients from the University Hospital of Rouen and Lille&#xD;
      with hepatocellular carcinoma meeting the criteria for indication of liver transplantation&#xD;
      validated in SPC will be set up, the main objective of which will be to assess the&#xD;
      decision-making contribution of PET TDM FDG and Choline in addition to conventional imaging&#xD;
      in the pre-transplant assessment.&#xD;
