  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucocorticoids are the cornerstone treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica but induce adverse&#xD;
      events. The efficacy of the candidate drug tofacitinib has not yet been demonstrated in&#xD;
      controlled studies. The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib&#xD;
      as a glucocorticoid sparing agent in patients with refractory polymyalgia rheumatica.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A two-stage, phase 2 clinical trial was conducted to test whether tofacitinib would take into&#xD;
      effect as a glucocorticoid sparing agent in patients with refractory polymyalgia rheumatica.&#xD;
      Tofacitinib was given at the dose of 10mg daily through the 24 weeks. Patients were to&#xD;
      receive prednisone in a dosage of 15mg daily (or equivalent) at baseline and decreased to&#xD;
      10mg daily at week 2. The PMR-AS was determined every two weeks; if ≤10, the prednisone&#xD;
      dosage was decreased by 2.5 mg every two weeks; and if &gt;17 the dosage was increased to&#xD;
      previous dosage; if 10≤PMR-AS ≤17, the dosage was maintained at previous stable dose. The&#xD;
      primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving sustained low disease activity&#xD;
      (PMR-AS&lt;7) with GC independence (prednisone≤2.5mg daily or equivalent) for 4 weeks before&#xD;
      week 24.&#xD;

Participants are required not to discuss their treatment regimen with physicians at each visit. The success of the blind method will be judged by requiring the assessors to determine the therapy of participants after each visit. When the database is locked, the statistician will carry on the data analysis in the hidden of therapy.</masking_description>

    <description>The Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (MHAQ), reduced the number of items from 20 in the original HAQ to eight, and improved the feasibility in clinical practice when screening patients. The MHAQ score is calculated as the mean of the scores for each activity. Total score is between 0.0-3.0, in 0.125 increments. Higher scores indicate worse function and greater disability. MHAQ scores &lt;0.3 are considered normal.</description>
