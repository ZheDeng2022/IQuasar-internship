      Aim To evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of a hyaluronan (HY) as adjunct to&#xD;
      scaling and root planning of residual pockets during supportive periodontal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods Sixty-six chronic periodontitis, that have completed the active phase of&#xD;
      treatment and are enrolled in a supportive periodontal therapy scheme, with 4 to 8&#xD;
      interproximal sites with PD ≥ 5 mm &lt; 8 mm and presence of BoP at the revaluation examination&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to the test (HY containing gel) or control group. Immediately after&#xD;
      debridement of the residual pockets the test gel (GUM® Afta Clear Gel, Sunstar) will be&#xD;
      applied into the experimental sites by the operator. Further, the participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to apply at the experimental sites the test gel supragingivally with an&#xD;
      interdental brush (TePe, Malmö, Sweden), once per day after tooth brushing for the first 3&#xD;
      months. Subgingival gel application will be repeated at the 3-month control in persistent&#xD;
      pockets (i.e. PD ≥ 5mm + BoP). CAL, PD, BoP, and presence of plaque will be evaluated at&#xD;
      baseline and thereafter every 3 months (i.e., after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Further,&#xD;
      subgingival microbiological samples will be collected from the 4 experimental sites at&#xD;
      baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Nine periodontal pathogens (Aggregatibacter&#xD;
      actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola,&#xD;
      Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Parvimonas micra, Campylobacter rectus,&#xD;
      Eikenella corrodens), total bacterial load, and amount of Candida albicans will be determined&#xD;
      quantitatively by real-time PCR.&#xD;

      Aim The aim of this project is to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of a HY&#xD;
      as adjunct to scaling and root planning of residual pockets during supportive periodontal&#xD;
      therapy. The primary hypothesis is that application of HY as adjunct to debridement of&#xD;
      residual pockets in chronic periodontitis patients results in a significantly higher number&#xD;
      of sites with reduced risk for further disease progression (i.e. attachment loss) after&#xD;
      debridement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Hyaluronan (HY) is a naturally occurring high molecular weight glycosaminoglycan&#xD;
      present in various body fluids and tissues, and shows bacteriostatic, fungistatic,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, anti-oedematous, osteoinductive, and pro-angiogenetic properties. A&#xD;
      recently published systematic review (Bertl et al. 2015a) of controlled studies on the use of&#xD;
      HY in non-surgical and surgical periodontal treatment showed that HY as adjunct to&#xD;
      non-surgical and/or surgical periodontal therapy that HY has a positive, albeit moderate,&#xD;
      effect in favour of in terms of BOP and residual PD, compared to controls. However, due to&#xD;
      large heterogeneity of included studies, no recommendations on the mode of application or the&#xD;
      effect size of HY as adjunct to non-surgical and surgical periodontal treatment could be&#xD;
      made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods Sixty-six chronic periodontitis, that have completed the active phase of&#xD;
      treatment and are enrolled in a supportive periodontal therapy scheme, with 4 to 8&#xD;
      interproximal sites with PD ≥ 5 mm &lt; 8 mm and presence of BoP at the revaluation examination&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to the test (HY containing gel) or control group. Immediately after&#xD;
      debridement of the residual pockets the test gel (GUM® Afta Clear Gel, Sunstar) will be&#xD;
      applied into the experimental sites by the operator. Further, the participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to apply at the experimental sites the test gel supragingivally with an&#xD;
      interdental brush (TePe, Malmö, Sweden), once per day after tooth brushing for the first 3&#xD;
      months. Subgingival gel application will be repeated at the 3-month control in persistent&#xD;
      pockets (i.e. PD ≥ 5mm + BoP). CAL, PD, BoP, and presence of plaque will be evaluated at&#xD;
      baseline and thereafter every 3 months (i.e., after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, subgingival microbiological samples will be collected from the 4 experimental sites&#xD;
      at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Nine periodontal pathogens (Aggregatibacter&#xD;
      actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola,&#xD;
      Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Parvimonas micra, Campylobacter rectus,&#xD;
      Eikenella corrodens), total bacterial load, and amount of Candida albicans will be determined&#xD;
      quantitatively by real-time PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance So far any possible beneficial effect of HY containing products in the treatment&#xD;
      of residual pockets during supportive periodontal treatment has not been assessed. It seems&#xD;
      relevant to assess whether the positive effect of HY when applied as adjunct to scaling and&#xD;
      root planning of residual pockets during supportive periodontal therapy, may reduce the risk&#xD;
      for further disease progression and/or the need for periodontal surgery, compared to&#xD;
      debridement alone.&#xD;
