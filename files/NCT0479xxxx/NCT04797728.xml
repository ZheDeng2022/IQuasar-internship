    <textblock>
      ELIPSE is a window of opportunity, prospective, multicenter, phase 0 trial which evaluates&#xD;
      the effect of Elacestrant on proliferation after 4 weeks of treatment in postmenopausal women&#xD;
      with Estrogen Receptor-positive (ER+) and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-negative&#xD;
      (HER2-negative) early breast cancer (BC) amenable to surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis is that Elacestrant induces a significant proliferative arrest (Ki67 ≤&#xD;
      2.7%) in ER+ and HER2-negative BC naïve to Endocrine Therapy (ET). To test this hypothesis, a&#xD;
      total of 24 patients will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will include correlative molecular and histological analyses at the&#xD;
      tumor tissue, changes in Ki67 and the identification of molecular biomarkers and gene&#xD;
      signatures of response to Elacestrant. Molecular analysis of tumor circulating DNA (ctDNA) in&#xD;
      blood will be also performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists of postmenopausal women with cT1c-3 (minimal 15 mm of largest&#xD;
      diameter) cN0 cM0, ER+ and HER2-negative breast operable tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who fulfil all eligibility criteria will then start treatment in Elacestrant&#xD;
      monotherapy cohort as follows: Elacestrant continuously at 400 mg given orally (PO), once a&#xD;
      day, in a continuous schedule (QD). After 4 weeks (+/- 2 days) of Elacestrant treatment,&#xD;
      surgery will be performed in accordance to local practice. If the tumor is not surgically&#xD;
      removed after 4 weeks (+/-3 days), a tumor biopsy will be obtained. In this case, patients&#xD;
      may continue further neoadjuvant treatment under physicians' criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two biopsies of the same lesion will be mandatory: first the screening sample and second the&#xD;
      surgical sample. A core biopsy will be collected if surgery is not performed for any reason.&#xD;
      Complete Cell Cycle Arrest (CCCA) (determined by Ki67 ≤ 2.7%) and relative changes in the&#xD;
      PAM50 subtypes in tumor samples will be analyzed at baseline and after 4-weeks of Elacestrant&#xD;
      therapy at central laboratory. Ki67 status at baseline will be performed at local sites for&#xD;
      inclusion criteria (Ki67 at diagnostic ≥10%). Extensive RNA-based and blood analyses will be&#xD;
      performed in tumor specimens at the same timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include the incidence, nature, and severity of Adverse Events (AEs)&#xD;
      and laboratory abnormalities graded per the NCI CTCAE v.5.0&#xD;
