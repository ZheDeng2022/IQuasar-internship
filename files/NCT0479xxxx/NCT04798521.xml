  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to test the efficacy of a peer-facilitated telemedicine HCV&#xD;
      treatment implementation strategy for people who use drugs versus local HCV treatment&#xD;
      referral for achieving HCV sustained viral response at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-blinded, randomized controlled trial. In-depth qualitative interviews assess attitudes&#xD;
      and barriers to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, potential participants will be pulled from a convenience sample at a Portland&#xD;
      clinic providing care for the urban area. An initial target sample of 100 Hepatitis C&#xD;
      positive participants will be enrolled for DBS validation. Power will be reassessed based on&#xD;
      feedback from receiver operating curve model and additional participants enrolled up to a&#xD;
      total of 100 Hepatitis C Positive participants, if necessary. A total of 500 potential&#xD;
      participants can be screened expecting 1 in every 4 participants will be positive HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2, rural peer care coordinators (PCCs) and research assistants recruit up to 200&#xD;
      PWUD participants from high-needs rural Oregon counties. Study staff specifically target&#xD;
      untreated populations recruited from local syringe exchange programs and direct community&#xD;
      outreach (e.g. community barbeques, parks, homeless shelters, food pantries, etc.).&#xD;
      Participants are encouraged to refer others for study screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of up to 40 study participants will complete in-depth qualitative interviews&#xD;
      regarding their experiences of hepatitis C treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Participants allocated to telemedicine intervention arm are scheduled for treatment assessment by a study clinician. For a majority of participants, this will also be the treatment initiation visit. If additional studies are necessary for routine treatment decision making, peers will assist participants in navigating health system barriers and arrangement of second telemedicine visit.</description>

    <description>Participants allocated to the community linkage-to-care arm will complete screening, be offered enrollment, and undergo informed consent as in the telemedicine arm. Following study inclusion and enrollment, research staff will refer the participant to a local community health clinic to engage in hepatitis C care and seek treatment.</description>

    <description>Patients will be prescribed HCV medication treatment for 4 weeks at a time. The study pharmacist will check in with the participant by telephone or telemedicine visit at week 0, week 4, and end of treatment to 1) determine general medication tolerance, 2) assess quality of adherence and 3) dispense medications. Peers will assist participants in keeping telehealth appointments and navigating medication pick up or storage. HCV labs will be repeated at 12 weeks post end of treatment and results will be relayed to the participant in the SVR12 follow up visit with the research assistant, along with follow up surveys. Those successfully achieving SVR12 will be counseled on ongoing harm reduction methods. Those showing persistent HCV viremia at 12 weeks post treatment will be referred to community-based HCV treatment providers for treatment re-initiation.</description>
