    <textblock>
      This project will promote the development of transdisciplinary analyses. Neuropsychological&#xD;
      disorders will be explored with the usual appropriate tests done by psychologists and&#xD;
      neuropsychologists regularly involved in the management of sickle cell disease affected&#xD;
      children. For the social sciences' component, various methods will be used: Measure of the&#xD;
      Life habits (MHAVIE), Measure of Environmental Quality (MQE) and semi-guided interviews will&#xD;
      complete the collection of qualitative data. The expected results concern the identification&#xD;
      of the barriers or facilitators the sickle cell patients might face in their social&#xD;
      participation, whether they are affected or not by neurological disorders.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sickle cell anaemia, which is the most frequent genetic disease in France, requires an early&#xD;
      and optimal care to reduce its morbidity and mortality. Children with sickle cell anaemia who&#xD;
      are significantly anaemic may present neurological complications including stroke with or&#xD;
      without clinical signs. A major risk associated to these strokes is the impairment of the&#xD;
      general intellectual ability and learning ability, essentially resulting from&#xD;
      neuropsychological disorders affecting intellectual functioning, executive and attentional&#xD;
      functions. Although the negative impact of sickle cell anemia on the quality of life of the&#xD;
      affected children and adolescents is well documented, no study has been focused on the role&#xD;
      played by the neurocognitive disorders on their social participation. The objective of this&#xD;
      project is the assessment of the influence of neurocognitive disorders in the social&#xD;
      participation of children and adolescent with sickle cell anemia (6 to 16 years old),&#xD;
      followed in Guadeloupe. This project will promote the development of transdisciplinary&#xD;
      analyses. Neuropsychological disorders will be explored with the usual appropriate tests done&#xD;
      by psychologists and neuropsychologists regularly involved in the management of sickle cell&#xD;
      disease affected children. For the social sciences' component, various methods will be used:&#xD;
      Measure of the Life habits (MHAVIE), Measure of Environmental Quality (MQE) and semi-guided&#xD;
      interviews will complete the collection of qualitative data. The expected results concern the&#xD;
      identification of the barriers or facilitators the sickle cell patients might face in their&#xD;
      social participation, whether they are affected or not by neurological disorders&#xD;
