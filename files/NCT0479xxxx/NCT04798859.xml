  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with acquired brain injury (ABI) often struggle with complex impairments, including&#xD;
      cognitive (such as memory and attention), social, emotional and behavioral challenges. There&#xD;
      is a lack of evidence-based knowledge about rehabilitation for children with ABI in the&#xD;
      chronic phase. The current study, the CICI Study, is a randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      directed towards children with ABI and their families in the chronic phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in close collaboration with schools and local health care&#xD;
      providers. The CICI Study focuses on the child's and parents' individually identified target&#xD;
      outcome areas and rehabilitation goals. The intervention aims to enhance everyday functioning&#xD;
      in the home and school environment by attaining rehabilitation goals in areas noted as&#xD;
      challenging by the participants. The efficacy of the CICI-intervention will be measured in&#xD;
      terms of goal attainment, burden of brain injury related symptoms, parenting self-efficacy,&#xD;
      unmet health care needs, as well as several aspects of child, parent and family functioning.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is considerable knowledge about how to help children with ABI during the first, acute&#xD;
      and post-acute stages. Yet, impairments are often long lasting and, due to the vulnerability&#xD;
      of children's developing brain, new problems may emerge or become increasingly problematic&#xD;
      over time. Children with ABI may struggle at school and with peers, which can lead to or&#xD;
      increase emotional difficulties, and reduce quality of life, affecting the children and their&#xD;
      families. The local communities and the children's schools are, together with the families,&#xD;
      often left responsible for dealing with the chronic challenges of pABI. Parents may&#xD;
      experience considerable stress and develop emotional symptoms when a child suffers an ABI. As&#xD;
      a result, the entire family may experience impaired functioning, which in turn may affect the&#xD;
      long-term prognosis of the child with ABI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty families will be included in the study: 40 in the intervention group and 40 in the&#xD;
      control group. The children will have a clinical ABI diagnosis, verified injury related&#xD;
      intracranial abnormalities, and be at least one year post injury at inclusion. The children&#xD;
      and/or their families must report enduring cognitive, emotional, social or physical&#xD;
      challenges related to the brain injury. The intervention will be conducted in collaboration&#xD;
      with the children's families, schools and their local health care providers. It consists of&#xD;
      individualized goal-oriented strategies adapted to the home- and school-setting. Goal&#xD;
      attainment scaling will be applied. In addition, psychoeducation will be provided to the&#xD;
      family and school/local care providers on topics related to the child's injury. A parent&#xD;
      group session will be held for discussions and knowledge transfer concerning family&#xD;
      challenges after pABI, such as communication skills and parenting. The intervention will&#xD;
      include 7 individualized meetings with the family (7 sessions whereof most will be&#xD;
      videoconferences, but with the possibility of 1-2 of the sessions being home visits), one&#xD;
      parent group seminar and 4 sessions with school and local health care providers during a&#xD;
      period of 4-5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be conducted at baseline (T1), at the end of the intervention (T2, 4-5&#xD;
      months after inclusion) and one year after inclusion (T3). Baseline assessment includes a&#xD;
      brief neuropsychological assessment of the children in addition to the outcome measures at T2&#xD;
      and T3. Outcome assessors will ble blinded to group allocation. Primary outcomes are change&#xD;
      in parent-reported brain injury symptoms of the children and change in parenting&#xD;
      self-efficacy. Secondary outcomes include change in child-rated severity of brain injury&#xD;
      symptoms, change in unmet healthcare needs of the family, change in children's executive&#xD;
      functioning in the home and school environment as assessed by parents, children and teachers,&#xD;
      change in children's quality of life assessed by parents and children, change in family&#xD;
      functioning, change in caregiver emotional symptoms, an evaluation of the intervention&#xD;
      completed by parents, children and teachers in the intervention group, change in the&#xD;
      perceived severity of the individually defined target outcome areas completed by children and&#xD;
      parents, and change in goal attainment scaling in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of this study will contribute to enhanced clinical expertise within&#xD;
      pABI-rehabilitation on a specialist health care level, and will also be relevant for a wide&#xD;
      array of health care professionals in the community as well as the educational system and&#xD;
      parents of children with ABI.&#xD;
