  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if a person with weakness or paralysis in one or&#xD;
      both arms, can use the NuroSleeve combined powered arm brace (orthosis) and muscle&#xD;
      stimulation system to help restore movement in one arm sufficient to perform daily&#xD;
      activities. This study could lead to the development of a product that could allow people&#xD;
      with arm weakness or arm paralysis to use the NuroSleeve and similar devices to improve arm&#xD;
      health and independent function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People can develop arm weakness due to stroke and other neurological conditions. Portable&#xD;
      powered braces and functional electrical stimulation can help restore functional arm movement&#xD;
      in these individuals. Powered braces and muscle stimulation may be triggered by detecting&#xD;
      movement or electrical activity of proximal muscles that the person still can control. The&#xD;
      overall objective of this study is to establish that children and adults with chronic, stable&#xD;
      neurological motor impairment can achieve voluntary control over the NuroSleeve myoelectric&#xD;
      elbow-wrist-hand orthosis, that incorporates optional functional electrical stimulation, and&#xD;
      that they can use this voluntary control to perform functionally beneficial tasks to enhance&#xD;
      independence, mental and physical health. While myoelectric prostheses have been studied for&#xD;
      decades in children with limb loss, it is necessary to gather pilot data on the use of&#xD;
      orthoses with optional electrical stimulation in people with intact yet paralyzed limbs.&#xD;
      These adults and children have persistent motor deficits even after intensive physical and&#xD;
      occupational therapy. The NuroSleeve and similar devices could help all people who have arm&#xD;
      weakness.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Canadian Occupational Performance Measure score at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is an individualized measure designed for use by occupational therapists to detect self-perceived change in occupational performance problems over time. From Law et al., 2000.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) score at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) measures specific changes in the arm function in people who sustained cerebral damage resulting in arm weakness. The ARAT consists of 19 items grouped into four subscales: grasp, grip, pinch and gross movements. Each sub scale has items ordered according to ascending difficulty: 0- can not perform any part of the test, 1- performs the test partialy, 2- completes the test, but takes abnormally long time, 3- performs the test normally. The sum of all subscales are added to compute the total score. The total score ranges between 0 to 57. The higher score is considered to be better outcome.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ABILHAND-Kids questionnaire was developed as a measure of manual ability and explores the most representative inventory of manual activities. The 21 items of ABILHAND-Kids defined a valid and reliable manual ability scale.</description>

    <measure>Change in Box and Blocks score at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The experimented counts how many uniformly sized cubes that can be moved from one half of an opened wooden box, over a partition to the other half of the opened box the participant can move in one minute, This measure reflects dexterity, grasp strength, ability to release, and speed of movement and will be performed while the participant is using the NuroSleeve.
