      The LALGFA2019 Recommendations redefine the standard risk criteria and propose to introduce&#xD;
      anthracycline induction in so-called high-risk forms (LAL line T and LAL line B with&#xD;
      leukocytosis greater than or equal to 50 G/L or in children less than 1 year of age or more&#xD;
      than 10 years of age) as well as Endoxan and Methotrexate in high dose consolidation.&#xD;

      A few studies conducted in developing countries confirm that it is possible to significantly&#xD;
      improve the prognosis of children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) provided that the&#xD;
      centres can benefit from a precise and adapted protocol and logistical support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GFAOP has been working with units for the past 20 years and this is the second study put&#xD;
      in place by the group for the treatment of LAL. The initial study was a feasibility study&#xD;
      with the treatment of standard risk LAL. This study GFALAL2019 aims to include both standard&#xD;
      and high-risk forms of LAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study it is hoped to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ensure the feasibility of these recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To show that the correct application of the therapeutic recommendations will result in a&#xD;
           complete remission rate (CR) close to 85% at the end of the induction treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The survival without relapse of patients in RC will be close to 65% at 5 years.&#xD;
