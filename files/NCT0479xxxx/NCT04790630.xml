  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine if computerized administered cognitive fitness&#xD;
      activities will improve thinking and depression in older depressed adults who are being&#xD;
      treated with antidepressants. The investigators are also interested in whether participating&#xD;
      in the treatment will result in changes to brain activity measured with magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depression in the elderly is both challenging to treat and detrimental to the cognitive&#xD;
      functioning of patients. Major depression increases the probability of a later dementia&#xD;
      diagnosis. By targeting cognitive processes in treatment, the investigators hope to both find&#xD;
      a more effective means to manage major depression in older adults, but also demonstrate how&#xD;
      top-down processes (e.g., Executive Control Network) may be driving depression and cognitive&#xD;
      decline in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are recruiting older adults with and without mild cognitive impairment. All&#xD;
      subjects must have at least mild depressive symptoms to be eligible to participate. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of two different interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of this study will help the investigators understand the mechanisms that contribute&#xD;
      to depressed mood and cognitive change in older adults with late life depression.&#xD;
