  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see how well an experimental freeze dried plasma&#xD;
      product, known as FDP, works to reverse the anticoagulation effects of a prescription&#xD;
      medication called warfarin sodium (warfarin) compared to a licensed and routinely used plasma&#xD;
      product known as fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The study hypothesis is that FDP is not inferior&#xD;
      to FFP when used for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects are required to undergo a minimum of 4 plasmapheresis procedures,&#xD;
      generating approximately 2,400 mL. Half will be used as FFP and half will be manufactured&#xD;
      into FDP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive a total of 6 autologous units (approximately 1,620 mL) of plasma&#xD;
      product over the course of 2 infusion visits (approximately 810 mL per infusion visit) with a&#xD;
      14 day washout period between infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Warfarin will be administered to each subject prior to each infusion visit. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to a treatment arm at their first warfarin administration visit leading up to the&#xD;
      first infusion. This establishes the sequence of the plasma products to be infused across the&#xD;
      2 infusion visits. Those randomized to receive 3 units of FDP (approximately 810 mL) at the&#xD;
      first infusion visit will receive the equivalent dose of FFP at their second infusion visit&#xD;
      and vice versa for those randomized to receive 3 units of FFP at the first infusion visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDP and FFP will be infused intravenously.&#xD;
