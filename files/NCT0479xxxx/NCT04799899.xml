  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to establish, in a pilot RCT (approx. N=50 participants) with a&#xD;
      time- and attention-matched health enhancement control, (a) the feasibility of the&#xD;
      recruitment procedures (screening, eligibility, enrollment rates), and feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the (b) MBCT and control interventions (adherence, retention, fidelity,&#xD;
      satisfaction, group videoconferencing delivery) and (c) data collection procedures by group&#xD;
      (adherence, satisfaction). Hypothesis 1a: Recruitment will be feasible as evidenced by&#xD;
      screening, eligibility, and enrollment rates; (1b) the MBCT and control interventions and&#xD;
      (1c) data collection procedures in both groups will be feasible and acceptable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study will employ an open pilot RCT with a time-and-attention-matched health&#xD;
      control group to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a virtual, MBCT intervention&#xD;
      for ACS patients. The investigators plan to enroll approximately N=50 participants (approx. 3&#xD;
      MBCT groups and approx. 3 health enhancement control groups with approximately 6-7&#xD;
      participants per group; accounting for 20% attrition). Participants will be randomized to a&#xD;
      MBCT or a time- and attention-matched health enhancement control in a 1:1 design using a&#xD;
      random number generator. Participants will then be stratified by antidepressant medication&#xD;
      use. The MBCT intervention will involve 8 virtually-delivered MBCT sessions (approximately&#xD;
      1.5 hours each), during which participants will be taught how to use evidence-based&#xD;
      mindfulness skills to regulate distress and choose healthy behaviors, as well as learn about&#xD;
      cardiac health. The health enhancement control group will follow the same structure of the&#xD;
      MBCT intervention (e.g., 8 virtually-delivered MBCT sessions, approximately 1.5 hours each)&#xD;
      and will educate participants on depression and cardiac health (e.g., relationship between&#xD;
      depression and cardiac health, cardiac risk factors, cardiac health behaviors, finding&#xD;
      resources for mental health care). Participants will be asked to complete a brief survey&#xD;
      following each session. Within one week before and after the intervention and 3-months&#xD;
      post-intervention participants will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires and&#xD;
      provide self-collected blood samples. Upon completion of the intervention participants will&#xD;
      complete an audio-or video recorded exit interview (approximately 30-60 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited through EPIC, the hospital's clinical data registry,&#xD;
      advertisements (e.g., flyers, brochures) placed throughout the hospital, direct provider&#xD;
      referrals, and from inpatient cardiac units. Patients who express interest in the study will&#xD;
      be asked complete an eligibility screening. Eligible patients agreeable with study&#xD;
      participation will then complete informed consent with study staff prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in either one of three MBCT intervention cohorts (approx.) or&#xD;
      one of three health enhancement control cohorts (approx.). Participants in all of these&#xD;
      groups will be expected to participate in 8-weekly, 1.5-hour virtual sessions. Participants&#xD;
      in the MBCT intervention group will be expected to participate in 30 minutes of at-home daily&#xD;
      practice. Participants in the health enhancement control group will be expected to review&#xD;
      educational videos or readings between sessions. A licensed mental health provider (e.g.,&#xD;
      LICSW, PhD) trained in the MBCT protocol will delivered the intervention to the MBCT&#xD;
      intervention group. A licensed clinician or pre-doctoral or post-doctoral fellow with&#xD;
      supervision from a licensed clinician will lead the control group. Both the MBCT intervention&#xD;
      and health enhancement control groups will be delivered via Zoom, secure, HIPPA-compliant&#xD;
      video-conferencing software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study assessments will include a battery of self-report surveys administered at baseline,&#xD;
      post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up; session satisfaction surveys administered after&#xD;
      each intervention session; post-intervention individual exit interviews (conducted via&#xD;
      telephone or videoconference); blood spot samples self-collected by participants at baseline,&#xD;
      post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up (submitted to the research team via paper mail);&#xD;
      and, for the MBCT-intervention group, home practice logs submitted between each intervention&#xD;
      session. Primary outcomes for the intervention are feasibility and acceptability. Exploratory&#xD;
      outcomes are changes in emotional and biological variables. Data collected from this study&#xD;
      will generate knowledge about e-health technologies and congruent research methods to apply&#xD;
      to other mind-body interventions and patient populations.&#xD;
