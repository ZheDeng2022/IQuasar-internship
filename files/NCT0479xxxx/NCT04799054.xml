  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TransCon TLR7/8 Agonist is an investigational drug being developed for treatment of locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This Phase 1/2 study will evaluate TransCon TLR7/8&#xD;
      Agonist as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab in dose escalation and dose&#xD;
      expansion. Participants will receive intratumoral (IT) injection of TransCon TLR7/8 Agonist&#xD;
      every cycle. The primary objectives are to evaluate safety and tolerability, and define the&#xD;
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of TransCon TLR7/8 Agonist&#xD;
      alone or in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that play a key role in innate immune cell&#xD;
      recognition of foreign pathogens, stimulating innate and adaptive immune responses. TransCon&#xD;
      TLR7/8 Agonist is designed as a long-acting localized delivery prodrug of resiquimod, a&#xD;
      potent toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist, with the potential to prolong high local&#xD;
      concentrations of resiquimod and promote potent anti-tumoral responses while reducing&#xD;
      systemic drug exposure and related adverse events. TransCon TLR7/8 Agonist is expected to&#xD;
      stimulate innate and adaptive immune response in the tumor microenvironment and enhance the&#xD;
      activity of checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab.&#xD;
