  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized controlled clinical study to be conducted in the Department of Pediatric&#xD;
      Dentistry of the International University of Catalonia (UIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study and data collection will be obtained by the second year students of the&#xD;
      master's degree in Pediatric Dentistry. All of them will receive the same practical and&#xD;
      theoretical training on the treatment to be performed, and will be calibrated by the&#xD;
      principal investigator. The procedure and the data obtained will be reviewed by a trained&#xD;
      investigator and blinded with the type of procedure used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children from 4 to 8 years old will be selected to visit the Clinica Universitaria de&#xD;
      Odontología (CUO) with the master's degree in Pediatric Dentistry. A sample of 60 children&#xD;
      will be taken. There will be three study groups, where 20 subjects will be assigned to each,&#xD;
      estimating a follow-up loss ratio of 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient is selected, they will be assigned to one of the groups in order of arrival.&#xD;
      For example, patient one will be assigned in group 1, patient two in group 2, patient three&#xD;
      in group 3 and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 study groups groups: Group 1, with Manual instrumentation with K files (Dentsply&#xD;
      Caulk, Milfors, DE, USA); group 2, with the VDW.ROTATETM (VDW, Munich, Germany); and group 3,&#xD;
      with Reciproc® Blue (RCP, VDW, Munich, Germany) system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preliminary clinical and radiographic examination with periapical radiographs will be&#xD;
      performed. To anesthetize the tooth, the student will use topical anesthesia (Urricaine gel,&#xD;
      Clarben SA Laboratories) and local anesthesia with articaine 4% 1:200,000 epinephrine&#xD;
      (Ultracaine; Normon S.A., Madrid, Spain) using a lower alveolar nerve block. The student will&#xD;
      work with absolute isolation with rubber dam. The cavities will be removed with a high-speed&#xD;
      diamond ball cutter and once the operator are inside the pulp chamber, will continue to&#xD;
      remove the coronal pulp with a endo-Z cutter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operator will determine the working length (LT) with the Gold Reciproc motor (VDW,&#xD;
      Munich, Germany), using K #15 file. LT is to be determined it at 1 mm less than what the&#xD;
      locator indicates due to the physiological reabsorptions present in the tooth. Each group&#xD;
      will be instrumented according to the manufacturer's instructions, explained above. The duct&#xD;
      permeability will be ensured with K #10 file with between files and at the end of the&#xD;
      instrumentation. The duct irrigation was carried out with 5ml of 2,5% NaOCl in each duct and&#xD;
      a side outlet needle. In the case of group 3, which is a single lime system, the operator&#xD;
      will take into account that the irrigation must be similar to that of the other systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the instrumentation is finished,the elapsed time will be recorded from the beginning to&#xD;
      the end of the instrumentation with the disinfection of the appropriate irrigant. The&#xD;
      operator will record the minutes and seconds evaluated with an analog stopwatch. The ducts&#xD;
      will be dried with sterile paper tips and place the sealing material, calcium hydroxide with&#xD;
      iodophormic paste (Vitapex; Neo Dental International Inc., Federal Way, WA, USA). The sealing&#xD;
      material will be placed with the applicator tip that comes with the product and at the end we&#xD;
      will compact the sealing with a cotton ball in the chamber. The application material&#xD;
      procedure will be carried out in this way, to know if the success of the sealing depends on&#xD;
      the system of files used. The tooth will remain with a temporary Eugenol Zinc Oxide (IRM;&#xD;
      Dentsply Caulk, Milfors, DE, USA) filler until the next visit, which will be a week later, to&#xD;
      place a stainless steel crown (3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) cemented with glass ionomer cement&#xD;
      (Ktac-Cem;3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To finish the treatment, a periapical radiography will be done to the patient. With the final&#xD;
      periapical radiography, a researcher blinded to the study groups, will evaluate the quality&#xD;
      and quantity of the seal without the need for auxiliary elements such as léntulos or files.&#xD;
      The filling will be evaluated if it's optimal, under-filled, over-filled or with the presence&#xD;
      of gaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the patient's anxiety during dental treatment, the operator will use a pulse&#xD;
      oximeter (digital Onyx, NONIN, Plymouth, MN, USA). The child's heart rate will be evaluated&#xD;
      in the following moments: 3 min before the application of topical anesthesia, at the topical&#xD;
      anesthesia aplication, during the application of the local anesthetic, when the rubber dam is&#xD;
      placed, during the instrumentation and removal of coronal pulp tissue, during the&#xD;
      instrumentation with each file system, and finally when the rubber dam is removed. The&#xD;
      average heart rate will be determined for each period by a set of values in a period of 1&#xD;
      minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the treatment the operator will evaluate the behavior of the child with the&#xD;
      Frankl scale where 1 is very uncooperative and 4 is very collaborative; and will see if it is&#xD;
      similar to the behavior of previous visits with conservative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the ease of operation, a numerical scale from 0 to 10 is will be used, where 0&#xD;
      means very easy to use and 10 very difficult. It will be taken into account that if there are&#xD;
      more than one operator, they have the same acquired skills and the same familiarity with the&#xD;
      file systems used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the evaluation of postoperative pain, that same day the patient's parents will be given a&#xD;
      questionnaire where the parents will have to write down at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours and a week&#xD;
      later, the pain felt. The pain will be evaluated with the Wong-Baker scale because facial&#xD;
      scales are usually easier for the pediatric patient. All patients will be given a 2% junifen&#xD;
      prescription with a weight-appropriate dose in case of postoperative pain. Parents will be&#xD;
      advised that the prescription should only be used in cases of more severe pain, and will need&#xD;
      to be noted on the data collection sheet. When these patients need taking medication, the&#xD;
      marked value at the Wong-Baker station will not be taken into account. It will be noted that&#xD;
      they are patients who have required medication. The operator will collect the data a week,&#xD;
      coinciding with the stainless steel crown placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data obtained from the patients participating in the study will be recorded in two&#xD;
      sheets: One for the operator, where the age, sex, the assigned study group, and all the&#xD;
      variables studied will be recorded: instrumentation time, filler quality, operator's ease,&#xD;
      behavior and anxiety of the patient; The other sheet will be for parents to record at home&#xD;
      the postoperative pain felt by the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be caried out with Statgraphics Plus 5.1 version and Microsoft&#xD;
      Excel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An absolute and relative frequency shall be used in categorical variables to describe the&#xD;
      data. For the numerical variables the mean and standard deviation or median and first and&#xD;
      third quartile will be used, depending on whether the data is parametric or not. To be able&#xD;
      to make comparisons between files, the Chi-square T will be used for categorical variables&#xD;
      and the T-student or Mann Whitney test for numerical variables. The SHAPIRO WILKS contrast&#xD;
      will be used to compare the normality of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, a 95% confidence interval is to be taken into account, taking as&#xD;
      statistically significant reference a p value ≤ 0.05.&#xD;
