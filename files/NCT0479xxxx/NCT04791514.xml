    <description>Participants will be administered a single dose of trepreostinil palmitil inhalation powder (TPIP). The first participant will be administered TPIP 112.5 μg. Dose levels for subsequent participants will be determined based on information collected for the previous participant(s) by a Safety Review Committee.&#xD;
An optional extended-use period for 16 weeks will be available to participants who have completed the core, single-dose period.</description>
