    <textblock>
      This study plans to enroll 10 patients aged 13-17 years of age with refractory perianal&#xD;
      fistulizing disease. Patients will be treated by direct injection to the fistula tract(s)&#xD;
      with 75 million allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells at baseline and again&#xD;
      after 3 months if not completely healed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic transmural inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract, continues to increase in incidence for unknown reasons. According to population based&#xD;
      studies, at least 26% of patients with CD will develop perianal fistulas in the first two&#xD;
      decades following diagnosis, particularly those with colonic and rectal involvement. These&#xD;
      patients experience significant morbidity due to pain, persistent drainage, recurrent&#xD;
      perianal sepsis, and ongoing need to access medical care resulting in increased costs and&#xD;
      impaired quality of life. Onset of Crohn's disease in childhood is associated with even more&#xD;
      aggressive perianal fistula development, with fistulas occurring in as many as 20-31% of&#xD;
      children within 5-7 years after Crohn's disease diagnosis. Based on national estimates of&#xD;
      pediatric Crohn's disease prevalence, this suggests that there are more than 10,000 children&#xD;
      with perianal fistulas due to Crohn's disease in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to enroll 10 patients (aged 13-17 years) with refractory perianal&#xD;
      fistulizing disease. The next step in management for these patients would be a mucosal tissue&#xD;
      flap, temporary stoma, or proctectomy with permanent ostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated by direct injection of 75 million allogeneic bone marrow derived&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells at baseline and again after 3 months if not completely healed.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for a total of 12 months post initial injection.&#xD;
