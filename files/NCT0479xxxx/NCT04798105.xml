  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to investigate whether tDCS has an effect on reward and punishment learning&#xD;
      sensitivity. Further, whether tDCS will modulate extraversion and impulsivity personality&#xD;
      traits, and eye-blink-rate's effect on learning. For instance, trait extroversion in past&#xD;
      research is linked to the dopamine neurotransmitter system, where it is thought that extreme&#xD;
      low and high levels are detrimental to cognitive performance. Since tDCS has been shown to&#xD;
      increase dopamine levels, it is thought that people who are already high in dopamine may&#xD;
      experience less benefit (or even impairment) on cognitive performance following tDCS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a non-invasive, low intensity and risk,&#xD;
      brain stimulation technique known as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the&#xD;
      way people learn in a computer administered cognitive task. This will be achieved by&#xD;
      comparing participants' performance on this task after receiving placebo 'sham' tDCS in one&#xD;
      experimental session, and real 'treatment' tDCS in another experimental session. Neither the&#xD;
      researcher administering the session or the participant will be aware of which form of tDCS&#xD;
      is being used. Previous research indicates that tDCS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex brain region stimulates the release of a chemical neurotransmitter, dopamine, that is&#xD;
      linked to reward and punishment processing, and implicated in conditions such as addiction&#xD;
      and Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computerized cognitive learning task presents participants with pairs of six different&#xD;
      symbols and asks them to choose one of these. In the first half of the task, participants&#xD;
      receive visual feedback (correct or incorrect; +$0.10 or -$0.10) and the symbols are&#xD;
      preprogrammed to be rewarded or punished for. In the second part of the task, participants&#xD;
      are tested on the same task but do not receive feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, the effect of participants' personality characteristics (specifically extraversion&#xD;
      and impulsivity), as well as eye-blink-rate, on cognitive learning performance will be&#xD;
      investigated, as this is known to be influenced by tDCS. Past research suggests that people&#xD;
      may respond differently to tDCS based on individual differences in these personality traits,&#xD;
      that are linked at a brain circuits level. Participants will be assessed on extraversion and&#xD;
      impulsivity personality traits using pen and paper, self-report questionnaires. Similarly,&#xD;
      eye-blink-rate is linked to the aforementioned brain neurotransmitter, dopamine, and will be&#xD;
      assessed by manually counting of blinks in a video recording of the participant focusing on a&#xD;
      stationary point.&#xD;
