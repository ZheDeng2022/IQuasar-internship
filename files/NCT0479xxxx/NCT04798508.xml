  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluating the neurologic prognosis in disorders of consciousness (DOC) patients is still a&#xD;
      crucial issue in intensive care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurophysiology allows the investigators to record cerebral responses of patients to auditory&#xD;
      stimuli and in particularly to their own name. Numerous studies try to improve the relevance&#xD;
      of the auditory stimuli used in this paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here the investigators assess if the use of own name stimuli uttered by more expressive&#xD;
      voices (for example smiling voices) modulates the cerebral responses recorded. They then&#xD;
      correlate these cerebral responses to the neurologic prognosis at three months.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Late auditory evoked potentials (as P3 wave) are used in neurophysiology to assess the level&#xD;
      of consciousness in DOC (disorder of consciousness) patients. The P3 wave, elicited by&#xD;
      listening standard and deviant stimuli, corresponds to the activation of a frontoparietal&#xD;
      network and is considered to reflect a cognitive attention task. Using the own name of the&#xD;
      patient as deviant stimuli improve the ability to detect the P3 wave because of the&#xD;
      particularly relevance of this stimulus for the patient. However the correlation of this P3&#xD;
      wave and neurologic prognosis is still imperfect and depends on the etiology of the DOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In human cognition, to identify the expressivity valence of a voice is essential. Neural&#xD;
      processing of expressive voices involves more widespread brain areas than neutral voices&#xD;
      processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here the investigators assume that using own name stimuli uttered by more expressive voices&#xD;
      (positive : smiling voice or negative : rough voice) should recruit more widespread brain&#xD;
      areas and modulate the cerebral responses recorded. The investigators then evaluate if these&#xD;
      cerebral responses are relevant markers of consciousness and correlate them to neurologic&#xD;
      prognosis at three months.&#xD;
