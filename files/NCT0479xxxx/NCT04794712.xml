  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic venous insufficiency occurs when your leg veins don't allow blood to flow back up to&#xD;
      your heart. Normally, the valves in your veins make sure that blood flows toward your heart.&#xD;
      But when these valves don't work well, blood can also flow backwards. This can cause blood to&#xD;
      collect (pool) in the legs. Chronic venous disease is a highly prevalent condition in the&#xD;
      general population, and it has a significant impact on quality of life. While it is usually&#xD;
      manifested by obvious signs, such as varicose veins and venous ulcers, other symptoms of the&#xD;
      disease are less specific. Among the other symptoms, which include heaviness, swelling,&#xD;
      muscle cramps and restless legs, pain is the symptom that most frequently compels CVeD&#xD;
      patients to seek medical aid. However, there is a substantial discrepancy between pain&#xD;
      severity and clinically detectable signs of CVeD, questioned by several opposing studies.&#xD;
      Further evaluation is needed to clarify this subject, and to analyse whether pain development&#xD;
      predicts objective tool to evaluate pain by dosflexin exercise pre surgery and post and&#xD;
      measure the severity of pain by heat stimulation . General management of CVeD starts with&#xD;
      advising lifestyle . pain in chronic venous insufficiency it will measure before and after&#xD;
      treatment by using contact heat evoked potential (CHEPS) and visual dialog scale ( VAS ) to&#xD;
      estimate the pain intensity the severity of the pain before the patient do exercise before&#xD;
      three moths of leaser endovenous ablation procedure . 2-photo-plethysomography Non invasive&#xD;
      technique , pp sensor emit infrared light detects changes in reflection from epiderma layer .&#xD;
      Vessels full of blood reflect 10 times less than without blood . On dorsiflexion - pressure&#xD;
      drops, increasing reflection in the measuring window Venous assessment the venous refill&#xD;
      time, is shorter and typically less than 20 s&#xD;

      The study will have no interventional procedures. Participants who will be attending for&#xD;
      routine Ultrasound scan for assessment of venous insufficiency , assessment evaluation of&#xD;
      pain and participants meets our study's inclusion criteria will be provided with full&#xD;
      research information, if they decide to participate. Once the routine assessment is done.&#xD;
      Ultrasound will be performed to obtain the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      the RT (second), the PRV (cm/s) and the flow at peak reflux(mL/s) . photo plethysmography&#xD;
      (PPG) can be used to measure the severity of the venous reflux disease time (RT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, if advanced ultrasound applications can promise a precise, cost-effective,&#xD;
      convenient, and repeatable results for the follow-up of CVI , it would be of an extreme&#xD;
      benefit to use ultrasound scan diagnoses anatomy of lower limb for Chronic venous&#xD;
      insufficiency patients rather than PPG . photoplethysmography : the non-invasive technique of&#xD;
      assessing pressure without a needle .&#xD;
&#xD;
      assessment evaluation of pain CHEPS (contact heat evoked potentials ): a beneficial objective&#xD;
      tool to measure small nerve fibre function CHEPS provides a clinically practical,&#xD;
      non-invasive and objective measure, .Therefore heat pulses could be annoying for the patient&#xD;
      .and it is cost effectetive machine and require a special training .&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAS visual analogue scale :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective tool to measure the intensity of chronic and acute pain.some of this tool issue is&#xD;
      a sensitive tool to use by patients and there is some changes in pain intensities because it&#xD;
      is little variable&#xD;
