    <textblock>
      Managing the hydration status in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a key task&#xD;
      for nephrologists in Thailand that is made difficult due to lack of timely access to&#xD;
      hydration metrics including weight, blood pressure, and ultrafiltration volume. This research&#xD;
      project aims to improve the monitoring of hydration status in PD patients from a bimonthly,&#xD;
      in-clinic review of a handwritten log-book to a smart phone based app (CKD-PD) with digitized&#xD;
      data that allows for near real time monitoring hydration abnormalities, thereby creating the&#xD;
      opportunity for earlier treatment of overhydration. The investigators hypothesize that use of&#xD;
      the CKD-PD will improve early treatment of overhydration, and potentially reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of complications, hospitalizations, and mortality in PD patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of patients in Thailand with end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis (PD)&#xD;
      is growing rapidly. Thai nephrologists have identified a critical gap in the current&#xD;
      management of PD patients: a lack of timely information about fluid (hydration) status. Real&#xD;
      time access to this information creates the opportunity for the early treatment of&#xD;
      overhydration - the most common cause of complications and hospitalization in this&#xD;
      population. Early treatment of overhydration in PD patients can decrease the incidence of&#xD;
      complications, improve quality of life, and decrease health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project aims to improve the monitoring of fluid status in PD patients from a&#xD;
      bimonthly, in-clinic review of handwritten log books to a smart phone based app (&quot;CKD-PD&quot;)&#xD;
      with digitized data. This allows for near real time data visualization, hydration status&#xD;
      monitoring, outlier notifications, and more timely treatment interventions for overhydration.&#xD;
      Data from home monitoring equipment to transferred to the CKD-PD app. Hydration metrics are&#xD;
      uploaded to &quot;CKDNET&quot; (Chronic Kidney Disease NorthEast Thailand) database in the Thai Care&#xD;
      Cloud - Thailand's national health database, merging patient collected data with hospital and&#xD;
      clinic records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine if use of the CKD-PD app can improve early&#xD;
      treatment of overhydration in PD patients. The investigators will conduct a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial comparing the incidence of clinical interventions for treatment of&#xD;
      overhydration. PD patients from 3 facilities in Northeast Thailand - Srinagarind Hospital at&#xD;
      Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen Hospital and Chaiyaphum Hospital - (N=200) will be randomized&#xD;
      into two groups - one using the CKD-PD app, and one receiving usual management. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be the incidence of clinical intervention to treat overhydration as an&#xD;
      intermediate outcome related to the secondary outcomes: complications, hospitalizations, and&#xD;
      mortality related to fluid overload.&#xD;
