      The rationale for the interventional, open-label, single-arm design of JZP258-401 is to&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical experience in participants with narcolepsy transitioning treatment from&#xD;
      Xyrem to XYWAV.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant must be 18 to 80 years of age (inclusive), at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent. Type of Participant and Disease Characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants who have a primary diagnosis of Type 1 or Type 2 narcolepsy that meets&#xD;
             ICSD-3 criteria or DSM-5 criteria (Ruoff and Rye 2016), and are being currently&#xD;
             treated with Xyrem, with or without additional anticataplectics or stimulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants who have been taking Xyrem (with or without additional anticataplectics&#xD;
             or stimulants eg, TCA, SNRI, SSRI, atomoxetine) in a stable dose and regimen for at&#xD;
             least two months prior to screening, with evidence of clinical improvement on their&#xD;
             current regimen, per the investigator's judgement. Only Xyrem will be substituted with&#xD;
             XYWAV, with dose and regimen of any concomitant anticataplectics or stimulants&#xD;
             remaining unchanged throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Sex and Contraceptive/Barrier Requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant is male or female&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Is a woman of non-childbearing potential (WONCBP) as defined in Appendix 3&#xD;
                       OR&#xD;

                       failure rate of &lt; 1% per year), preferably with low user dependency, as&#xD;
                       described in Appendix 3, during the study Intervention period and for at&#xD;
                       least 7 days after the last dose of study intervention. The investigator&#xD;
                       should evaluate the potential for contraceptive method failure (eg,&#xD;
                       noncompliance, recently initiated) in relationship to the first dose of&#xD;
                       study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test (serum) during&#xD;

                  early undetected pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
