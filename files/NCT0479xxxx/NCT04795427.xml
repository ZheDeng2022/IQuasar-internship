      The purpose of this Chinese bridging study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetics of asciminib versus best available therapy in Chinese patients with&#xD;
      Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in chronic phase, previously treated with 2 or more tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase inhibitors to support related indication registration in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the Major Molecular Response (MMR) rate of&#xD;
      asciminib treatment at 24 weeks.&#xD;

      The purpose of this Chinese bridging study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetics (PK) of asciminib versus best available therapy (BAT) in Chinese&#xD;
      patients with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP), previously treated with&#xD;
      2 or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to support related indication registration in&#xD;
      China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll the participants 1) who failed their most recent TKI therapy by&#xD;
      meeting the definition of treatment failure as per the 2013 European Leukemia Net (ELN)&#xD;
      guidelines, or 2) who were intolerant to the most recent TKI therapy and must have BCR-ABL1&#xD;
      ratio &gt; 0.1% IS at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized into asciminib arm or the BAT arm on a 2:1 ratio, to&#xD;
      receive asciminib treatment (continuous 40 mg BID) or BAT from Day 1 until the end of study&#xD;
      treatment period defined as 96 weeks after the last participant receives the first dose.&#xD;
