  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seventeen United States Veterans die by suicide each day. Nearly three-fourths of those&#xD;
      Veterans die from firearm injury or poisoning, and many seek care in VA Emergency Departments&#xD;
      (ED) prior to suicide attempts. In 2019, the VA began screening all Veterans seeking ED care&#xD;
      for increased suicide risk. Interventions that promote firearm and medication safety are&#xD;
      recommended for Veterans identified as at-risk. The investigators work will provide important&#xD;
      information that will aid the development and testing of such an intervention for Veterans&#xD;
      who seek care in VA EDs. The investigators will interview at-risk Veterans who recently&#xD;
      sought VA ED care to identify factors relevant to developing the intervention, and work with&#xD;
      Veterans and VA healthcare staff to develop and test an intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Veterans will be recruited from the Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center (RMRVAMC) ED&#xD;
      who are identified as having elevated suicide risk by VHA's new suicide risk screening&#xD;
      initiative. All Veterans visiting VHA EDs are screened using an eight-item version of the&#xD;
      Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Screener, a valid predictor of future&#xD;
      suicidal behavior. The C-SSRS Screener assesses suicide risk using eight items about recent&#xD;
      suicidal ideation and intent, preparatory behaviors, and action. Deductive and inductive&#xD;
      content analysis of qualitative interviews will occur in parallel with recruitment, and&#xD;
      participants will be recruited until thematic saturation is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Veterans' visits (approx. 90 minutes) will be scheduled at their preferred times at RMRVAMC&#xD;
      within two weeks of discharge from the ED. Sociodemographic and military service data will be&#xD;
      collected using the Rocky Mountain Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center&#xD;
      (MIRECC) Demographics Survey. During this visit, individuals will participate in qualitative&#xD;
      interviews to identify contextual factors that may inform development of VA-based lethal&#xD;
      means safety interventions.&#xD;
