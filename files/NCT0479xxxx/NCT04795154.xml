  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a specific pregnancy disorder that complicates approximately 3-5% of all&#xD;
      pregnancies. The effects on pregnant women vary from mild hypertension, severe hypertension /&#xD;
      hypertensive crisis, eclampsia to hemolysis syndrome, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet&#xD;
      count (HELLP), while the impact of these abnormalities on the fetus also varies from preterm&#xD;
      birth, stunted fetal growth (CHD) to fetal death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial cause of preeclampsia is still unknown, recent developments explain the molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms behind its manifestations and especially abnormal development, placental hypoxia,&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prenatal yoga (yoga for pregnancy) is a modification of classical yoga which has been adapted&#xD;
      to the physical condition of pregnant women which is done with a more gentle and slow&#xD;
      intensity. Rakhsani A, et al., (2012) suggested that the positive effects of yoga for&#xD;
      pregnant women are reducing occure of hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes as&#xD;
      well as cases of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of prenatal yoga on reducing&#xD;
      preeclampsia. This study was an experimental study that used pre and post-test mechanisms&#xD;
      (paired test) with Yoga exercise treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The number of samples wares 24 samples from pregnant women&gt; 20 weeks who had blood pressure&#xD;
      level which was 130/80 mmHg to 140/90 mmHg. This study was carried out in September 2020.&#xD;
      There were three parameters to measured decreased hypertension that is blood pressure, the&#xD;
      protein level in urine, as well as blood platelets. The research was carried out in several&#xD;
      public health centers where was Puskesmas Pembina and two clinics of midwives practice in&#xD;
      Palembang city from September to November 2020. Yoga exercises technique used stretching and&#xD;
      posture exercises (asanas) combined with deep breathing (pranayama) and meditation, to unify&#xD;
      body, mind, and spirit (Babbar S, Parks-Savage AC, Chauhan SP, 2012).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study was an experimental study that used pre and post-test designs in a single group. pre-group wasn't got yoga exercise, and post group was got yoga exercise was 30 minutes every 2 weeks for two months (4 times treatment). Yoga exercises technique used stretching and posture exercises (asanas) combined with deep breathing (pranayama) and meditation, to unify body, mind, and spirit (Babbar S, Parks-Savage AC, Chauhan SP, 2012). We obtained 24 samples from pregnant women&gt; 20 weeks who had blood pressure level which was 130/80 mmHg to 140/90 mmHg got fouth times yoga exercise during pregnancy. This study was carried out in September 2020. Every each subject was measured the hypertension level by systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the protein level in urine, as well as blood platelets. The research was carried out in several public health centers where was Puskesmas Pembina and two clinics of midwives practice in Palembang city from September to November 2020.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>The blood pressure measured two times measurement that were 1 hour before yoga exercise and 1 hour after yoga exercise.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure is the pressure of circulating blood against the walls of blood vessels to expressed the systolic pressure (maximum pressure during on heartbeat) over diastolic pressure (minimum pressure between two heartbeats) in the cardiac cycle.&#xD;
. The blood pressure measure device used the digital sfigmomanometer.</description>

    <measure>Protein urine level</measure>
    <time_frame>the protein urine level measured two times measurement that were 1 hour before yoga exercise and 1 hour after yoga exercise.</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of proteins in urine (albumin urine) as an indication of problems in the kidneys which one is increased blood pressure. the normal value of urine albumin levels for random urine retrieval is 0-8 mg/dl. urine collected immediately after waking up which is before performing activities in the morning. about 50 ml volume of urine was measured used technique using high-performance liquid chromatography method to analysis the albumin urine.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>blood platelets level</measure>
    <time_frame>blood platelets level measured two times measurement that were 1 hour before yoga exercise and 1 hour after yoga exercise.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood platelets or thrombocytes level test is count platelet level per microliter (mcL) of blood. TThe normal number of platelets in the blood is 150,000 to 400,000 platelets per microliter (mcL) or 150 to 400 Ã— 109/L.&#xD;
the blood collected from drawing blood from a vein in the arm or hand. Obtaining a sample of blood from a vein takes a few minutes and generally causes only minimal discomfort.</description>
