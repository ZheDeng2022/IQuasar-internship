  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is 8 weeks long and involves subjects taking memantine or placebo. If they are&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the memantine arm and are eligible to participate in the study, they&#xD;
      will begin by taking 10mg once daily of memantine for two weeks, then 20mg for the remaining&#xD;
      six weeks. Efficacy and safety measures will be performed at each visit. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either memantine or placebo on a 1:1 basis. This blinding will be&#xD;
      maintained by the IDS pharmacy at the University of Chicago.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of memantine in 80&#xD;
      subjects with DSM-5 trichotillomania (TTM) or skin picking disorder (SPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis to be tested is that memantine will be more effective and well tolerated in&#xD;
      adults with trichotillomania or skin picking disorder compared to placebo. The proposed study&#xD;
      will provide needed data on the treatment of a disabling disorder where there are not any&#xD;
      current treatments options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be one of few studies assessing the use of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of TTM&#xD;
      and SPD in adults. Assessing the efficacy and safety of memantine will help inform clinicians&#xD;
      about additional treatment options for adults suffering from this disorder.&#xD;

    <measure>NIMH Symptom Severity Scale (for TTM or Skin Picking)</measure>
    <time_frame>The primary efficacy end points will be the change in these measures from baseline to week 8.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy measure will be the change in hair pulling or skin picking frequency and urges to pull hair or pick skin for the past week as indicated by change in total score. The entire study lasts 10 weeks. Every two weeks subjects will take the NIMH-TSS. The change in scores from baseline to after 10 weeks will be assessed. The scale itself assesses severity of trichotillomania symptoms. The NIMH-TSS score ranges from 0 to 20, with 0 being no symptoms and 20 being the most severe.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The entire study for the subject will last 8 weeks. Every two weeks the subject will complete the CGI. The change in scores from baseline to after 8 weeks will be assessed. The scale itself assesses overall disorder severity on a scale from 1 to 7 with 1 being &quot;not at all&quot; and 7 being &quot;among the most severe cases&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Brief, self-report instrument for assessing repetitive hairpulling. Seven individual items, rated for severity from 0 to 4, assess urges to pull, actual pulling, perceived control, and associated distress.</description>

    <measure>Skin Picking Symptom Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The entire study lasts 8 weeks. Every two weeks subjects will take the SP-SAS. The change in scores from baseline to after 8 weeks will be assessed. The scale itself assesses severity of skin-picking symptoms. The SP-SAS score ranges from 0 to 48, with 0 being no symptoms and 48 being the most severe.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report assessment of patient perceived quality of life that will be assessed at baseline and week 8. Higher scores indicate a higher quality of life, whereas lower scores indicate a lower quality of life.&#xD;
A self-report assessment of patient perceived quality of life that will be assessed at baseline and visit 8. Higher scores indicate a higher quality of life, whereas lower scores indicate a lower quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Sheehan Disability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will complete the SDS at all visits. The change in scores from baseline to study completion will be assessed. The scale itself assesses the level of disability from target disorder with higher scores indicating a more debilitating disorder.</description>

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A clinician-administered assessment of anxiety that will be assessed at all study visits. Changes in scores from baseline to final visit will be assessed. Higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety, with 0 being no symptoms of anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
