  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telerehabilitation is a service delivery method that has grown substantially in recent years.&#xD;
      It has both advantages and disadvantages in comparison to clinic-based services. For example,&#xD;
      telerehabilitation is advantageous for people residing in locations in which specialized&#xD;
      rehabilitation services are scarce; however, it has the disadvantage of being dependent on&#xD;
      reliable internet connections that are not available in all locations. Also, some people&#xD;
      prefer the privacy afforded by receiving treatment in their home, but other people prefer the&#xD;
      interaction with other clients with similar challenges afforded by attending sessions in&#xD;
      clinic-based settings. Other questions about advantages and disadvantages of&#xD;
      telerehabilitation remain unexplored. One such question is the focus of this research and&#xD;
      concerns the effect of receiving post-acute telerehabilitation services versus clinic-based&#xD;
      services on the general well-being and quality of life experienced by people with traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury. The study purpose is to compare changes in wellness and quality of life&#xD;
      occurring over a four-month period during which people with traumatic brain injury receive&#xD;
      post-acute services either via telerehabilitation or at an outpatient facility.&#xD;

        Fifty adults with traumatic brain injury will comprise the participant sample. Prospective&#xD;
        participants will be from a convenience sample of people with traumatic brain injury&#xD;
        nearing discharge from Quality Living's inpatient program. Participants will form two&#xD;
        subgroups-those whose prospective outpatient treatment will be through clinic-based&#xD;
        services from practitioners near their home and those whose continued rehabilitation will&#xD;
        be through telerehabilitation services. Each person's decision about clinic-based versus&#xD;
        telerehabilitation service will stem from factors including funding, local availability and&#xD;
        access, individual preference, and treatment team recommendations.&#xD;
