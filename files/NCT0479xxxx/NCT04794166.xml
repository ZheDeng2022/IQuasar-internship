      The primary purpose of this study is to assess whether lumbar spine surgery patients with&#xD;
      dura rupture differ in symptom prevalence and severity from other lumbar spine surgery&#xD;
      patients in the early postoperative phase. This is in order to develop a symptom-specific&#xD;
      mobilization algorithm (DURAMOB) that can be used to assess whether patients with dura&#xD;
      rupture safe can be mobilized earlier after lumbar back surgery to prevent bed rest&#xD;
      complications&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accidental dura rupture is a complication of lumbar spine surgery, with an incidence of 2-18%&#xD;
      which can cause cerebrospinal fluid leakage leading to symptoms such as postural headache,&#xD;
      photosensitivity, tinnitus, infection, and pseudomeningocele. Traditionally, the condition is&#xD;
      treated with postoperatively flat bed rest ranging from 0-72 hours, entailing an increased&#xD;
      risk of complications due to bed rest. There is inconsistency in the length of prescribed&#xD;
      flat bed rest for these patients, and no consensus exists nationally or internationally. The&#xD;
      prescription of flat bed rest is generally made by the surgeons based on their clinical&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This quality development project in the clinimetric field aims to develop an assessment tool&#xD;
      (Duramob) of perioperative symptoms prevalence and severity in lumbar spine surgery patients&#xD;
      with and without dura rupture in the early postoperative phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is based on clinical auditing comprising a consecutive samples of patients in&#xD;
      collaboration with &quot; Center for Rheumatology and Spine Diseases&quot;, Rigshospitalet-Glostrup,&#xD;
      Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Duramob instrument will be developed as an evidence-based algorithm for assessing the&#xD;
      potential need for postoperatively restrictive bedrest after dura rupture, - and subsequently&#xD;
      to be implemented in clinical perioperative practice. Further scientific testing will&#xD;
      following be carried out in a feasibility study and / or as a Randomized Controlled Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initial study will generate observational evidence investigating the first steps towards&#xD;
      establishing a safe mobilisation regime for patients with surgical dura rupture. Ultimately,&#xD;
      we seek to avoid unnecessary bedrest and complications derived from perioperative&#xD;
      immobilization. Data will be protected in a local clinical database RedCap hosted by the&#xD;
      Capital Region Data Management system and follows GDPR regulations. The department leadership&#xD;
      approved the project and the local ethical Committee' waived the need for approval.&#xD;
