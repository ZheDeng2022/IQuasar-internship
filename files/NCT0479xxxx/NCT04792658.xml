  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benzodiazepines are usually a secondary drug of abuse-used mainly to augment the high&#xD;
      received from another drug or to offset the adverse effects of other drugs. Few cases of&#xD;
      addiction arise from legitimate use of benzodiazepines. Pharmacologic dependence, a&#xD;
      predictable and natural adaptation of a body system long accustomed to the presence of a&#xD;
      drug, may occur in patients taking therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines. However, this&#xD;
      dependence, which generally manifests itself in withdrawal symptoms upon the abrupt&#xD;
      discontinuation of the medication, may be controlled and ended through dose tapering,&#xD;
      medication switching, and/or medication augmentation. Due to the chronic nature of anxiety,&#xD;
      long-term low-dose benzodiazepine treatment may be necessary for some patients; this&#xD;
      continuation of treatment should not be considered abuse or addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      previous study reported that The results of the study are important in that they corroborate&#xD;
      the mounting evidence that a range of neuropsychological functions are impaired as a result&#xD;
      of long-term benzodiazepine use, and that these are likely to persist even following&#xD;
      withdrawal. The findings highlight the residual neurocognitive compromise associated with&#xD;
      long-term benzodiazepine therapy as well as the important clinical implications of these&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
