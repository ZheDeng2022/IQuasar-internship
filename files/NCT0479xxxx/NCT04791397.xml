  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of interval hypoxy-hyperoxic training (IHHT) on&#xD;
      the arterial stiffness and elasticity of the liver tissue in patients with metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      and on other components of the metabolic syndrome, and the possibility of their reversible&#xD;
      recovery after training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will included 60 patients with metabolic syndrome (alimentary obesity (large waist,&#xD;
      that measures at least 89 centimeters for women, and 102 centimeters for men), high blood&#xD;
      pressure (130/85 mm Hg or higher), dislipidemia (triglyceride level 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) or&#xD;
      higher of this type of fat found in blood; reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol&#xD;
      less than 40 mg/dL (1.04 mmol/L) in men, or less than 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) in women of HDL&#xD;
      cholesterol), elevated fasting blood sugar (100 mg/dL (5,6 mmol/L) or higher). All patients&#xD;
      were random separated into two groups: trial (30 pers., who will undergo 15 procedures of the&#xD;
      IHHT, 5 days a week for 3 weeks), and control (30 pers., who will undergo 15 placebo&#xD;
      procedures simulating IHHT, 5 days a week for 3 weeks). Before and after procedures of IHHT&#xD;
      all patients will undergo laboratory and instrumental examinations, wich include arterial&#xD;
      stiffness measurement, making by Fukuda Denshi VS-100 VaSera, measurement of liver tissue&#xD;
      elasticity and fibrosis, making by elastography on FibroScan (Echosense, XL-sensor), and&#xD;
      laboratory analysis (lipid profile, fasting blood sugar, trimethylamin N-oxyde (TMAO),&#xD;
      Toll-like receptors 4,7,9). After 6 month of IHHT all patients will undergo the same&#xD;
      laboratory and instrumental examinations to assess the duration of the effect.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Interval hypoxic-hyperoxic training (IHHT) using respiratory therapy unit ReOxy.</intervention_name>
    <description>Every patient from control group undergo 15 procedures of IHHT, 5 procedures per week for 3 weeks, 1 procedure lasts 40 minutes. IHHT is a protocol which employs passive (the patient is at rest), short (several minutes) mild normobaric hypoxic exposures alternated with similar duration intervals of breathing hyperoxia, and repeated for 40 minutes. During the initial pretreatment test, the patient inhales air with low oxygen content at atmospheric pressure in a continuous mode through a mask. In the interval therapeutic mode that follows, periods of hypoxia (10-14% O2) are interrupted by periods of reoxygenation by hyperoxia (up to 35% O2). Automatic switching of gas flows (SRT technology). Built-in intelligent software automatically identifies and suggests key treatment parameters for the individual treatment program, by adjusting the starting parameters based upon the results of the pretreatment hypoxic test.</description>
