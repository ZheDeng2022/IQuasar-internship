  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an independent risk factor for heart failure (HF) and is&#xD;
      associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Recent therapeutic advances in&#xD;
      pharmacotherapies, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), have shown to&#xD;
      be beneficial in preventing HF among patients with T2DM. However, despite widely available&#xD;
      risk prediction and stratification tools and evidence-based practice guidelines, SGLT-2i&#xD;
      medications are under-prescribed in the United States. The proposed study is a pragmatic,&#xD;
      single-center, randomized trial to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a clinical&#xD;
      decision support (CDS) tool to alert providers and improve HF risk stratification in patients&#xD;
      with T2DM.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an independent risk factor for heart failure (HF) and is&#xD;
      associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Even despite adequate glycemic control,&#xD;
      individuals with T2DM face considerable risk of HF even in individuals without other&#xD;
      significant risk factors. Moreover, individuals with both atherosclerotic cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and T2DM face up to a five-fold increased risk of HF and experience higher rates of&#xD;
      mortality compared to age-matched controls. Thankfully, recent therapeutic advances in&#xD;
      pharmacotherapies, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), have shown to&#xD;
      be beneficial in preventing HF among patients with T2DM. Current guidelines by the American&#xD;
      Diabetes Association and the joint American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association&#xD;
      (ACC/AHA) both provide class I/A recommendations in initiating SGLT2i medication in&#xD;
      individuals with T2DM and cardiovascular comorbidities for prevention of HF. Similarly, the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration now indicates SGLT2i as a method to reduce the risk of HF&#xD;
      hospitalization in adults with T2DM and established CV risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, SGLT2i are underused in patients with T2DM at risk for HF with ~5% of eligible&#xD;
      patients treated with the medication. Risk-based approaches to identify patients who are at&#xD;
      increased risk of developing adverse events is key to improve the use of evidence-based&#xD;
      therapies and for efficient and cost-effective allocation of preventive strategies. Previous&#xD;
      methods, such as the Pooled Cohort Equation, have been effective in guiding prescription of&#xD;
      statin medications to at-risk patients. Similarly, alert-based clinical decision support&#xD;
      tools have been used to help guide anticoagulation strategies in patients with atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation. However, no such risk-based approach exists for implementation of goal-directed&#xD;
      medical therapy for HF prevention in patients with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WATCH-DM risk score (Weight [body mass index], Age, hyperTension, Creatinine, HDL-C,&#xD;
      Diabetes control [fasting plasma glucose] and QRS Duration, MI and CABG) is one such machine&#xD;
      learning-based tool that was developed among participants of the Action to Control&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators used machine-learning methods and readily available clinical&#xD;
      characteristics to derive the risk prediction model and has had excellent discrimination and&#xD;
      calibration for estimating HF risk. For each risk factor level, patients are given a specific&#xD;
      number of points. The sum of the points accounting for all risk factors included in the model&#xD;
      is associated with 5-year risk of HF. There is a graded, dose-response relationship between&#xD;
      the WATCH-DM risk score and risk of HF. For example, patients who had a WATCH-DM risk score&#xD;
      of at least 11 had a 5-year risk of incident HF â‰¥9.2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed trial will test the efficacy of a computer-based electronic alert (clinical&#xD;
      decision support) notifying the provider that the patient is at an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing heart failure. There currently are no developed or implemented alert systems&#xD;
      notifying the provider that the patient is at an increased risk of heart failure. Similarly,&#xD;
      there is no risk-based approach to implementation evidence-based T2DM therapies in patients&#xD;
      at risk for HF. Currently, SGLT2i use is underutilized with ~5% of eligible patients current&#xD;
      prescribed the medication. Clinical decision support tools may inform providers about a&#xD;
      patient's risk of HF and may be useful to improve the use of SGLT2i therapies. Previous&#xD;
      implementation strategies have been useful to guide statin medications in patients at risk&#xD;
      for atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and anticoagulation strategies in patients with&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will determine the impact of electronic alert-based CDS on prescription of&#xD;
      SGLT2i medications in high-risk HF patients in the outpatient setting who are not being&#xD;
      prescribed SGLT2i therapies. Investigators will not mandate a specific SGLT2i agent or&#xD;
      regimen. Study investigators will provide options for SGLT2i medications to prevent HF and&#xD;
      allow the provider to make the best choice based on their clinical judgement. If there is a&#xD;
      contraindication to SGLT2i therapy, the provider can elect to omit the suggested therapy and&#xD;
      provide an explanation for doing so. Data acquired throughout the study duration will also&#xD;
      determine the impact of electronic alert-based CDS on the frequency of SGLT2i prescription&#xD;
      patterns and incident HF events.&#xD;
