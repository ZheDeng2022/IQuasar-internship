      Brief Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognition and balance are known to decline during the aging process. Cognitive performance is&#xD;
      essential for functional independence and determines whether an individual can perform&#xD;
      instrumental daily living activities (e.g., finances, driving, independent living). Balance&#xD;
      is critical for participation in everyday life activities. Impaired balance increases fall&#xD;
      risk, and subsequent injury increased caregiver dependency and decreased independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the outcomes of 24 sessions of online mobility&#xD;
      and cognitive training (35 minutes/session, 3x/week, 8-12 weeks) for community-based older&#xD;
      adults. The exercise program is progressively challenging and emphasizes balance,&#xD;
      cardiovascular conditioning, attention, and working memory. The primary outcomes of interest&#xD;
      are cognitive performance and balance changes, with secondary outcomes relating to&#xD;
      self-efficacy, resilience, and physical activity.&#xD;

      Protocol Overview: Subjects will be recruited from the greater Washington D.C. metro area.&#xD;
      Individuals interested in participating as subjects will complete initial verbal screening to&#xD;
      determine eligibility for inclusion. Those subjects who volunteer to participate will then be&#xD;
      consented and enrolled for participation if exclusion and inclusion criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: (~120 minutes) Participants meeting study rationale and voluntarily agree to&#xD;
      participate will receive a standardized email generated through the Research Electronic Data&#xD;
      Capture (REDcap) platform. The email will contain a Zoon videoconference link to complete&#xD;
      cognitive assessments (described below) and virtual balance tests (described below) with a&#xD;
      research assistant. That email will also contain a second link to complete all surveys&#xD;
      through the REDcap portal. Only one selected member of the research team will have an&#xD;
      identification key connecting personally identifiable information to returned surveys.&#xD;
      Cognitive assessments will be completed online using REDcap and Q-global Pearson, with a&#xD;
      member of the research team providing verbal instruction via videoconference. After cognitive&#xD;
      assessment completion, participants will perform the virtual balance tests. A team member&#xD;
      will oversee setup via videoconference to ensure the environment's safety and administer the&#xD;
      test. Participants will receive login instructions and access code to the virtual training&#xD;
      sessions with POWER BRAINing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2-25: (~35 minutes each) Participants will perform training videos at their&#xD;
      convenience two to three times per week for 8-12 weeks for a total of 24 sessions.&#xD;
      Participants will receive a weekly email and/or phone call from research staff to check&#xD;
      safety, provide encouragement, and answer any questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 26: (~120 minutes) Subjects will repeat the same testing procedures, in the same order,&#xD;
      as they did in visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Outcome Measures: The following assessments will be administered via&#xD;
      videoconference using the Zoom platform, and data will be stored in REDcap. Directions will&#xD;
      be given verbally using the specified script for each outcome measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digit Span subset of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale- 4th Edition (WAIS-IV, 10 minutes):&#xD;
      Digit Span, which has two subsections forward (DS-F) and backward (DS-B), evaluates attention&#xD;
      and auditory working memory respectfully. The DS-F requires participants to repeat numbers in&#xD;
      the same order as they were read aloud by the examiner. The testing administrator will say to&#xD;
      the subject, &quot;I am going to read you a sequence of digits, and I want you to try and repeat&#xD;
      the digits in the same order they were read out loud.&quot; To minimize confusion, this example&#xD;
      will be provided, &quot;If I say '4, 7, 1', then you would repeat those same digits in that same&#xD;
      order&quot;. The DS-B requires participants to repeat the numbers in reverse order of what was&#xD;
      presented aloud by the examiner. The test administrator will say, &quot;I am going to read you a&#xD;
      sequence of digits, and I want you to try and repeat the digits in the reverse order they&#xD;
      were read out loud. For example, if I say '4, 7, 1', then you would repeat those same digits&#xD;
      backward.&quot; In both subsets, the sequences increase in length as the participant progresses,&#xD;
      each length has two different sequences. The DS-F has 16 sequences, and the DS-B has 14&#xD;
      sequences. The maximum raw score of DS-F is 16 and DS-B is 14. The digits will be read in an&#xD;
      even tone, at approximately the rate of one digit per second. The first set of sequences will&#xD;
      begin at three digits. The discontinuation criterion is the failure to reproduce two&#xD;
      sequences of equal length correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Letter-Number Sequencing (LNS, 5 minutes): The LNS requires participants to listen to a&#xD;
      series of number and letter and repeat the sequence starting first with the numbers in&#xD;
      ascending order, followed by the letters in alphabetical order. The testing administrator&#xD;
      will say to the subject &quot; &quot;I am going to say a set of numbers and letter. Your task is report&#xD;
      them by first saying the numbers in ascending order and then the letters in alphabetical&#xD;
      order. For example, if I say '9, T, 3, A', your response would be '3, 9, A, T'.&quot; The numbers&#xD;
      and letters will be read in an even tone, at approximately the rate of one digit/number per&#xD;
      second. The first sequence begins at two and increases in length as the participant&#xD;
      progresses. The maximum raw score is 21. Discontinuation criterion is failure to correctly&#xD;
      reproduce three sequences of equal length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple and Choice Reaction Time (10 minutes): The simple (SRT) and choice (CRT) response time&#xD;
      tasks record reaction time to measure the speed of information processing using an online&#xD;
      visual stimulus task. The participant will begin with the SRT and will be asked to &quot;Wait&#xD;
      until you see a black 'X' in the white square. When that happens, press the spacebar. The&#xD;
      goal is to respond as quickly as possible&quot;. In the CRT task, there are four possible stimuli&#xD;
      and four possible stimulus-response associations. Directions are as follows, &quot;Wait until you&#xD;
      see a black 'X' in one of the four white squares. When that happens, press the corresponding&#xD;
      key (z, x, &lt;or &gt;). You can use both hands and may keep your fingers on the keys throughout&#xD;
      the test. The goal is to respond as quickly as possible&quot;. The participant will have one&#xD;
      practice round for each task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spatial Addition subset of Wechsler Memory Scale- 4th Edition (WMS-IV, 15 minutes): This&#xD;
      subtest examines visual-spatial working memory and will be administered using the Q-global&#xD;
      Pearson platform. The participant is shown two 4x4 grids for five seconds each. Both stimuli&#xD;
      will contain blue dots, red dots, or both. The participant must memorize the dots' color and&#xD;
      location in each stimulus to create a final grid that adds the blue dots' locations, ignores&#xD;
      any red dots, and subtracts the location of blue dots that overlap. The instructions will&#xD;
      include: &quot;In this next task, you will be shown two grids for 5 seconds each that contain red&#xD;
      or blue dots. Your task in the third grid is to create a final grid that adds the spatial&#xD;
      location of the blue dots, subtracting any blue dots that overlapped and ignore any red&#xD;
      dots&quot;. Participants will be shown an example of this task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance outcome measures: The following assessments will be performed via videoconference&#xD;
      using Zoom with a research team member who will oversee the participants' setup for optimal&#xD;
      safety and visualization. The participant will be cued to prioritize safety, upright balance&#xD;
      during tests. Participants are encouraged to position themselves with the back of a chair, a&#xD;
      countertop, or a wall within reach to their front or side, as they perform these tests. The&#xD;
      virtual test administrator will ensure a safe environment before starting the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30-second Chair Stand (~5 minutes): A test of leg strength where the number of times a&#xD;
      participant can stand up fully and sit back down within 30 seconds with arms crossed over&#xD;
      their chest. Ideally, the chair has a straight back that does not have armrests and, ideally,&#xD;
      without armrests with the seat seventeen inches above the floor. Most importantly for this&#xD;
      assessment is using the same chair during pre- and post-assessments. Participants will place&#xD;
      the chair against a wall to ensure it will not move. Ideally, camera orientation is lateral&#xD;
      to the participant to verify achieving full stand and sit for each repetition and not bracing&#xD;
      knees/legs against the chair. Participants must use the same chair during baseline and&#xD;
      follow-up testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four-Stage Balance Test (~10 minutes): The purpose is to assess static balance in a standing&#xD;
      position without using an assistive device. Patients will balance with their feet in four&#xD;
      positions that get progressively more challenging. Positions include feet together,&#xD;
      staggered, heel-to-toe, and single leg. Participants will stand up to 10 seconds in the first&#xD;
      three positions and up to 30 seconds while in a single leg stance to minimize a ceiling&#xD;
      effect. The participant may adjust their arms to maintain balance, but the test is over if&#xD;
      they grab a support surface or changes foot-position. Test administrator times each position&#xD;
      stance when the participant achieves the testing position without UE support. If the person&#xD;
      holds a position for 10 seconds without moving their feet or needing support, that position&#xD;
      is complete, and the participant returns to a bilateral stance. If the participant cannot&#xD;
      hold the position for 10 seconds, the time is over, and the sustained time is documented&#xD;
      (i.e., the participant does not progress to the next test position). The final position&#xD;
      (single-limb stance) is held for up to 30 seconds, with documentation of the length of time&#xD;
      held in seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Tool: This questionnaire is study-specific, developed to assess the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria of inquiring individuals and provide standardized information on the purpose of this&#xD;
      study. It is administered by research staff via phone call and recorded in the REDcap&#xD;
      platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing/Forms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q, 5 minutes): The PAR-Q is a 7 question&#xD;
      screening tool used to assess an individual's physical fitness level and ability to engage in&#xD;
      physical activity. The PAR-Q will be administered in REDcap after meeting the criteria via&#xD;
      phone screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (~10 minutes): The Connor Davidson Resilience Scale is a&#xD;
      one-dimensional self-reported scale consisting of 25 items measuring resilience and will be&#xD;
      administered through an online survey REDcap on visit-1 and visit 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC Scale, 5-10 minutes): The ABC scale is a&#xD;
      16-item self-report rating confidence in performing various activities. The ABC Scale will be&#xD;
      administered through an online survey through REDcap on visit-1 and visit-26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient Physical Therapy Improvement in Movement Assessment Log (OPTIMAL, 20 minutes): The&#xD;
      OPTIMAL scale measures self-confidence and difficulty performing 21 functional activities and&#xD;
      will be administered through an online survey through REDcap on visit-1 and visit-26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire- Long Form (~15-30 minutes): The IPAQ is a&#xD;
      27-item self-reported measure of physical activity to compare levels between populations&#xD;
      internationally. It will be administered through an online survey through REDcap on visit-1&#xD;
      and visit-26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Online Video Intervention: The intervention intends to encompass cardiovascular conditioning,&#xD;
      cognitive performance, and balance performance improvements. The exercises are structured to&#xD;
      keep the participant in motion to promote cardiovascular conditioning while maintaining an&#xD;
      elevated heart rate using techniques such as squats, marching, and upper extremity movements.&#xD;
      The video provides adaptations to increase or decrease the challenge based on subject&#xD;
      ability. Participants will be asked to complete simple and complex cognitive tasks to promote&#xD;
      cognitive performance, such as arithmetic, spatial memory recall, and attention while&#xD;
      completing the physical exercises. The videos include single-limb stance and weight shifting&#xD;
      tasks to promote balance performance. Videos are presented in a progressively challenging&#xD;
      manner for all domains.&#xD;
