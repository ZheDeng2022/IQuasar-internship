      The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the mid-term safety and efficacy&#xD;
      end-points [medical outcomes study-short form 36-item (SF-36) physical component summary&#xD;
      (PCS) at 30 days after surgery, etc.] in patients with complex coronary artery lesions [an&#xD;
      indication of off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAGB)] who received minimal invasive&#xD;
      coronary surgery (MICS)-CABG and those who received thoracotomy OPCABG. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that patients in MICS-CABG group have superior clinical demonstrations regarding&#xD;
      the primary endpoint than those in OPCAGB group without increased adverse outcomes. A total&#xD;
      of 200 eligible patients are planned to be randomized to MICS-CABG or OPCABG group with an&#xD;
      allocation ratio of 1:1. The primary endpoint is SF-36 PCS at 30 days after surgery. The&#xD;
      analysis on primary endpoints will be conducted according to the basic principle of&#xD;
      intention-to-treat (ITT).&#xD;

      Objective and Hypothesis: The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the mid-term&#xD;
      safety and efficacy end-points (SF-36 PCS at 30 days after surgery, etc.) in patients with&#xD;
      complex coronary artery lesions (an indication of OPCAGB) who received MICS-CABG and those&#xD;
      who received thoracotomy OPCABG. The investigators hypothesize that patients in MICS-CABG&#xD;
      group have superior clinical demonstrations regarding the primary endpoint than those in&#xD;
      OPCAGB group without increased adverse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MICS-CABG (experimental group): Off-pump multi-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting&#xD;
           via left thoracotomy under minimally invasive conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Surgery preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
                General anesthesia, double lumen tracheal intubation. In the supine position, tilt&#xD;
                15Â° to the right. An automatic defibrillation electrode is attached to the right&#xD;
                front and left rear chest wall, and the external defibrillator is connected. A&#xD;
                small incision of 8-10 cm into the left anterior lateral 5th intercostal space was&#xD;
                performed into the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Internal mammary artery acquisition:&#xD;
&#xD;
                After entering the chest, the internal mammary artery (IMA) is exposed through a&#xD;
                new minimal invasive retraction system. Single or bilateral IMA is obtained as&#xD;
                needed. Separate the IMA From the middle segment (non-fat muscle coverage area)&#xD;
                applied with an electric scalpel (15J), and the free range was up to the first rib&#xD;
                to the fifth or sixth intercostal (IMA bifurcation).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Bypass strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
                All procedures were performed under a non-cardiopulmonary situation, and vascular&#xD;
                anastomosis was performed with the aid of a laparoscopic cardiac stabilizer. The&#xD;
                stabilizer is smaller and does not occupy the operating space. The head of&#xD;
                stabilizer can be rotated 360 degrees and the target vessel can be fixed at any&#xD;
                angle. Bilateral internal mammary artery, radial artery and saphenous vein can be&#xD;
                used as graft vessels. The bypass strategy is not particularly different from&#xD;
                conventional bypass surgery, including aorta (AO)-saphenous vein graft (SVG) or&#xD;
                radial artery (RA)-X1-X2-...( sequential anastomosis), left internal mammary artery&#xD;
                (LIMA)-right internal mammary artery (RIMA) -RA or SVG(Y)-X, RIMA-left anterior&#xD;
                descending (LAD), LIMA-RA or RIMA or SVG(I)-X1-X2 and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Vascular anastomosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The target vessel is exposed through the pericardial suture, the heart is locally&#xD;
                fixed with the aid of a cardiac stabilizer, and the target vessel is inserted shunt&#xD;
                to avoid hemodynamic disorder and arrhythmia. Vascular anastomosis is performed by&#xD;
                8-0 polypropylene suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Aortic exposure and proximal anastomosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Place gauze behind the aorta, expose the aorta with the right pericardial suspension&#xD;
           suture, temporary block aortic anterior wall with a soft-chain sidewall clamp, Punch on&#xD;
           the aortic anterior wall with 3.5 mm puncher, anastomose SVG or RA on AO with 6-0&#xD;
           polypropylene suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OPCABG (control group): Off-pump multi-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting with&#xD;
           conventional thoracotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized to MICS-CABG or OPCABG group with an allocation ratio of&#xD;
      1:1 after providing written informed consent. The randomization sequence will be generated by&#xD;
      an independent statistician with block randomization method (block size=4 or 6). Each&#xD;
      enrolled patient will be allocated to MICS-CABG or OPCABG group within 24-48 hours prior to&#xD;
      surgery in the order of the assigned number in the allocation table uploaded in the&#xD;
      electronic data capture (EDC) system. The allocation table will be concealed from researchers&#xD;
      during research process.&#xD;
&#xD;

                with st-t segment elevation on cardiogram].&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Outcomes: Details are shown in the Outcome Measures part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-ups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed at 7 days, 14 days, 30 days (1 month), 3 months, 6 months, and 12&#xD;
      months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to previous studies and reports, the average SF-36 PCS was 43 with a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 10 at 30 days after OPCABG. Through preliminary studies, the average SF-36 PCS&#xD;
      at 30 days after MICS-CABG was 50. The minimum clinically important difference of SF-36 PCS&#xD;
      was 2 according to previous publications. Assuming that the lower limit of 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval of PCS score difference between MICS-CABG group and OPCABG group is greater than 2,&#xD;
      it is considered that the PCS score of MICS-CABG group is better than OPCABG group, with&#xD;
      inspection level Î±=0.025 (one side) and inspection efficiency 1-Î²=0.80. The sample size of&#xD;
      OPCABG group and MICS group is calculated to be 64 cases, with an estimated drop-out rate of&#xD;
      10%, and each group needs to include at least 72 people. Based on the above conclusions, the&#xD;
      investigators calculated sample size is 100 cases in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is SF-36 PCS at 30 days after surgery. The analysis on the primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be conducted according to the basic principle of ITT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For baseline characteristics, mean and standard deviation will be described for continuous&#xD;
      data with normal distribution, while median and interquartile range (IQR) will be used to&#xD;
      depict continuous skewed data. Frequencies and percentages will be demonstrated for&#xD;
      categorical variables. For group comparisons, t-test will be used for normal distributed&#xD;
      variables, Mann-Whitney U test will be applied for skewed variables, while Pearson's&#xD;
      chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test will be conducted for categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary endpoint, the difference of SF-36 PCS at 30 days after surgery between two&#xD;
      groups with 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated. If the lower limit of 95%CI is&#xD;
      greater than 2, the superiority of MICS-CABG will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For secondary endpoints, t-test will be used for normal distributed variables, Mann-Whitney U&#xD;
      test will be applied for skewed variables, while Pearson's chi-squared test or Fisher's exact&#xD;
      test will be conducted for categorical variables. Survival analysis will be applied for&#xD;
      time-to-event data [time to the first major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events&#xD;
      (MACCE) within1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical significance is defined as the two-sided p-value less than 0.05. All analyses&#xD;
      were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26.0 or&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis System (SAS) version 9.4 or later.&#xD;
