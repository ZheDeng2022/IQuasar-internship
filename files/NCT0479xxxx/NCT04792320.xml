  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Taiwan has more chronic kidney disease (CKD) per capita than anywhere in the world, leading&#xD;
      to the highest expense of National Health Insurance. By reviewing previous studies, uremic&#xD;
      toxins contribute critically to the detrimental effects of CKD on atherosclerotic peripheral&#xD;
      artery disease (PAD). When recognized early and managed appropriately, mortality and&#xD;
      complications of the participants with CKD and established PAD can be minimized. It is&#xD;
      critical to identify novel biomarkers and mediators, which can help identify those with&#xD;
      potential poor outcomes and facilitate the discovery/development of novel therapeutics for&#xD;
      the patients with CKD and PAD. The OMICs studies support the theory that gut microbiome is a&#xD;
      major contributor to adverse cardiovascular outcomes and progression of CKD. However,&#xD;
      successful integration of multi-omics approach remains sparse. There is no report on the&#xD;
      impact of gut microbiota on the host circulating long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) expression&#xD;
      signature, other CAD/PAD potential marker, and the potential link between gut microbiota,&#xD;
      circulating lncRNA levels changes and CKD/PAD. Additionally, although numerous studies&#xD;
      indicated that probiotics or activated charcoal have benefits for CKD patients, few studies&#xD;
      evaluated the effect of coadministration of activated charcoal/probiotics on the patients&#xD;
      with CKD/PAD. The mechanisms of therapeutic effect on CKD/PAD patients with coadministration&#xD;
      of activated charcoal/probiotics involving the cross talk among host, microbiota and&#xD;
      metabolites still remain unclear. Thus, in the present study, investigators aim to develop&#xD;
      novel diagnostic/prognostic markers and a new treatment with activated bamboo charcoal&#xD;
      (ABC)/probiotics for therapeutic opportunities to prevent cardiovascular complications,&#xD;
      amputation and death in CKD patients with established PAD. To identify the&#xD;
      diagnostic/prognostic markers, the multi-omics (microbolome and metabolome) and lncRNA will&#xD;
      be analyzed. The therapeutic impact of activated bamboo charcoal (ABC)/probiotics with&#xD;
      optimal formulation, on the renal/endothelial/vascular function, cardiovascular (CV) outcome&#xD;
      and mortality in CKD patients with PAD will be also determined to evaluate its therapeutic&#xD;
      opportunities.&#xD;

      roles of microbiota associated with expression profiles of lncRNA and metabolome linked to&#xD;
      adverse CV/limb outcome will be investigation. Through combination of innovative molecular&#xD;
      biological techniques with new approaches for clinical research, investigators will develop a&#xD;
      novel therapy by updated knowledge of the mechanisms of disease and by improved&#xD;
      pharmacological technology for the CKD patients with established PAD. Investigators expect to&#xD;
      demonstrate the clinical efficacy of ABC Â± probiotics to improve symptoms and outcomes of CKD&#xD;
      patients with PAD, and offer a possibility to develop a precision medicine with novel&#xD;
      diagnostic/prognostic markers and special ABC/probiotic formula, which will ultimately lead&#xD;
      to the improved clinical care and outcomes in this population.&#xD;
