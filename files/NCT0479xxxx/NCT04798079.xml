      The goal of this study is to establish a birth cohort that collects prenatal and early life&#xD;
      biosamples and environmental samples and rigorously phenotypes young children for food&#xD;
      allergy and Atopic Dermatitis (AD) to identify prenatal and early life markers of high risk&#xD;
      for food allergy and AD, as well as biological pathways (endotypes) that result in these&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the role and interrelationships of established and novel clinical,&#xD;
           environmental, biological, and genetic prenatal and early-life factors in the&#xD;
           development of allergic diseases through age 3 years, with an emphasis on atopic&#xD;
           dermatitis and food allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To apply systems biology to identify mechanisms and biomarkers underlying the&#xD;
           development of food allergy, atopic dermatitis, and their endotypes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect, process, and assay or store environmental and biological samples for current&#xD;
           and future use in the study of allergic disease development&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study in which pregnant women (at any stage of pregnancy), the&#xD;
      offspring's biologic father, and the offspring will be enrolled at study sites and the&#xD;
      offspring will be observed from birth to age 3 years. The enrollment goal is at least 2500&#xD;
      pregnant women who agree to enroll their offspring at birth. Enrollment of biological fathers&#xD;
      will be attempted; however, enrollment of the mother or child is not dependent on enrollment&#xD;
      of the biological father.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, biological and environmental samples and questionnaire information will be&#xD;
      collected from the parents and the children, and the children will be assessed for allergic&#xD;
      diseases at clinic visits at ages 2, 5, 12, 24, and 36 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of Atopic Dermatitis (AD)</measure>
    <time_frame>From 2 months to 36 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>To understand the early life origin and risk factors of child's atopic dermatitis (AD).&#xD;
Atopic dermatitis is defined as the following since the last assessment (or since birth for the 2- and 5-month visits):&#xD;
A history of a dry or itchy rash that is (a) either continuous or intermittent lasting at least 4 weeks OR (b) requiring medicated treatment AND&#xD;
The rash was or is present in the skin creases (folds of elbows, behind the knees, fronts of ankles, or around the neck) or on the extensor aspects of the forearms or lower legs or on cheeks or trunk.&#xD;
Any infant fulfilling these criteria but who, on examination by a suitably trained health professional, is deemed to have a different skin disease that explains the above findings will be classified as not having atopic dermatitis.</description>

        The study population will include pregnant women, their offspring from birth until age 3&#xD;
        years, and the offspring's biological father. Although biological fathers will be&#xD;
        recruited, their enrollment is not required. The women will be recruited from OB/GYN and&#xD;
        prenatal clinics and offices. Other than the eligibility criteria listed, women will not be&#xD;
        selected by any criteria or characteristics. The intent is to recruit a study population of&#xD;
        children of varying risks with regards to the development of allergic diseases. The&#xD;
        rationale is to identify risk factors in the population for the development of allergic&#xD;
        disease. Selection of pregnant women whose offspring are at an elevated risk of allergic&#xD;
        disease would prevent the study of the risk factors used to select the women.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Agrees to meet the child's study requirements, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Provides written informed consent for the child's continued participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Throughout the protocol where it refers to the mother, father, or parent answering&#xD;
             questionnaires about the child or collecting samples from the child and the child's&#xD;
             primary home, the legal guardian who provides consent for the child's participation&#xD;
             may complete those procedures&#xD;
