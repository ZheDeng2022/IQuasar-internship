  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients living with multiple long-term health conditions have difficulty accessing the&#xD;
      services they need, despite available primary care and community resources. Patient&#xD;
      navigation programs may help those with complex health conditions to improve their care and&#xD;
      outcomes. Community health navigators (CHNs) are community members who help guide patients&#xD;
      through the health care system. CHNs are not health professionals like a doctor or nurse, but&#xD;
      they are specially trained to help patients get the most out of their health care and connect&#xD;
      them to resources. The ENCOMPASS program of research evaluates a patient navigation program&#xD;
      that connects patients living with long-term health conditions to CHNs. To understand if the&#xD;
      CHN program can be scaled to a provincial level, the ENCOMPASS program of research is&#xD;
      expanding to select primary care settings across Alberta. This study implements and evaluates&#xD;
      the CHN program at WestView Primary Care Network in the Greater Edmonton area, Alberta,&#xD;
      Canada.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community Health Navigators (CHNs) are defined as community health workers that provide&#xD;
      patient navigation. Based on evidence to date, CHNs for chronic disease management are likely&#xD;
      to beneficially impact patient experience, clinical outcomes and costs; however, contextual&#xD;
      evidence is lacking given that most studies to date have been conducted in the United States.&#xD;
      In Canada, patient navigation programs currently exist in only a few settings (primarily&#xD;
      cancer treatment and transitional care), with few navigation programs implemented in chronic&#xD;
      disease care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ENCOMPASS program of research was initiated in 2016, when researchers with the University&#xD;
      of Calgary's Interdisciplinary Chronic Disease Collaboration partnered with Mosaic Primary&#xD;
      Care Network (PCN) to develop, implement and evaluate a community health navigation program&#xD;
      for patients with multiple chronic conditions. The program was based on a systematic&#xD;
      literature review and refined in consultation with key stakeholders. A cluster-randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial is currently ongoing with Mosaic PCN to determine the impact of the program&#xD;
      on acute care use, patient-reported outcomes and experience, and disease-specific clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (NCT03077386).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alberta Primary Care Networks (PCNs) are comprised of groups of family physicians and other&#xD;
      health care professionals working together to provide comprehensive patient care to&#xD;
      Albertans. To understand if the community health navigation program can be feasibly scaled&#xD;
      and spread to PCNs across Alberta, we are expanding research to examine and evaluate&#xD;
      community health navigation program implementation to other geographic areas and populations.&#xD;
      This study expands the ENCOMPASS program of research to WestView PCN, which represents over&#xD;
      80 physician members. The current study employs the RE-AIM framework (reach, effectiveness,&#xD;
      adoption, implementation, and maintenance) to examine the scalability of the community health&#xD;
      navigation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to (1) assess the impact of the intervention on the target&#xD;
      population and health system (effectiveness); (2) explore the feasibility and appropriateness&#xD;
      of practical intervention scale-up (reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance), and&#xD;
      (3) identify the required resources and infrastructure necessary to maintain and scale the&#xD;
      intervention provincially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the community health navigator program will be studied using a&#xD;
      two-armed, pragmatic, randomized waitlist-controlled trial. This study will employ&#xD;
      patient-level block randomization with research staff blinded to block size. Randomization&#xD;
      will be concealed and computer-generated. Primary outcomes will be assessed using&#xD;
      administrative health data. Secondary outcomes will be measured using a patient health survey&#xD;
      administered by a research assistant at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. A concurrent&#xD;
      qualitative study will provide contextual information on the effectiveness of the community&#xD;
      health navigator program from patient, provider, and CHN perspectives. Process evaluation&#xD;
      metrics and interviews with program stakeholders will inform the feasibility and&#xD;
      sustainability of the community health navigator program in Alberta PCNs.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The ENCOMPASS study will evaluate the effectiveness of a community health navigator program using a two-armed, pragmatic, randomized waitlist-controlled trial. The intervention arm will receive the CHN program for six months. The waitlist control arm will have a six month waiting period followed by six months of CHN program. This study will employ patient-level block randomization. Research staff will be blinded to block size. In the case where participants live together in the same residence, they will be randomly assigned to the same study arm.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Patients will be matched to a community health navigator (CHN) who will conduct a needs assessment to determine the frequency of meetings. A CHN may perform any of the following: providing information to a patient's health care provider, translation, advocating for the patient, connecting the patient with resources (e.g., social, financial, insurance), helping patients set health-related goals, facilitating health care referrals and appointments, and monitoring appointments. These activities may require the CHN to be physically present at appointments or have direct contact with the patient's health care provider. Goal setting and support will be provided in-person or over the telephone using motivational interviewing principles.</description>
