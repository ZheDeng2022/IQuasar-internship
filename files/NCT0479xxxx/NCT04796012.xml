  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a multi-center, non-randomized, open-label Phase II study evaluating the&#xD;
      feasibility and efficacy of vincristine, irinotecan, temozolomide, and atezolizumab. The&#xD;
      trial will enroll patients with pediatric relapsed/refractory solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will test the combination of atezolizumab with chemotherapy for relapsed&#xD;
      solid tumors in childhood. This combination has not been tested. Thus, in the first cohort,&#xD;
      investigators will determine the feasibility of administering vincristine, irinotecan,&#xD;
      temozolomide, and atezolizumab simultaneously in children with relapsed or refractory solid&#xD;
      tumors, regardless of PD-L1 status. In the next cohort, investigators will determine the&#xD;
      objective response rate (ORR), duration of response, and progression-free survival of&#xD;
      children with PD-L1(+) relapsed or refractory solid tumors treated with vincristine,&#xD;
      irinotecan, temozolomide, and atezolizumab.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Relapsed or refractory solid tumor after at least one prior course of therapy. Hodgkin&#xD;
             lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma are not permitted. Patients with CNS malignancy or&#xD;
             asymptomatic CNS metastases may be enrolled, provided all of the following criteria&#xD;
             are met. No metastatic or primary disease affecting the brainstem, midbrain, pons, or&#xD;
             cerebellum, or within 10 mm of optic nerve. No history of leptomeningeal disease No&#xD;
             history of intracranial or spinal cord hemorrhage. No evidence of progression of&#xD;
             neurologic deficit, in the investigator's judgment, within 7 days prior to initiation&#xD;
             of study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age ≥ 6 months and ≤ 30 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Lansky Performance Status (patients &lt; 16 years old) or Karnofsky Performance Status&#xD;
             (patients ≥ 16 years old) ≥ 50&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability to comply with the study protocol, in the investigator's judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. For efficacy cohort, disease must be measurable as defined by RECIST v1.1, mINRC, or&#xD;
             RANO criteria (as appropriate). For the feasibility cohort, disease must be evaluable,&#xD;
             but patients enrolled on the feasibility cohort will be prospectively assessed for&#xD;
             measurable disease. If they are deemed to have measurable disease and PD-L1(+)&#xD;
             staining, they will also be included in the efficacy cohort. Previously irradiated&#xD;
             lesions can be considered as measurable disease only if progressive disease has been&#xD;
             unequivocally documented at that site since radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. For the efficacy cohort, PD-L1(+) tumor is required. Staining may be performed in the&#xD;
             central site CAP/CLIA -certified laboratory using the 22c3 antibody for&#xD;
             immunohistochemical analysis. PD-L1(+) status will be defined as staining on ≥1% of&#xD;
             tumor cells or ≥1% of stroma. For the feasibility cohort, PD-L1 positivity is not&#xD;
             required but will be performed centrally in all cases for exploratory biomarker&#xD;
             studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Availability of a tumor specimen suitable for determination of PD-L1 status, either&#xD;
             from initial diagnosis or from a recurrence. For PD-L1 staining to be performed at the&#xD;
             central site, a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimen in a paraffin&#xD;
             block (preferred) or at least 15 slides containing unstained, freshly cut, serial&#xD;
             sections must be available along with an associated pathology report prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment. Patients for whom the required number of slides are not available may&#xD;
             still be eligible to enroll on study with PI approval&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Adequate organ and marrow function as defined by the following laboratory values&#xD;
             obtained within 21 days prior to initiation of study medication.&#xD;

                  pegfilgrastim, or 7 days after short-acting growth factor), (2) Absolute&#xD;
                  lymphocyte count ≥ 0.5 x 10^9 / L (500/µL), (3) Platelet count ≥ 75 x 10^9 / L&#xD;
                  (75,000/µL) without transfusion in the last 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients with known bone marrow metastatic disease will be eligible for the study&#xD;
                  if they meet the following criteria: (1) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥&#xD;
                  750/mm3, (2) Absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 0.4 x 10^9 / L (400/µL), (3) Platelet&#xD;
                  count ≥ 50,000/mm3 (may receive transfusions provided they are not known to be&#xD;
                  refractory to red cell or platelet transfusions).&#xD;

                  fraction ≥ 50% or shortening fraction ≥ 30%&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Negative HIV and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) tests at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods, and agreement to refrain from&#xD;
             donating eggs, as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of&#xD;
                  less than 1% per year during the treatment period and for 5 months after the&#xD;
                  final doses of atezolizumab, vincristine, and temozolomide. Women must refrain&#xD;
                  from donating eggs during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal,&#xD;
                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (12 or more continuous months of&#xD;
                  amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone&#xD;
                  surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus), regardless of sexual&#xD;
                  orientation or marital status.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. For men who are not surgically sterile: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from&#xD;
             donating sperm, as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. With a female partner of childbearing potential who is not pregnant, men must&#xD;
                  remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that&#xD;
                  together result in a failure rate of less 1% per year during the treatment period&#xD;
                  and for 5 months after the final doses of atezolizumab, irinotecan, and&#xD;
                  temozolomide. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
