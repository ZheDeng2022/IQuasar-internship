  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Symptoms questionnaire (SANDE) scores to Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The SANDE score is calculated by taking the square root of the product of the severity of symptoms scores and the frequency of symptoms score. The SANDE scale ranges from 0 to 100 with 100 being the maximal amount of dry eye symptoms and 0 being the minimal amount or absence of dry eye symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Schirmer I test (without anesthesia) to Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Without previously instilling anesthetic drops, the Schirmer strip will be inserted into the lower conjunctival sac at the junction of the lateral and middle thirds, avoiding contact with the cornea.&#xD;
The patients will be instructed to close their eyes gently. After 5 minutes have elapsed, the Schirmer test strip will be removed and the length of the tear absorption on the strip will be measured (millimeters/5 minutes)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Symptoms questionnaire (SANDE) scores for frequency to Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The SANDE score is calculated by taking the square root of the product of the frequency of symptoms score. Each of the two scores ranges from 0 to 100 with 100 being the maximal amount of dry eye symptoms and 0 being the minimal amount of dry eye symptom. The endpoint here is the SANDE sub-score for frequency.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in conjunctiva vital staining with lissamine green to Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford scheme is used for grading the scale of conjunctival damage. Briefly, the observer grades the extent of staining across temporal, nasal and central zones between 0 to 5, with 0 representing no staining and 5 representing severe/maximal staining.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Tear Film Break-Up Time (TFBUT) to Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>TFBUT is measured by determining the time to tear break-up. The TFBUT is performed after instillation of 5 μL of 2% preservative-free sodium fluorescein solution into the inferior conjunctival cul-de-sac of each eye. The patient is instructed to blink several times to thoroughly mix the fluorescein with the tear film.&#xD;
A TFBUT greater than 15 &quot; is considered normal, while a break up time of less than 10&quot; is considered pathological.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in OSDI score from baseline to Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Ocular Surface Disease Index score is a 12-item questionnaire designed to survey the dry eye symptomatology of a given patient. In this case, OSDI will be used to assess whether the study drug affects specific symptoms of dry eye more than others. In other words, OSDI may be used to determine whether patients on the study drug see improvement of gritty sensations, sensitivity to light or burning sensations.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Corneal Staining Score from baseline to Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal staining with fluorescein is measured from 0-3 by the NEI grading scale in any one eye region.</description>
