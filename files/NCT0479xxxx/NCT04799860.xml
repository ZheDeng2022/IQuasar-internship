  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will support implementation of a health promotive work-way in primary care setting&#xD;
      by using external and internal facilitators, with the aim to identify effective&#xD;
      implementation strategies and to evaluate intervention uptake. Data will be collected from&#xD;
      multiple perspecitves.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insufficient physical activity, hazardous use of alcohol, tobacco use and unhealthy eating&#xD;
      habits increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, cancer and type 2-diabetes.&#xD;
      Health-promoting work reduces the disease risk and mortality and should thus be integrated in&#xD;
      clinical care processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite support by the National guideline for prevention and treatment of unhealthy&#xD;
      life-style habits, there is a chasm to bridge when integrating evidence into clinical&#xD;
      practise. Prerequisites for changing work-ways are often underestimated and left to the&#xD;
      individual co-workers to full fill on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Too few patients are asked about life-style habits and too few receive evidence-based&#xD;
      measures. The measures taken may also depend on sex, language, residence and caregiver's&#xD;
      profession. The investigators strive to support the implementation of a health-promoting way&#xD;
      of working that includes self-reporting of life-style habits before a visit and that takes&#xD;
      measures for those with at least one unhealthy lifestyle habit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to identify effective implementation strategies for health-promoting efforts in&#xD;
      the primary care. The perceptions of barriers and opportunities when changing way of working&#xD;
      from the target groups (leaders, co-workers, patients) will be used to enhance the&#xD;
      possibility of successful implementation. Strategies are enhanced by theories of leading&#xD;
      change. External and internal facilitators support the implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the effects and the implementation process at the level of leaders,&#xD;
      patients, co-workers and organisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project provides generalizable knowledge on strategies to overcome the gap between&#xD;
      evidence and praxis, contributing to utilize an existing synthesized knowledgebase regarding&#xD;
      health-promoting and preventative workways in a Swedish primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is central for the health care system to identify successful implementation strategies in&#xD;
      order to manage their future mission.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A pre-post-intervention design with control group will be used to evaluate intervention uptake and implementation process effectiveness from the perspective of managers, primary care professionals, patients, and organisation. Primary care settings in central Sweden will be supported in implementing a guideline-based health-promoting way of working including screening of life-style habits, measures taken according to evidence based recommendations and documentation. Strategies will include interactive education sessions, external and internal facilitators, audit and feedback, and tools from theories of leading change; tailored according to contextual and participant needs.</intervention_model_description>
