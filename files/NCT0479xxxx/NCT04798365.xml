  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The widespread inappropriate use of antimicrobial substances drives resistance&#xD;
      development at the individual and population level all over the world. In long-term care&#xD;
      facilities (LTCF), antibiotics are among the most frequently prescribed medications. More&#xD;
      than one third of antibiotics prescribed in LTCFs are for urinary tract infections (UTI).&#xD;
      Studies have shown that 30 - 40% of antibiotic courses prescribed in LTCFs were unnecessary&#xD;
      and that more than two-thirds were inappropriate based on society guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data: A surveillance study on healthcare-associated UTIs at LTCFs of the&#xD;
      Geriatric Health Centers Graz revealed that guideline recommendations on antimicrobial choice&#xD;
      were met in only 50% of patients. The most frequently used antimicrobial substances for UTI&#xD;
      were quinolones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: Using a multifaceted bundle of antimicrobial stewardship interventions consisting of&#xD;
      clinical practice guidelines, care pathways and local as well as web-based education and&#xD;
      training targeting nursing staff as well as physicians we aim to improve the quality of&#xD;
      antimicrobial prescriptions for UTIs in four LTCFs in Graz, Austria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Non-randomized cluster controlled intervention study. Setting: The Geriatric Health&#xD;
      Centers Graz are a local institution comprising among others 4 LTCFs (total of 400 beds).&#xD;
      These will serve as intervention group. Four LTCFs located in the surroundings of Graz will&#xD;
      serve as control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The main components of the intervention are 1) two sessions of voluntary&#xD;
      continuing medical education on the urinary tract infection program in each LTCF for&#xD;
      physicians and nursing staff, 2) distribution of educations materials such as written&#xD;
      guidelines on antibiotic prescribing including a smart phone friendly version, 3)&#xD;
      implementation of the project homepage as a platform to distribute guidelines and educational&#xD;
      videos and to enable physicians to ask questions which will be answered by an infectious&#xD;
      disease physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary outcome will be the proportion of adequate prescriptions (adequate in&#xD;
      terms of antimicrobial choice). Secondary outcomes include proportion of adequate&#xD;
      prescriptions (adequate in terms of decision to treat), number of cases with clinical&#xD;
      failure, number of admissions to hospital due to UTI, number of adverse events attributed to&#xD;
      antimicrobial treatment for UTI, percentage of extended spectrum betalactamase (ESBL)&#xD;
      producing enterobacteria isolated from urinary cultures&#xD;
