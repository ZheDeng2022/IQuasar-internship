  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical exercise on a cycle ergometer combine with CPAP as an adjunct to the rehabilitation&#xD;
      of hospitalized subjects who will undergo myocardial revascularization will be safe, decrease&#xD;
      the length of stay in the ICU, and help maintain functional capacity&#xD;

    <measure>Modified Borg scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4th day</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Borg Dyspnoea Scale is most commonly used to assess symptoms of breathlessness. Despite being a subjective measure of exercise intensity, RPE scales provide valuable information when used correctly.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6 min walk distance</measure>
    <time_frame>4th day</time_frame>
    <description>The six minute walking test (6MWT) was developed by the American Thoracic Society and it was officially introduced in 2002, coming along with a comprehensive guideline. The 6 Minute Walk Test is a sub-maximal exercise test used to assess aerobic capacity and endurance. The distance covered over a time of 6 minutes is used as the outcome by which to compare changes in performance capacity</description>

    <measure>1 min sit to stand test</measure>
    <time_frame>4th day</time_frame>
    <description>Vaidya et al reported that 1-minute STS test is a simple and sensitive test and appears to be a practical, reliable, valid, and responsive alternative for measuring exercise capacity, particularly where space and time are limited</description>

    <time_frame>4th day</time_frame>
    <description>The manovacuometer is a simple, quick and non-invasive test which measures the maximal respiratory pressures (MRS).Digital manovacuometer is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing maximum inspiratory pressure and maximum expiratory pressure in healthy subjects</description>

    <description>The control program will consist of progressive exercises according to each postoperative day. Two daily sessions with an average duration of 25 min will be performed. In addition to the physiotherapeutic program standardized by the hospital's team of physical therapists, the intervention group will perform physical exercise on a cycle ergometer with CPAP.</description>
