    <textblock>
      PrEPTECH Phase 2 is a 2-arm randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      telehealth intervention in increasing PrEP uptake among cisgender men and transgender women&#xD;
      who have sex with men over six months. Participants (N = 400) will be randomized equally into&#xD;
      one of two study conditions, treatment with a telehealth intervention called PrEPTECH or a&#xD;
      control condition consisting of treatment as usual plus access to a listing of online and&#xD;
      local PrEP resources, and assessed via surveys at baseline and at 90 and 180 days after&#xD;
      baseline. Randomization of participants will be stratified by participant sub-group (adult&#xD;
      men who have sex with men, adolescent men who have sex with men, and transgender women).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline and follow-up assessments will include questions on demographic characteristics,&#xD;
      measures related to our primary and secondary outcomes, and psychosocial measures. The&#xD;
      primary outcomes measure is self-reported PrEP initiation at 3-month post enrollment, the&#xD;
      percentage of participants reporting having taken at least one dose of PrEP medication by&#xD;
      that time point. In addition, usage data and medical data will be collected and analyzed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A 2-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      telehealth intervention in increasing PrEP uptake among cisgender gay or bisexual men and&#xD;
      transgender women over six months. PrEPTECH 2 is a follow-up to a pilot study of PrEPTECH&#xD;
      undertaken in 25 adult men who have sex with men aged 18-25 years from the San Francisco Bay&#xD;
      Area. In the pilot, PrEPTECH reached underserved populations, providing access to a&#xD;
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimen through a convenient telehealth system. The digital&#xD;
      PrEPTECH 1 program provided digital PrEP education and resources to users, facilitated PrEP&#xD;
      initiation and maintenance, simplified appointments needed to begin and maintain PrEP&#xD;
      regimens through telemedicine appointments with physicians, eliminated the need for direct&#xD;
      in-person follow-up with medical providers, provided a gay and bisexual male preferred&#xD;
      telehealth method for accessing PrEP, offered personalized messaging to increase adherence&#xD;
      and motivation for PrEP regimens, bypassed stigma and cost barriers for PrEP uptake in young&#xD;
      men who have sex with men, and decreased the time required of clinicians managing PrEP&#xD;
      patients. This follow-up study will extend our understanding of the PrEPTECH intervention and&#xD;
      its capacity to increase PrEP uptake, adherence and maintenance, extending the populations&#xD;
      served to include adolescent MSM ages 15-17 and transgender women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase 2 study, participants (N = 400) will be randomized equally into one of two&#xD;
      study conditions, treatment with the PrEPTECH telehealth intervention or a control condition.&#xD;
      Randomization of participants will be stratified by participant sub-group (adult men who have&#xD;
      sex with men, adolescent men who have sex with men, and transgender women). Those in the&#xD;
      treatment arm will have access to PrEPTECH for six months. PrEPTECH features includes a&#xD;
      platform for connecting the participant with a prescribing physician providing free PrEP&#xD;
      care, optional email or text message reminders, free home lab testing, and a supply of free&#xD;
      PrEP (a 6 month supply for adolescent and transgender gender women participants and a 1 month&#xD;
      supply for all other participants). Those in the control arm will be provided with a list of&#xD;
      online resources about PrEP and how to locate and pay for PrEP care and contact information&#xD;
      for a professional PrEP navigator at a local community-based organization partnering with the&#xD;
      study. Participants will complete brief online surveys at baseline and at 90- and 180-days&#xD;
      following baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited using a variety of methods, including through digital&#xD;
      advertising on social media platforms and online dating/hook-up web sites and posting to&#xD;
      community listservs, web sites offering resources on finding PrEP, and forums;&#xD;
      community-based organizations partnering, that will assist with recruitment through social&#xD;
      media and other online communication and in-person advertising with palm cards and flyers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. Stratified randomization will be used to allocate participants. Participants&#xD;
      will be stratified by study site and participant sub-group, ensuring that half of&#xD;
      participants in each study site will be allocated to the PrEPTECH condition and half to the&#xD;
      control condition and that the participants in each of the three study populations (adult&#xD;
      YMSM, minors, and transgender women) will also be allocated equally to each of the two&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation. After randomization participants in the treatment group, will be granted&#xD;
      access to the online PrEPTECH intervention, which includes a panel that sets-up text-message&#xD;
      or email medication reminders, information about the intervention and PrEP, and a panel that&#xD;
      guides the participant through the process of getting on PrEP: from ordering home lab&#xD;
      testing, to completing a telehealth appointment with a study doctor, to ordering PrEP&#xD;
      medication home delivery through an online pharmacy. Those in the control group will&#xD;
      exclusively have access to a static web page offering links to online resources and&#xD;
      information about local PrEP navigation resources available to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection. Participants will be surveyed at three time points: 1) prior to&#xD;
      randomization (baseline) 2) 3 months (90 days) after enrollment 4) and 6 months (180 days)&#xD;
      after enrollment. Surveys will be created on Qualtrics, hosted on the PrEPTECH web site, and&#xD;
      taken online. All survey data will be transferred to SPSS for survey analysis. Data will also&#xD;
      be collected through the app on usage of the web site. Additional study data will come from&#xD;
      the lab tests collected prior to the first prescription being administered (hepatitis B, HIV,&#xD;
      creatinine, serum creatinine and syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia test) and roughly 90 days&#xD;
      later (HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia).&#xD;
