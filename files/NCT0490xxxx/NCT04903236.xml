  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MR BIO study aims to understand the changes in the tumour and normal tissues during a&#xD;
      course of radiotherapy. This is accomplished by studying the MR images taken during each&#xD;
      treatment session on the MR Linear accelerator (MR Linac). The overarching hypothesis is that&#xD;
      changes in MR imaging and biological parameters from blood, tissue, or urine biomarkers can&#xD;
      be measured during radiotherapy and associated with clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MR Linac is a new radiotherapy machine with an on board MR scanner. This enables us to&#xD;
      take images with high resolution and target the tumours more precisely and also reduce the&#xD;
      dose to normal tissues. All patients undergoing treatment in the MR Linac at the Christie&#xD;
      hospital will be considered for enrolment regardless of tumour site being treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will receive the standard of care treatment for their disease&#xD;
      condition. In addition, they will be requested to give weekly blood and urine samples during&#xD;
      the course of radiotherapy and at first follow up. On completion of radiotherapy treatment,&#xD;
      the participants will continue to be on standard of care follow up protocol with the treating&#xD;
      oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small cohort of ten healthy volunteers will also be recruited to the study to develop and&#xD;
      select some of the MR sequences onlyÍ¾ they will not provide blood or urine samples. The&#xD;
      healthy volunteers will be scanned for no more than one hour per session for a maximum of two&#xD;
      sessions in total. These optimised sequences can then be used in the patient cohort.&#xD;

    <description>Analysis of MR images will be performed using in-house protocols based on established mathematical modelling techniques. Pearson correlation analysis will be used to assess relationships between MRI parameters and tissue markers. For oxygen enhanced imaging, two-sample unpaired t-tests will be used to identify changes in tissue oxygen in MR images. Descriptive statistics will be presented using median and 95% confidence intervals (CI) or standard deviation (SD). In addition, Bland-Altman analysis will be performed to calculate bias and 95% limits of agreement between the two measurement techniques.</description>
