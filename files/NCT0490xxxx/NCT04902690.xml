    <textblock>
      Ocrelizumab (OCR) is a humanized anti-CD20 antibody approved for Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis&#xD;
      (RMS) and Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS), due to neuroprotective effects of&#xD;
      partially unknown origin. While its mechanism of action is mainly thought to occur via B cell&#xD;
      depletion, previous studies on rituximab, another anti-CD20 drug, showed that CD20 binding&#xD;
      elicits several intracellular signalling pathways, also including Protein Kinase C (PKC)&#xD;
      activation. Of interest, the β isoform of PKC is known to modulate, through the RNA-binding&#xD;
      protein ELAV/HuR, the expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), a signaling&#xD;
      protein that has been suggested to play deleterious effects in the first phases of MS.&#xD;
      Therefore, the hypothesis is that part of the neuroprotective effects exerted by OCR may also&#xD;
      be due to the modulation of VEGF expression via PKCβ /HuR cascade. The primary objective is&#xD;
      to evaluate the variation of the expression of VEGF (protein and mRNA) in Peripheral Blood&#xD;
      Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) induced by OCR therapy. No additional visits will be required&#xD;
      outside of clinical practice. Additional laboratory testing (VEGF protein expression and&#xD;
      PKCbeta/HuR cascade) will be performed on extra blood which will be taken during the routine&#xD;
      blood exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an observational, longitudinal, monocenter and single arm study, in patients&#xD;
      with RMS who are newly prescribed with OCR as per clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of the following visits as per clinical practice&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T0 visit: at the first dose of OCR, blood sample and clinical/radiological MS data will&#xD;
           be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T6: after 6 months of OCR treatment, blood samples and clinical MS data will be&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T12 visit: after 12 months of OCR treatment, blood samples and clinical MS data will be&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ocrelizumab (OCR) is a humanized monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody approved by the FDA in 2017&#xD;
      and by the European Medicines Agency in 2018 for treatment of adult patients with Relapsing&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis (RMS). In addition, having shown neuroprotective effects, OCR is the first&#xD;
      drug ever approved for early treatment of Primary Progressive MS (PPMS). Currently, OCR is&#xD;
      thought to mostly act via the rapid depletion of the B cells expressing CD20. Additionally,&#xD;
      this depletion most likely causes long-lasting changes in the profile of B cells,&#xD;
      characterized by a reduction of their pro-inflammatory phenotype, as demonstrated with other&#xD;
      anti-CD20 antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of interest, previous studies on other anti-CD20 drugs, mainly rituximab, have shown that&#xD;
      anti-CD20 agents also exert interesting effects on additional intracellular signaling&#xD;
      pathways, such as those involving serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, as well as c-myc.&#xD;
      Considering the structural, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic similarities between OCR and&#xD;
      rituximab, it can be hypothesized that the efficacy of OCR in delaying disease progression&#xD;
      and neuroprotection might also stem from such intracellular effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the various intracellular effects elicited by rituximab through the binding with CD20,&#xD;
      stimulation of the Protein Kinase C (PKC) pathway is of potential significance. The term PKC&#xD;
      encompasses a family of several serine/threonine protein kinases of which the isoform β has&#xD;
      been implicated in pathological processes, such as diabetic retinopathy, via a specific&#xD;
      PKCβ/HuR/Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) pathway (Amadio et al. 2010). Notably, HuR&#xD;
      belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins, named ELAV, which are able to influence&#xD;
      virtually any aspect of the post-synthesis fate of the targeted transcripts, including VEGF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VEGF is a signaling molecule involved in vital processes such as angiogenesis, endothelial&#xD;
      proliferation and cellular response to hypoxia. The possible role of VEGF in MS pathogenesis&#xD;
      and evolution has not been explored until recently, but mounting evidence points to the&#xD;
      conclusion that VEGF might play a significant noxious role in the relapsing stage of MS, for&#xD;
      instance by mediating an increase in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, while playing a&#xD;
      beneficial, neuroprotective role in the late, progressive stage of the disease. Of note, VEGF&#xD;
      has a primary role in promoting vascular hyperpermeability, indeed via phosphorylation of&#xD;
      endothelial tight junction proteins modulates their degradation, finally leading to BBB&#xD;
      disruption. Further, it also regulates vessel growth and is chemotactic for monocytes and&#xD;
      lymphocytes, promoting neuroinflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of interest, a significant increase in VEGF was observed in mice in the acute phase of murine&#xD;
      MOG-induced MS, which correlates to the clinical score, and in sera of MS patients during&#xD;
      clinical disease relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these considerations, it can be possible that OCR exerts an additional beneficial&#xD;
      effect in MS therapy by modulating VEGF content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this project, we aim to explore the effects of OCR on intracellular signaling pathways&#xD;
      by assessing VEGF expression in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of RMS patients at&#xD;
      the beginning of OCR therapy, as well as at 6 and 12 months of ongoing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, ther purpose of the study is to focus on the pro-angiogenic VEGF-A 165, which&#xD;
      seems the isoform mainly involved as mediator of inflammation and cellular immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, the PKCβ/HuR cascade will be investigated in the same conditions. Secondly, disease&#xD;
      activity during OCR treatment will be examined at every step, and also compared with VEGF and&#xD;
      PKC levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will also possibly demonstrate a necessity of further determining the extent and&#xD;
      significance of intracellular effects of anti-CD20 therapy in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an observational (phase 4) , longitudinal, monocenter and single arm study, in&#xD;
      patients with RMS who are newly prescribed with OCR as per clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of the following visits as per clinical practice:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline/start (T0): informed consent signature, inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
           verification, demographical characteristics, clinical medical history recording,&#xD;
           concomitant therapies, neurological history recording (MS history), number of relapses&#xD;
           from MS onset, neurological examination, the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS),&#xD;
           the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS), blood sample, ocrelizumab administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T6: (after 6 months of OCR treatment) adverse events (including relapses), neurological&#xD;
           examination, therapies changes, EDSS, MSSS, blood sample, ocrelizumab administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T12 (after 12 months* of OCR treatment), adverse events (including relapses),&#xD;
           neurological examination, therapies changes, EDSS, MSSS, blood sample, ocrelizumab&#xD;
           administration.&#xD;
