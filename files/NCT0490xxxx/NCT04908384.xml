  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to iteratively develop, refine and test the Improving Asthma Care Together&#xD;
      (IMPACT) Intervention for school-age children (7-11 years) with persistent asthma and their&#xD;
      parents.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is one of the most common chronic conditions of childhood, affecting over six million&#xD;
      US children. Asthma treatment relies on self-management including symptom monitoring and&#xD;
      response, trigger avoidance, and timely and appropriate medication use. Unfortunately, fewer&#xD;
      than 50% of children with asthma are adherent to asthma treatment regimens, leading to&#xD;
      increased disease morbidity and mortality and potentially irreversible airway damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with asthma are missing a voice in their own care. The school-age years (7-11)&#xD;
      represent a natural transition in asthma management, as children must assume some&#xD;
      responsibility for asthma-related care while they spend increasing time away from parents at&#xD;
      school and other extracurricular activities. Yet, existing interventions focus on parents&#xD;
      alone and use prescriptive approaches, telling the parent what to &quot;do&quot; to the child to manage&#xD;
      their asthma. As a result, current strategies are failing to provide children with asthma and&#xD;
      their families the tools they need to manage asthma successfully within the realities of&#xD;
      their daily lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a Human-Centered Design (HCD) framework, the investigators co-designed a tailored&#xD;
      asthma shared management mobile health application that pairs the parent and child together&#xD;
      as a team and facilitates the intentional transition of some asthma management to the child.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that by involving children in their own care, participants will improve&#xD;
      asthma management in the present, but also establish lifelong successful self-management&#xD;
      skills. The objective of the proposed study is to pilot test the Improving Asthma Care&#xD;
      Together (IMPACT) mobile health application with parent-child dyads. Based on the preliminary&#xD;
      data, the central hypothesis is that IMPACT will be effective for delivering a shared asthma&#xD;
      management intervention for children and their parents.&#xD;
