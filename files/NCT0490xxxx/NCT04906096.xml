  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug called Paxalisib (GDC-0084) as a possible treatment&#xD;
      for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase 2 study to determine the efficacy of Paxalisib (GDC-0084) in 25&#xD;
      patients with recurrent or refractory primary central nervous system lymphoma (R/R PCNSL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The name of the study drug involved in this study is Paxalisib (GDC-0084).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment&#xD;
           including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that about 25 participants will take part in this research study for up&#xD;
           to 24 months as long as there is no serious side effects and disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase 2 clinical trial. Phase 2 clinical trials test the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Paxalisib for this specific disease but it has&#xD;
      been approved for other uses.&#xD;
