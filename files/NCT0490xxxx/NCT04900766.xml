      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase Ib study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome in subjects with unresectable or metastatic bone and soft&#xD;
      tissue sarcoma who has failed at least one prior line of therapy. About 50 subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited in this study. The subjects will receive Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome 20&#xD;
      mg/m2 by an intravenous infusion (IV), every 21 days (q3w, 1 cycle). All the subjects will&#xD;
      receive the treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, or withdrawal&#xD;
      by investigator or subject decision (a maximum of 6 cycles).&#xD;
