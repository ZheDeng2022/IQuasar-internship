  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is looking for new and better ways to treat melanoma, an aggressive type of skin&#xD;
      cancer. Having surgery to remove the melanoma will cure the majority of patients with early&#xD;
      stage disease. However, a small percentage of these patients will go on to develop further&#xD;
      disease, which may spread to other places in their body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, patients who have been cured of melanoma will have appointments in clinic to check&#xD;
      that further disease has not developed or returned and some may also receive regular scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial team has developed a blood test that tells us whether cancer cells are still&#xD;
      present or is becoming active after a patient has been 'cured' of melanoma, even if a scan&#xD;
      looks normal. The test looks for pieces of DNA in the blood that are known to have come from&#xD;
      the cancer, which we call 'circulating tumour DNA', or ctDNA. Patients who have ctDNA in&#xD;
      their blood have an extremely high chance of the cancer returning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using the blood test that we have developed we think that we can identify patients earlier&#xD;
      than normal. We think that some of the treatments that are used when melanoma cancer has&#xD;
      spread may benefit patients at this earlier stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to see if these patients with ctDNA in their blood, who have a higher risk of their&#xD;
      cancer returning or spreading, and receive treatment early have a better response to their&#xD;
      cancer compared to those patients who receive treatment when their cancer has returned and it&#xD;
      can be seen on a scan. This could mean we would be able to offer patients earlier treatment&#xD;
      in the future using just a blood test rather than a scan, while also providing reassurance to&#xD;
      those patients that do not have ctDNA in their blood that they do not need treatment and&#xD;
      their cancer is not returning.&#xD;
