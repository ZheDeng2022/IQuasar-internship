  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is a common complication after many upper motor neurone disorders. Many surgical&#xD;
      techniques have been introduced for patients with refractory spasticity though they are not&#xD;
      without peri-operative risks. Cryoneurotomy is another procedure which is cheaper, faster and&#xD;
      less invasive in comparison to other surgical interventions. While many studies support the&#xD;
      use of cryoneurotomy for pain relief, there are not much studies on use of cryoneurotomy to&#xD;
      manage spasticity. The purpose of this study to measure the effect of tibial nerve&#xD;
      cryoneurotomy on electrophysiological and clinical spasticity measures in adult patients with&#xD;
      spastic equinovarus or equinus foot, who will receive this procedure as a part of their&#xD;
      treatment based on spasticity treatment available guidelines. The results will provide us&#xD;
      valuable information like how long cryoneurotomy is effective, before regeneration happens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Different surgical techniques, including muscle and tendon lengthening and&#xD;
      neurotomy/neurectomy (surgical sectioning of a peripheral nerve) are reserved for patients&#xD;
      with refractory spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryoneurotomy which involves direct application of a low temperature probe to a nerve is&#xD;
      another procedure, which is cheaper, faster and less invasive than surgical intervention, for&#xD;
      the treatment of refractory spasticity. While many studies support using of cold temperature&#xD;
      in pain relief (Ilfeld BM, 2017, Friedman, T. 2012), there are not much studies on use of&#xD;
      cryoneurotomy to manage spasticity.This clinic has been using cryoneurotomy clinically with&#xD;
      empiric success for 2.5 years. The initial results reveal significant increased active and&#xD;
      passive range of motion in upper limbs and decreased clonus and improved gait after tibial&#xD;
      neurotomy in lower limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spastic equinovarus foot (SEF) which is a common type of lower limb spasticity is typically&#xD;
      treated with focal botulinum toxin injections, bracing and therapeutic exercise, although the&#xD;
      drawback of these treatments is the need for serial injections and frequent interactions with&#xD;
      health care providers. Recently selective tibial neurotomy has been shown to more&#xD;
      definitively treat SEF (Bollens B, et al.2011, Deltombe T, et al. 2015), but as mentioned&#xD;
      above this is an invasive approach. In light of our promising clinical experience with&#xD;
      cryoneurotomy, we propose to prospectively and systematically measure its effect on SEF, as&#xD;
      an alternative to more invasive surgical procedures and the typical multi-modal approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection fro this project which is a single-centre, prospective cohort study will&#xD;
      occur at the Victoria General Hospital (VGH) multidisciplinary spasticity clinic. Patients&#xD;
      with spasticity are referred to this clinic for different procedures including cryoneurotomy.&#xD;
      This study will not interfere or change the patients' medical care, and the assessments will&#xD;
      be done for the patients who are already candidates for this procedure as a part of their&#xD;
      treatment, besides other provided medical cares and have been accepted to receive that.These&#xD;
      participants will be invited to have an extra electrophysiological test for being enrolled in&#xD;
      this study, which will be performed before the procedure and at 1, 3 and 12 months after&#xD;
      cryoneurotomy. In addition, the results of their routine physical examinations including&#xD;
      spasticity degree and ankle passive range of motion will be collected in this study.&#xD;
