      Introduction Most countries imposed mandatory lockdowns that were rapidly lifted, however&#xD;
      Argentina holds the record for one of the longest quarantines in the world. General surgery&#xD;
      emergency conditions and trauma cases still require immediate evaluation and timely&#xD;
      resolution. The primary objective of this study was to analyze the variations in the&#xD;
      consults, surgical outcomes and severity of disease in admissions at our department of&#xD;
      general surgery and to study the consequences of the lockdown effect in our community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods An observational, ambispective study was carried out on a prospective&#xD;
      cohort of patients who consulted with on-call surgical pathology and required hospitalization&#xD;
      in the period from March 13th, 2020 until July 31, 2020 (PG) were included, analyzed and&#xD;
      compared with the same period of 2019 (CG).&#xD;

      intervention and the medical care and treatment of all participants that require it will be&#xD;
      carried out according to the current guidelines. The protocol does not contemplate any&#xD;
      procedure or study additional to the usual care of the patient.&#xD;
