      The objective of this pilot study is to design a companion booklet and pilot test it with a&#xD;
      voice-controlled intelligent personal assistant (VIPA), Google Home or Amazon Alexa, to&#xD;
      provide patients with skills and tools to help manage their social isolation. The companion&#xD;
      booklet is a document that will be created using feedback obtained from a panel of geriatric&#xD;
      experts, highlighting features of the VIPA that may be most beneficial to socially-isolated&#xD;
      older adults. It will be submitted to the IRB for approval once finalized. The specific aims&#xD;
      of this project are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Design a companion booklet to be used in conjunction with a VIPA (Google Home/Amazon&#xD;
      Alexa) for improving social isolation and communication among homebound older adults, defined&#xD;
      as someone who is unable to leave the home without assistance of a device or another person,&#xD;
      due to a physical or cognitive condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess the feasibility and implementation of the VIPA (Google Home/Amazon Alexa) and&#xD;
      the companion booklet and its impact on clinical and functional outcomes for older adults&#xD;
      with social isolation.&#xD;

    <description>For Aim 2, we will recruit a total of 20-40 older adult homebound patients who are likely to be socially isolated, through the Geriatric and General Internal Medicine clinics at Northwestern (over 2,300 homebound older adults) to use the VIPA and accompanying instructional booklet focused on social-isolation. Either the study PI or Research Study Coordinator (RSC) will visit the participant's home, or assist the patient virtually, once consented, to set up the Google Home or Amazon Alexa device for them and review the companion VIPA booklet with them.</description>
