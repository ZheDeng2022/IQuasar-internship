      This is a single center, open-label, fixed sequence, drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in&#xD;
      healthy subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following a 28-day Screening period, eligible subjects will enter the clinical research unit&#xD;
      (CRU) and will be enrolled into either Cohort A or B. Subjects in both cohorts will receive a&#xD;
      single dose of ecopipam on Day 1. On Day 7, subjects will begin taking a UGT inhibitor&#xD;
      according to their assigned cohort. Subjects in Cohort A will receive mefenamic acid 250 mg&#xD;
      every 6 hours for 7 days, while subjects in Cohort B will receive divalproex sodium ER 1250&#xD;
      mg once a day for 10 days. A single oral dose of ecopipam will also be administered to Cohort&#xD;
      A on Day 7, 1 hour after the first dose of mefenamic acid, and to Cohort B on Day 10, 1 hour&#xD;
      after administration of divalproex sodium ER. Subjects in Cohort A will continue taking&#xD;
      mefenamic acid through the evening of Day 13 and will remain in the CRU until discharged on&#xD;
      Day 14/ET. Subjects in Cohort B will continue taking divalproex sodium ER through Day 16 and&#xD;
      will remain in the CRU until discharge on Day 17/ET.&#xD;
