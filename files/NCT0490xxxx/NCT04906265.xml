    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial, including three intervention arms with different methods for&#xD;
      rehabilitation after hip fracture, conducted among persons with the need of rehabilitation in&#xD;
      their own home.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increase of the aging population challenges health care providers. Fragility,&#xD;
      oste-oporosis, and impaired balance are some major risk factors for hip fracture, an injury&#xD;
      causing morbidity, mortality, and loss of independent life. The aim of this study is to study&#xD;
      the effect of three different interventions for rehabilitation after hip fracture. The study&#xD;
      is designed as a randomized controlled trial. Patients 65 years and older, with hip fracture&#xD;
      that require rehabilitation at home, will be invited to participate in the study. Those who&#xD;
      accept to participate will randomly be assigned to one out of three intervention groups. The&#xD;
      first intervention includes rehabilitation according to High Intensity Functional Exer-cise&#xD;
      (HIFE) and standard follow-up. The second intervention includes HIFE and follow-ups by means&#xD;
      of a wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU). The control intervention includes standard&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocol and standard follow-up via home visits and phone calls. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is balance, in terms of postural sway measured with the IMU, and functional balance&#xD;
      measured with the Functional Balance test for Geriatric patients, secondary outcomes are&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, measured with the EQ5D and functional independence in&#xD;
      everyday activities, measured with the Barthel Index.&#xD;
