    <description>Treatment will consist of canakinumab (ACZ885) administered as a subcutaneous injection every 3 weeks for 3 cycles concurrent with standard of care concurrent chemoradiation, followed by canakinumab administered intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 12 total infusions concurrent with standard of care durvalumab. Canakinumab (ACZ885) will be dosed at 200mg via subcutaneous injection every 3 weeks x 3 injections that will start with concurrent chemoradiation, followed by 200mg via intravenous infusion every 4 weeks x 12 infusions that will start with the initiation of durvalumab. Canakinumab (ACZ885) will be concurrent with thoracic chemoradiation and durvalumab therapy for up to 15 cycles, or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.</description>
