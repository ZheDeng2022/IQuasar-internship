  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if a best practice alert (BPA) system&#xD;
      that prompts providers to consider the addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist&#xD;
      (MRA) in eligible patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) will&#xD;
      result in increased prescription of this guideline-recommended therapy. The system will also&#xD;
      inform providers about FDA-approved potassium binders for the treatment of hyperkalemia if&#xD;
      elevated potassium is a barrier for MRA use and will provide educational information on the&#xD;
      evidence for MRA therapy in these patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the robust literature demonstrating improved outcomes with the use of&#xD;
      mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection&#xD;
      fraction (HFrEF), MRAs continue to be underused in clinical practice. This underuse often&#xD;
      stems from the perceived risks of hyperkalemia, including a prior history of hyperkalemia and&#xD;
      acute or chronic kidney disease, as well as the cautioned use for those with potassium&#xD;
      greater than 5.0 mEq/L, as recommended in national societal guidelines. New potassium binders&#xD;
      have recently been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat&#xD;
      hyperkalemia. It remains unknown if a best practice alert built into the clinical electronic&#xD;
      health record can facilitate MRA prescription in eligible patients by providing&#xD;
      guideline-based information about MRA recommendations and evidence, as well as informing&#xD;
      practitioners about available treatments for hyperkalemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, open-label interventional trial to test the&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness of an EHR BPA system that informs practitioners about MRAs for&#xD;
      HFrEF and, if necessary, potassium-binders that are FDA-approved for hyperkalemia, versus&#xD;
      usual care (no alert, current standard of care). Fifty outpatient Cardiology and Internal&#xD;
      Medicine providers practicing at affiliated locations will be enrolled and undergo&#xD;
      randomization to either the intervention (alert) group or a control (usual care) group. Those&#xD;
      in the intervention group will receive an informational alert for their eligible adult&#xD;
      outpatients (those with HFrEF not currently prescribed an MRA). Those in the control group&#xD;
      will not receive any alerts and will continue to care for patients as usual. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be the proportion of patients with HFrEF who have an active prescription for an&#xD;
      MRA at 6 months following randomization.&#xD;

    <description>Providers randomized to the intervention arm will have a best practice alert appear for each of their eligible patients upon opening of the order entry screen in the patient's medical record. This alert informs the provider to the presence of HFrEF and absence of MRA prescription, notes the patient's current LVEF, and notes the most recent labs, including NT-ProBNP, potassium, and creatinine. Providers will also have access to a link to best available guideline recommended information regarding use of MRAs and a link to both an order set for prescribing an MRA and an alternate order set with option for potassium monitoring should hyperkalemia be a concern. If a patient is hyperkalemic (i.e. K ≥ 5 mEq/L), a link to an order set for prescribing a potassium binder will be provided instead. If a provider feels that the recommended therapy is not indicated for a particular patient, he/she can select an available reason from the list provided within the alert.</description>
