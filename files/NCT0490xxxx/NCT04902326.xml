  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with prediabetes can significantly reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (T2DM) by participating in a Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) or using metformin,&#xD;
      but very few patients with prediabetes engage in these strategies. This randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial will compare, among adults with prediabetes, the effectiveness of financial incentives,&#xD;
      tailored messages based on self-determination theory (SDT) principles, and the combination of&#xD;
      financial incentives plus tailored messages based on SDT principles in decreasing hemoglobin&#xD;
      A1c (HbA1c) and weight and in increasing participation in a DPP or use of metformin. Our main&#xD;
      hypotheses are that the mean decrease in HbA1c will be greater in the arm that receives a&#xD;
      combination of financial incentives plus tailored messages than in the arm that receives&#xD;
      generic health education messages, and that the mean decrease in HbA1c will be greater in the&#xD;
      arm that receives a combination of financial incentives plus tailored messages than in the&#xD;
      arm that receives financial incentives alone and the arm that receives tailored messages&#xD;
      alone. The study will also identify moderators and mediators of the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      interventions and evaluate facilitators of and barriers to scalability, acceptability, and&#xD;
      sustainability of the different interventions.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Automated educational text messages</intervention_name>
    <description>During the first two weeks, participants receive a series of educational messages delivered via text message. These messages welcome participants to the study, set expectations for the next 12 months, and establish a general level of knowledge among all participants on prediabetes, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), and metformin.&#xD;
For the next 11.5 months, participants receive three automated text messages per week that provide evidence-based educational content about prediabetes and tips on prevention. Additionally, participants receive monthly messages reminding them about their health insurance plan's coverage of the DPP at no cost and coverage of metformin as a low co-pay medication, and monthly messages providing feedback on their participation in the DPP and use of metformin in the previous calendar month. Participants' PCPs receive quarterly chart updates about participation in the DPP and use of metformin, and A1c results at enrollment and 6 and 12 months.</description>

    <description>Participants receive the same text messages as in the automated educational text message intervention, but the thrice weekly messages have been modified, where applicable, to support the participant's autonomy, in accordance with principles of Self-Determination Theory. Participants' PCPs receive quarterly chart updates about participation in the DPP and use of metformin, and A1c results at enrollment and 6 and 12 months.</description>

    <description>Participants in this arm have the opportunity to earn a financial incentive ranging from $50 to $250 per month for taking an evidence-based action to prevent T2DM (i.e., engagement in a DPP or fill of a metformin prescription) in the previous month.</description>

    <description>Participants receive twice-weekly tailored text messages that link evidence-based actions to prevent T2DM to the participant's self-identified top values, roles, and strengths. Text messages are also tailored, when possible, to participants' self-reported importance of taking action to try to prevent T2DM (i.e., participating in the DPP or taking metformin), confidence in being able to take such preventive action, and past preventive actions taken.</description>
