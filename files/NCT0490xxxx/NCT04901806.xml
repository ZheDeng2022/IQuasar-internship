      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1/2 open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, safety, PK, and&#xD;
      biomarker study of PBI-200 in subjects with NTRK-fusion-positive advanced or metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumors. Phase 1 will also include subjects with NTRK-amplified advanced or metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumors or refractory EWSR1-WT1-fusion-positive desmoplastic small round cell tumors (DSRCTs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 is the dose-escalation portion of the study in which the evaluation of safety and&#xD;
      tolerability and establishing the RP2D are primary objectives. Once the RP2D has been&#xD;
      established, two expansion cohorts will open to accrual, a Non-Brain Primary Tumor cohort and&#xD;
      a Primary Brian Tumor cohort.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Dose Escalation: Single-subject cohorts will be enrolled initially, until a subject has a Grade 2 or greater adverse event (AE), at which time a 3+3 design will be utilized. Dose escalation will continue until the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) is reached, or the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) is established.&#xD;
Cohort Expansion: Two cohorts will be opened to accrual. Cohort A will enroll subjects with a non-brain primary tumor and Cohort B will enroll subjects with a primary brain tumor.</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has one of the following solid tumors which has progressed on or following at&#xD;
             least one systemic therapy regimen administered for advanced or metastatic disease or&#xD;
             for which no approved therapy exists:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NTRK-fusion-positive, locally advanced (i.e., not amenable to surgical resection)&#xD;
                  or metastatic solid tumor Note: Subjects with any grade of malignant glioma&#xD;
                  previously treated with systemic therapy are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NTRK-gene amplified, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EWSR1-WT1-positive DSRCTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with NTRK-fusion-positive solid tumors other than primary brain tumors must&#xD;
             have previously received treatment with a TRK inhibitor, unless the subject does not&#xD;
             have access to TRK-inhibitor therapy (e.g., no TRK inhibitor is marketed and available&#xD;
             to the subject in the subject's country) or the subject has declined treatment with&#xD;
             available marketed TRK inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with NTRK-gene amplified solid tumors, primary brain tumors or&#xD;
             EWSR1-WT1-positive DSRCTs may have received prior treatment with a TRK inhibitor but&#xD;
             this is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 for subjects with non-brain primary tumors or&#xD;
             RANO criteria for subjects with primary brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with non-brain primary tumors must have previously received treatment with a&#xD;
             TRK inhibitor and a documented resistance mutation(s) (e.g., solvent front, gatekeeper&#xD;
             or xDFG mutation). Archival tissue from a prior biopsy taken after the subject&#xD;
             completed TRK inhibitor treatment but prior to additional systemic therapy may be used&#xD;
             to meet this eligibility criterion with Medical Monitor approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with primary brain tumors may have received prior treatment with a TRK&#xD;
             inhibitor but this is not required. Biopsies of brain tumors are not required for&#xD;
             eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy, biologic agent, investigational agent, or radiation therapy ≤&#xD;
             3 weeks prior to the first dose of PBI-200 (6 weeks for nitrosoureas).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with either primary brain tumors or brain metastasis must have completed&#xD;
                  brain radiation therapy 12 weeks prior to the brain MRI obtained within 4 weeks&#xD;
                  of the first dose of PBI-200.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Small-molecule kinase inhibitors or hormonal agents ≤ 14 days and within 5 half-lives&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of PBI-200.&#xD;
