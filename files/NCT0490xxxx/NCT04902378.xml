      This internal pilot trial will assess the feasibility and safety of a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial using the Tandem t:slim X2 pump with Control IQ technology in pregnant women with T1D.&#xD;
      If funding for a larger multi-centre trial is obtained, the effects of using the Tandem&#xD;
      t:slim X2 pump with Control IQ technology compared with standard insulin delivery (multiple&#xD;
      daily injections (MDI) or pump) and CGM on blood glucose control, quality of life, and&#xD;
      maternal and neonatal outcomes will not be analyzed as part of this internal pilot study so&#xD;
      that this data from pilot trial participants can be included in the analysis for the larger&#xD;
      multi-centre trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (T1D) require normal or near normal glucose in order to&#xD;
      reduce the risks of birth defects, stillbirth, increased birthweight, neonatal hypoglycemia,&#xD;
      neonatal death, preterm delivery and preeclampsia. Reducing maternal glucose is extremely&#xD;
      difficult due to an increased risk of maternal hypoglycemia. Only 14% of T1D pregnancies&#xD;
      achieve pregnancy guideline recommended glucose control, leading to complications related to&#xD;
      high maternal glucose exposure in roughly half of newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintaining recommended maternal glucose levels during pregnancy reduces the risk of adverse&#xD;
      neonatal outcomes to those similar in pregnancies unaffected by T1D. Most insulin pumps in&#xD;
      use today are open-loop systems, which means that the user must program the pump to deliver a&#xD;
      pre-set amount of insulin. These insulin delivery methods (MDI and open-loop pumps) are&#xD;
      usually inadequate to achieve the optimal glucose control necessary for T1D pregnancies and&#xD;
      they impart a large time, effort and emotional burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Closed-loop systems have been found to be effective in improving glucose control outside of&#xD;
      pregnancy when studied in children and adults. A new hybrid closed-loop system, the Tandem&#xD;
      t:slim X2 insulin pump with Control IQ technology, recently became commercially available.&#xD;
      Trials have demonstrated the efficacy of the Control IQ algorithm for non-pregnant adults and&#xD;
      children. Pregnant women were not included in these trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose the first pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate the Tandem&#xD;
      t:slim X2 insulin pump with Control IQ technology versus standard insulin delivery (MDI or&#xD;
      pump) and CGM in pregnant women with T1D. In this pilot trial, the investigators will aim to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility and safety of a pilot randomized controlled trial using the Tandem&#xD;
      t:slim X2 pump with Control IQ technology in pregnant women with T1D. If funding for a large&#xD;
      mulit-centre trial is obtained, the investigators will not analyze blood glucose control,&#xD;
      quality of life and maternal and neonatal outcomes as part of this internal pilot study so&#xD;
      that this data from pilot trial participants can be used in the analysis of the larger&#xD;
      multi-centre trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are grateful to Tandem Diabetes Care and Dexcom for in-kind donations to this investigator&#xD;
      initiated study.&#xD;
