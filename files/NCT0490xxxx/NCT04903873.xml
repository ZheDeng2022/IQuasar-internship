    <textblock>
      Phase 1 (Dose Escalation) of this study will assess the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT), and will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) of EU101 in participants with advanced solid tumors. Phase 2 (Dose Expansion) of&#xD;
      the study will assess the antitumor effect of EU101 in two indications including colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (CRC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
