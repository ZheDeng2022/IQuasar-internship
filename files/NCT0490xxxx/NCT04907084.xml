  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a study of the effect of serine supplementation and fenofibrate treatment on&#xD;
      serum deoxysphingolipid levels in patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel). This&#xD;
      study involves six arms. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following&#xD;
      treatment groups: serine 200 mg/kg/day, serine 400 mg/kg/day, fenofibrate 160 mg/day, both&#xD;
      serine 200 mg/kg/day and fenofibrate 160 mg/day, both serine 400 mg/kg/day and fenofibrate&#xD;
      160 mg/day, or no treatment (control group). Serum deoxysphingolipid levels will be used as&#xD;
      the primary outcome, and safety will be evaluated. The participants will be followed for 10&#xD;
      weeks, with visits at Screening, Week 0, 3, 6 and 10.&#xD;
