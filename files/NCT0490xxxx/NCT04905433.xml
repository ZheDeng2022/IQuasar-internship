      As an extension of previous work, in this study, a breathing retraining component is added&#xD;
      using breathing calisthenics and inspiratory muscle trainer for the classical cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation (CR), as an appealing option, to implement a comprehensive rehabilitation&#xD;
      protocol addressing the different patient-centered outcomes including different&#xD;
      cardiovascular, and respiratory complaints; increasing the benefits of classical CR;&#xD;
      detecting the impact of adding this on the cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, and discovering the&#xD;
      correlation between the CV and respiratory data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A very large number of studies have demonstrated the positive effect of cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation (CR) and pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) on morbidity and mortality. Globally,&#xD;
      each year millions of patients with different cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and chest&#xD;
      diseases are enrolled in these programs. The exact effects may be slightly variable, but&#xD;
      generally, both CR and PR aim to improve the patient's condition and improve the overall&#xD;
      quality of life utilizing almost the same methods (exercise, and education).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these positive effects, utilization rates of either CR or PR are around 30% in&#xD;
      Europe, with much less percentages in the Middle East. The reasons for the low engagement&#xD;
      rates are many; with most probably the main reasons are about individuality and reach.&#xD;
      Optimized CR programs have to be individually tailored; meeting the individual needs of every&#xD;
      single patient in the program. Worse knowing that the chest pain and breathlessness are&#xD;
      highly prevalent in general in CVD, and considered -in many cases as the chief complaint, and&#xD;
      the classical CR programs are neglecting these complaints; negatively affecting adherence&#xD;
      rates and patient-centered outcomes (PCO) which mostly extend much beyond the cardiovascular&#xD;
      complaints, to extend to the respiratory, and sleep complaints; questioning the reason why&#xD;
      breathing retraining methods are not yet considered as an integral part of the CR programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason that standard CR programs usually neglect these complaints, and only look for the&#xD;
      CV outcomes; is considering the other mentioned complaints as &quot;out-of-context&quot;. However,&#xD;
      solid evidence is suggesting a strong correlation between respiratory, sleep, and CV&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been previously investigated the impact of the CR on sleep, and there is a prior&#xD;
      estimate suggesting that 25% of the participants in the CR programs have already sleep&#xD;
      disorders, there is a strong correlation between the sleep and CV outcomes, and almost all of&#xD;
      the patients in the CR have respiratory symptoms including dyspnea and functional capacity&#xD;
      decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it was suggested adding a breathing retraining component using breathing&#xD;
      calisthenics and inspiratory muscle trainer for the classical CR, as an appealing option, to&#xD;
      implement a comprehensive rehabilitation protocol addressing the different PCO including&#xD;
      different cardiovascular, and respiratory complaints; increasing the benefits of classical&#xD;
      CR; detecting the impact of adding this on the CV outcomes, and discovering the correlation&#xD;
      between the CV and respiratory data.&#xD;
