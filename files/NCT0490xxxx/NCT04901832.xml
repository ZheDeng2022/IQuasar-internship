  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal replacement therapy is a treatment option for people who have acute or chronic renal&#xD;
      failure. A patient with increasing symptoms of renal failure is referred to a dialysis and&#xD;
      transplantation center early in the course of progressive kidney disease. Hemodialysis is one&#xD;
      of the most widely used dialysis procedures. Muscle cramps are the most common complication&#xD;
      experienced by hemodialysis patients that usually develop during and in between hemodialysis&#xD;
      therapy. These cramps appear to be the most common reason for the early termination of the&#xD;
      hemodialysis session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Research Question: Is there a difference in leg muscle cramps levels between patients&#xD;
      undergoing hemodialysis who received intradialytic stretching exercises compared to those&#xD;
      patients who do not receive these exercises?&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Hypothesis: Leg muscle cramp levels are less among patients undergoing hemodialysis who&#xD;
      receive intradialytic stretching exercises compared to those patients who do not receive such&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;

      Study Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-probability purposive sample of 60 patients undergoing hemodialysis. The sample is&#xD;
      divided randomly into two groups; 30 patients as study group are exposed to intradialytic&#xD;
      stretching exercises, and the other 30 patients are not exposed to the exercises considered&#xD;
      as the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Instrument:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effectiveness of the intradialytic stretching exercises program on the&#xD;
      prevention and reduction of leg muscle cramps among patients undergoing hemodialysis, the&#xD;
      researcher has adopted an assessment tool in order to achieve each of the study objectives.&#xD;
      This tool consists of three parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: Socio-Demographic Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A socio-demographic datasheet consists of (6) items, which include residency, gender, age,&#xD;
      smoking, educational level, occupational status. These variables are coded as preparation for&#xD;
      data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Clinical Variable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the questionnaire consists of (10) items, which include duration of&#xD;
      dialysis treatment, number of hemodialysis session per week, duration of hemodialysis&#xD;
      session, frequency of leg muscle cramps per week, site of leg muscle cramps, comorbidity,&#xD;
      level of calcium, body mass index, ultrafiltration rate, and ultrafiltration volume. These&#xD;
      variables are coded as preparation for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part III: Muscle Cramp questionnaire chart. The muscle cramp questionnaire chart is adopted&#xD;
      to assess the level of muscle cramps during hemodialysis, before and after the intervention.&#xD;
      This chart is used because it is an easy and valid tool, as it has been adopted in several&#xD;
      previous studies. It contains various features of muscle cramps such as the frequency of&#xD;
      muscle cramps, duration of muscle cramps, level of pain, temperature, and discomfort which&#xD;
      was comprehensively scored as the level of muscle cramps ranging from (0-13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Score Interpretation of Study Instruments :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four scores are used for rating the levels of leg muscle cramps among Patients undergoing&#xD;
      Hemodialysis in terms of no cramps, mild cramps, moderate cramps, and severe cramps. These&#xD;
      cramps levels are scored as (0) for no cramps, (1 - 4) for Mild cramps, (5 - 8) for moderate&#xD;
      cramps, and (9 - 13) for severe cramps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the body mass index, four scores are used for rating the body mass index categories&#xD;
      in terms of underweight, normal, overweight, obesity. These categories are scored as shown in&#xD;
      the following table from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (2020) Underweight:Below&#xD;
      18.5 Normal or Healthy Weight:18.5 - 24.9 Overweight:25.0 - 29.9 Obese:30.0 and Above&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection The Data Collection was done according to CONSORT 2010 Flow Diagram&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with age group 20-60 years, because it is the most common age group affected&#xD;
