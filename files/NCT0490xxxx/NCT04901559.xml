    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare short-term patient reported outcome measures (PROM) of&#xD;
      Bone-Quadriceps-Tendon (BQT) autograft with Semitendinosus-Gracilis (STG) and&#xD;
      Bone-Patellar-Tendon-Bone (BPTB) autografts following Anterior Cruciate Ligament&#xD;
      Reconstruction (ACLR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PROM used are Knee Injury and Osteoarthrithis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Tegner. Difference&#xD;
      in change in KOOS, KOOS subscales and Tegner from preoperative baseline to one-year follow-up&#xD;
      and absolute KOOS, KOOS subscales and Tegner at one-year follow-up were evaluated. All of&#xD;
      which were BQT compared to STG and BPTB, respectively. The primary outcome is change in KOOS&#xD;
      from preoperative baselinge to one-year follow-up. Other outcomes are secondary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis was that patients receiving the BQT autograft show similar results in KOOS,&#xD;
      KOOS subscales and Tegner as patients receiving STG or BPTB autografts.&#xD;
