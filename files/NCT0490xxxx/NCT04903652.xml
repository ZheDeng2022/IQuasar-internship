  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, single-arm, prospective phase II clinical study, which mainly&#xD;
      evaluates the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib maleate combined with oral vinorelbine in the&#xD;
      treatment of HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most important treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer is based on anti-HER2 targeted&#xD;
      therapy, combined with chemotherapy or endocrine therapy. China's original new anti-HER2&#xD;
      targeted therapy drug, pyrotinib, has obtained rapid approval from the country for its&#xD;
      outstanding phase II clinical trial efficacy. In patients enrolled in the phase II trial,&#xD;
      pyrotinib has a significant effect, but the combination of pyrotinib and capecitabine&#xD;
      significantly increases the adverse reactions of diarrhea. For this reason, there is a lack&#xD;
      of research on other combination schemes of pyrotinib in HER2 advanced breast cancer. In the&#xD;
      first-line treatment, the combination therapy (HN) of trastuzumab and vinorelbine has shown&#xD;
      that it also has a synergistic effect with vinorelbine in anti-HER2 targeted therapy. It&#xD;
      provides a good evidence-based basis for the trial design of pyrotinib combined with&#xD;
      vinorelbine soft capsules. This phase II clinical study is specially designed for preliminary&#xD;
      exploration.&#xD;
