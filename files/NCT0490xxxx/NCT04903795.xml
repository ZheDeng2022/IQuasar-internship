  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study of hEGFRvIII-CD3-biscFv Bispecific T cell engager (BRiTE) in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma (MG). The primary&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the safety of BRiTE alone and in combination with peripheral&#xD;
      autologous T-cell infusion in patients whose MG has an EGFR (epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor) variant III (EGVRvIII) mutation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A maximum of eighteen patients will participate in this study after undergoing undergoing&#xD;
      standard of care radiation therapy (XRT) with or without concomitant temozolomide (TMZ).&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a leukapheresis to generate autologous lymphocytes that may be infused&#xD;
      prior to BRiTE injection, pending tolerance of the BRiTE only injection. For newly diagnosed&#xD;
      patients, leukapheresis will occur either before initiating radiation therapy or after&#xD;
      completing radiation therapy, but before initiating adjuvant temozolomide. After completion&#xD;
      of a minimum of six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide, or at first progression, eligible&#xD;
      patients will receive a bolus BRiTE injection followed by a 14-day safety monitoring period.&#xD;
      If no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) or unacceptable toxicity occurs within 14 days, patients&#xD;
      will receive an infusion of activated cell therapy (ACT) derived from autologous lymphocytes&#xD;
      immediately followed by a second bolus BRiTE injection.&#xD;
