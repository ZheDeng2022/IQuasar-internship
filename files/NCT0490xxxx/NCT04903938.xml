    <textblock>
      Studies on Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD), in which criminal behaviors, aggression&#xD;
      and anger behaviors are frequently seen, are very rare. Developed by Nosrat Peseschkian,&#xD;
      positive psychotherapy is an eclectic therapy approach born from the psychodynamic approach,&#xD;
      existential-humanist approach, behavioral approach and intercultural therapy approach.&#xD;
      Psychodynamic psychotherapy is a humanistic, psychodynamic, resource-focused,&#xD;
      conflict-solving, integrative and intercultural approach that has its own unique intervention&#xD;
      methods as well as the features of other therapy theories. In this study, it was aimed to&#xD;
      determine the primary and secondary abilities of individuals with criminal and non-criminal&#xD;
      antisocial personality disorder within the scope of positive psychotherapy, to compare these&#xD;
      abilities with respect to healthy individuals, and to examine the effects on crime,&#xD;
      aggression behavior and anger levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antisocial personality disorder usually begins before the age of 15 and is characterized by&#xD;
      neglect and violation of the rights of others, impulsivity, aggression, apathy,&#xD;
      irresponsibility, and criminal behavior. Lack of empathy, anger, anger and hostility, and&#xD;
      confrontation with legal problems can be seen in those with antisocial personality disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies of antisocial personality disorder are scarce and focus predominantly&#xD;
      on all adults, especially young adults. The frequency of ASPD among adults in the general&#xD;
      population is estimated at 3.0% - 4.3%. Antisocial personality disorder is 3.5 times more&#xD;
      common in men than in women. Genetic and environmental factors play a role in the etiology of&#xD;
      this disorder. In addition, mental disorders such as major depressive disorder, generalized&#xD;
      anxiety disorder and substance use disorders are frequently encountered in these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with antisocial personality disorder often exhibit aggressive behavior.&#xD;
      Aggressive behaviors have been associated with risk factors such as low household income,&#xD;
      insufficient parental control, single-parent families, upbringing by antisocial parents,&#xD;
      neglect, and presence of criminal peer relationships. Modeling of aggressive behaviors can be&#xD;
      explained as part of the individual's problems related to the environment in which he grows&#xD;
      and his attachments, and by taking the aggressive behaviors witnessed as an example.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The positive concept is derived from the expression &quot;positum&quot; and means existing, real,&#xD;
      actual, given, real and concrete. This concept reflects the focus of the positive&#xD;
      psychotherapy approach because the method motivates the client's capacities to find out what&#xD;
      the symptom is doing to resolve the conflict and find a useful solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive psychotherapy is an eclectic approach stemming from psychodynamic approach,&#xD;
      existential-humanistic approach, behavioral approach and intercultural therapy approach. In&#xD;
      addition, positive psychotherapy is a humanistic, psychodynamic, resource-focused,&#xD;
      conflict-solving, complementary and intercultural approach that incorporates features of&#xD;
      other therapy-related theories as well as original intervention procedures. While this&#xD;
      theory, like other therapy theories, aims to treat disorders and diseases, it places special&#xD;
      emphasis on one's abilities and development possibilities. According to the positive&#xD;
      psychotherapy approach, although each person has such abilities, the intensity is different.&#xD;
      In this sense, although it is important in a positive psychotherapy approach to accept&#xD;
      problems and disorders as they are, it is also important to focus on things outside of them,&#xD;
      take into account any person's current abilities, and help clients realize their abilities&#xD;
      and capacities. Almost all consulting approaches can focus on this point. However, unlike&#xD;
      other approaches, the positive psychotherapy approach places a central emphasis on this issue&#xD;
      and puts it into practice within a meta-theory for the treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principles of balance, consultation and hope are the three basic principles of positive&#xD;
      psychotherapy. If the client continues to live a balanced life in key areas such as body,&#xD;
      success, contact and future / fantasy / spirituality, they gain a balance model. The&#xD;
      principle of consultation means that the client cooperates with the individuals around him to&#xD;
      solve his problems. The hope principle is that the client believes that they can solve their&#xD;
      problems and overcome them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive psychotherapy approach argues that people come to the world with two important&#xD;
      abilities: the ability to love and the ability to know. The ability to know manifests itself&#xD;
      in secondary abilities. Patience, time, love, trust, faith, hope, contact and tenderness /&#xD;
      sexuality are evaluated within the primary abilities. Secondary abilities include order,&#xD;
      cleanliness, punctuality, politeness, honesty, archievement, reliability, thrift, obedience,&#xD;
      justice and faitfulness. This type of therapy conception links the emergence of mental&#xD;
      disorders to the underdevelopment or overdevelopment of these abilities. The positive&#xD;
      psychotherapy approach focuses on the optimal use of these abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structured cognitive behavioral techniques, psychoanalytic psychotherapy, dialectical&#xD;
      behavior therapy, schema-focused therapy, and mindfulness-based therapy are used to treat&#xD;
      antisocial personality disorder. In addition to these intervention methods, positive&#xD;
      psychotherapy discusses the hypothetical statements regarding antisocial personality&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive psychotherapy explains that personality development takes place through abilities.&#xD;
      It is an important assumption that many skills suggested by this approach predict aggression&#xD;
      and anger levels in cases with antisocial personality disorder. Studies on aggression, anger,&#xD;
      and delinquent behaviors in studies conducted with individuals with Antisocial Personality&#xD;
      Disorder are available in the literature. However, there are no studies addressing these&#xD;
      behaviors within the scope of positive psychotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the researchers' knowledge, this study is the first study to examine the primary&#xD;
      and secondary abilities of individuals with criminal and non-criminal antisocial personality&#xD;
      disorder within the scope of positive psychotherapy and the effect of these abilities on&#xD;
      criminal behavior and aggression and anger levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is thought that determining the abilities of individuals with criminal and non-criminal&#xD;
      antisocial personality disorder within the scope of positive psychotherapy and explaining the&#xD;
      behavioral pathologies in these individuals will contribute to the literature. In this&#xD;
      context, the purpose of this study is to compare the primary and secondary abilities of&#xD;
      individuals with antisocial personality disorder within the scope of positive psychotherapy&#xD;
      with healthy individuals and to examine whether these abilities are associated with criminal&#xD;
      behavior, anger and aggression tendencies in individuals with antisocial personality&#xD;
      disorder. In addition, it is to bring a new perspective to the studies of those with&#xD;
      antisocial personality disorder and to provide a perspective for future studies. The findings&#xD;
      of this study can be used by therapists working with individuals with criminal and&#xD;
      non-criminal antisocial personality disorder in the process of positive psychotherapy and may&#xD;
      eliminate the gap in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the study, approval was obtained from the local ethics committee. Including&#xD;
      individuals who were older than 18 years of age, who were able to read and understand&#xD;
      structured interview forms and scale forms, and who were at the education level (at least&#xD;
      primary school graduate), who agreed to participate in the study, and who were diagnosed with&#xD;
      Antisocial Personality Disorder according to SCID-1 and DSM IV diagnostic criteria. has been.&#xD;
      Those under the age of 18, those who did not agree to participate in the study, those with a&#xD;
      comorbid psychiatric disorder according to SCID-1 and DSM IV diagnostic criteria, and those&#xD;
      with an additional medical disease were excluded from the study. The researchers interviewed&#xD;
      the participants face to face and provided information about the study. Participants were&#xD;
      given a structured interview form prepared by the researchers, the Wiesbaden Positive&#xD;
      Psychotherapy and Family Therapy Inventory that evaluates primary and secondary abilities,&#xD;
      the Buss-Perry Impulsivity Scale to determine the levels of aggression, and the Trait Anger&#xD;
      and Anger Expression Scale to determine the levels of anger. The data of the study were&#xD;
      obtained in this way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of the study data was made using the SPSS 15.0 package program. Number,&#xD;
      percentage, average and standard deviation values will be used in defining the data. Student&#xD;
      T test will be used for continuous variables in comparisons between groups, and Chi-Square&#xD;
      test will be used for comparing discrete variables. Pearson correlation analysis will be used&#xD;
      to examine the relationships between variables. A level of p&lt;0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
