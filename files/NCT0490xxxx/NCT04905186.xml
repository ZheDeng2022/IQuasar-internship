  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of different domains of executive&#xD;
      function (EF) during dual task walking condition on brain activation and gait performance in&#xD;
      healthy adults. There are two experiments will be conducted in this study. Experiment 1 is a&#xD;
      pilot study to determine the same level of difficulty in 3 EF domains, including inhibition,&#xD;
      working memory and cognitive flexibility. Experiment 2 is carried out to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of 3 different domains of EF which difficulties are controlled on gait performance&#xD;
      and brain activation in dual task condition. 10 subjects will perform Stroop test (2s/3s/4s&#xD;
      to change question), backward digit spans (3/4/5 digits) and naming test in Experiment 1. In&#xD;
      Experiment 1, the primary outcome is the correct response speed (CRS) while secondary outcome&#xD;
      will be the brain activity. In Experiment 2, 30 subjects will perform the single cognitive&#xD;
      task A (SCTA, Stroop test), single cognitive task B (SCTB, backward digit spans), single&#xD;
      cognitive task C (SCTC, naming test), single walking task (SWT), dual task A (DTA, walking&#xD;
      while performing cognitive task A), dual task B (DTB, walking while performing cognitive task&#xD;
      B) and dual task C (DTC, walking while performing cognitive task C). The CRS, gait&#xD;
      performance, brain activity and the dual task costs (DTC) will be recorded in the Experiment&#xD;
      2. Brain activities in prefrontal cortex (PFC), premotor cortex (PMC) and supplementary motor&#xD;
      area (SMAs) will be measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during this&#xD;
      study. One-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test will be performed to establish the effect of&#xD;
      different type of executive task on CRS or the brain activity. The differences of gait&#xD;
      parameters and brain activity in different condition in the Experiment 2 will be examined by&#xD;
      one-way ANOVA with repeated measured. Furthermore, the Pearson correlation coefficient will&#xD;
      be used to examine the correlation of brain activation and executive function performance or&#xD;
      gait parameters.&#xD;
