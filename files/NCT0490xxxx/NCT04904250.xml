    <textblock>
      A single center, prospective, outcome-assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial study&#xD;
      (CASH-ES) is designed to compare the efficiency of two different distal embolism protection&#xD;
      devices (SpiderFX and Emboshield NAV6) in during CAS procedure of patients with vulnerable&#xD;
      plaque.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CAS is an alternative to CEA for treating carotid stenosis with a similar efficacy in&#xD;
      preventing future stroke. High-intensity signal in the plaque on the TOF-MRA is associated to&#xD;
      a high risk of cerebral embolism during stenting. The evidence of protection selection in&#xD;
      such patients was limited. A single center, prospective, outcome- assessor-blinded,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial study (CASH-ES) is designed to compare the efficiency of two&#xD;
      distal embolism protection devices (SpiderFX and Emboshield NAV6) during CAS procedure of&#xD;
      patients with vulnerable plaque. Asymptomatic patients with internal carotid artery stenosis&#xD;
      ≥ 70% (NASCET) and symptomatic patients with a stenosis ≥ 50% who is over 70 years old,&#xD;
      diagnostic of vulnerable plaque on ultrasound or have a high-intensity signal in the relevant&#xD;
      plaques on TOF-MRA will be included. Patients are randomized in two balanced groups (1:1) to&#xD;
      receive CAS with either distal (Spider FX) or distal (Emboshield NAV6) protection. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint is the incidence of new cerebral ipsilateral ischemic lesions on the DW-MRI&#xD;
      within 7-days post operation. Secondary endpoints include the number, size, location of new&#xD;
      cerebral ischemic lesions on the DW-MRI, the counts of MES during TCCD monitoring during&#xD;
      procedure, procedural complications, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death within 7 days.&#xD;
