  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the clinical effectiveness in producing anesthesia&#xD;
      of the whole upper limb between two regional blocks - Selective Trunk Block (SeTB) and Hybrid&#xD;
      Interscalene Supraclavicular Brachial Plexus Block (hybrid IS-SC BPB).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brachial plexus block (BPB) is frequently used as the sole anesthestic technique for upper&#xD;
      extremity surgery. The choice of injection can be made from different approaches that often&#xD;
      depends on the site of surgery because the extent of sensory-motor blockade after a BPB&#xD;
      varies with the approach used. However, there is no single BPB technique that can&#xD;
      consistently produce anesthesia of the whole ipsilateral upper extremity. Nevertheless, cases&#xD;
      such as combined fracture of the upper humerus and forearm bones have to anesthetize the&#xD;
      whole upper extremity for surgery or those with multiple comorbidities and unfit for general&#xD;
      anesthesia. In these cases, multiple injections have to be made. Thus, a combined ultrasound&#xD;
      guided (USG) interscalene-supraclavicular (IS-SC) BPB has to be used as the sole anesthetic&#xD;
      for proximal humerus surgery but with a relatively large volume (35-50mL) of numbing&#xD;
      medication, which often exceed the recommended maximum safety dose. Recently principal&#xD;
      investigator has demonstrated that it is feasible to accurately identify majority of the main&#xD;
      components of the brachial plexus above the clavicle, including the three trunks, using&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging. As majority of the innervation of the upper extremity, i.e. shoulder,&#xD;
      arm, elbow, forearm, wrist and hand, originates from the three trunks of the brachial plexus,&#xD;
      principal investigator has proposed that selectively blocking the superior, middle and&#xD;
      inferior trunks of the brachial plexus under ultrasound guidance, will produce anesthesia of&#xD;
      the entire upper limb. Principal investigator refers this technique as selective trunk block&#xD;
      (SeTB). The preliminary experience with SeTB for anesthesia of the entire upper limb with&#xD;
      smaller volumes (25ml) of numbing medication is feasible and able to ensure total immobility&#xD;
      of the whole upper limb that meets the essential requirement for surgery. In this study&#xD;
      principal investigator hypothesizes that USG guided SeTB is not inferior to USG IS-SC BPB in&#xD;
      terms of its ability to produce sensory-motor blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the proportion of patients who develop &quot;readiness for&#xD;
      surgery&quot; for 30 minutes between a SeTB and hybrid IS-SC BPB. In other words, comparing the&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness in producing anesthesia of the whole ipsilateral upper limb between&#xD;
      SeTB and hybrid IS-SC brachial plexus block.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either a SeTB (SeTB group) or hybrid interscalene-supraclavicular BPB (IS-SC group) under ultrasound guidance. The randomization sequence will be generated using an online randomization software (www.randomization.com). The randomization sequence will be assigned as 1 = selective trunk block (SeTB group) and 2 = interscalene-supraclavicular BPB (IS-SC group). The group allocation will be prepared by a computer officer (third party) in the Department of Anaesthesia &amp; Intensive Care, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Patients in both study groups will not be able to see the ultrasound monitor during block placement and therefore will be blinded to group allocation. The &quot;outcome assessor&quot; (research nurse) will not be present in the procedure room during block placement and thus will also be blinded to group allocation. Dressings applied on the skin to cover the needle entry sites will also be identical in the two study groups. The anaesthesiologist (principal investigator) performing the allocated BPB will take no further part in the study after block placement.</masking_description>

    <description>Patients will lie flat on their back on the examination couch with the arm in neutral position and the head turned slightly to the opposite side. Ultrasound scan will be performed sequentially starting from the base of the neck (supraclavicular fossa) to the upper part of the interscalene groove. The unique sonomorphology of the C7 transverse process will be used as the key anatomical landmark to identify the individual elements of the brachial plexus. Under ultrasound guidance, local anesthetic agents (a mixture of 2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine and 0.5% levobupivacaine in a total of 30ml) will be injected at the interscalene groove and at the supraclavicular fossa in order to anesthetize the whole upper limb.</description>

    <description>It is one type of peripheral nerve blocks for upper extremity surgery. Patients will have an ultrasound scan and nerve block with local anesthetic (LA) agent (a mixture of 2% Xylocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline and 0.5% Chirocaine in a total of 20ml) injected at the trunks of the brachial plexus in order to produce the anesthesia of the whole upper extremity of the patients scheduled for upper limb surgery. SeTB will be performed as a &quot;two-injection technique&quot;. One at the side of the neck (interscalene groove) of the affected upper limb, injections will be made near the superior trunk (5mL) and follow by redirection of the needle under ultrasound guidance to inject the LA to middle trunk (5mL). Then the second skin puncture will be made near the upper part mid-collar bone (supraclavicular fossa) to inject the LA to the inferior trunk (10mL).</description>

Patients will have an ultrasound scan and nerve block with local anesthetic (LA) agent (a mixture of 2% Xylocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline and 0.5% Chirocaine in a total of 30ml) injected at the interscalene groove and supraclavicular fossa, so &quot;two-injection technique&quot; will be adopted. The first skin puncture will be near the side of the neck (interscalene groove) of the affected upper limb (15mL) and then the second skin puncture will also be made near the upper mid-collar bone (supraclavicular fossa) to inject 15mL of LA.</description>
