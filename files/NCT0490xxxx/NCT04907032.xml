      Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction: Urgency Urinary Incontinence (UUI) is a common condition with a prevalence of&#xD;
      9-31% in women in the United States. Despite current treatments, a high number of women have&#xD;
      symptoms refractory to first- and second-line treatment approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) and mirabegron treatment versus PTNS with&#xD;
      placebo on change in the number of UUI episodes over a 12-week treatment course. Secondary&#xD;
      aims include comparing the efficacy of combined treatment of PTNS and mirabegron versus PTNS&#xD;
      with placebo on improvement in urinary incontinence symptom specific distress and quality of&#xD;
      life related to UUI over a 12-week course of PTNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A total of 54 consented participants will be recruited and randomized with 27&#xD;
      patients in the PTNS with mirabegron (daily 50 mg dose for the 12-week course) group and 27&#xD;
      patients in the PTNS with placebo group. Demographics and baseline data will be analyzed by&#xD;
      student's t-test and chi-squared test or Fischer's Exact test as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We anticipate that combination therapy will prove superior to monotherapy for&#xD;
      reducing the number of UUI episodes over a 12-week treatment course.&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction/Background: Urgency Urinary Incontinence (UUI) remains a challenging clinical&#xD;
      problem for urogynecologists as they treat women and seek to find better therapies. There is&#xD;
      a wealth of literature addressing individual therapies for first, second, and third line&#xD;
      treatments for UUI. There are three main third line treatment options for UUI including&#xD;
      percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS), sacral neuromodulation, and intradetrusor&#xD;
      botox. At the current time, there are limited studies that have looked at a combination of&#xD;
      second and third-line therapy therapies for UUI. While some anticholinergic medications have&#xD;
      been studied in combination with percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) such as&#xD;
      solifenacin, tolterodine, and trospium, there is limited data on the combination of&#xD;
      mirabegron, a beta-3 agonist, and PTNS for treatment of refractory UUI. The studies that&#xD;
      looked at anticholinergic medications in combination with PTNS revealed improvement in UUI&#xD;
      compared to PTNS plus placebo. However, there are patients who do not tolerate&#xD;
      anticholinergic medications well because of side effects. A relatively new finding as&#xD;
      reported by the American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS) about avoiding anticholinergic&#xD;
      medications in women greater than age 70 secondary to increased risk for cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease is further impetus to conduct this trial [1].&#xD;
      The rationale for studying mirabegron in combination with PTNS versus PTNS plus placebo is&#xD;
      important as mirabegron does not have the significant side effect profile that&#xD;
      anticholinergic medications have and better tolerated in the older population. Therefore,&#xD;
      more research should be performed to evaluate the effect of the combination of mirabegron and&#xD;
      PTNS for refractory UUI. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the combination of PTNS and&#xD;
      mirabegron and compare that to PTNS plus placebo in the treatment of refractory UUI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Combination therapy of PTNS and mirabegron, a beta-3 agonist, will contribute to&#xD;
      greater improvement in the number of urgency urinary incontinence episodes as measured by a&#xD;
      3-day bladder diary compared to PTNS plus placebo in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: This is a randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy of combination therapy&#xD;
      with PTNS plus mirabegron to PTNS plus placebo in women with refractory urgency urinary&#xD;
      incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: The primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of combined treatment&#xD;
      of PTNS and mirabegron versus PTNS plus placebo on change in the number of UUI episodes at 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparing urinary symptom specific distress and quality of life over a 12-week course of&#xD;
           PTNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparing the side effect/adverse event profile of combined treatment of PTNS and&#xD;
           mirabegron versus PTNS plus placebo over a 12-week course of PTNS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparing the treatment efficacy and adverse events of combined treatment of PTNS and&#xD;
           mirabegron versus PTNS plus placebo in women &gt; 70 years of age as a sub analysis within&#xD;
           the study&#xD;

    <description>One arm of the study will receive PTNS combined with mirabegron. In the PTNS with mirabegron arm, the patient will take a 50 mg dose daily for 12 weeks of the trial. This arm of the study will have 27 patients randomized to this arm of the study. The percutaneous approach entails insertion of a 36-gauge needle electrode at a 60 degree angle approximately 5 cm or 3 finger breadths cephalad to the medial malleolus and posterior to the tibia. A portable electrical stimulator delivers an adjustable current in the range of 0.5-9 mA. The generators commonly are set for a pulse frequency of 20 Hz with a goal of creating a motor and/or sensory response in the foot. The stimulation sessions last for 30 min once per week for 12 continuous weeks.</description>
