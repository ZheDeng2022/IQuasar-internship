  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and PK of single and multiple inhaled doses of imatinib inhalation&#xD;
      solution (AER-901) in healthy adult volunteers. This study consists of 2 parts and an&#xD;
      optional third part:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A: double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (SAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part B: double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending dose (MAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part C (optional): an open-label, single-dose, 2-way crossover. Each part of the study&#xD;
           will include a 28-day screening period, a treatment period, and follow-up period.&#xD;

      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and PK of single and multiple inhaled doses of imatinib inhalation&#xD;
      solution (AER-901) in healthy adult volunteers. This study consists of 2 parts and an&#xD;
      optional third part:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A: double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (SAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part B: double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending dose (MAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part C (optional): an open-label, single-dose, 2-way crossover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to proceed with Part C will be made by the Sponsor after reviewing unblinded&#xD;
      safety and PK data from Part A and Part B of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oversight for the study will be provided by a safety review committee (SRC). The decision to&#xD;
      progress from Cohort A1 to Cohort A2 will be based on safety and tolerability data from&#xD;
      Cohort A1. The decision to progress from Cohort A2 to Cohort A3 will be based on review of&#xD;
      safety and tolerability data from Cohort A2 and PK data from Cohort A1 by the SRC. A similar&#xD;
      sequence will follow for subsequent progression decisions by the SRC for all the cohorts in&#xD;
      Part A and Part B of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each part of the study will include a 28-day screening period, a treatment period, and&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;
