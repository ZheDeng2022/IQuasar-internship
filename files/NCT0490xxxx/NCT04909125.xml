  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the difference in fatigue, quality of life and&#xD;
      radiation morbidity between hypofractionated and conventional radiation to the breast, chest&#xD;
      wall and regional lymph nodes post mastectomy or lumpectomy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Australia. Radiotherapy to the breast,&#xD;
      chest wall and regional lymph nodes for breast cancer after surgery can reduce the risk of&#xD;
      local recurrence by 50% and reduce breast cancer mortality. Traditionally, radiotherapy is&#xD;
      delivered in a large number of small doses i.e. 25 treatment sessions over 5 1/2 weeks.&#xD;
      Another approach is to give a lower number of larger doses i.e. 15 sessions over 3 1/2 weeks&#xD;
      (hypofractionated radiotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies in Europe and Asia have investigated hypofractionated radiotherapy to the&#xD;
      chest wall, breast and regional lymph nodes following surgery for breast cancer, and found&#xD;
      that it is equally effective to standard treatment, with similar side effects. These two&#xD;
      approaches have not been directly compared in Australia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is to compare these two approaches, to determine whether hypofractionated&#xD;
      radiotherapy is better tolerated by patients.&#xD;

    <description>Changes in patient reported fatigue at six weeks post commencing radiotherapy compared to baseline fatigue score. Fatigue score is rated as fatigue that interfered with patients' normal daily activities from &quot;all of the time&quot;, &quot;most of the time&quot;, &quot;a good bit of the time&quot;, &quot;some of the time&quot;, &quot;a little of the time&quot;, &quot;hardly any of the time&quot;, &quot;none of the time&quot; with the &quot;all of the time&quot; being the worst outcome</description>

    <description>Changes in patients' quality of life during radiotherapy and follow up period are captured by questionnaires. The questions are for examples how difficult is it in planning or being able to continue your usual activities?, how often have you felt low in energy? The score scales are from &quot;all of the time&quot;, &quot;most of the time&quot;, &quot;a good bit of the time&quot;, &quot;some of the time&quot;, &quot;a little of the time&quot;, &quot;hardly any of the time&quot;, &quot;none of the time&quot; with the &quot;all of the time&quot; being the worst outcome</description>
