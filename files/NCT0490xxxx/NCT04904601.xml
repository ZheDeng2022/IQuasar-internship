  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whilst obesity represents a key risk factor for the development of metabolic disease and&#xD;
      further premature mortality, the actual type of diet may provide the 'primary insults' for&#xD;
      inflammation affecting systemic health in the pre-diabetic state such as obesity.&#xD;
      Specifically, previous data indicate that a high-fat diet and/or unfavorable systemic lipid&#xD;
      profiles can impair metabolic health which may occur via inflammatory mechanisms. The study&#xD;
      aims to conduct a randomized interventional dietary trial with Freeze-dried Kale, as a&#xD;
      superfood, to reduce inflammation and improve lipid profile in patients with obesity. These&#xD;
      studies will analyze the effects of this superfood on metabolic changes among obese and&#xD;
      non-obese Saudi women. Our hypothesis is the inclusion of Brassica into the daily diet will&#xD;
      significantly improve metabolic health, microbiota composition, lower inflammatory insults&#xD;
      (inflammasome), and lower microbial translocation, with resulting improvements in metabolic&#xD;
      health. The team, therefore, proposes to examine the impact of the superfood kale on lipid&#xD;
      function (acute and medium-term) over a 4 week dietary intervention period to assess the&#xD;
      influence on metabolic change and biomarker changes. The team intends to utilize the&#xD;
      expertise from a broad spectrum of specialists from plant biologists, clinical and allied&#xD;
      health care professionals, and translational scientists, to provide a unique holistic insight&#xD;
      into the role of nutrition for metabolic health benefits in human participants. These studies&#xD;
      will provide us with the capacity to use a directly applicable dietary supplement,&#xD;
      freeze-dried Kale, to improve the health of people metabolically. As this is a natural&#xD;
      product, this will have the capability to reach the market much quicker and advance research&#xD;
      at a much faster pace. This dietary supplement will also provide an additional measure to&#xD;
      improve the health across the general public not just those at increased risk of disease to&#xD;
      help provide another way to improve health among Saudis.&#xD;

      Subjects Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study we will recruit a total of 100 obese age matched non-diabetic Saudi women,&#xD;
      (age 18-40 years; BMI 30-40Kg/m2) through college clinics in applied medical sciences&#xD;
      college, KSU. The study participants exclusion criteria in brief: age under 18 or above 40&#xD;
      years, any medical/endocrine problem that could affect energy expenditure (e.g. thyroid&#xD;
      problems, Cushing's syndrome); chronic inflammatory disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, or&#xD;
      long term use of steroids or other immunomodulatory like cyclosporine, azathioprine; severe&#xD;
      depression or any psychiatric illness, claustrophobia or needle phobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample and Data Collections:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry and body composition as well as biochemical data will be undertaken for all&#xD;
      visits, including blood, urine and stool collection. Serum will be collected all patients for&#xD;
      later analysis. All samples collected will be stored appropriately for biochemical analysis&#xD;
      within the Bio-Bank facilities, in the Chair for Biomarkers of Chronic Diseases in King Saud&#xD;
      University. All samples will be stored at -80oC following the appropriate protocol extraction&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to give either Kale (blanched freeze dried Kale) group1 or&#xD;
      placebo (Blanched Freeze dried Peas) group2. The supplements will be given as one scoop of&#xD;
      powder of (Kale or Green Peas) three times a day for a total of 10g/day. The follow up will&#xD;
      be for 6 week intervention. After visit 2 will be washout period for 2 weeks, to study acute&#xD;
      and medium effects, followed by a cross-over between the groups.&#xD;
