  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study include investigating the performance of HM242-Solution compared&#xD;
      to normal Saline with respect to venous leg ulcer healing. Saline is widely used for venous&#xD;
      leg ulcer cleansing and has served as comparator or standard treatment in clinical trials&#xD;
      evaluating new cleansing products to prove that it is as good as the standard treatment. Data&#xD;
      will also be collected on the patients' quality of life and any adverse events that may arise&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
