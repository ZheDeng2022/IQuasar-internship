  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Taiwan's community population is aging rapidly, and women in the aging community&#xD;
      account for the majority of frail elderly.In the process of aging, you must face changes in&#xD;
      cognitive function, sleep disorders, and emotional state. Female elders have more impact on&#xD;
      physical health than male elders. Precision nursing is a new trend in nursing in recent&#xD;
      years. It is based on individual differences in disease type, gender, lifestyle, family,&#xD;
      race, social and cultural factors, etc., to provide the most suitable empirical-based nursing&#xD;
      treatment. It can also prevent and delay disability in improving the cognitive function,&#xD;
      sleep quality and emotional state of frail female elderly in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: This study explored the effectiveness of precision nursing intervention program on&#xD;
      cognitive function,sleep quality and emotional state of frail female elderly in the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study utilized a quasi-experimental research design. The subjects divided to 35&#xD;
      persons of experimental group and 35 people of comparison group. The experimental group&#xD;
      implemented a weekly precision care program course for frail female elderly in the community&#xD;
      for a total of 12 weeks; the control group maintained normal daily life. We collected&#xD;
      cognitive function、sleep quality and emotional state from before and after intervention among&#xD;
      frail female elderly in the community. The statistical methods uses were descriptive&#xD;
      analysis, chi square, t test, generalized estimating equation (GEE), and&#xD;
      difference-in-differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefit: The precise care plan of this study can benefit the cognitive function,&#xD;
      sleep quality and emotional state of frail female elders in the community, and then extend it&#xD;
      to various aging communities. According to the characteristics of the community elders and&#xD;
      making good use of health policies and local resources, we will arrange and design&#xD;
      appropriate courses to create a localized healthy aging life circle, and achieve the goal of&#xD;
      preventing and delaying disability for the elderly and frail.&#xD;
