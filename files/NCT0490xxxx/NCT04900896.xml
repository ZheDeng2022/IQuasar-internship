      The objective of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic and functional gains of a&#xD;
      myoelectric elbow-wrist-hand orthosis for adult individuals with upper limb impairments using&#xD;
      repeated measures studies that combines both gross motion and quantitative function outcome&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic and functional gains of a&#xD;
      myoelectric elbow-wrist-hand orthosis for adult individuals with upper limb impairments using&#xD;
      repeated measures studies that combines both gross motion and quantitative function outcome&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes of this study will collect data on the participants' therapeutic and&#xD;
      functional outcome measures when using the MyoPro over time in their home. Baseline data&#xD;
      without the device will be collected prior to receiving the MyoPro. Data with and without the&#xD;
      device will then be collected at 2-weeks post fitting and then at 1-month intervals&#xD;
      thereafter for 12 months. These outcome measures will enable an understanding of the&#xD;
      participants' functional gains with and without the MyoPro and over time with the MyoPro.&#xD;
