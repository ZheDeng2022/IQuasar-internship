  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies confirmed that MARPE (Mini-screw Assisted Rapid Palatal Expansion) technique&#xD;
      resulted in transverse skeletal expansion without the undesired dentoalveolar compensations&#xD;
      or drawbacks. It also resulted in widening of the nasal cavity and zygomatic bone. ALT-RAMEC&#xD;
      (Alternate Rapid Maxillary Expansion and Constriction) in literature proved to be&#xD;
      advantageous over conventional RME in producing subluxation and sutural displacement to&#xD;
      facilitate maxillary protraction in skeletal class III growing patients.The current study&#xD;
      investigates the efficacy of a combination of MARPE/ ALT-RAMEC techniques to expand the&#xD;
      maxilla in adult cases of transverse maxillary deficiency. It compares the proportion of&#xD;
      success cases in patients who are treated with MARPE/ ALT-RAMEC to those treated using MARPE&#xD;
      (conventional). It also describes the circum-maxillary sutural displacement in patients&#xD;
      treated with both techniques, it hypothesizes that it will result in transverse skeletal&#xD;
      expansion as well as sutural subluxation and displacement in young adult ages, which may be a&#xD;
      sign of hope in the treatment of antero-posterior deficiency in adults without resorting to&#xD;
      surgery. It also will describe the dento-skeletal changes (the amount of dental tipping) and&#xD;
      the respiratory changes that occurred after applying the two different expansion techniques.&#xD;
      It will also compare clinically, the changes occur gingivally (Gingival recession and Pocket&#xD;
      depths) between pre-treatment and post-expansion periods.&#xD;

      Patient with functional or esthetic complain (malocclusion) attending Dental Clinics in&#xD;
      Al-Azhar University seeking orthodontic treatment, will be screened. Orthodontic young adult&#xD;
      patients with transverse maxillary deficiency (as a primary diagnosis) will be selected from&#xD;
      the list (by the study operator), based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. For this&#xD;
      research purpose all subjects, whatever their number, who met the inclusion criteria, will be&#xD;
      informed details of the expansion procedure, and about the whole study purposes, risks and&#xD;
      benefits. Patient who agree to be a part of this research work, informed written consent will&#xD;
      be taken from them. The patient will be divided randomly into two studying group, with a&#xD;
      control group, Group A: (MARPE/ Conven), who will receive MARPE with its conventional&#xD;
      expansion, and interventional group, Group B: who will receive a combination of&#xD;
      MARPE/ALT-RAMEC technique. This randomization process will be carried out by the study&#xD;
      operator using 30 sealed and shuffled envelopes, to blind both the operator and the&#xD;
      participants during assignment to the groups. When a patient selects a group name, the&#xD;
      operator will enroll him/her in the specific group list with allocation ratio 1:1 (15&#xD;
      patients in each group). Patient first visit (after assignment in the study) will take about&#xD;
      1 hour for preliminary evaluation, and T1 CBCT imaging. extra and intra oral assessment will&#xD;
      be carried out to assess the dentition, occlusion type, periodontal status, and oral hygiene.&#xD;
      Pretreatment CBCT imaging, gingival recession depths, and sulcus depths, will be taken as T1&#xD;
      records and interdental separating elastics will be used mesial and distal to 1st molars to&#xD;
      provide adequate space for 1st molar banding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then a second visit will be required for impression taking, where orthodontic 1st molar bands&#xD;
      will be selected and fitted properly in position for conventional alginate transfere&#xD;
      impression to be taken for appliance laboratory construction. After that, dental separators&#xD;
      will be reinserted again in their position. After which, and during the third visit (which&#xD;
      might be the longest, 2 hours visit) the appliance will be loaded intraorally after local&#xD;
      anesthesia infiltration using 4 mini-screws with previously planned length according to each&#xD;
      patient palatal bone and soft tissue height. Then immediate activations (2-3 initial quarter&#xD;
      turns), written hygiene, and activation instructions will be given to the patients in each&#xD;
      group. In Group A (MARPE/conven) (Control), patients will open 2 quarter turn (0.2 mm) in the&#xD;
      morning, and 2 quarter turn in the evening until overcorrection achieved. While in Group B&#xD;
      (MARPE/ALT-RAMEC) (Interventional), patients will open 2 quarter turn (0.2mm) in the morning,&#xD;
      and 2 in the evening in the first week, then alternate with closing 2 quarter turn in the&#xD;
      morning and 2 in the evening in the second week. And then continuing opening and closing till&#xD;
      end with opening in the 7th week and continue opening until overcorrection achieved. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed up every week (1/2 an hour visit) for assessment of oral hygiene and&#xD;
      interdental diastema appearance. In control group, if patients showed central diastema before&#xD;
      2-3 week , they will continue expansion till achieving overcorrection. But if they didn't&#xD;
      show diastema after the 2-3 weeks, they will be terminated from the study and referred to&#xD;
      maxillofacial surgery department for surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion (SARPE). In&#xD;
      MARPE/ALT-RAMEC group, if patients showed diastema before 7-8 weeks of alternating expansion&#xD;
      and constriction, they will continue only expansion till achieving overcorrection. But if&#xD;
      they didn't; they will be terminated from the study and referred to maxillofacial surgery&#xD;
      department for SARPE. All patients at the end of their expansion protocol, will get their T2&#xD;
      CBCT imaging and intra- oral measurements. Data collection from T1 and T2 CBCT records will&#xD;
      be done by the study operator and then will be repeated again after 2 weeks of complete data&#xD;
      collection by the same operator for data reliability. The patients who continue the expansion&#xD;
      will be followed up until overcorrection is achieved which would take about 1-2 weeks after&#xD;
      confirmation of median diastema event. The overall duration of participant involvement in&#xD;
      group A (Control) is about 3-4 weeks, while in group B (Interventional) it will range from 8-&#xD;
      9 weeks.&#xD;
