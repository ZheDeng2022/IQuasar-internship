  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reducing the nicotine content in combustible cigarettes to non-addictive levels has&#xD;
      demonstrated promise as a safe and effective public health strategy for decreasing&#xD;
      tobacco-caused morbidity and mortality. Little data are available, however, assessing how the&#xD;
      marketing of low nicotine content (LNC) cigarettes could dampen their potential population&#xD;
      health benefit. This study will examine LNC cigarette advertising content effects on message&#xD;
      recall, viewing patterns, product perceptions, and use behaviors. Young adults (N = 340; 170&#xD;
      smokers, 170 non-smokers) will complete a single-session laboratory study using a 2 x 2&#xD;
      between-subject design to manipulate advertisement messaging accuracy (true vs.&#xD;
      false/misleading) and content (implicit vs. explicit). Findings may be used to guide public&#xD;
      health policy decisions related to regulating cigarette nicotine content and marketing.&#xD;

    <measure>Attention</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Attention to areas of interest defined within the advertisement (e.g., cigarettes, Surgeon General's warning) will be captured with eye tracking software. Attention measures will be assessed in milliseconds using measures of latency (time to first view of specific regions) and dwell time (amount of time spent on regions of interest) obtained from eye-tracking equipment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Risk beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Risk beliefs will be assessed using individual items and a summary score from a previously validated 8-item scale. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;definitely untrue&quot;, 5 = &quot;definitely true&quot;) and will ask participants to compare the advertised cigarettes to &quot;regular&quot; cigarettes on the following statements: a) &quot;are lower in nicotine&quot;, b) &quot;are lower in tar&quot;, c) &quot;are less addictive&quot;, d) &quot;are less likely to cause cancer&quot;, e) &quot;have fewer chemicals&quot;, f) &quot;are healthier&quot;, g) &quot;make smoking safer&quot;, h) &quot;help people quit smoking.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Recall</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Recall will be captured using forced and open items. Multiple-choice format forced items will assess recognition of specific content (e.g., &quot;How much less nicotine is in the advertised cigarettes?&quot;) vs. bogus content, scored dichotomously (i.e., correct vs. incorrect). Participants will type answers to open item questions assessing general content (e.g. &quot;What was the overall message of the ad you saw?&quot;).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived health risks</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a 13-item measure2 asking them to indicate on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;very low risk&quot;, 7 = &quot;very high risk&quot;) their risk of developing 11 health conditions (i.e., lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, liver disease, emphysema, respiratory infections, other cancers, and addiction) after using regular or the advertised cigarettes, as well as two additional items asking them to evaluate overall risks of the cigarettes for themselves and for others.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Purchasing behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral economic indices of demand will be measured using a hypothetical purchase task. Participants will be asked how many of the advertised cigarettes they would purchase and consume in the next 30 days across a range of prices, from free up to high amounts at which purchase/consumption is expected to drop off.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attitudes</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Attitudes toward the advertised cigarettes will be assessed using the mean of an eight-item, seven-point semantic differential scale that asks, &quot;If the advertised cigarettes became commercially available in the next 30 days, which of the words below would best describe your use of this product?&quot; Items were a) bad/good, b) unenjoyable/enjoyable, c) unpleasant/pleasant, d) foolish/wise, e) difficult/easy, f) more/less harmful, g) not under/under my control, and h) less/more healthy. Higher and lower scores respectively indicate more and less favorable attitudes.</description>
