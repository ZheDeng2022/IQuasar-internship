  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main risk of developing cervical cancer is the persistence of an High risk human&#xD;
      papillomavirus (HPV-HR) infection, the mechanisms of which are still not understood. These&#xD;
      chronically infected patients could develop multi-site lesions. The main objective is to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility of setting up a personalized screening in patients at high risk of&#xD;
      cervical cancer (chronically infected with HPV), by evaluating documenting the acceptability&#xD;
      of these patients to be sampled from the ENT sphere and anal spheres for HPV analysis with&#xD;
      next-generation sequencing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening for cervical cancer (CCU) is based on a well-codified, organized national screening&#xD;
      program. However, unlike breast cancer or colorectal cancer, there is no personalized&#xD;
      screening for patients said identified to be at higher risk of developing UCC. In addition,&#xD;
      other cancers linked to HPV (papillomavirus), oropharynx and anal, were excluded from this&#xD;
      screening, including for high-risk patients. However, in France, HPV-related cancers in the&#xD;
      majority of cases concern the cervix (44%), in the majority of cases, but the anal (24%) and&#xD;
      oropharynx (22%) locations can no longer be neglected. An increase of more than 200% in the&#xD;
      incidence of oropharyngeal cancer was reported in the United States between 1988 and 2004.&#xD;
      There appears to be a significant association between certain some sexual habits and the risk&#xD;
      of multi-site HPV (+) carcinoma. However, several studies suggested that multi-site&#xD;
      transmission could involve simple self-inoculation. Therefore, we are interested in a&#xD;
      population particularly at risk of developing these viro-induced cancers: patients&#xD;
      chronically infected with HPV who will also be those likely to develop multi-site lesions. It&#xD;
      is established that high risk HPV are more widely involved in CCU, however, the causes of the&#xD;
      persistence of these HPV have not been clearly identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It therefore seems essential to continue screening for CCU in chronically infected patients,&#xD;
      taking into account the multiple possible locations. The characterization of HPV viruses in&#xD;
      terms of types, subtypes and co-infections is one of the key elements, determining the risk&#xD;
      of persistence and the risk of cancer. Also, the implementation of a multi-site screening&#xD;
      associated with a genotyping by high throughput or new generation sequencing (NGS) would make&#xD;
      it possible to understand the part of HPV in the persistence of the infection and to detect&#xD;
      the development of lesions at other anatomical sites.&#xD;
