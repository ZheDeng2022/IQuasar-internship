  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study in 24 subjects where half will be randomized to 10 treatments with&#xD;
      hyperbaric oxygen (HBO). It will primarily study pulmonary sequelae with imaging and&#xD;
      physiological measurements (low dose chest computer tomography (CT), Ventilation/perfusion&#xD;
      with magnetic resonance imaging (VA/Q MRI), cardiopulmonary exercise testing with pulse&#xD;
      oximetry (SpO2) and spirometry including diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). The&#xD;
      target patient group will be previously healthy whom have had covid-19 with lingering&#xD;
      symptoms past 12 weeks of recovery from the acute phase.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long COVID or Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) is current terms for&#xD;
      patients demonstrating fatigue, chest pain, exertion malaise, dyspnea, cognitive dysfunction,&#xD;
      and headaches, just to name a few symptoms that can last more than 12-weeks after the initial&#xD;
      infection of SARS-CoV-2. Pulmonary symptoms of dyspnea and exercise intolerance may be due to&#xD;
      pulmonary gas exchange derangement, which could be from hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction&#xD;
      (HPV) inhibition due to lingering inflammatory processes. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) has known&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects, shown in multiple organ systems, and recently reported in case&#xD;
      studies to improve outcomes of acute COVID-19 pneumonitis. If there is pulmonary inflammation&#xD;
      it is possible that HBO can improve pulmonary gas exchange by restoring HPV. To test this&#xD;
      hypothesis, we plan to perform a mechanistic study on V̇A/Q̇ matching in Long COVID patients&#xD;
      with lingering pulmonary symptoms. The etiology of symptoms is unknown, but it is probable&#xD;
      that the inflammatory processes associated with COVID-19 may inhibit HPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open, randomized, controlled clinical trial with hyperbaric oxygen therapy&#xD;
      delivered by a hyperbaric chamber as the intervention. Twelve patients will receive ten HBO&#xD;
      therapy (HBOT) over a 2-3-week period, and twelve patients will serve as controls and receive&#xD;
      no HBOT. Each HBOT session will administer oxygen (O2) at 2.4 atmospheres absolute pressure&#xD;
      (ATA) (100% O2) for 90 minutes in a hyperbaric chamber.&#xD;
