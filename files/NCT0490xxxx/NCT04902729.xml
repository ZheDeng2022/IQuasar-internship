  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal death worldwide. Oxytocin is the&#xD;
      most commonly used uterotonic drug for the active management of third stage labor, to reduce&#xD;
      the risk of PPH and help deliver the placenta. Carbetocin is currently recommended by the&#xD;
      SOGC (Society of Obstetricans &amp; Gynecologists of Canada), and is a relatively newer drug with&#xD;
      a longer duration of action. It has been previously demonstrated that women with elevated BMI&#xD;
      require higher doses of these drugs to induce adequate uterine contraction and dose finding&#xD;
      studies undertaken at Mount Sinai Hospital have shown that the ED 90 in obese patients to be&#xD;
      carbetocin 80 mcg and oxytocin 1IU. Furthermore, previous studies have indicated that the use&#xD;
      of carbetocin over oxytocin in non-obese popultion is associated with reduced bleeding and&#xD;
      requirement of additional uterotonic medications. No study has directly compared the two&#xD;
      drugs in obese parturients in a head to head clinical trial; therefore a double-blind&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial is necessary to show the non-inferiority of carbetocin against&#xD;
      the current standard of care at Mount Sinai hospital, which is oxytocin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity in pregnancy is defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI) above 30 kg/m2 and is often cited&#xD;
      as a risk factor for PPH after cesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health organization (WHO) recommends that uterotonic medications are routinely&#xD;
      administered at cesarean delivery for the active management of the third stage of labor, both&#xD;
      to facilitate delivery of the placenta and to reduce the risk of PPH. The optimal regimen for&#xD;
      active management of third stage of labor is yet to be fully determined and obesity adds&#xD;
      another layer of complexity and risk, with higher doses required to induce adequate uterine&#xD;
      contraction. While oxytocin is the most commonly used drug world-wide, multiple agents are&#xD;
      available and there is no clear consensus as to which drug should be first choice. Multiple&#xD;
      studies have shown that carbetocin is associated with reduced post-partum bleeding, need for&#xD;
      blood transfusion and additional uterotonic medications, in the non-obese population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will provide evidence on the non-inferiority of carbetocin when&#xD;
      compared directly to the current standard of care at Mount Sinai hospital, which is oxytocin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that when administered in equipotent doses, carbetocin would be&#xD;
      non-inferior to oxytocin in women with BMI ≥40 kg/m2 undergoing elective cesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to prove that the difference between uterine tone elicited by&#xD;
      carbetocin falls within the inferiority margin of -1.2 using a verbal numerical rating score.&#xD;
