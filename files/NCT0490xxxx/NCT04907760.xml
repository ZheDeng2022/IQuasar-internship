  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, the global prevalence of diabetes was estimated to 5% of the population in 2016,&#xD;
      the type two diabetes (DT2) corresponding to 90% of cases. This number is widely&#xD;
      underestimated because most people are untreated and undiagnosed. Due to the silent character&#xD;
      of this disease, it is estimated that 20 à 30 % of diabetic adults have not yet been&#xD;
      diagnosed. The conclusions, presented during the annual meeting of EASD in 2019, suggest that&#xD;
      the precursor signs of this disease could be present until 20 years before the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is a metabolic disease and people are diagnosed, in general, around 40-50 years old.&#xD;
      The main risk factor of type II diabetes is lifestyle (rich diet, sedentary) but there is&#xD;
      also other factors like hyperlipidemia, high blood pressure, high fasting blood sugar,&#xD;
      stress, smoking, heredity, family history of diabetes, or gestational diabetes. This induces&#xD;
      an increase of obesity, itself a major risk factor for type II diabetes occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From an economical aspect, chronic pathologies (including diabetes) represent 60% of health&#xD;
      insurance expenses, even though it concerns 35% of insured persons, i.e. 20 million of&#xD;
      patients. The average of annual reimbursement for a type 2 diabetic patient is 4890 euros. In&#xD;
      this context, this study is the first step of thinking about a different, coordinated care&#xD;
      approach, based on a preventive rather than curative approach.&#xD;

      This study includes a personalized care program, including the patient follow-up by a nurse&#xD;
      during 5 years with a contact every 4 months for the first year, then after every 6 months.&#xD;
      The nurse will review the patient's progress and provide advice and contact with&#xD;
      professionals: physical activity, psychologists, dieticians, endocrinologists, etc The main&#xD;
      objective of this study is to compare, after 5 years of follow-up, the risk factors&#xD;
      associated with type 2 diabetes, between participants who received personalized follow-up and&#xD;
      those who did not. The secondary objectives are to compare the occurrence of type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      the quality of life and the compliance to the program between participants who received&#xD;
      personalized follow-up and those who did not.&#xD;
