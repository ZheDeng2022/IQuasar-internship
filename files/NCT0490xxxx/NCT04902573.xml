      TriMaximize, a non-interventional trial aims to collect prospective, longitudinal data from&#xD;
      asthma patients under routine care, for whom their treating physician has decided to&#xD;
      prescribe Trimbow® (beclometasone/formoterol/glycopyrronium).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trimbow is a fixed triple therapy containing a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA,&#xD;
      glycopyrronium), a long-acting beta-adrenergic agonist (LABA, formoterol) and an inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroid (ICS, beclometasone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma patients often need to use multiple inhalers as part of their therapy, which require&#xD;
      different inhalation techniques. It has been shown that the use of several inhalers of&#xD;
      different mode of action, design and dosage requirements may have a detrimental effect on&#xD;
      patient adherence and subsequent treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective, non-interventional trial, the investigators aim to evaluate aspects of&#xD;
      adherence to Trimbow, a single-inhaler triple therapy (SITT) as a maintenance treatment of&#xD;
      asthma, to gather knowledge from routine care on whether appropriate step-up to SITT leads to&#xD;
      greater adherence and better health outcomes.&#xD;
