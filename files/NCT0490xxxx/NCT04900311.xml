      The study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy, and safety of pyrotinib versus&#xD;
      pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and nab-paclitaxel for neoadjuvant treatment in&#xD;
      HER2+ early or locally advanced breast cancer patients. To explore whether pyrotinib regimen&#xD;
      could provide better clinical results compared with pertuzumab in the study population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, controlled trial. Eligible patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to neoadjuvant pyrotinib or pertuzumab containing regimen every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for four cycles before surgery. Randomization was stratified by the following factors:&#xD;
      hormone receptor status and primary tumor size. After completing four cycles of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment, all patients who are eligible for surgery will undergo surgery and have their&#xD;
      pathologic response evaluated. Following surgery, patients will receive 90-100 mg/m2&#xD;
      epirubicin and 600 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Clinicians will select&#xD;
      subsequent treatments for patients based on guidelines as well as clinical practice at each&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
