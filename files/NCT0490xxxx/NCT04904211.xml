  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      a multicenter single-arm feasibility and safety study of home-based intensive chemotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia and their quality of life and&#xD;
      psychological wellbeing. This national study included patients from six sites in Denmark who&#xD;
      received intensive chemotherapy on programmed CADD Solis infusion pumps through a central&#xD;
      venous catheter and were also managed as outpatients during treatment-induced pancytopenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This national single-arm feasibility cohort study was conducted at six hematology departments&#xD;
      at six university hospitals in Denmark: Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet;&#xD;
      Herlev/Gentofte Hospital; Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde; Odense University Hospital;&#xD;
      Aarhus University Hospital, and Aalborg University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project nurse at each site approached and recruited participants from October 2017 to&#xD;
      August 2020. The participants were explicitly evaluated for their ability to manage their&#xD;
      symptoms, administer oral medication, eat and drink sufficiently, and practice good personal&#xD;
      hygiene. Eligible participants received oral and written information and provided written&#xD;
      informed consent before inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included participants received intensive chemotherapy treatment on a CADD pump through their&#xD;
      CVC. The CADD pump is unique because it is portable, carried in a small bag or backpack, and&#xD;
      applicable for home-based treatment due to its intuitive and user-friendly interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient educational program based on strategic patient involvement was integrated into&#xD;
      supportive care practice during induction treatment at each hematology department. The&#xD;
      program included guidance and training to the patient and/or their primary caregiver in&#xD;
      managing the care of their CVC including drawing blood samples, how to use a positive&#xD;
      expiratory pressure whistle, functionality of the infusion pump, how to manage and react on&#xD;
      pump alarm, and precautions when receiving treatment while being home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants could contact the hematological department from where they received their&#xD;
      treatment 24 hours a day by telephone. They were instructed to contact their respective&#xD;
      department immediately if fever (&gt;38.0 Celcius) or any pump report alarm occurred. The nurses&#xD;
      would then guide the participant to solve the problem from home or recommend they seek help&#xD;
      at the department to solve the problem or get evaluated by a doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events were categorized into non-serious adverse events and serious adverse events.&#xD;
      Non-serious adverse events were any pump infusion alarms that could not be solved by phone&#xD;
      and required a visit to the hospital. Serious adverse events were any adverse reactions&#xD;
      during treatment at home, which resulted in the following outcomes: death or septic shock.&#xD;

        condition (delirium or severe depression), or in case of transition to terminal care or if&#xD;
