  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      35 participants will be recruited from a list of patients who are scheduled, as part of their&#xD;
      routine NHS care, to have a clinically-indicated outpatient hysteroscopy for assessment of&#xD;
      their uterine cavity. The participants will be women from the age of 18 up to the age of 40&#xD;
      who are undergoing hysteroscopy investigation. All participants included in the study require&#xD;
      at least one ultrasound scan, within the preceding 5 years, demonstrating the presence of a&#xD;
      normal uterine cavity devoid of uterine anomalies such as a septate uterus or intrauterine&#xD;
      fibroids (which may affect endometrial blood flow measurements). It is usual for a patients&#xD;
      to have an ultrasound assessment prior to hysteroscopy therefore we do not anticipate this&#xD;
      requirement limiting the number of eligible participants available.&#xD;

      Patient registry: Recruited patients will be registered on 'Edge', a secure,&#xD;
      password-protected, database for study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the investigators will comply with the requirements of the GDPR 2018 with regards to the&#xD;
      storage, processing and disclosure of personal information and will uphold the Act's core&#xD;
      principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to patient-identifiable data will be restricted to the core patient-facing members of&#xD;
      the research team at Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital. The patient-facing members&#xD;
      will be the Chief Investigator (ME), the Principal Investigator (JC), and co-investigator&#xD;
      (HH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves depersonalised data and the data will be maintained within secure servers.&#xD;
      The Birmingham Women's Hospital Research and Development department will hold an archived&#xD;
      copy of the study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chief Investigator (ME) and the Principal Investigator (JC) will act as data custodians&#xD;
      and keep the site file locked away securely with restricted access to study data for 25&#xD;
      years. Only the aforementioned members of the research team will have access to the site file&#xD;
      for the purpose of quality control, audit and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coded, depersonalised data will be created and used for study documents, in place of&#xD;
      participant-identifying information. The participant data within the study and the code&#xD;
      linking this data to the individual's true identity and identifiable data will be kept in&#xD;
      separate locations using encrypted digital files within password-protected folders and&#xD;
      storage media&#xD;
