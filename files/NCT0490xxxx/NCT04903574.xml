  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy outcomes, such as excessive gestational weight gain and gestational diabetes, are&#xD;
      linked to long and short-term maternal and child health. Interventions aimed at improving&#xD;
      health behaviors, such as sedentary behavior (SB; i.e., any behavior in a seated or reclining&#xD;
      position with low energy expenditure) are attractive because they are low-cost, can be&#xD;
      disseminated in a wide variety of populations once pregnancy begins, and do not require drugs&#xD;
      or prescriptions. Studies have linked SB to some pregnancy outcomes. To the investigators'&#xD;
      knowledge, no studies have tested the efficacy of an intervention to reduce SB in pregnant&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 90% of reproductive aged women own a smartphone with similar rates of ownership among&#xD;
      black, white, and Hispanic/Latina women, and most adults carry smartphones while awake.&#xD;
      Smartphones can monitor SB without additional equipment. Thus, smartphones offer a&#xD;
      streamlined opportunity to intervene on SB. The purpose of the research is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and perception of an mHealth intervention aimed at changing SB in pregnant&#xD;
      women. Investigators will survey providers regarding their SB opinions and counseling&#xD;
      practices&#xD;

      Investigators will recruit 28 pregnant women, 14 per arm, to participate in this pilot&#xD;
      randomized, controlled study. Particiants will complete an in-person baseline study visit in&#xD;
      early pregnancy (&lt; week 16). The visit will occur in the Public Health Research Center,&#xD;
      Discovery Building, or at a Prisma Health facility. Measurements at the in-person visit (~ 1&#xD;
      hr) include demographics, surveys regarding current and pre-pregnancy PA and SB, medical and&#xD;
      pregnancy history, height, and weight. All participants will be given an activPAL(TM)&#xD;
      (Glasgow, UK) at V1 to objectively measure SB for 1 week using gold-standard methodology. At&#xD;
      the end of the 1-week run-in period (i.e., the week during which SB is objectively measured&#xD;
      prior to randomization), participants will mail back the activPAL(TM) and be randomized to&#xD;
      the mHealth SB intervention or control group for 12 weeks. SB will be objectively measured&#xD;
      again using the activPAL(TM) from week 11-12 of the study. Surveys (Nausea and Vomiting of&#xD;
      Pregnancy, Global Health Scales, inquiry about new diagnoses) will be administered remotely&#xD;
      in week 5 and week 11. A recruitment opinion survey will be administered remotely in week 5&#xD;
      to inform future recruitment efforts. Surveys related to the intervention platform and&#xD;
      perceived effectiveness will be administered remotely at week 12 to participants in the&#xD;
      experimental group. Investigators will ask about new diagnoses or adverse events at week 5&#xD;
      and week 11. Investigators will link to participants' medical charts and abstract in-clinic&#xD;
      body weight, the results of the third trimester glucose tolerance test, and any other&#xD;
      pregnancy-related diagnoses. Investigators will survey Ob/Gyn clinicians (doctors, residents,&#xD;
      and nurses) regarding their perceptions of SB during pregnancy.&#xD;
