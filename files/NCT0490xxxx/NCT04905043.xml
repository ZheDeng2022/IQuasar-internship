  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-period study done under fasting conditions. Participants will receive an oral&#xD;
      wireless motility/pH capsule (SmartPill®) followed immediately by a single 100 mg oral dose&#xD;
      of acalabrutinib on Day 1 of Period 1 and Period 2 (ie, Day 1 and Day 4, respectively). There&#xD;
      will be 72 hours of washout between Day 1 dosing of each period. Participants will be&#xD;
      contacted approximately 14 days after the last dose of study drug for adverse events.&#xD;
