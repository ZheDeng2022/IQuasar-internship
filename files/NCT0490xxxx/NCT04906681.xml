  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation technology is more and more implemented in conventional therapy to increase&#xD;
      the dosage of therapy and/or increase patient's motivation towards therapy. In orthopedic as&#xD;
      well as neurological rehabilitation it is important to exercise with enough intensity and&#xD;
      repetitions to improve functional performance in activities of daily life, and consequently&#xD;
      quality of life. At the moment, not all (rehabilitation) technologies are adapted towards the&#xD;
      wishes and needs of both patients and therapists for everyday use in the clinical setting.&#xD;
      Also, not all technologies are fit for independent use by the patients. Researcher of PXL&#xD;
      have developed a Kinect-based system (i.e. i-ACT) for rehabilitation and performed supervised&#xD;
      research with i-ACT in neurological and musculoskeletal rehabilitation, and older adults.&#xD;
      Within this research, patients will exercise with i-ACT under supervision of their therapist&#xD;
      during weekdays, but in the weekends they will be motivated by the medical staff to perform&#xD;
      their exercises with i-ACT. The medical staff will be present for safety reasons, but the&#xD;
      patient is asked to use and exercise with i-ACT as independent as possible. The aim of this&#xD;
      research is to explore to which extend i-ACT is suitable for semi-independent use by patients&#xD;
      in orthopedic or neurological rehabilitation.&#xD;

    <measure>Intrinsic Motivation Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) is a multidimensional measurement questionnaire intended to assess participants' subjective experience with, in this, i-ACT. The IMI consists of 6 subscales in which a person scores on a scale from 1 (totally not true) to 7 (totally true). Some scores need to be reversed by subtracting the response score from 8. A total IMI-score is not recommended, therefore subscale scores are used in the analyses. A higher score means a higher level of the aspect of the subscale.</description>
