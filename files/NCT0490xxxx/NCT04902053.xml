  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the INSPIRIS RESILIA Aortic Valve-in-valve (ViV) Surveillance Study&#xD;
      (&quot;the Study&quot;) is to capture Adverse Event information and valve measurement data from&#xD;
      dysfunctional INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valves before and after Valve-in-valve (ViV) treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, non-blinded cohort study with no active concurrent&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least fifty (50) Subjects with dysfunctional 19mm-25mm INSPIRIS aortic valves, who are&#xD;
      determined to need ViV placement of an approved Edwards transcatheter aortic heart valve,&#xD;
      will participate in this study. Sizes 27mm and 29mm valves are not candidates for&#xD;
      surveillance under this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be followed for up to 3 months after the TAVR ViV procedure.&#xD;
