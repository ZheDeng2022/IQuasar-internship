      The proposed project will examine the effects of a healing touch intervention in women&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy and radiation for advanced cervical cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receiving chemoradiation for cervical cancer are at risk for distress,&#xD;
      chemoradiation-related side effects, and immunosuppression. This prospective randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial proposes to examine the effects of a complementary therapy, Healing Touch&#xD;
      (HT), versus relaxation training (RT) and usual care (UC) for (1) supporting cellular&#xD;
      immunity, (2) improving mood and quality of life (QOL), and (3) reducing treatment-associated&#xD;
      toxicities and treatment delay in cervical cancer patients receiving chemoradiation.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in metabolomic measures</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Compare metabolic profile of participants receiving HT during radiation and chemotherapy treatment to participants receiving relaxation training or usual care. Samples were assayed using Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS). The metabolomic profiling analysis measures the quantity of specific compounds in the plasma vs. a platform of 844 known metabolites in a commercial platform powered by Metabolon, Inc. For any specific metabolite, higher levels indicates greater presence of the metabolite.</description>
