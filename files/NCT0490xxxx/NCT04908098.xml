  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is an infectious disease that causes destruction of periodontal tissues with&#xD;
      complex etiology that develops due to local and systemic factors. Host-derived enzymes,&#xD;
      cytokines and proinflammatory markers are the main elements that play a role in this&#xD;
      degradation. New techniques such as non-surgical or surgical methods combined with laser&#xD;
      application are used for its treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects were divided into two groups as &quot;Individuals Applied with Diode Laser in&#xD;
      Addition to Non-Surgical Periodontal Treatment&quot; (Laser group) and &quot;Individuals with&#xD;
      Non-Surgical Periodontal Treatment (SRP)&quot; (Control group). While only non-surgical&#xD;
      periodontal treatment was applied to individuals in the control group; In the laser group,&#xD;
      diode laser was applied in addition to this treatment. All individuals were examined 1 and 3&#xD;
      months after treatment.The scaling root planing (SRP) procedure was performed mechanically&#xD;
      with gracey curettes under local anesthesia. The diode laser applied to the study group was&#xD;
      applied parallel to the gingival sulcus at 0.80W power, 940 nm wavelength and 0.80 J / s&#xD;
      energy level in continuous phase. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples were taken without&#xD;
      any procedure in order not to change the amount and content. All clinical parameters were&#xD;
      also measured by the same investigator before SRP and in all participants. After this&#xD;
      treatment, the participants were re-examined in the 1st and 3rd months for control purposes&#xD;
      and GCF samples were taken from the same regions again and the clinical parameters were&#xD;
      measured again by the same researcher. GCF samples were stored at -20 degrees Celsius until&#xD;
      ELISA studies were performed. Clinical parameters (pocket depth, clinical attachment loss,&#xD;
      bleeding on probing, gingival index, plaque index) and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF)&#xD;
      sampling were obtained at each control. IL-1β, IL-10, IL-17, OPG, RANKL, TWEAK, Sclerostin&#xD;
      levels in GCF samples were measured with ELISA method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of diode laser application in addition&#xD;
      to non-surgical treatment in periodontitis treatment clinically and biochemically and to&#xD;
      assess the potential biomarkers for use.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome of the study was the control examination performed 3 months after the first examination. At the 3rd month control, the same researcher measured clinical parameters from all patients</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Probing depth is the measurement from the free gingival margin, to the base of the pocket in millimeters of the distance. Periodontal probe is used.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary outcome of the study is the recording of bleeding index in the 3rd month.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The bleeding index is evaluated as positive if there is bleeding in the gingiva during probing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Another outcome of the study is the collection of gingival crevicular fluid samples in the 3rd month.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Samples are obtained by means of paper strips placed gently in the gingival groove. These samples are stored at -20 ° C for later analysis by ELISA method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary outcome of the study is a measure of the clinical attachment level.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The distance in millimeters from the cemento enamel junction to the bottom of the pocket.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary outcome of the study is the recording of gingival index in the 3rd month.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The gingival index is graded as follows:&#xD;
0 = Normal gingiva&#xD;
= Mild inflammationslight change in color, slight oedema. No bleeding on probing&#xD;
= Moderate inflammation redness, oedema and glazing. Bleeding on probing&#xD;
= Severe inflammation marked redness and oedema. Ulceration. Tendency to spontaneous bleeding.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary outcome of the study is the recording of plaque index in the 3rd month.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The plaque index is graded as follows:&#xD;
0 = No plaque in the gingival area.&#xD;
= A film of plaque adhering to the free gingival margin and adjacent area of the tooth. The plaque may only be recognized by running a probe across the tooth surface.&#xD;
= Moderate accumulation of soft deposits within the gingival pocket, on the gingival margin and/or adjacent tooth surface, which can be seen by the naked eye.&#xD;
= Abundance of soft matter within the gingival pocket and/or on the gingival margin and adjacent tooth surface.</description>
