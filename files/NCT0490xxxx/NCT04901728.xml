  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improvements in health care and antiretroviral treatments have made it possible to turn HIV&#xD;
      into a chronic disease leading to longer life expectancies and better quality of life among&#xD;
      patients. Dual-drug combinations offer the advantage of a reduced exposure to antiretroviral&#xD;
      agents, therefore leading to potential reductions in drug-associated side effects in the&#xD;
      long-term. In light of this context, the primary aim of this qualitative study is to&#xD;
      investigate patients' perceptions and experiences on the safety, effectiveness, tolerability,&#xD;
      and unmet needs of the dolutegravir/lamivudine two-drug regimen. The secondary objective is&#xD;
      to conduct a comparative analysis between patients on dolutegravir/lamivudine and patients on&#xD;
      other two-drug and three-drug combinations. Lastly, the study aims to provide recommendations&#xD;
      that improve doctor-patient communication, knowledge and understanding of the treatment plan,&#xD;
      and additional care that ought to be considered in patient-centred, holistic care plans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a three-phase comparative study with a control population (i.e.,&#xD;
      people living with HIV on other dual therapy regimens and triple ART) and the target&#xD;
      population (i.e., people living with HIV on dual DTG/3TC regimen). The control population&#xD;
      will include a group on dual regimens other than DTG/3TC and a group on triple therapy. In&#xD;
      the control group of patients receiving dual therapies, the investigators will include&#xD;
      patients (i) on Juluca (DTG/rilpivirine[RPV]), (ii) on boosted darunavir plus lamivudine&#xD;
      (DRV/r or DRV/c + 3TC), and (iii) on boosted darunavir plus raltegravir (DRV/r or DRV/c +&#xD;
      RAL). The target population will include patients on DTG/3TC. The addition of the control&#xD;
      group of patients on other dual therapies will allow the investigators to tease out the&#xD;
      particular characteristics of the dual DTG/3TC beyond the mere reduction of molecules&#xD;
      employed for the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators suggest that a comparative study including the target and control&#xD;
      populations will allow to better understand patient perceptions and needs as related to the&#xD;
      variables of (i) safety, (ii) effectiveness, (iii) tolerability, and (iv) unmet needs. This&#xD;
      is because DTG/3TC will not be experienced and perceived in isolation from the patients'&#xD;
      previous drug regimens or from other patients on different drug regimens. When a participant&#xD;
      on DTG/3TC describes their experiences and perceptions, they will be making a comparison to a&#xD;
      'time before' or to 'an other'. For example, the investigators anticipate patients to&#xD;
      describe current experiences of DTG/3TC effectiveness in comparison to a time they were on&#xD;
      another drug regimen or in comparison to a friend/known person on another drug regimen (e.g.&#xD;
      'DTG/3TC is more effective than my previous treatment' or 'DTG/3TC seems to be less tolerable&#xD;
      because my friend is on a different regimen and has fewer side-effects'). This supports the&#xD;
      need to explore other drug regimens through a control group so that comparisons that arise in&#xD;
      the data will have a reference point rooted in the data. In short, if a patient says 'DTG/3TC&#xD;
      is safer than my previous treatment' the investigators can understand not only experiences on&#xD;
      DTG/3TC, but also how it compares to other treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the subjective nature of these variables means that each person will have a&#xD;
      different understanding, meaning, perception, and experience of the study variables. ViiV&#xD;
      Healthcare, the researchers, and health care providers will have one, or more, ways of&#xD;
      defining the variables, but there is added value in exploring what they mean to patients. By&#xD;
      widening our participant population to not just include the target population, but to also&#xD;
      include the control groups the investigators will gain a more in-depth understanding of what&#xD;
      these variables mean to patients. This will ensure conceptual and operational alignment of&#xD;
      the variables between patients and researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's 'phases' refer to the order in which specific methods will be deployed and&#xD;
      findings preliminarily analysed. In Phase I the investigators will deploy Cultural Domain&#xD;
      Analysis (CDA), a type of structured interview aimed at understanding how people in a group&#xD;
      think about lists of things that somehow go together. CDA will help the investigators to&#xD;
      better understand patient unmet needs. After data collection, the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      a preliminary analysis to refine and improve our Focus Group Discussion (FGD) questions and&#xD;
      approach. In Phase II the investigators will conduct FGDs to gain a deeper knowledge of&#xD;
      patient unmet needs and to begin exploring the variables safety, efficacy, and tolerability.&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a preliminary analysis of the FGDs to refine the questions and&#xD;
      approach the subsequent In-Depth Interviews (IDI). In Phase III the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct IDIs to gain expert knowledge and understanding of the variables safety, efficacy,&#xD;
      and tolerability. The investigators will conduct a preliminary analysis of the data. Finally,&#xD;
      the investigators will analyse all data sets, prepare journal articles, conference papers,&#xD;
      and share findings through public engagement with both the Brighton and Sussex Medical School&#xD;
      and the Sussex Beacon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will ask the control population to draw on their knowledge of the DTG/3TC&#xD;
      regimen, and the target population to share their experiences on DTG/3TC; both in relation to&#xD;
      the above-mentioned variables. By asking the control population about the DTG/3TC regimen (as&#xD;
      opposed to their current care plan) the investigators will illuminate potential gaps in&#xD;
      knowledge and understanding about the DTG/3TC regimen, as well as potential misconceptions&#xD;
      among HIV patients in treatment about the 2-drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also ask the control population about their current dual and triple&#xD;
      therapy regimens and the target population about their previous experiences on triple therapy&#xD;
      or alternative dual therapy combinations before switching to the DTG/3TC regimen; both in&#xD;
      relation to the above-mentioned variables. By including exploration of different treatments,&#xD;
      the investigators will gain an understanding of whether patients perceive the new regimen to&#xD;
      be safer, effective, and more tolerable, as well as if they feel previously unmet needs are&#xD;
      now met on the new treatment plan. The investigators can also gauge the potential interest&#xD;
      and/or concern/worry/fear that patients on triple and alternative dual therapies may feel&#xD;
      about the future direction of HIV treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This data will enable the investigators to provide recommendations for improved&#xD;
      doctor-patient communication and health education about the 2-drug and DTG/3TC regimen. It&#xD;
      may also allow identifying psycho-social concerns that support teams should be aware of or&#xD;
      anticipate as patient treatment plans change.&#xD;
