  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fontan operation is currently the most common procedure performed in patients with&#xD;
      single-ventricle physiology. This surgery allows for passive caval blood flow to the&#xD;
      pulmonary arteries in the absence of a subpulmonary pump and therefore separating the&#xD;
      pulmonary circulation from systemic circulation. However, late hepatic complications such as&#xD;
      liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, or even hepatocellular carcinoma are increasingly described in&#xD;
      patients with Fontan circulation. The Fontan associated liver disease (FALD) is related to&#xD;
      the decreased cardiac output and elevated central venous pressure after Fontan operation.&#xD;
      Although the prevalence of FALD is higher than 90% in patients with Fontan circulation. There&#xD;
      are no specific medications can reverse the liver fibrosis or prevent the progression of FALD&#xD;
      at present. Sildenafil had been used in patients after Fontan operation not only to decrease&#xD;
      their pulmonary vascular resistance and central venous pressure, increased systemic cardiac&#xD;
      output. Comparing with other oral pulmonary vasodilators, sildenafil is with less possibility&#xD;
      of liver toxicity. Therefore, we will conduct a prospective, open-labeled,&#xD;
      randomized-controlled study in at least 90 Fontan patients with age &gt; 12 years receiving&#xD;
      follow -up at our institute. These patients will be in accordance with the ratio of 1: 1&#xD;
      distribution randomized into two groups, group 1 will receive sildenafil 20 mg three times&#xD;
      daily for 3 years and the group will not receive any pulmonary vasodilator as a control.&#xD;
      Patients in both group will receive the examinations of liver fibrosis markers, transient&#xD;
      ultrasound elastrography (FibroScan), diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI)&#xD;
      and cardiopulmonary function test at baseline, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years after initiating&#xD;
      treatment. Comparing the results of two groups, we may further clarify the treatment effect&#xD;
      of sildenafil on FALD in patients after Fontan procedure.&#xD;

      Research Design and Methods Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The adolescent and adult patients (age ≥ 12 years) with anatomic and/or functional&#xD;
           univentricular heart receive Fontan procedure and are followed at our institute will be&#xD;
           included in our study protocol. The expected sample size is 90 candidates, with the&#xD;
           ratio of 1:1 distribution randomized into two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patients age ≥ 12 years with anatomic and/or functional univentricular heart&#xD;
                receive Fontan procedure followed at our institute (including the patients with&#xD;
                heart failure or pregnancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Patients without taking organic nitrates and not allergic to Sildenafil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The patients cannot safely receive MRI examination, including patients with severe&#xD;
                renal dysfunction, or after pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator&#xD;
                implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Patients having known liver disease (such as viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver&#xD;
                disease, etc.) other than FALD.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Patients are under sildenafil or any pulmonary vasodilator therapy for lowering&#xD;
                pulmonary resistance, or have been using any of these medications in recent 3&#xD;
                months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a three-year prospective, open-labeled, randomized-controlled study. After&#xD;
           informed consent, eligible patients will be randomly assigned to two groups: the control&#xD;
           group will not receive any specific therapy for decreasing the pulmonary vascular&#xD;
           resistance, the treatment group will administrate oral sildenafil 20 mg three times per&#xD;
           day. The medical records including histories of prior cardiac interventions, hemodynamic&#xD;
           data form cardiac catheterization and clinical cardiac performance will be reviewed.&#xD;
           Patients who discontinued therapy for any reason will be withdrawn from the trial. All&#xD;
           patient will undergo peripheral blood sampling for liver function test, level of&#xD;
           circulating biomarkers, acoustic radiation force impulse elastrography and&#xD;
           diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary outcome measurement of blood test is the changes from baseline to 1 year,&#xD;
           1.5 years, 2 years, 2.5 years and 3 years in liver fibrosis assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The measurements include:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Liver function tests: including aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase&#xD;
           (ALT), bilirubin, viral hepatitis markers for hepatitis B and C, gamma-glutamyl&#xD;
           transferase (gamma-GT), platelet count, cholesterol, hyaluronic acid, and albumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: Serum alfa-macroglobulin, haptoglobin, hyaluronic&#xD;
           acid, procollagen type III N-terminal peptide and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1&#xD;
           levels will be measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to&#xD;
           manufacturer's instructions (eBioscience, Inc, CA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
           - AST to platelet ratio index (APRI): [{AST (IU/l)/ AST upper limit (IU/l)}× 100]/&#xD;
           platelet count (109/l)&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Forn's index: 7.811 - 3.131 ln (platelet count (109/L)) + 0.781 ln (gamma-GT (IU/L)) +&#xD;
           3.467 ln (age (y)) - 0.014 (cholesterol (mg/dL))&#xD;
&#xD;
           - MELD-XI score: 5.11 x ln (total serum bilirubin mg/dL) + 11.76 x ln (serum creatinine&#xD;
           mg/dL) + 9.44; serum creatinine and total bilirubin values &lt; 1.0 mg/dL are rounded to 1&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Transient elastography (TE) TE will be performed using FibroScan (Echosens,&#xD;
                France). This machine is equipped with a probe including an ultrasonic transducer&#xD;
                mounted on the axis of a vibrator. A vibration transmitted from the vibrator&#xD;
                towards the tissue induces an elastic shear wave that propagates through the&#xD;
                tissue. These propagations are followed by pulse-echo ultrasound acquisitions and&#xD;
                their velocity is measured which is directly related to tissue stiffness. Results&#xD;
                are expressed in kilopascal. The examination will be performed on the right lobe of&#xD;
                the liver through the intercostal space of the patient. After the area of&#xD;
                measurement was located, the examiner pressed the button of the probe to start the&#xD;
                acquisition. The measurement depth was between 25 and 65 mm. As suggested by the&#xD;
                manufacturer ten successful acquisitions were performed on each patient. Only TE&#xD;
                results obtained with 10 valid measurements, with a success-rate of at least 60%&#xD;
                and an interquartile range ≤30% were considered reliable. FibroScan failure is&#xD;
                defined when less than 10 valid measurements are obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging:&#xD;
&#xD;
           MRI will be performed on a 1.5T MRI system (Magnetom Avanto; Siemens Medical Solution,&#xD;
           Erlangen, Germany) with a dedicated, six-channel, torso-array coil. The maximum gradient&#xD;
           specificationswere 45 mT/m for amplitude and 200 mT/m/s for the slew rate. The IVIM&#xD;
           imaging will be performed in addition to the routine abdomen MRI protocol which included&#xD;
           nonenhanced T1-weighted (T1W) and T2-weighted (T2W) imaging, T2W MR&#xD;
           cholangiopancreaticography imaging, and contrast-enhanced T1W imaging. Axial IVIM DW&#xD;
           images will be acquired using a navigator echo-triggered (PACE [prospective acquisition&#xD;
           correction], Siemens) single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence with the following&#xD;
           parameters: echo time, 60 ms; repetition time, 2100 ms; echo-planar imaging factor, 115;&#xD;
           receiver bandwidth, 1594 Hz per pixel; field of view (FOV), 340 - 256 mm; matrix size,&#xD;
           192 - 115; number of average, 4; section thickness, 7 mm; intersection gap, 1.4 mm;&#xD;
           number of sections, 20; and acquisition time, approximately 7 min (variable depending on&#xD;
           a patient's respiratory cycle). Instead of bipolar gradients, mono-polar DW gradients&#xD;
           which allow for scanning with a shorter echo time, will be used in order to achieve a&#xD;
           higher signal-to-noise ratio and to decrease the susceptibility artifacts. An&#xD;
           image-based, dynamic distortion correction algorithm will be used to correct for&#xD;
           eddy-current-induced distortions. DW gradients (i.e. nine b values of 0, 30, 60, 100,&#xD;
           150, 200, 400, 600, and 900 s/mm2) will be applied in three, orthogonal directions and&#xD;
           be subsequently averaged. A k-space-based, parallel imaging technique (generalized&#xD;
           auto-calibrating partially parallel acquisition, GRAPPA, Siemens Medical Solutions) will&#xD;
           be used with an acceleration factor of 2. Fat suppression will be achieved using a&#xD;
           chemical shift-selective, fat-suppression technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary outcome measurement is the changes from baseline to 1 year, 2 years and 3&#xD;
           years in pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) levels, New York Heart Association&#xD;
           functional classification, 6-minute walk test and cardiopulmonary function test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Methods of cardiopulmonary function test: Equipment The cardiopulmonary exercise test&#xD;
           was performed on a cycle ergometer (Ergotest ER 800, Erich Jaeger GmbH &amp; Co., Germany)&#xD;
           in an air-conditioned laboratory at a temperature of 22 to 26 oC, barometric pressure of&#xD;
           756 to 772 mmHg, and a relative humidity of 54 to 68%. The blood pressure (TANGO,&#xD;
           SunTech Medical Instruments, Inc., North Carolina, USA) and continuous 12-lead&#xD;
           electrocardiogram were monitored during test. The expired air was analyzed&#xD;
           breath-by-breath using an automatic gas analyzer (Metamax 3B, CORTEX Biophysik GmbH,&#xD;
           Leipzig, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exercise Protocol Exercise test was performed at least 2 hours after breakfast. The&#xD;
           program began with 2 minutes of data collection in resting on the ergometer, followed by&#xD;
           3 minutes of warm-up cycling with 10 watt, then with load increased by 10 watts per&#xD;
           minutes. Patients would exercise as long as they could, and would be stopped based on&#xD;
           intolerable dyspnea, fatigue or by supervising physician's safety concerns. Finally,&#xD;
           recovery was monitored for more than 3 minutes with unloaded cycling.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measurement parameters Exercise cardiopulmonary parameters, including heart rate,&#xD;
           12-lead electrocardiogram, blood pressure, workload (WR), minute ventilation (VE),&#xD;
           oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), oxygen (O2) pulse,&#xD;
           ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (VE/VO2), and ventilatory equivalent for carbon&#xD;
           dioxide (VE/VCO2), were processed. The ventilatory threshold (VT) was defined as (1) the&#xD;
           VE/VO2 began to increase without a corresponding increase in the VE/VCO2; (2) the end&#xD;
           tidal O2 pressure (PO2) began to increase without a decrease in the end tidal CO2&#xD;
           pressure (PCO2); and (3) the VE departed from linearity for VO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and demographic characteristics will be summarized by use of means + SDs for&#xD;
      continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables. Primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes changes from baseline will be analyzed by ANCOVA, including terms for treatment&#xD;
      group and the baseline variable for the parameter being analyzed. The difference between&#xD;
      treatment and control groups is estimated and presented, along with its 2-sided 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval and 2-tailed P value.&#xD;
