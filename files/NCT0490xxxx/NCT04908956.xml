    <textblock>
      STEREO is single-arm phase II study, which aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      osimertinib combined with early locally ablative radiotherapy of all cancer sites in patients&#xD;
      with synchronous oligo-metastatic (primary tumour and maximum 5 metastases) EGFR-mutant (exon&#xD;
      19 deletion or exon 21 L858R) NSCLC. Eradication of all macroscopic cancer sites at the time&#xD;
      of primary diagnosis by combined modality treatment is expected to decrease the risk of&#xD;
      resistance development with only microscopic disease potentially remaining. This will result&#xD;
      in an improvement of PFS and OS without added high-grade toxicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Targeting Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation has fundamentally changed the&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several randomised phase III studies have compared first-generation (erlotinib or gefitinib)&#xD;
      or second-generation (afatinib) EGFR-targeting TKIs with standard platinum-based chemotherapy&#xD;
      and all reported significantly improved objective response rates (ORR) and progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS). For patients with TKI resistance development by T790M mutation, which is the&#xD;
      resistance mechanism in about 50% of the patients, osimertinib is superior compared to&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy with significant and clinically relevant improved ORR and PFS.&#xD;
      Recently, the FLAURA study reported improved PFS of osimertinib compared to first-generation&#xD;
      TKI (erlotinib or gefitinib) for untreated EGFRmutant advanced NSCLC, without differences in&#xD;
      ORR. On longer follow-up, first-line osimertinib was also associated with improved survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integration of local therapy into a multimodality treatment is a promising strategy to&#xD;
      overcome the limitations of EGFR-targeting TKIs alone, despite patients suffering from a&#xD;
      metastatic stage of disease. This is based on the observations that disease progression under&#xD;
      EGFR-targeting TKI most frequently occurs at the original sites of metastatic disease and&#xD;
      that the majority of patients show disease progression in a limited number of metastatic&#xD;
      lesions, a situation defined as oligoprogression. Al-Halabi et al. reported in a series of 49&#xD;
      patients that 47.0%, 32.6%, and 20.4% of the patients developed original site failure,&#xD;
      combined original site and distant site failure and distant site failure as first progression&#xD;
      of disease to EGFR-targeting TKI. Primary tumour size was the most significant predictor for&#xD;
      original site failure. Li et al. reported about 266 patients treated with first-line&#xD;
      EGFR-targeting TKI and disease progression was reported at original and distant sites in 39%&#xD;
      and 61%, respectively. Guo et al. reported disease progression in original sites, combined&#xD;
      original and distant sites and distant sites in 50%, 28% and 22%, respectively. Consequently,&#xD;
      EGFR-targeting TKIs appear less effective in controlling sites of macroscopic disease, where&#xD;
      residual cancer cells ultimately acquire resistance and become the source of further disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early imaging-based detection of oligoprogressive disease sites and their local ablation&#xD;
      combined with continuation of TKI is one strategy to overcome this resistance development:&#xD;
      metastatic sites with acquired resistance to EGFR-targeting TKI are eradicated by locally&#xD;
      ablative treatment, irrespective of the underlying resistance mechanism, whereas&#xD;
      non-progressing and EGFR-sensitive sites are continuously targeted and controlled by TKI&#xD;
      therapy. This combined modality strategy has shown promising results in several retrospective&#xD;
      studies, including a recent Swiss cohort study, where locally ablative treatment added to&#xD;
      continuation of osimertinib in oligoprogressive T790M-mutant NSCLC patients was identified as&#xD;
      the intervention which prolonged overall survival (OS). A randomised phase II trial is&#xD;
      currently testing this hypothesis of locally ablative radiotherapy for oligoprogressive&#xD;
      driver mutated NSCLC patients (NCT03256981); assessment of liquid biopsy for response&#xD;
      evaluation is an important translational endpoint to identify patients with residual&#xD;
      resistant disease after locally ablative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the strategy of local eradication of oligoprogressive disease has the limitation&#xD;
      that imaging can only detect resistance development when this has already translated into&#xD;
      macroscopically progressive disease. Systemic dissemination of resistant disease beyond the&#xD;
      initial sites of acquired resistance development may then have already occurred, which is&#xD;
      supported by the finding that the majority of patients develop further disease progression&#xD;
      after locally ablative treatment. Consequently, there is a strong rationale of early&#xD;
      targeting of local disease sites at high risk for developing acquired EGFR resistance, before&#xD;
      imaging-based progression has developed. This strategy is supported by retrospective data of&#xD;
      patients with brain metastases, where early radiosurgery combined with EGFR-targeting TKI&#xD;
      improved OS compared to EGFR-targeting TKI alone and delayed radiotherapy at the time of&#xD;
      disease progression (HR 0.39, 46 months vs 25 months). The hypothesis of upfront SBRT is&#xD;
      supported by a recent randomised phase III trial of patients with oligo-metastatic&#xD;
      EGFR-mutated NSCLC treated with first-generation EGFR TKIs presented at ASCO 2020, which&#xD;
      demonstrated a PFS and OS benefit for early use of SBRT compared to systemic therapy alone.&#xD;
      However, this study is limited by the use of first-generation TKIs only, and especially by&#xD;
      chemotherapy as mandatory second line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The value of combined modality systemic therapy with locally ablative therapy for&#xD;
      oligo-metastatic NSCLC has recently been evaluated in several randomised trials. All studies&#xD;
      reported a significantly and clinically relevant improved OS or PFS for adding locally&#xD;
      ablative therapy to standard of care systemic therapy. However, these studies included only&#xD;
      very few NSCLC patients with activating driver mutations and the benefit of adding upfront&#xD;
      local radiotherapy might be smaller or larger in this NSCLC patient population with&#xD;
      activating driver mutations and treatment with TKIs: smaller because of the higher systemic&#xD;
      efficacy of TKIs compared to chemotherapy or larger because the benefit of local treatment&#xD;
      might become most obvious if potential microscopic disease is successfully controlled by&#xD;
      TKIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, there is a clinical need to evaluate locally ablative therapy in&#xD;
      oligo-metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients and simultaneously a strong rationale that this&#xD;
      population might benefit in particular from a combined modality treatment: the benefit of&#xD;
      locally ablative therapy is expected to be largest in situations of effective systemic&#xD;
      therapies to control locally untreated microscopic disease which is true for EGFR targeting.&#xD;
