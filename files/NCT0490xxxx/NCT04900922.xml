  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tennis is a global sport that approximately 10% of people play more than 20 times per year in&#xD;
      the USA. A typical tennis match can take 1 to 5 hours, and players averagely hit 100&#xD;
      groundstrokes and 400 serves. Tennis serve can be divided into eight stages. Injuries usually&#xD;
      happen in the cocking stage and acceleration stage, where it requires large shoulder range of&#xD;
      motion and proper scapular motion, including sufficient scapular upper rotation, external&#xD;
      rotation, and posterior tilt to produce a powerful serve. Altered shoulder kinematics is are&#xD;
      associated with shoulder injuries in tennis players, including delayed shoulder horizontal&#xD;
      adduction, and early external rotation. Due to the long duration and repetition of activity&#xD;
      in a match, fatigue may happen and result in decreases in sensory input, passive range of&#xD;
      motion, ball speed, and muscle strength. These changes may further lead to altered&#xD;
      glenohumeral and scapular kinematics. However, previous studies mainly focused on the effects&#xD;
      of fatigue on scapular kinematics in constrain movements and applied different fatigue&#xD;
      protocols, which lead to inconsistent results. Tennis serve in the acceleration stage&#xD;
      requires high activation of shoulder internal rotators, including pectoralis major,&#xD;
      subscapularis, latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior. However, to our knowledge, no study&#xD;
      has investigated how fatigue of shoulder internal rotators influences shoulder kinematic as&#xD;
      well as scapular kinematics during the cocking and acceleration stages of tennis serve.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators aim to investigate whether fatigue of internal rotator affects&#xD;
      shoulder kinematics in healthy tennis players during cocking and acceleration stage s of&#xD;
      tennis serve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single group, pretest-posttest measurement study. In a fatigue protocol,&#xD;
      investigators use an isokinetic dynamometer to induce fatigue of shoulder internal rotators.&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be tested before and after the fatigue protocol, including peak torque&#xD;
      of shoulder internal rotators, humerothoracic kinematics, scapular kinematics, and&#xD;
      superficial electromyography. Peak torque of shoulder internal rotators will be measured with&#xD;
      an isokinetic dynamometer. Superficial electromyography will be also used to measure the&#xD;
      muscle activation of internal rotators during the fatigue protocol. Humerothoracic kinematics&#xD;
      and scapular kinematics during a functional tennis serve will be collected with a motion&#xD;
      capture system.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in this group need to perform three times of shoulder elevation and five times of tennis serving before and after a fatigue protocol. The fatigue the participants will receive will be conducted with a dynamometer. Surface electromyography on pectoralis major, anterior deltoid ,and latissimus dorsi will be used to detect muscle activity related to fatigue.</description>
