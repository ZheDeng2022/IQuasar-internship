    <textblock>
      The phase I portion of this study is designed for children or adolescents and young adults&#xD;
      (AYA) with a diagnosis of a solid tumor that has recurred (come back after treatment) or is&#xD;
      refractory (never completely went away). The trial will test 2 combinations of therapy and&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to either Arm A or Arm B. The purpose of the phase I&#xD;
      study is to determine the highest tolerable doses of the combinations of treatment given in&#xD;
      each Arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Arm A, children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors will receive 2&#xD;
      medications called Onivyde and talazoparib. Onivyde works by damaging the DNA of the cancer&#xD;
      cell and talazoparib works by blocking the repair of the DNA once the cancer cell is damaged.&#xD;
      By damaging the tumor DNA and blocking the repair, the cancer cells may die. In Arm B,&#xD;
      children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors will receive 2 medications called&#xD;
      Onivyde and temozolomide. Both of these medications work by damaging the DNA of the cancer&#xD;
      call which may cause the tumor(s) to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest doses are reached in Arm A and Arm B, then &quot;expansion Arms&quot; will open. An&#xD;
      expansion arm treats more children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors at the&#xD;
      highest doses achieved in the phase I study. The goal of the expansion arms is to see if the&#xD;
      tumors go away in children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. There will be&#xD;
      3 &quot;expansion Arms&quot;. In Arm A1, children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors&#xD;
      (excluding Ewing sarcoma) will receive Onivyde and talazoparib. In Arm A2, children and AYAs&#xD;
      with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, whose tumors have a problem with repairing DNA&#xD;
      (identified by their doctor), will receive Onivyde and talazoparib. In Arm B1, children and&#xD;
      AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors (excluding Ewing sarcoma) will receive Onivyde&#xD;
      and temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest doses of medications used in Arm A and Arm B are determined, then a phase II&#xD;
      study will open for children or young adults with Ewing sarcoma that has recurred or is&#xD;
      refractory following treatment received after the initial diagnosis. The trial will test the&#xD;
      same 2 combinations of therapy in Arm A and Arm B. In the phase II, a participant with Ewing&#xD;
      sarcoma will be randomly assigned to receive the treatment given on either Arm A or Arm B.&#xD;

      ONITT (ONIvyde, Talazoparib, Temozolomide) is a phase I/II study which will evaluate two&#xD;
      treatment regimens; nanoliposomal irinotecan (nal-IRN, Onivyde) plus talazoparib (TAL) and&#xD;
      Onivyde (ONI) plus temozolomide (TMZ) for the treatment of recurrent or refractory (RR) Ewing&#xD;
      sarcoma. A dose finding phase I study will be open to patients with recurrent or refractory&#xD;
      solid tumors. Patients will be assigned to receive either ONI plus TAL (Arm A) or ONI plus&#xD;
      TMZ (Arm B). Once the recommended phase II doses (RP2D) of Arm A and Arm B are determined,&#xD;
      expansion cohorts (A1, B1) will open at the RP2Ds for enrollment of non-Ewing sarcoma solid&#xD;
      tumor patients. There will be an additional Arm A expansion cohort (A2) for patients with&#xD;
      homologous recombination repair defects. Concurrently, the phase II study will open to&#xD;
      patients with RR Ewing sarcoma. In the phase II study, patients with RR Ewing sarcoma will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either ONI plus TAL or ONI plus TMZ. The primary endpoint will be&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS). PFS of both treatment arms in the phase II study will be&#xD;
      compared to one another by using a two-arm non-inferiority design when superiority is&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I Primary Objective To determine the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) of Onivyde&#xD;

&#xD;
      Phase I The phase I portion of the study will include 2 separate treatment arms, Arms A and&#xD;
      B. Arm A will evaluate Onivyde plus talazoparib (ONI + TAL). Arm B will evaluate Onivyde plus&#xD;
      temozolomide (ONI + TMZ). Both phase I studies will be open to patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      refractory solid tumors who meet eligibility criteria. In Arm A, patients will receive&#xD;
      intravenous Onivyde on Days 1 and 8. They will receive oral talazoparib twice on Day 1 and&#xD;
      then daily on Days 2-6. In Arm B, patients will receive intravenous Onivyde on Days 1 and 8.&#xD;
      They will receive oral temozolomide daily on Days 1-5. Pharmacokinetic testing will take&#xD;
      place during Cycle 1. Therapy may continue for up to 24 months. Tumor assessments will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline and repeated after cycles 2, 4, 6 and then every 4 cycles thereafter to&#xD;
      assess disease status. If at any designated disease evaluation time point a patient develops&#xD;
      a response that is better than the prior response (i.e. SD at Cycle 2 evaluation, then PR at&#xD;
      Cycle 4 evaluation), an interim disease evaluation is recommended after 28 days to confirm&#xD;
      response. Therapy will be discontinued if there is evidence of disease progression or&#xD;
      drug-related dose limiting toxicities requiring removal from treatment. Safety and&#xD;
      tolerability will be monitored continuously throughout study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Following the completion of the phase I dose finding studies, patients with&#xD;
      recurrent or refractory Ewing sarcoma that meet eligibility criteria will be eligible for&#xD;
      randomization into the phase II study. Arm A will evaluate Onivyde plus talazoparib (ONI +&#xD;
      TAL). Arm B will evaluate Onivyde plus temozolomide (ONI + TMZ). In Arm A, patients will&#xD;
      receive intravenous Onivyde on Days 1 and 8. They will receive oral talazoparib twice on Day&#xD;
      1 and then daily on Days 2-6. In Arm B, patients will receive intravenous Onivyde on Days 1&#xD;
      and 8. They will receive oral temozolomide daily on Days 1-5. Pharmacokinetic testing will&#xD;
      take place during Cycle 1. Therapy may continue for up to 24 months. Tumor assessments will&#xD;
      be performed at baseline and repeated after Cycles 2, 4, 6 and then every 4 cycles thereafter&#xD;
      to assess disease status. If at any designated disease evaluation time point a patient&#xD;
      develops a response that is better than the prior response (i.e. SD at Cycle 2 evaluation,&#xD;
      then PR at Cycle 4 evaluation), an interim disease evaluation is recommended after 28 days to&#xD;
      confirm response. Therapy will be discontinued if there is evidence of disease progression&#xD;
      and/or any other condition(s) occur that do not allow treatment continuation or similar&#xD;
      toxicities requiring removal from the trial. Safety and tolerability will be monitored&#xD;
      continuously throughout study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: In the dose escalation phase I study, approximately 18 patients per arm will be&#xD;
      enrolled for a total of 36 patients. The dose expansion phase I study will include 3&#xD;
      treatment cohorts. Arm A will have 2 dose expansion cohorts including 1) a non-ES solid tumor&#xD;
      cohort (A1) and 2) a DNA repair defects/mutations cohort (A2). Arm B will have 1 dose&#xD;
      expansion cohort including non-ES solid tumors (B1). Approximately 12 patients will enroll&#xD;
      per expansion treatment cohort for a total of 36 patients. In the phase II study, 44 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled on each arm for a total of 88 patients.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be &gt; 12 months and &lt; 30 years at the time of enrollment on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with refractory or recurrent non-central nervous system (CNS) solid tumors&#xD;
             not amenable to curative treatment are eligible. Patients must have had histologic&#xD;
             verification of malignancy at original diagnosis or at the time of relapse. Patients&#xD;
             eligible for the expansion cohort, A2, will include non-ES patients with refractory or&#xD;
             recurrent non-CNS solid tumors with a deleterious alteration in germline or somatic&#xD;
             genes involved in HR repair and DSBs signaling, germline or somatic assessed by prior&#xD;
             comprehensive sequencing performed in a CLIA-approved (or equivalent) facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with refractory or recurrent Ewing sarcoma (during or after completion of&#xD;
             first-line therapy). Refractory disease is defined as progression during first line&#xD;
             treatment or within 12 weeks of completion of first line treatment. Recurrent disease&#xD;
             includes patients who received first line treatment and experienced disease&#xD;
             progression at any time point &gt;12 weeks from the completion of first line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a histologic diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma with EWSR1- FLI1&#xD;
             translocation or other EWS rearrangement at the time of initial diagnosis. Repeat&#xD;
             biopsy at the time of disease recurrence is strongly encouraged but it is not&#xD;
             required/mandated for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Disease status&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have either measurable or evaluable disease (see Section 7.0 for&#xD;
             definitions). Measurable disease includes soft tissue disease evaluable by&#xD;
             cross-sectional imaging (RECIST). Patients with bone disease without a measurable soft&#xD;
             tissue component or bone marrow disease only are eligible for the phase 1 and phase 2&#xD;
             study but will not be included in the OR endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance level: Karnofsky &gt; 50% for patients &gt; 16 years of age and Lansky &gt; 50% for&#xD;
             patients &lt; 16 years of age. Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but&#xD;
             who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing&#xD;
             the performance score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase I Patients who have received prior therapy with an irinotecan-based or&#xD;
        temozolomide-based regimen are eligible. Patients who have received prior therapy with a&#xD;
        PARP inhibitor other than talazoparib are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should have received first line therapy and developed either refractory or&#xD;
             recurrent disease (first relapse).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Organ function: Must have adequate organ and bone marrow function as defined by the&#xD;

&#xD;
        In the phase I study, patients with solid tumors metastatic to bone marrow or with bone&#xD;
        marrow hypocellularity defined as &lt;30% cellularity in at least one bone marrow site will be&#xD;
        eligible for study, but they will not be evaluable for hematologic toxicity. These patients&#xD;
        must not be refractory to red cell or platelet transfusions. At least 2 of every cohort of&#xD;
        3 patients (in the phase I study) must be evaluable for hematologic toxicity. If dose&#xD;
        limiting hematologic toxicity is observed at any dose level, all subsequent patients&#xD;
        enrolled at that dose level must be evaluable for hematologic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate renal function defined as: Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR &gt;&#xD;
             60ml/min/1.73m2 or a serum creatinine maximum based on age/sex: age 6months to &lt;1&#xD;
             year, creatinine 0.4; 1 to &lt; 2 years, creatinine 0.6; 2 &lt; 6 years, creatinine 0.8; 6 &lt;&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Adequate pulmonary function defined as no evidence of dyspnea at rest and a pulse&#xD;
             oximetry &gt; 94% if there is a clinical indication for determination. Pulmonary function&#xD;
             tests are not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of chemotherapy,&#xD;
             immunotherapy, surgery, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study. Pregnancy tests&#xD;
             must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal. Males or females of reproductive&#xD;
             potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use two methods of birth&#xD;
             control: a medically accepted barrier of contraceptive method (e.g., male or female&#xD;
             condom) and a second method of birth control during protocol therapy. Two highly&#xD;
             effective methods of contraception are required for female patients during treatment&#xD;
             and for at least 7 months after completing therapy. Male patients with female partners&#xD;
             of reproductive potential and/or pregnant partners are advised to use two highly&#xD;
