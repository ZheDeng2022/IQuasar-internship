    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1/2 open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and biomarker study of CBX-12 in subjects with advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      refractory solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 is the dose-escalation portion of the study in which the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      two dosing schedules of CBX-12 will be evaluated. Subjects in Part A will be treated with&#xD;
      CBX-12 on a daily x 5 every 3 weeks schedule. Subjects in Phase 1 Part B will be treated with&#xD;
      CBX-12 on a daily x 3 every 3 weeks schedule. Once at least 2 cohorts in Part A have been&#xD;
      evaluated for safety through the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) period and the Safety Review&#xD;
      Committee (SRC) has reviewed the safety and available PK data for the completed Part A&#xD;
      cohorts, the first cohort in Part B may open for accrual. The initial dose in Part B will be&#xD;
      determined based on the safety and tolerability of Part A subjects to that point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been established in both Part A and Part B,&#xD;
      Phase 2 expansion cohorts may open.&#xD;

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a histologically- or cytologically-diagnosed solid tumor which is advanced&#xD;
             or metastatic and which has progressed on or following at least one systemic therapy&#xD;
             regimen administered for advanced or metastatic disease or for which no approved&#xD;
             therapy exists. Subject's prior treatment should include all approved regimens that&#xD;
             have demonstrated a survival advantage for the subject's disease, stage, and line of&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has measurable disease per RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An adequate tumor sample must be available from core needle biopsies obtained during&#xD;
             the Screening Period and following the subject's most recent systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agrees to an on-treatment biopsy preferably of the same lesion from which the&#xD;
             pre-CBX-12 treatment sample was obtained as long as the Investigator determines such&#xD;
             biopsy can be performed with acceptable safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy, biologic agent, investigational agent, or radiation therapy&#xD;
             less than or equal to 3 weeks prior to the first dose of CBX-12. The interval may be&#xD;
             reduced to 2 weeks for bone only radiation therapy or investigational agents not&#xD;
             expected to be associated with adverse events (AEs) after 2 weeks of last&#xD;
             administration, with Medical Monitor approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Small-molecule kinase inhibitors or hormonal agents less than or equal to 14 days&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of CBX-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are currently receiving any other anti cancer or investigational&#xD;
             agent(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant intercurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors or clinically active CNS&#xD;
             metastases or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with stable brain metastasis may be&#xD;
             enrolled with Medical Monitor approval.&#xD;
