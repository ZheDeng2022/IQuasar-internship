  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study endeavored to assess the effect of an isokinetic strength training (IsoK-ST)&#xD;
      program on weight-bearing symmetry, gait-symmetry, and dynamic balance in children with&#xD;
      hemiparetic cerebral palsy (HCP). Thirty-six children with HCP were randomly allocated to the&#xD;
      IsoK-ST group (n = 18, received their usual physical rehabilitation program plus an IsoK-ST&#xD;
      program) or the Control group (n =18, received usual physical rehabilitation alone). Both&#xD;
      groups were assessed for weight-bearing symmetry, gait-symmetry, and dynamic balance before&#xD;
      and after treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-six children with HCP were recruited from the Physical Therapy Outpatient Clinic of&#xD;
      Collee of Applied Medical Sciences, Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, King Khalid&#xD;
      Hospital, and a tertiary referral hospital, Al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia. Their age ranged between&#xD;
      8 and 16 years, were functioning at levels I or II according to the Gross Motor Function&#xD;
      Classification System, and had spasticity level 1 or 1+ per the Modified Ashworth Scale.&#xD;
      Children were excluded if they had structural nonreducible deformities, underwent&#xD;
      neuromuscular or orthopedic surgery in the last 12 months, submitted to BOTOX injection in&#xD;
      the past 6 months, sensory-perceptual disorders, unstable convulsions, cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      problems preventing them from performing high-intense exercise training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Weight-bearing symmetry index: The weight-bearing symmetry index for the rearfoot and&#xD;
           forefoot segments were assessed through a pressure analysis system&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gait-symmetry Indices: Gait symmetry indices (Spatial and temporal) were measured&#xD;
           through the portable GAIT Rite system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dynamic balance: The directional dynamic limit of stability (forward, backward, paretic,&#xD;
           and non-paretic) and overall limit of stability were assessed using the Biodex balance&#xD;
           system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IsoK-ST and control groups received their usual physical rehabilitation program for 45&#xD;
      minutes, three times a week for eight consecutive weeks. The program comprised advanced&#xD;
      balance training, and gait training exercises, postural and flexibility exercises, strength&#xD;
      training exercises. Additionally, the IsoK-ST group received an IsoK-ST program, thrice/week&#xD;
      for eight weeks per the National Strength and Conditioning Association guidelines and&#xD;
      American Academy of Pediatrics safety standards. The IsoK-ST consisted of 3 sets (5-10&#xD;
      repetitions) of maximal concentric contraction of knee extensors and flexors on the affected&#xD;
      side at angular speeds of 90, 120, 180, and 240 deg./sec., with intervals of rest for two&#xD;
      minutes after each selected speed. The IsoK-ST workout was proceeded by a 5-minute warm-up&#xD;
      and ended up with a 5-minute cool-dowm.&#xD;
