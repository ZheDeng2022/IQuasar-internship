  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The construction methods of the same brace vary on an experiential basis according to who&#xD;
      builds them, the prescriber, the characteristics of the patients and also the innovations&#xD;
      introduced to ensure greater comfort for the patient. The closure of the brace or the way in&#xD;
      which the two shells are fixed varies at the discretion of the orthopedic technician. Plastic&#xD;
      materials have also changed. In addition, the use of the classic cast for the production of&#xD;
      the negative model was gradually replaced by cad-cam technology. In some cases, modular&#xD;
      constructions were introduced with respect to the customized one. All this has changed the&#xD;
      classic corsets over time, even without changing their name / type, and according to the&#xD;
      hypothesis that their effectiveness remained at least the same, if not even improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no publications that have shown variations in efficacy that can be correlated with&#xD;
      some of these stylistic variations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to retrospectively investigate whether the various innovations&#xD;
      and stylistic variations over time have had an effect on the clinical, functional and&#xD;
      radiographic outcomes in growing subjects suffering from spinal deformity treated with&#xD;
      corsets at a specialized center.&#xD;

    <description>measures of quality of life. The Italian Spine Youth Quality of Life questionnaire (ISYQOL) measures the health-related quality of life of adolescents with spinal deformities. ISYQOL consists of 20 items, each scored 0, 1 or 2. In accordance with the Rasch analysis technique, used to develop the questionnaire, the ordinal ISYQOL total score is converted to an interval measure (i.e., ISYQOL measure), which is expressed on a 0%-100% scale (with 100% indicating high quality of life).</description>

    <description>measures of quality of life. The Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22) is a questionnaire developped to measure health-related quality of life in patients with idiopathic scoliosis. It has 22 questions divided into five domains: function/activity, pain, self-image/appearance, mental health and satisfaction with management. Each domain contains five questions, except the satisfaction with management domain, which contains two questions. Each item can be scored from 1 (worst possible) to 5 (best possible). The function/activity, pain, self-image and mental health domains have a total score ranging from 5 to 25. The satisfaction with management domain has a total score ranging from 2 to 10. The maximum total score is 110 and the results are expressed as a mean</description>
