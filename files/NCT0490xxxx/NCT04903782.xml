      Assessment of the utility of family-based (trio) whole-genome sequencing for cancer&#xD;
      predisposition testing in sequential newly diagnosed paediatric and adolescent cancer&#xD;
      patients&#xD;

      Cancer Predisposition Syndromes (CPS), caused by germline mutations in cancer predisposition&#xD;
      genes (CPG) are heritable disorders associated with an increased risk of developing certain&#xD;
      types of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge of CPG will advance the understanding of tumorigenesis, improve patient care, and&#xD;
      facilitate genetic counselling of patients and families. But the prevalence of CPS in&#xD;
      Australian children with cancer and the psychosocial impact of germline sequencing to&#xD;
      identify CPG have not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical benefit of family-based WGS in every new child with cancer compared with&#xD;
      conventional predictive factors is currently unknown. By testing every child with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed cancer the aim is to determine the utility of this approach and its impact on&#xD;
      participants and families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal objective of the proposed multicentre prospective study is establish the&#xD;
      clinical benefit and utility of family-based WGS to identify underlying CPS in every newly&#xD;
      diagnosed child with cancer.&#xD;

    <description>This will be achieved through identifying the incidence of patients and parents enrolled in the study experiencing clinically significant levels of distress, defined as a &gt;7 rating on any of the outcome measures in the Emotion Thermometers Tool©. The incidence of parents and patients experiencing other psychological outcomes such as reduced quality of life will also be identified using the validated scales EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L (parent proxy)/EQ-5D-Y (youth version), Decisional Regret Scale and the Trust In Physician Scale (adapted for a paediatric setting). Psychological outcomes will be re-assessed over the 5 year course of the study to assess impacts of germline sequencing over time.</description>
