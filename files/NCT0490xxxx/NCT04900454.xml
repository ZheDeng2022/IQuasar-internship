  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine the highest tolerated dose of an investigational cell&#xD;
      therapy called DVX201 in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. DVX201 is an allogeneic NK&#xD;
      (natural killer) cell therapy. NK cells are a normal part of your immune system that have the&#xD;
      ability to identify and kill cells in the body that are infected by viruses such as COVID-19.&#xD;
      There is evidence that both NK cell exhaustion and low numbers of NK cell in the blood occur&#xD;
      in COVID-19 patients, and this may contribute to worsening of the infection. Therefore,&#xD;
      infusion of healthy functional NK cells (like DVX201) may help overcome COVID-19 infection&#xD;
      and prevent progression of the disease. This study is being done to look at the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of DVX201 in patients with COVID-19 and to gather information on how COVID-19&#xD;
      responds to treatment with DVX201.&#xD;

This study will enroll a minimum 3 subjects who each receive a single dose of DVX201 and who are evaluable for toxicities at each dose level. Depending on the occurrence of DLTs and the number of dose levels evaluated, additional subjects may be enrolled (approximately 3-15 additional subjects). All subjects will be followed for 28 days post infusion of DVX201.</description>
