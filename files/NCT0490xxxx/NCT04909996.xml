  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, controlled, open-label, pilot study to assess the safety&#xD;
      and the performance of Sentinox medical device in the treatment of mild COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 9 visits. At the screening visit, according to the investigational&#xD;
      site procedures, patients with a positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab (quantitative swab&#xD;
      test with RT-PCR Ct value &gt;30 for at least 2 genes out of 4) performed at the investigational&#xD;
      site on the same day will be summoned. Patients will be enrolled after having signed the&#xD;
      informed consent form prior to any other study procedure and after inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria check. According to the investigator's judgment, the patient's clinical outcomes,&#xD;
      and the investigational site guidelines, the enrolled patients should be hospitalized or&#xD;
      redirected to other structures (e.g. &quot;COVID-19 hotel&quot;, patient's home).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 0 (day 0), the patient will be randomized with a 1:1:1 ratio in one of 3 trial&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group A: Sentinox treatment performed 3 times/day for 5 days (as add-on to the standard&#xD;
           therapy);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group B: Sentinox treatment performed 5 times/day for 5 days (as add-on to the standard&#xD;
           therapy);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group C: no Sentinox treatment; only the standard therapy will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allocation of the patient in one of the three study arms will be performed sequentially&#xD;
      by the principal investigator or delegates in the order in which the subjects are enrolled&#xD;
      and will be reported in a randomization list, including the identification code of the&#xD;
      patient and the treatment arm (A, B or C) assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1 (day 1) and Visit 2 (day 2), three nasopharyngeal swabs will be performed. At&#xD;
      subsequent planned visits only one nasopharyngeal swab will be performed in the morning. From&#xD;
      Visit 1 (day 1) to Visit 5 (day 5), patients will record daily adverse events (AE),&#xD;
      concomitant medication, and presence of clinical features COVID-19 related in a diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of the treatment visit (Visit 5), three follow-up visits will be performed on&#xD;
      day 6, day 10, and day 21 respectively.&#xD;
