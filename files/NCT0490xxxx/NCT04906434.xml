      This is an open-label phase 1 study with an escalation part and an expansion part.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The escalation part will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and recommended dose of&#xD;
      expansion (RDE) of oral ABSK-011 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The expansion part&#xD;
      of oral ABSK-011 at RDE will be followed for further evaluating safety and tolerability in&#xD;
      patients with FGF19 overexpression advanced HCC. Preliminary antitumor activity will also be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
