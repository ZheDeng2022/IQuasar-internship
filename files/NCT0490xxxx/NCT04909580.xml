  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pre-/post-test design. Youth with type 1 diabetes and their parent(s) were referred to the&#xD;
      intervention by their diabetes physician. Decision coaching guided youth and their parents in&#xD;
      completing a patient decision aid that was pre-populated with evidence on insulin delivery&#xD;
      options. Primary outcomes were youth and parent scores on the low literary version of the&#xD;
      Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A pre-/post-test design was used. Youth with type 1 diabetes and their parent(s) were&#xD;
      referred to the intervention by their diabetes physician. Eligible participants were youth&#xD;
      under 18 years old with T1D and their parents, who were considering a change in insulin&#xD;
      delivery method, capable of participating in the decision making process, and able to read&#xD;
      and speak English or French. No lower age limit was set for youth participants, provided the&#xD;
      youth and parent(s) could participate in the consent or assent process. Family dyads (youth&#xD;
      and one parent) and family triads (youth and two parents) were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention was decision coaching guided by the Ottawa Decision Support Framework for&#xD;
      youth with type 1 diabetes and their parents using a patient decision aid that was&#xD;
      pre-populated with evidence on insulin delivery options.&#xD;
