  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FOLFIRINOX regimen has become the standard treatment regimen for advanced colorectal&#xD;
      cancer, advanced pancreatic cancer and postoperative adjuvant treatment for pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. With the continuous exploration of Chinese scholars, it has also revised the modified&#xD;
      dose suitable for the physical fitness of the Chinese people, which is well tolerated and has&#xD;
      a clear efficiency. The drugs in this program are all standard treatment drugs for gastric&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2020, JAMA Network Open and JAMA Oncology successively reported the application of&#xD;
      FOLFIRINOX in the perioperative period of gastric cancer and the late-stage results of&#xD;
      gastric cancer, and they obtained very amazing data respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the results of CheckMate-649, the FDA approved Nivolumab combined chemotherapy&#xD;
      for first-line treatment of advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, gastroesophageal junction&#xD;
      cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma, regardless of PD-L1 expression. At the same time, this&#xD;
      is also the first first-line immunotherapy approved by the FDA for gastric cancer.However,&#xD;
      there is no definite conclusion about the preoperative neoadjuvant or perioperative clinical&#xD;
      research, so it is necessary to explore the efficacy of PD-1 antibody in the perioperative&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-center, randomized, controlled phase II clinical study. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint of the study is the perioperative administration of mFOLFIRINOX regimen combined&#xD;
      with PD-1 antibody and D2 radical resection for the treatment of resectable advanced gastric&#xD;
      cancer. The deep tumor remission rate (TRG0 and TRG1) , secondary endpoints include pCR rate,&#xD;
      3-year DFS rate, safety, R0 resection rate, D2 radical resection rate, 5-year DFS rate,&#xD;
      5-year OS rate.&#xD;
