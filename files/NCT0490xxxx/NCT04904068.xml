  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to better understand changes in the brain&#xD;
      underlying motor symptoms affecting upper and lower limbs in Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a tremendous need to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology underlying&#xD;
      motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease in order to optimize existing treatment options/develop&#xD;
      new therapies. This study seeks to further the understanding of impaired movement in&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease by examining brain changes and how these relate to changes in motor&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a noninvasive imaging technique that does&#xD;
      not include X-rays. MRI will assess brain activity in response to simple and coordinated&#xD;
      movements of the upper and lower limbs that participants have to perform inside the MRI&#xD;
      scanner. Motor and cognitive function outside the scanner using various clinical and&#xD;
      behavioral tests will also be assessed. The study includes 1 visit to the University of&#xD;
      Delaware.&#xD;
