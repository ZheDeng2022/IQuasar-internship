  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to literature reports, about 16.3%-19% of newly diagnosed NSCLC patients are&#xD;
      associated with brain metastasis, and 30%-50% of NSCLC patients will develop brain metastasis&#xD;
      during the whole course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with EGFR positive-type had a 10-15% higher risk of brain metastasis than patients&#xD;
      with EGFR wild-type. mOS in patients with EGFR positive were twice as high as those with EGFR&#xD;
      wild-type, despite the presence of brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving the control rate of intracranial lesions in patients with EGFR positive can not&#xD;
      only improve the quality of life, but also may translate into survival benefits and improve&#xD;
      OS. Previous studies have shown that in lung cancer patients with EGFR-sensitive mutations,&#xD;
      craniocerebral radiotherapy prior to delayed craniocerebral radiotherapy significantly&#xD;
      prolonged OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first-line treatment of the third generation of EGFR-TKI targeting drug Almonertinib for&#xD;
      EGFR-positive NSCLC can eliminate the possible EGFR T790M mutant clones at an early stage and&#xD;
      better control the disease progression. Moreover, Almonertinib is easy to pass through the&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier, which can not only better control intracranial lesions, but also&#xD;
      control, prevent or delay the occurrence of brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was intended to conduct a randomized controlled study on the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of early craniocerebral radiotherapy combined with Almonertinib in patients with EGFR&#xD;
      positive non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the above studies we hope to confirm that early craniocerebral radiotherapy combined&#xD;
      with Almonertinib is safe and feasible for patients with EGFR positive newly diagnosed with&#xD;
      brain metastasis, and can prolong the intracranial progression-free survival (IPFS), and even&#xD;
      extend the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;

      All eligible patients will receive craniocerebral radiotherapy in combination with&#xD;
      Almonertinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here are two types of craniocerebral radiotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SRS or SRT is recommended for patients with ≤4 intracranial metastases and the maximum&#xD;
           lesion ≤4cm. 24-15 Gy*1F was recommended if use SRS. 9-12 Gy*3F or 6Gy×5F was&#xD;
           recommended if use SRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For &gt;4 intracranial metastases, or the maximum lesion&gt;4cm, whole-brain radiotherapy&#xD;
           (WBRT) of 30Gy/10F was recommended, and then the large residual lesions will be treated&#xD;
           with a local dose (≤DT 45Gy/15F). Hippocampal protection is highly recommended.&#xD;
