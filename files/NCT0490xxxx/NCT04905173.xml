    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of squat-to-stand maneuver in&#xD;
      eliciting left ventricular outflow gradients in patients with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      (HCM) compared to Valsalva, amyl nitrite inhalation, and exercise stress echocardiogram&#xD;
      (ESE).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Left ventricular hypertrophy and abnormal ventricular configuration result in dynamic left&#xD;
      ventricular outflow obstruction in ~75% of HCM patients, which is associated with increased&#xD;
      cardiac morbidity and mortality. However, the dynamic nature of the gradient can make&#xD;
      obstruction difficult to identify. Provocative maneuvers such as Valsalva maneuver,&#xD;
      administration of amyl nitrite, and ESE are currently used to assess for obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A shortage of amyl nitrite beginning in December 2018 spurred a search for alternative&#xD;
      provocative maneuvers. Beginning in February 2019, the Mayo Clinic echocardiography&#xD;
      laboratory began utilizing a squat-to-stand maneuver as an alternative to amyl nitrite&#xD;
      inhalation. Anecdotally, the squat-to-stand maneuver, which decreases both preload and&#xD;
      afterload, has been successful in provoking latent left ventricular outflow obstruction. A&#xD;
      retrospective study (Peng et al, in progress) studying 119 patients who performed the&#xD;
      squat-to-stand maneuver between February and September 2019 demonstrated squat-to-stand to be&#xD;
      a more robust provocative maneuver than the Valsalva maneuver for identifying severe dynamic&#xD;
      left ventricular obstruction with Doppler echocardiography. Squat-to-stand elicited latent&#xD;
      obstruction in a greater proportion of the study participants and higher average gradients.&#xD;
      It also demonstrated the potential to alter clinical management - six patients had severe&#xD;
      obstruction only with squat-to-stand (otherwise would not have been diagnosed) and&#xD;
      subsequently underwent septal reduction surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent return of amyl nitrite to the echocardiography laboratory creates an opportunity&#xD;
      for direct comparison with squat-to-stand, particularly regarding cost savings and diagnostic&#xD;
      performance. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and degree of&#xD;
      provocation of left ventricular outflow gradients by the squat-to-stand maneuver compared to&#xD;
      amyl nitrite inhalation in patients with HCM undergoing echocardiography. Squat-to-stand will&#xD;
      also be compared with other provocation methods, including Valsalva maneuver, which should be&#xD;
      performed on every patient going on to squat-to-stand, and ESE when available. Validating&#xD;
      this novel provocative maneuver can broaden the toolbox of techniques used to elicit left&#xD;
      ventricular outflow gradients and improve clinical evaluation and management of symptomatic&#xD;
      HCM patients.&#xD;
