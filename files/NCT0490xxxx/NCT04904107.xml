  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, investigator-initiated, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      aiming to reduce the percentage of non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) patients admitted to the&#xD;
      cardiac emergency department (ED) by performing the modified HEART score by emergency medical&#xD;
      transport (EMT) personnel.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should be referred to the hospital promptly.&#xD;
      However, referring all patients with chest pain is not feasible, as recent studies showed&#xD;
      that up to 80% of the patients with acute chest pain do not have ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bedside point-of-care (POC) high sensitive troponin testing (in fingerprick blood/capillary&#xD;
      blood) and the modified HEART score have become available and might play a substantial role&#xD;
      in the triage and diagnosis of chest pain patients in a pre-hospital setting by general&#xD;
      practitioners (GPs) and EMT personnel in the future. We hypothesize that patients with chest&#xD;
      pain can be referred more accurately by using the modified HEART score.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>It concerns an investigator initiated prospective 1:1 randomised clinical trial in chest pain patients in a pre-hospital setting. Patients will be randomised to (A, intervention group) a direct assessment of the modified HEART score (including POC high sensitive troponin measurement) by EMT personnel and refrainment of transport to the cardiac emergency department (ED) in cases of a low score or (B, control group) regular triage and hospital evaluation, taking place at the cardiac ED in the majority of cases.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Evaluation of the percentage of NCCP patients admitted to the cardiac ED by performing the modified HEART score in comparison to our control group (regular triage and care). We aim to detect a reduction of minimal 10% in unnecessarily referred chest pain patients (NCCP patients) but expect an even higher percentage. A lower percentage of NCCP patients indicates improval of the triage of chest pain patients.</description>

We aim that the proportion of MACE in the intervention group (modified HEART score) is non-inferior to the control group (regular care and triage). Preliminary results of the second phase of FAMOUS Triage trial showed 15.7% (13.1-18.6) MACE rate.We used the expected incidence of 15.7% as the point estimate (meaning no difference between control and intervention). A higher MACE rate (%) in the intervention group suggests a worst outcome.</description>

    <description>This economic evaluation investigates the health care costs of full implementation of a prehospital rule- out strategy with the modified HEART score (intervention group) compared with regular care and standard transfer to the hospital to rule out ACS (control group). Health-care costs will be prospectively recorded at baseline and at 30 days follow-up, 6 months and 1 year. This includes health care costs due to readmission, diagnostic testing, revascularization etc. The cost of hospital treatment is determined by the Dutch Diagnose Behandel Combinatie (DBC) hospital reimbursement system and the DBC information system, similar to the international diagnosis related group system.</description>

    <description>Chest pain patients in the intervention group will be assessed by EMT personnel by performing the modified HEART score (including POC high sensitive troponin-I measurement (POC HS cTnI)) and the referral policy depends on the result.&#xD;
In case of a low modified HEART score (modified HEART 0-3) patients will not be referred to the cardiac ED.&#xD;
Patients with a modified HEART score &gt;3 are directly referred to the cardiac ED after evaluation. These patients will receive standard care.</description>

    <intervention_name>modified HEART score (including POC hs cTnI analysis)</intervention_name>
    <description>The modified HEART score was developed in 2007 and has been validated to stratify the risk of short-term adverse cardiac events in patients with chest pain at the ED. Negative predictive value (NPV) of the modified HEART score for ACS as well as positive predictive value (PPV) for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) within 6 weeks after presentation is high.&#xD;
The modified HEART score is an acronym for history, ECG, age, risk factors and troponin at arrival.The components can be rated 0,1 or 2 points each and result in a total score between 0 and 10.</description>
