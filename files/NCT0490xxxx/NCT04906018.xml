  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective study to be undertaken at University of Oregon,&#xD;
      Portland, USA. The aim is to evaluate the clinical performance of ScanNav Anatomy PNB when&#xD;
      highlighting anatomical structures during UGRA scanning. Specifically, we aim to assess and&#xD;
      quantify the correct/incorrect highlighting of anatomical structures associated with ScanNav&#xD;
      Anatomy PNB during UGRA scanning.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) has published&#xD;
      evidence-based assessment of ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (Neal et al., 2010)&#xD;
      concluding that ultrasound guidance is superior or equal to other non-ultrasound nerve&#xD;
      localization techniques. A subsequent publication from ASRA (Neal et al., 2016), has&#xD;
      strengthened their position of ultrasound guidance being superior than other methods,&#xD;
      including for the reduction of local anesthetic systemic toxicity. However, ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      regional anesthesia (UGRA) is a difficult technique to master. A key activity of UGRA is&#xD;
      ultrasound image interpretation (Sites et al., 2009) which ScanNav Anatomy PNB is designed to&#xD;
      support. The data collected during this study will be assessed by a panel of intended users&#xD;
      (experts in UGRA) to evaluate the performance and safety of ScanNav Anatomy PNB device&#xD;
      highlighting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation analyses will be conducted once the data collection has been complete. The&#xD;
      collected scans will be processed, and the device output will be generated post hoc. Device&#xD;
      output will be presented with raw ultrasound side-by-side. A panel of at least three expert&#xD;
      anesthesiologists will review and evaluate each processed scan. The majority view of the&#xD;
      panel will be used to evaluate each endpoint for any given structure ScanNav Anatomy PNB is&#xD;
      intended to highlight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and scan processing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 different subjects will be scanned. The dataset will be balanced to contain approximately&#xD;
      equal numbers of subjects with BMI&lt;30 and BMI&gt;= 30 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collection will be performed with FDA cleared general purpose ultrasound machine,&#xD;
      ScanNav Anatomy PNB device will not be used during data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data characteristics for scan subjects (e.g., age and BMI) will be reported. Ultrasound scans&#xD;
      for all 9 supported anatomical regions will be collected from both sides of each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      90 x 10s clips per supported anatomical region will be generated, consisting of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  80 x 10s scene clips: the block view (chosen by the expert scanner) together with the&#xD;
           preceding 10 seconds of ultrasound scanning will be recorded (without the use of ScanNav&#xD;
           Anatomy PNB)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 x 10s non-scene clips: 10 second ultrasound scans will be recorded at non-optimum&#xD;
           block views, chosen by the expert scanner to represent plausible scanning errors&#xD;
           (without the use of ScanNav Anatomy PNB) Scenes and non-scenes will be analyzed&#xD;
           separately. Unmodified ultrasound video and highlighted video (color overlay produced by&#xD;
           ScanNav Anatomy PNB generated post-hoc) will be presented side-by-side to independent&#xD;
           experts for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every clip will be presented to a minimum of 3 independent expert reviewers. All clips from a&#xD;
      single anatomical region will be reviewed by the same 3 reviewers. Experts may review more&#xD;
      than one anatomical region, but not necessarily all anatomical regions. Thus, a range of&#xD;
      experts will review all anatomical regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reviewers will be asked structured questions to assess the highlighting of safety critical&#xD;
      anatomical structures (see definitions later in document) and the performance of ScanNav&#xD;
      Anatomy PNB output for each individual clip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority opinion (at least 2/3) will be obtained to establish the overall panel opinion&#xD;
      (e.g., yes/yes/no = yes) for each structure on each clip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be evaluated and presented by structure in each anatomical region and overall&#xD;
      (i.e., total for each class; nerve, artery etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter-rater agreement between the reviewers will be reported on an anatomical region basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be presented as frequencies and presented as percent of total clips analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will include stratification by subject age, BMI, and ultrasound machine to&#xD;
      ensure consistency across these variables.&#xD;
