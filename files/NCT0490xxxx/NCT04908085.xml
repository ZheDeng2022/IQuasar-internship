  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex disease that negatively impacts a person's ability to&#xD;
      participate in a wide range of important and meaningful activities1-4. MS rehabilitation&#xD;
      interventions often focus on reducing symptoms, with the assumption that fewer symptoms will&#xD;
      lead to improved participation in daily activities5-8. Yet, literature shows that engagement&#xD;
      in necessary and desired activities requires more than symptom reduction - it requires people&#xD;
      with chronic diseases like MS to apply their knowledge and skills to a complex&#xD;
      self-management process9-11 that balances personal values, and activity and environmental&#xD;
      demands. Core self-management skills include self-monitoring, problem-solving,&#xD;
      decision-making, goal setting, action planning, and the ability to adjust plans when&#xD;
      necessary12. Looking beyond MS, coaching interventions have enabled people with stroke13-16,&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury17, and Parkinson's disease18, 19 to develop self-management skills and&#xD;
      achieve personally meaningful activity goals. Occupational Performance Coaching (OPC) is a&#xD;
      well-developed form of coaching that builds competence in core self-management skills and&#xD;
      improves participation in daily activities20, 21. The investigator's preliminary work&#xD;
      indicates that OPC is an acceptable and feasible intervention for people with MS22. The&#xD;
      investigators now must determine if OPC reduces the impact of MS on participation in daily&#xD;
      activities and increases the satisfaction of people with MS in performance of personally&#xD;
      important daily activities. Therefore, the investigators will conduct a waitlist-control&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial (RCT) with 30 adults with MS to determine if receipt of six OPC&#xD;
      sessions improves participants' satisfaction with performance in daily activities (primary&#xD;
      outcome). The investigators will also examine whether OPC reduces illness intrusiveness (MS&#xD;
      impact), improves resilience, and improves autonomy and participation (secondary outcomes).&#xD;

    <description>Measure of performance and satisfaction with performance and satisfaction on a scale of 1-10 where 10 indicates higher performance or satisfaction with performance.</description>

    <measure>Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, 10 weeks, and 2 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale captures induced interference of chronic disease and treatment on valued activities and interests. The scale is a brief self-report questionnaire that is composed of 13 items: health, diet, work, active recreation, passive recreation, financial situation, relationship with your spouse, sex life, family relations, other social relations, self-expression/ self-improvement, religious expression, and community and civic involvement. Respondents rate the degree to which their illness and/or treatment interfere with these domains using a seven-point scale (1- not very much, 7 - very much). A higher overall score (range13-91) indicates a higher level of illness intrusiveness.</description>

    <measure>MS Impact Scale-29</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, 10 weeks, and 2 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The MS Impact scale is a 29-item scale that measures the impact of MS on day-to day life on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). Higher scores (range 29-145) indicate higher impact of MS on daily life.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, 10 weeks, and 2 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The CDRS is a 10 item questionnaire used to measure participant's perception of their ability to cope and adapt to challenges. Scores range from 0-40 where a higher score indicates better resilience.</description>

    <measure>Impact on Participation and Autonomy Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, 10 weeks, and 2 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The IPA provides a measure of limitations in participation and autonomy. The tool includes 39 questions across 5 domains: autonomy indoors, autonomy outdoors, family role, social life and relationships, and work and education. Participants rate each item on scale from 0 (very good) to 4 (very poor). Score range is 0-156 with higher scores representing poorer autonomy and participation.</description>
