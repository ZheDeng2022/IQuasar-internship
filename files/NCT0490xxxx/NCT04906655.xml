    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different&#xD;
      methods of application of glycopyrronium cloth, 2.4% in patients with palmar hyperhidrosis&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess glycopyrronium cloth, 2.4% in patients with primary palmar&#xD;
      hyperhidrosis and compare the efficacy and safety of various application methods in order to&#xD;
      determine an optimal method for use in palmar hyperhidrosis. The study will assess four&#xD;
      application methods (treatment groups). Data from these cohorts will be reviewed on a&#xD;
      continuous basis, and the protocol may be amended to add one or more treatment groups if&#xD;
      required to determine the optional conditions of drug application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is open label and unblinded. The treatment groups will be enrolled in cohorts,&#xD;
      with each cohort being filled before moving on to the next. Cohort A will be enrolled first,&#xD;
      followed by B, C, and D. Each cohort will have 30 subjects. If there are multiple AEs of&#xD;
      special interest, the medical monitor may stop enrollment of one or more cohorts or may&#xD;
      prematurely terminate a cohort(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All visits for this study will be conducted virtually, using HIPAA compliant video&#xD;
      conferencing technology. Investigational product (IP) will be shipped overnight to subjects&#xD;
      that are deemed eligible for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will sign an informed e-consent and undergo screening for study eligibility. Key&#xD;
      criteria for entry are: primary palmar hyperhidrosis for at least 6 months, an average hand&#xD;
      sweat severity score of ≥4 (NRS 0-10 pts) during the screening period. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      includes pregnancy or lactation, secondary hyperhidrosis, prior sympathectomy, open wounds or&#xD;
      infection on the hands, and concomitant use of iontophoresis, botulinum toxin, experimental&#xD;
      therapy, or unstable doses of anticholinergic medications. Subjects will only be allowed to&#xD;
      enroll into one cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 120 eligible subjects, ≥9 years of age will be enrolled to one of four&#xD;
      treatment groups at the Baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed on the application method and will apply study drug at home once&#xD;
      each evening before going to bed for 28 days (+/- 2 days). Subjects will complete virtual&#xD;
      visits to check for adverse events (AEs) and study drug compliance at Week 1, Week 2, and&#xD;
      Week 4. Subjects will exit the study at the Week 4 visit.&#xD;

             uncontrolled infections, or any other condition, which (in the judgement of the&#xD;
             investigator) would put the subjects at unacceptable risk for participation in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
