  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It's to investigate the difference of the number of microorganisms at the DVC insertion site&#xD;
      and catheter tip after catheter removal both in Tegaderm CHG dressing group and Tegaderm&#xD;
      standard dressing group. The objective of this study is to evaluate the antimicrobial&#xD;
      efficacy and safety observation in skin condition of Tegaderm CHG dressing on DVC insertion&#xD;
      site in adult patients in critical care comparing with Tegaderm Standard Dressing.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Central venous catheters (CVC) inserted and PICCO and hemodialysis catheters are widely used&#xD;
      in patients for treatment and hemodynamic monitoring in China and worldwide. Catheter-Related&#xD;
      Blood Stream Infections (CRBSI) pose a serious risk for already compromised patient&#xD;
      population, where it is estimated that 3-5% of catheter-related procedures will result in&#xD;
      CRBSI1 (Moureau et al, 2009). In order to continue to reduce CRBSI, the use of chlorhexidine&#xD;
      impregnated dressings is recommended by WHO, NICE and the CDC. Clinical efficacy,&#xD;
      demonstrated by a reduction in catheter related bloodstream infections and/or central line&#xD;
      associated bloodstream infections has been demonstrated in multiple clinical trials2,3,4.&#xD;
      Multiple studies have demonstrated that Tegaderm CHG dressing is intuitive to use and carries&#xD;
      no greater risk of adverse skin reactions that existing comparable products5-9. The NICE&#xD;
      guidance committee concluded that the Tegaderm CHG Dressing demonstrated cost-effective&#xD;
      benefits while offering significantly improved CRBSI protection, as compared to&#xD;
      non-chlorhexidine dressings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's own skin flora is the most dangerous source of infecting agent. CVCs may become&#xD;
      colonized via migration of microorganisms from the CVC insertion site down the external&#xD;
      catheter surface, during manipulation of catheter hubs, hematogenous seeding from another&#xD;
      site of infection, or contaminated infusates10,11. CHG impregnated securement dressing&#xD;
      maintains low skin organism count while dressing is in place. While CHG has been long used as&#xD;
      a skin disinfectant and antiseptic, challenges arise as the skin's microflora begins to&#xD;
      regrow mere hours post disinfection. A study12 demonstrated that Tegaderm CHG dressing&#xD;
      significantly reduced the number of microorganisms at the CVC insertion and suture sites with&#xD;
      concomitant reduced catheter colonization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many studies demonstrated clinical efficacy in reduction of skin colonization and&#xD;
      catheter colonization, as far as we know, few studies have been reported on the clinical&#xD;
      performance of Tegaderm CHG dressing application in China. A China study reported that the&#xD;
      incidence of ICU-acquired carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) catheter related&#xD;
      colonization/infection was 10.08 per 1000 ICU patient-days13. China KOLs insist on a local&#xD;
      study to demonstrate the clinical benefit of Tegaderm CHG dressing in China due to the&#xD;
      local-based clinical practice and treatment environments. Only with the substantiation of&#xD;
      local evidence for Tegaderm CHG dressing in China, they would like to recommend it to be used&#xD;
      in routine ward/nurse care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, there is a significant demand to have a solid local evidence to prove the cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of Tegaderm CHG dressing, which results to improving local care for critical&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, this outside hospital study is proposed to develop local evidences for Tegaderm CHG&#xD;
      dressing on bacteria colonization as 1st step to demonstrate the clinical value in China.&#xD;
      This study will help to develop and maintain KOL and ICUs relationship as well. And the&#xD;
      generated evidence in China may help for requirement of certificate renewal.&#xD;

    <description>Tegaderm CHG dressing is used to cover and protect insertion catheter sites and to secure devices to skin. It is available in a variety of shapes and sizes. Tegaderm CHG Dressing is intended to reduce skin colonization and catheter colonization and to suppress regrowth of microorganisms commonly related to bloodstream infections. Tegaderm CHG dressing is intended to reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) in patients with central venous or arterial catheters.</description>

    <description>Tegaderm CHG dressing consists of a transparent adhesive dressing and an integrated gel pad containing 2% w/w chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), a well-known antiseptic agent with broad spectrum antimicrobial and antifungal activity. The gel pad absorbs fluid. The transparent film provides an effective barrier against external contamination including fluids (waterproof), bacteria, viruses* and yeast, and protects the I.V. site. In vitro testing (time kill and zone of inhibition) demonstrates that the Tegaderm™ CHG gel pad in the dressing has an antimicrobial effect against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and yeast. Tegaderm CHG dressing is transparent, allowing continual site observation, and is breathable, allowing good moisture vapor exchange.</description>
