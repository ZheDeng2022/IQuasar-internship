    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide a go/no-go decision for a randomized expansion study&#xD;
      by assessing the disease control rate (DCR) at 6 weeks for the combination of olaptesed pegol&#xD;
      on top of pembrolizumab and (Arm 1) nanoliposomal irinotecan, 5-FU and leucovorin or (Arm 2)&#xD;
      gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, to assess safety and tolerability and time-to-event&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;
