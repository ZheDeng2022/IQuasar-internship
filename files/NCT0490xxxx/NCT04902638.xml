  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative joint infection (PJI) is a rare but serious postoperative complication from&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and it is known to cause significant morbidities to the&#xD;
      patients suffering from it. Literatures have found evidence that there is correlation between&#xD;
      patients' perioperative blood glucose level and their risks of developing PJI&#xD;
      postoperatively. By monitoring patients' perioperative blood glucose level, clinicians may be&#xD;
      able to better identify patients who are at risks of developing PJI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous blood glucose level monitoring, where patients carry a blood glucose monitoring&#xD;
      device, has been a novel intervention in various medical specialties for recording and&#xD;
      monitoring patients' blood glucose levels. However, currently there has only limited studies&#xD;
      using this intervention for perioperative blood glucose monitoring in patients who are&#xD;
      receiving total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous dexamethasone is a widely used treatment for patients undergoing total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty as it has been shown in previous studies that it can provide good analgesic&#xD;
      effect and also reduce patients' nauesea symptoms preoperatively. However, hyperglycaemia is&#xD;
      also a known side effects from dexamethasone. There still has not been ample amount of&#xD;
      investigation on how significant this potential effect is and at what period of time&#xD;
      perioperatively that this side effect occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to investigate how intravenous dexamethasone can potentially affect&#xD;
      the perioperative blood glucose levels in patients receiving total knee arthroplasty. And by&#xD;
      using a continuous glucose monitoring machine we are also aiming to find out the variability&#xD;
      of the perioperative blood glucose profiles of these patients in order to design a better&#xD;
      glucose monitoring schedule.&#xD;
