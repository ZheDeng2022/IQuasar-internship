Solicited local AEs are: injection site pain/tenderness, erythema and swelling at the vaccination site.</description>

Solicited systemic events will include fatigue, headache, nausea, and myalgia.</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Change from Baseline in Respiratory Infection Intensity and Impact Questionnaire (RiiQ) Total Symptom Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 21 months</time_frame>
    <description>RiiQ is a 4-point scale and it can be scored as a mean of all scores (total symptom scale score) or 2 subscales scores that is respiratory symptoms and systemic symptoms. Respiratory symptoms subscale score is the mean of 6 symptoms, that is, 2 upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms (nasal congestion and sore throat) and 4 lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) symptoms (cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing up phlegm/sputum) whereas systemic symptom subscale score is the mean of 7 systemic symptoms (headache, feeling feverish, neck pain, body aches and pain, fatigue/tiredness, interrupted sleep, and loss of appetite). Each symptom is rated on the scale of 0 to 3 where 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, and 3=Severe. Higher scores indicating greater severity.&#xD;
The area under the curve during the ARI episode is determined.</description>
