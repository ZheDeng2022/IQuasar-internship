      Women were invited to attend colposcopy within two-four months after a positive screening&#xD;
      test (two consecutive screening tests indicating low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions&#xD;
      (LSIL) and HPV positivity or a single screening test indicating high grade squamous&#xD;
      intraepithelial lesions (HSIL)), according to national guidelines&#xD;

      To describe the source population, the overall number of invitations and tests taken in the&#xD;
      region during the study period were retrieved from the Swedish National Cervical Screening&#xD;
      Registry (NKCx), which has an almost 100% coverage of screening history in Sweden since 1993.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women were invited to attend colposcopy within two-four months after a positive screening&#xD;
      test (two consecutive screening tests indicating low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions&#xD;
      (LSIL) and HPV positivity or a single screening test indicating high grade squamous&#xD;
      intraepithelial lesions (HSIL)), according to national guidelines. All colposcopies were&#xD;
      performed in 2018 and 2019 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Falun Hospital, by&#xD;
      a specialist in Obstetrics and Gynecology. Digital imaging ensured the possibility of&#xD;
      subsequent re-review by an expert colposcopist at the Karolinska University Hospital. The&#xD;
      colposcopies consisted of a microscopic evaluation of the uterine cervix including punch&#xD;
      biopsies as well as endocervical sampling with liquid based cytology (LBC). In the absence of&#xD;
      visible colposcopic lesions, random biopsies at 6 and 12 o´clock were taken to ensure&#xD;
      histopathological confirmation in all women. Women with colposcopic and/or histopathologic&#xD;
      findings that required treatment underwent excision (conization) according to national&#xD;
      guidelines. The consultation also included questions on medical history according to a&#xD;
      protocol designed for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of histopathology and cytology was performed at the Department of Pathology, Falun&#xD;
      Hospital. An LBC sample was analyzed for the presence of 14 high risk HPV (hrHPV) genotypes&#xD;
      and cytology. HPV samples were tested at the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Falun&#xD;
      Hospital, using amplification of target DNA by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and&#xD;
      nucleic acid hybridization (Cobas 4800, Roche Molecular Systems). LBC samples positive for&#xD;
      high risk types other than HPV 16/18, were sent for further genotyping to the Center for&#xD;
      Cervical Cancer Prevention at the Karolinska University Laboratory Huddinge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on vaccination status was retrieved through linkage to the National HPV&#xD;
      Vaccination Register (SVEVAC), an informed consent-based register in operation since the&#xD;
      introduction of HPV vaccination In Sweden, and data was further complemented by linkage to&#xD;
      the Prescribed Drug Register (PDR), a mandatory register on dispensed prescriptions in Sweden&#xD;
      in operation since July 2005. All women were asked about their vaccination status after the&#xD;
      colposcopic examination had been performed, and linkage to SVEVAC and PDR was run after all&#xD;
      study colposcopies and laboratory analysis had been completed. Hence, vaccination status was&#xD;
      blinded to the colposcopists, pathologists, and laboratory staff.&#xD;
