      The prospective non-randomized case-control study to elucidate optimal target population of&#xD;
      immunotherapy from real-world lung cancer patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients are those who receive reimbursed immunotherapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy&#xD;
      after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy per current health insurance reimbursement&#xD;
      criteria. This study will not provide any additional intervention to patients, but they will&#xD;
      receive all treatments available per standard of care at each institution. If the&#xD;
      reimbursement criteria change or expand (to include the immunotherapy as the first-line&#xD;
      therapy) in the future, patients who get to receive immunotherapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy&#xD;
      according to the revised and expanded reimbursement criteria will be enrolled as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because immunotherapy was superior to the existing cytotoxic chemotherapy in terms of&#xD;
      survival and AEs in previous large-scale prospective studies, immunotherapy has been&#xD;
      preferred than cytotoxic chemotherapy after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy in&#xD;
      real-world clinical settings. In addition, pembrolizumab and nivolumab are reimbursed&#xD;
      according to PD-L1 expression levels, but atezolizumab is reimbursed for all patients&#xD;
      regardless of PD-L1 expression levels and thus is available for reimbursed prescription for&#xD;
      practically every patient. These three agents showed almost no difference in their clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness in previous prospective global studies. However, cytotoxic chemotherapy is&#xD;
      selected over immunotherapy in some patients, and they will be assigned to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the patient's symptoms and the physician's clinical judgment, cytotoxic therapy can&#xD;
      be selected as a second-line therapy in clinical settings if the patient has an extensive&#xD;
      lesion that requires inducing a rapid response or has experienced a disease progression&#xD;
      centered on bone or liver metastases, which are known to respond only marginally to&#xD;
      immunotherapy.&#xD;
