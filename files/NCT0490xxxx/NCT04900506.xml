  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dislocated femoral neck fractures are routinely treated with cemented hemiartroplasty and the&#xD;
      direct lateral approach (Hardinge) has commonly been used in Norway. The investigators have&#xD;
      lately witnessed a significant change in the prefered surgical approaches in total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty (THA) in favor of the posterior and anterior approaches. The direct lateral&#xD;
      approach has in THA, more or less, been abandoned in Norway. Numerous studies have reported&#xD;
      superior results using the posterior and anterior approahes compared to the lateral approach.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have witnessed a marked change in preferred anatomical route to the hip&#xD;
      joint when performing total hip artrhroplasty (THA) for osteoarthritis in Norway. The direct&#xD;
      lateral approach, which 10 years ago dominated, is today more or less abandoned. Several&#xD;
      studies have reported inferior results in patients operated with the lateral approach&#xD;
      compared to the posterior and anterior approaches, the latter approaches used in&#xD;
      approximately 95 % of all THA´s i Norway. Many approaches are known for hip arthroplasty in&#xD;
      trauma patients, but there is little consensus on the preferred method. The preferred&#xD;
      surgical approach varies among hospitals and surgeons. Identifying the best possible approach&#xD;
      for HA could lead to shorter hospital admission, faster rehabilitation, better functional&#xD;
      outcomes, lower morbidity and mortality and improvement in patient independence. Consequently&#xD;
      healthcare costs related to a hip fracture could be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of today the clinical results, reoperation rate and the morbidity have improved&#xD;
      significantly in hemiarthroplasty treatment for dislocated femoral neck fractures. However,&#xD;
      patients are primarily operated with the lateral approach, although inferior results are&#xD;
      reported compared to posterior and anterior approaches. RCT´s from Ugland et al and Mjaaland&#xD;
      have shown increased incidence of limping, lateral thigh pain and inferior PROM´s in patients&#xD;
      operated with the direct lateral approach compared to patients operated with anterior&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A meta-analysis regarding hemiarthroplasty and surgical approaches from 2018 concluded that&#xD;
      high-quality comparative studies are needed to further substantiate the preferred anatomic&#xD;
      route for hemiarthroplasty in older femoral neck fracture patients.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Outcome assessors are blinded to allocation by not having access to patients study protocol and by examining patients covering their operated hip with clothing.&#xD;
Patients are attempted blinded by using wound dressings to cover their operated hip and are, unless expressing specific interest in knowing the surgical approach, not informed of the randomization result. To evaluate the blinding of patients we will record their knowledge of which surgical approach they were operated with at their 12-month follow-up.</masking_description>
