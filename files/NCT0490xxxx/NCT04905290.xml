  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the CSPOT study is to determine the best mode of cardiac resynchronization&#xD;
      therapy (CRT) pacing for different populations of CRT patients, comparing traditional&#xD;
      biventricular (BiV), conduction system pacing (CSP)-only, and conduction system pacing&#xD;
      optimized therapy (CSPOT) also known as a combination of conduction system pacing (CSP) and&#xD;
      left ventricular (LV) pacing. Additionally, safety of the system will be assessed.&#xD;

    <measure>Electrical synchronization response</measure>
    <time_frame>At implant</time_frame>
    <description>Standard Deviation of Activation Times (SDAT), a measurement of dyssynchrony, taken by the ECG belt, a diagnostic tool used to provide feedback and additional information on the CRT pacing at the time of the device implant or at a device follow up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hemodynamic response</measure>
    <time_frame>At implant</time_frame>
    <description>For each intervention (i.e. left ventricular coronary sinus, conduction system only, and conduction system pacing optimized therapy), the pacing will switch back and forth between the intervention's pacing configuration and an atrial-only pacing configuration for several repetitions. For each repetition, left ventricular (LV) dP/dt max, a measurement of the initial velocity of myocardial contraction, will be measured for both configurations, and the median value across repetitions will be found for each configuration. Finally, the percent change in LV dP/dt max will be calculated as the difference between the median value from the intervention's pacing configuration and the median value from atrial-only pacing, divided by the median value from atrial-only pacing. This percent change will be used as the measurement of hemodynamic response for the given intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Left ventricular ejection fraction will be measured, based on echocardiography, at the baseline visit and again at the 6-month follow-up visit. Change will be calculated as the value observed at baseline subtracted from the value observed at 6 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Left ventricular end systolic volume will be measured, based on echocardiography, at the baseline visit and again at the 6-month follow-up visit. The change will be calculated as difference between the 6-month and baseline values, divided by the baseline value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Composite Score (CCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Composite Score (CCS) is a validated 3-level categorical variable that can take the values - Improved, Unchanged, or Worsened - at each follow-up visit. It is based on mortality, HF events, termination of device function, NYHA score, and patient global assessment. Briefly, the scoring system is as follows:&#xD;
A patient is considered &quot;worsened&quot; if they die, demonstrate a worsened NYHA class, report at least moderately worsened heart-failure symptoms, or are hospitalized or permanently discontinue therapy because of or associated with worsening heart-failure&#xD;
A patient is considered &quot;improved&quot; if they have not &quot;worsened&quot; and either demonstrate improvement in NYHA class or report at least moderately improved heart-failure symptoms&#xD;
A patient is considered &quot;stabilized&quot; if they have not &quot;worsened&quot; or &quot;improved&quot;</description>

    <description>On the date of implant, subjects will undergo Conduction System Pacing Optimized Therapy (CSPOT) lead placement, then Conduction System Pacing Optimized Therapy (CSPOT) acute pacing protocol, and then device implant. During the acute pacing protocol, all subjects will undergo three types of pacing configurations (defined in the intervention descriptions), and will serve as their own control. The subject will then be implanted with the cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) or cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (CRT-P) device will be implanted. Each subject's device will be programmed to conduction system pacing optimized therapy (CSPOT) configuration. Subjects will be followed for 6 months.</description>
