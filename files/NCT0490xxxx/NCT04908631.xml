  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and feasibility of transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) in combination with home-based auditory training therapy in cochlear&#xD;
      implant (CI) patients. Changes in speech perception performance will also be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will complete a 4 week web-based auditory training program while wearing a&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation device (tDCS). The customized auditory training&#xD;
      program will be completed at home, in 20 - 30 minute sessions at least five times a week for&#xD;
      four weeks. A customized learning and practice plan will be provided along with instructions&#xD;
      on use of the tDCS device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that delivers low-intensity current via&#xD;
      electrodes on the scalp to modify neuronal excitability in the underlying cortex. The tDCS&#xD;
      system has customizable headgear with disposable, snap-in electrodes that are easy to apply&#xD;
      at home without assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Speech and hearing assessments will be completed prior to the start of auditory training, at&#xD;
      the end of the 4 week training session, and again 6 months later.&#xD;
