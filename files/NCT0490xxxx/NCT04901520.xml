  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators tried to find a useful and safe way of training for the elderly&#xD;
      population which can help this population to improve their fitness factors as fast as&#xD;
      possible. investigators have tried to see if different intensity training has different&#xD;
      effects on the dynamic and static balance of elderly women in different time points (4, 8,&#xD;
      and 12 weeks). Investigators hypothesized that Higher intensity would be more effective to&#xD;
      improve balance at different time points. The participants were trained twice per week and&#xD;
      each session contain 4 exercises ( leg press, leg extension, leg curl, and seated calf&#xD;
      raises) and the data have been collected at the pre-test and 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
