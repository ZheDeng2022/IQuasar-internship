  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to generate diagnosis and therapeutic-decision tools&#xD;
      through the identification of molecular causes of PIDs with autoimmunity/inflammation and the&#xD;
      variability in disease outcome at the transcriptional level using a combination of omics&#xD;
      signatures (transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metagenomics, metabolomics and&#xD;
      lipidomics).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Primary Immune deficiencies (PIDs) are a group of monogenic diseases related to developmental&#xD;
      or functional dysfunction of one or several immune cell types. Individually there are rare&#xD;
      entities, but collectively they group several thousands of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 500 000 patients suffer from PIDs worldwide, making their management a true&#xD;
      health-care concern. According to European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID), the age&#xD;
      group in which PIDs is most frequently diagnosed is under 19 years of age (62%)1. PIDs are&#xD;
      causing susceptibility to severe and life-threatening infections by common pathogens, but&#xD;
      they also predispose to cancer and can initially manifest as autoimmune and inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple mechanisms underlie the development of autoimmunity/inflammation in PIDs. Moreover,&#xD;
      their development can be influenced by the composition of the microbiota, which shapes host&#xD;
      metabolic and immune functions and can be modified by many environmental factors. In the last&#xD;
      two decades a particular emphasis was given to the elucidation of the genomic mutations&#xD;
      causing PIDs. This led to a burst of genetic diagnosis as the numbers of known monogenic&#xD;
      causes of PIDs rose from around 200 in 2010 to more than 310 in 2017. These genomic&#xD;
      approaches revealed that: 1) a given monogenic defect can lead to very dissimilar clinical&#xD;
      presentations, disproving the initial concept that a monogenic defect is associated with&#xD;
      specific clinical manifestations ; and 2) the number of cases of autosomal dominant genetic&#xD;
      deficiencies has increased, with sometimes a partial clinical penetrance so that some&#xD;
      relatives carrying the causal genetic variant remain asymptomatic. Hence, onset and&#xD;
      presentation of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in PIDs is highly unpredictable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PIDs with autoimmunity/inflammation usually require life-long symptomatic treatments&#xD;
      including broad immunosuppression or immunotherapies. On the long term, such treatments can&#xD;
      have important side effects or poor efficacy and they result in high burden cost. It is&#xD;
      therefore crucial to diagnose PIDs as early as possible in order to select the most efficient&#xD;
      therapy based not only on clinical features as it is nowadays, but to include the underlying&#xD;
      molecular cause of immune dysregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central goal of this project is to explain the very variable outcome of monogenic&#xD;
      autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and to define predictive biomarkers in order to stratify&#xD;
      patients and to optimize therapeutic choices.&#xD;
