  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cataract surgery is a fast evolving refractive procedure, which aims to restore vision. The&#xD;
      majority of intraocular lens (IOL) implants following cataract surgery are monofocal IOLs,&#xD;
      which have been designed to improve distance vision by replacing the lens diopter power with&#xD;
      a single focal point. Monofocal IOLs have been associated with very few complications related&#xD;
      to the material or the technology. However, after the surgery patients are spectacle&#xD;
      dependent for near and intermediate tasks. This, in turn, has decreased the patient's&#xD;
      post-operative satisfaction and quality of life. Multifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs) were&#xD;
      introduced into the market in the 1980s. This type of IOLs provides clear distance and near&#xD;
      vision, which affects the quality of life and visual expectations of the patients who receive&#xD;
      them. Studies have indicated higher levels of patient's satisfaction with regards to distance&#xD;
      and near vision after the implantation of multifocal lenses. With Multifocal IOLs; however,&#xD;
      patients are still spectacle dependent for intermediate tasks such as computer work. The&#xD;
      recent development of trifocal IOLs has been found to provide optimal near, intermediate, and&#xD;
      distance visual performances; decrease spectacle dependence; and increase patient&#xD;
      satisfaction.AcrySof®IQ PanOptix™ (PanOptix) was introduced into the market in 2015 with a&#xD;
      design that allows the IOL to provide optimal near, intermediate, and distance visual&#xD;
      performances; decrease spectacle dependence; and increase patient satisfaction. Despite the&#xD;
      benefits of corrected visual acuity at multiple distances, multifocal and/or trifocal IOLs&#xD;
      are associated with certain disadvantages, including contrast sensitivity loss, dysphotopsia,&#xD;
      halos and glare, which account for over a third of the justifications used for IOL model&#xD;
      replacement. Dysphotopsia is the result of light reflecting off the intraocular lens (IOL)&#xD;
      onto the retina which causes a variety of visual symptoms that are expressed in a positive or&#xD;
      a negative form. Positive dysphotopsia refers to bright artifacts that are noticed in only&#xD;
      certain lighting conditions, such as glare and halos. Negative dysphotopsia refers to the&#xD;
      formation of a barrier, which prevents light from reaching the retina. The result of the&#xD;
      negative form of dysphotopsia is the formation of shadows that are often in the temporal&#xD;
      visual field. In 2014, the extended range of vision TECNIS Symfony®IOL (Symfony), with new&#xD;
      optical technology using a proprietary achromatic diffractive echelette design, received a CE&#xD;
      Mark. However, it was not until 2016 that this IOL became the first extended depth of focus&#xD;
      (EDF) IOL to gain approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This new optical&#xD;
      technology corrects the corneal chromatic aberration for enhanced contrast sensitivity,&#xD;
      generating a continuous vision for distance through intermediate into near with low incidence&#xD;
      of halos and glare. Despite the benefits of EDF IOLs, Monaco et al. conducted a study in&#xD;
      Italy and indicated that both PanOptix and Symfony IOLs seemed to be good options for&#xD;
      patients with intermediate-vision requirements, whereas the PanOptix IOL may be better for&#xD;
      patients with near-vision requirements. A few studies in the literature have evaluated the&#xD;
      performance of the PanOptix and Symfony IOLs in Europe. Our current study would add great&#xD;
      value to the literature since to the best of our knowledge; this is the first study to&#xD;
      address the same IOLs in North America. Cataract surgery expectations are continuously&#xD;
      rising, and in an effort to maximize patient satisfaction post-operatively, the&#xD;
      appropriateness of a patient for a particular IOL implantation should be evaluated carefully&#xD;
      during the pre-operative assessment. Therefore, further research is warranted to evaluate&#xD;
      patient satisfaction with both PanOptix and Symfony IOLs. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      compare the visual outcomes and the subjective satisfaction results between patients&#xD;
      implanted with PanOptix and Symfony IOLs.&#xD;
