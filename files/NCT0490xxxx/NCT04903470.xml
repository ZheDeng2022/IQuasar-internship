  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic constipation (CC) is a common condition that affects up to 25% of the population in&#xD;
      North America. It poses a major burden on the healthcare cost. The pathophysiology of this&#xD;
      condition is poorly understood and consequently there are inadequate treatments. Current&#xD;
      diagnostic tests provide incomplete and often conflicting information. Fecobionics is an&#xD;
      electronic simulated stool that has the consistency and shape of normal stool. The device&#xD;
      records pressures, cross-sectional area, orientation, bending, and shape of the rectum and&#xD;
      anal canal simultaneously. The central hypothesis is that rectal peristalsis is a key&#xD;
      component of the defecatory reflex which is not assessed in the current paradigm of&#xD;
      diagnostic testing. The novel Fecobionics device will mimic the natural defecation and&#xD;
      provide new mechanistic insights into the anorectal physiology and pathophysiology to&#xD;
      facilitate the development of new treatments for CC. The Specific Aims are as follows: 1)&#xD;
      Study the defecation dynamics in normal control subjects using Fecobionics. The investigators&#xD;
      will establish the role of rectal contraction/peristalsis in the normal evacuation process.&#xD;
      2) Define the defecatory patterns in patients with CC associated with defecatory disorders.&#xD;
      The investigators will determine if abnormalities of rectal contraction contribute to the CC.&#xD;
      3) Use a mathematical model of anorectal passage of Fecobionics for enhanced understanding of&#xD;
      the normal and abnormal defecatory patterns, including the length-tension properties of the&#xD;
      rectum and anal sphincter muscles. The proposal seeks to shift current CC research by&#xD;
      providing a stool surrogate for examining the physiologic parameters of defecation reflex&#xD;
      using a novel device that will record, pressure, deformability, biomechanics, vectoral and&#xD;
      topographic changes in the rectum and anal canal. The noted parameters will be recorded using&#xD;
      a wireless Fecobionics device that can examine in detail the mechanistic underpinnings&#xD;
      (stress and deformation) of defecation reflex/process in health and disease. The impact of&#xD;
      this project is that it assesses a novel, safe, low cost, less invasive, low-risk,&#xD;
      radiation-free device in its ability to provide better understanding of evacuation and&#xD;
      continence mechanisms and thereby facilitate future development of innovative therapies. The&#xD;
      improvement can lead to improvement in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities and reduce&#xD;
      healthcare costs associated with anorectal disorders.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For aim 1 study, the hypothesis is that a correctly performed Valsalva maneuver in the&#xD;
      presence of an inflated bag (stool) in the rectum initiates the rectal peristaltic reflex&#xD;
      that results in contraction of the rectal smooth muscles cranial to the bag and relaxation of&#xD;
      the rectum and internal anal sphincter caudal to the bag. The Fecobionics device records&#xD;
      rectal pressure as a surrogate of abdominal wall contraction. Changes in rectal pressure,&#xD;
      however, can also be related to the contraction of the rectal smooth muscles. The proposed&#xD;
      studies will record, 1) Abdominal wall EMG, and rectal wall ultrasound imaging, using high&#xD;
      frequency ultrasound catheter probe to distinguish the contribution of abdominal muscle and&#xD;
      rectal muscle contraction, respectively to the rectal pressure, 2) The investigators will&#xD;
      study the effects of atropine to inhibit rectal smooth muscle contraction) on the Fecobionics&#xD;
      expulsion, 3) EMG activity of the EAS during the Fecobionics device expulsion will allow&#xD;
      determination of the role of EAS in the defecation reflex. For these studies, 3 separate&#xD;
      experiments are proposed (15 normal healthy volunteers for each aim) to achieve above goals:&#xD;
      1) Record EAS and abdominal muscle EMG during the Fecobionics expulsion test: if the increase&#xD;
      in intrarectal pressure is related entirely to the abdominal wall contraction, there will be&#xD;
      a perfect spatiotemporal synchrony (not the amplitude) between the abdominal wall EMG and&#xD;
      intrarectal pressure waveform as recorded by the cranial sensor of the Fecobionics device.&#xD;
      Fecobionics and EMG signals can be recorded using wireless system in the private setting. 2)&#xD;
      The investigators will record ultrasound images of the rectal wall using high frequency&#xD;
      ultrasound catheter probe during Fecobionics balloon test. The investigators expect to&#xD;
      observe an increase in the rectal smooth muscle thickness as a marker of active smooth muscle&#xD;
      contraction during rectal peristalsis induced by the Valsalva maneuver. The ultrasound&#xD;
      transducer will be placed at the location of the cranial sensor to visualize the ascending&#xD;
      contraction of the peristaltic reflex (contraction cranial to the distended bag). 3) The&#xD;
      investigators will perform Fecobionics expulsion test before and after administration of&#xD;
      atropine I.V. 15micrograms/Kg. Only the rectal smooth muscle contraction-induced induced&#xD;
      increases in the intrarectal pressure will be eliminated by atropine (not the abdominal wall&#xD;
      skeletal muscle contraction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For aim 2, The investigators will study 100 patients who meet Rome IV criteria for chronic&#xD;
      constipation will be studied. Fecobionics recordings, along with US imaging of the rectal&#xD;
      wall, EMG recordings of the abdominal wall and external anal sphincter will be performed,&#xD;
      like the ones described in aim 1. In 15 subjects with CC, who fail to evacuate Fecobionics&#xD;
      bag, The investigators will administer edrophonium (Tensilon) 80 Î¼g/Kg) and repeat the&#xD;
      Fecobionics expulsion test. Edrophonium increases the level of acetylcholine at the&#xD;
      neuromuscular synapse to stimulate cholinergic activity and will be expected to stimulate&#xD;
      rectal peristalsis and restore evacuation in patients with abnormalities of rectal&#xD;
      peristalsis. In another 15 subjects with CC who fail to evacuate Fecobionics bag, The&#xD;
      investigators will administer Bisacodyl (2 capsules, 10 mg, dissolved in 10 ml of saline)&#xD;
      into the lumen of rectum through a tubing attached to the Fecobionics device. 5-10 minutes&#xD;
      later the investigators will repeat the Fecobionics expulsion test. Bisacodyl is a stimulant&#xD;
      laxative, used routinely in clinical practice. It works at the level of the enteric nerves to&#xD;
      stimulate colon motility. The investigators will test the hypothesis that stimulation of&#xD;
      rectal peristalsis by Bisacodyl restores the Fecobionics evacuation in patients with&#xD;
      defecatory disorder related to the abnormalities of rectal peristalsis. Fecobionics, EMG and&#xD;
      ultrasound image recordings, similar to what we described in Aim 1 of the study, will be able&#xD;
      to assess all of essential elements of defecatory reflex. The investigators can assess them&#xD;
      in a binary fashion whether absent or present. Based on the studies in normal individuals,&#xD;
      however, we will determine the quantitative values of these parameters and compare them in&#xD;
      patients as to which elements are in the abnormal range. The analysis will generate data to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that the following elements are part of the defecatory reflex: 1) Rectal&#xD;
      distension by the stool/distended balloon causing an urge to defecate, 2) Correctly performed&#xD;
      Valsalva maneuver that generates some critical threshold level of intra-abdominal pressure,&#xD;
      3) Rectal peristalsis that cause contraction above the balloon and relaxation of the internal&#xD;
      anal sphincter and 4) Relaxation of the external anal sphincter and puborectalis muscle&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 studies will validate a mathematical model of the anorectal passage of the Fecobionics&#xD;
      device to predict the occurrence/non-occurrence of the event in question. In order to build a&#xD;
      successful model, it is critical to know all the variables or parameters involved in the&#xD;
      occurrence of any event. Defecation/evacuation is basically the motion of liquid/ solid&#xD;
      material from rectum across the anal canal to the outside. The two important players in the&#xD;
      evacuation process are the intrarectal pressure (driving force) and resistive force. The&#xD;
      intrarectal pressure can be generated by abdominal wall contraction and/or rectal muscle&#xD;
      contraction related increases in rectal pressure. On the other hand, resistive forces for the&#xD;
      evacuation are related to the IAS, EAS, puborectalis muscle and frictional forces.&#xD;
      Fecobionics data along with the US imaging data, EMG recordings of abdominal wall and EAS,&#xD;
      for the first time should provide all the players involved in the defecation process. The&#xD;
      investigators will be collecting data from the normal subjects and patients which can be&#xD;
      plugged into a mathematical equation to predict successful event. However, above would only&#xD;
      be possible if all the elements in the defecation/evacuation process are known. The purpose&#xD;
      of the modelling experiment will be to determine if the assumption of known elements of the&#xD;
      process of defecation can predict it correctly. For example, whether anorectal angle is&#xD;
      critical for the continence/ incontinence function has never been addressed and the hope is&#xD;
      that using modelling approach we will be able to determine if the above is correct, which can&#xD;
      also be true for the other variables that we will record.&#xD;
