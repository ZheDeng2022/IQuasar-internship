    <textblock>
      Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are frequent in worldwide population. In neurogenic&#xD;
      condition, LUTS can occur from beginning of neurologic disease (SCI, MS) or during its&#xD;
      progression (MS). Neurogenic bladder may be responsible for upper urinary tract complications&#xD;
      such as urinary tract infection or renal failure. It can also decrease quality of life and&#xD;
      have an important socio-economic impact. For the last few years, patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
      (PRO) have been the main way to assess functional urinary symptoms such as urinary&#xD;
      incontinence or overactive bladder. Fortunately, Welk and al. developed and validated a new&#xD;
      questionnaire in 2013 to allow a multimodal evaluation of LUTS specifically designed for a&#xD;
      neurogenic population. The Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score (NBSS) is composed of 24 items&#xD;
      and explores 3 domains (urinary incontinence, bladder storage and voiding, consequences). In&#xD;
      addition, NBSS includes two additional questions related to bladder management and quality of&#xD;
      life. In 2020, Welk and al. developed a short version of NBSS (NBSS-SF), composed of 10 items&#xD;
      exploring the 3 same domains as the NBSS original long version. However, there is no&#xD;
      French-validated multi-dimensional questionnaire specifically assessing neurogenic LUTS, the&#xD;
      USP questionnaire being a generic tool (Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of our study was to validate the French linguistic version and the&#xD;
      cross-cultural adaptation of the NBSS-SF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conducted a prospective monocentric study between June and October 2020 in&#xD;
      our neuro-urology clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1, translation and back-translation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the author's agreement, two bilingual translators (fluent in English and native French)&#xD;
      created a French version of the NBSS. Both versions were combined and disagreement in wording&#xD;
      or item redaction were resolved to maintain a better understanding. Next step was the&#xD;
      back-translation with an native English translator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, a bilingual expert committee, composed by urologists and neuro-urologists, compared the&#xD;
      different versions to create a pre-final version of the questionnaire. Cross-cultural&#xD;
      equivalence with analysis of the semantic, idiomatic, conceptual, and empirical equivalence&#xD;
      of the source and pre-final versions of the NBSS-Short Form have been validated by the expert&#xD;
      committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2, Pilot study : n = 30 subjects. During this pilot study, acceptability and&#xD;
      understanding were evaluated. Participant had to answer with a 3 level Likert scale (A:&#xD;
      perfectly; B: good; C: poor) for each item. Comprehension and acceptation were considered as&#xD;
      good if they answered A or B. All difficulties and remarks were collected to incorporate&#xD;
      these comments in the final version after validation by a panel of experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3, Validation stud:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform validation study, the investigators used the same inclusion criteria than Welk and&#xD;
      al. and included patients with a neurogenic bladder due to multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal&#xD;
      cord injury (SCI) or other neurologic condition such as spina bifida or Parkinson disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation study was performed to determine the psychometric properties of the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators calculated the Cronbach's α coefficient, a measure of internal consistency&#xD;
      (reliability) ranging from 0-1, with a coefficient greater than 0.7 considered as very good.&#xD;
      The NBSS-short form is composed of 2 first items (covering quality of life and bladder&#xD;
      management) and 8 items covering 3 subdomains (items 3, 4, 5 for urinary incontinence, items&#xD;
      6, 7, 8 for storage and voiding) and finally 2 items covering the consequences. The&#xD;
      investigators calculated a Cronbach's α coefficient for each subscale and a coefficient for&#xD;
      the whole questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For test-retest reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) has been used. An&#xD;
      ICC greater than 0.7 is considered as a good test-retest reproducibility. Participants&#xD;
      completed the final version of the questionnaire and they had to mail the second&#xD;
      questionnaire within 7 to 14 days. As this second questionnaire was completed at home, all&#xD;
      participants were called to avoid missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlations were computed between NBSS-SF scores obtained overall and for each domain on two&#xD;
      different occasions, separated by a 7-14-day interval.&#xD;

        In total, 105 patients were included with 59 women (56%) and mean age was 53 years. They&#xD;
        were affected by a variety of neurological disorders: 58 (55%) had Multiple Sclerosis, 17&#xD;
        (16%) had a Spinal Cord Injury, and 30 (29%) had other neurological conditions such as&#xD;
        Parkinson's disease, spina bifida or cauda equina syndrome&#xD;
