  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-grade glioma is the most common primary malignant tumor in central nervous system, and&#xD;
      its high tumor heterogeneity is the main cause of tumor progression, treatment resistance and&#xD;
      recurrence. Habitat imaging is a segmentation technique by dividing tumor regions to&#xD;
      characterize tumor heterogeneity based on tumor pathology, blood perfusion, molecular&#xD;
      characteristics and other tumor biological features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some studies, the Hemodynamic Multiparametric Tissue Signature (HTS) method has been&#xD;
      proven to be feasible. The Hemodynamic Multiparametric Tissue Signature (HTS) consists of a&#xD;
      set of vascular habitats obtained by Dynamic Susceptibility Weighted Contrast Enhanced&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DSC-MRI) of high-grade gliomas using a multiparametric&#xD;
      unsupervised analysis method. This allows us to automatically draw 4 reproducible habitats&#xD;
      which enable to describe the tumor vascular heterogeneity:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The High Angiogenic enhancing Tumor (HAT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Less Angiogenic enhancing Tumor (LAT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The potentially tumor Infiltrated Peripheral Edema (IPE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The Vasogenic Peripheral Edema (VPE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other studies, contrast-enhancing mass can divided into spatial habitats by K-means&#xD;
      clustering of voxel-wise apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and cerebral blood volume (CBV)&#xD;
      values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To sum up, the assumption of this experiment is that the Habitats Created by The Hemodynamic&#xD;
      Multiparametric Tissue Signature (HTS) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) can predict&#xD;
      isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status and the overall survival of patients with&#xD;
      high-grade glioma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center experiment. The subjects of this study were patients diagnosed as&#xD;
      high-grade glioma by multi-parameter magnetic resonance imaging and pathological biopsy from&#xD;
      January 1, 2014 to the beginning of recruitment. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will&#xD;
      enter the next experimental stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) four reproducible blood flow habitats are automatically segmented by HTS method;&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) On the basis of four vascular heterogeneity habitats, the apparent diffusion coefficient&#xD;
      (ADC) was registered to form a more accurate habitat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) To analyse the relation between the spatial habitats and the IDH mutation status; To&#xD;
      analyse the relation between the spatial habitats and the overall survival (OS) of the&#xD;
      patient;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, statistical methods and survival analysis were used to determine whether the habitat&#xD;
      was statistically significant for IDH mutation status and prognosis. For example, receiver&#xD;
      operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis evaluated the potential of the spatial habitats&#xD;
      in IDH mutation prediction. The Kaplan-Meier curve evaluates the validation of the diagnosis&#xD;
      in OS prediction in high-grade glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are still many parameters to use in the future. We can use Dynamic Contrast Enhancement&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) to reflect the degree of angiogenesis and vascular&#xD;
      permeability, can use Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) to reflect metabolism.&#xD;
      Multiparametric MRI is more conducive to reflect the potential biological information inside&#xD;
      the tumor and realize individualized diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
