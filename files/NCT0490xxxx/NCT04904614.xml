  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label trial in which letermovir will be given as prophylaxis for the&#xD;
      prevention of CMV infection and disease to all heart transplants who are at risk for&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus. The study will compare a 30 patient prospective cohort to a retrospective&#xD;
      cohort of 374 heart transplant recipients for the rates of neutropenia. In addition, the&#xD;
      tolerability of letermovir will be assessed in this population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open label trial will follow 30 heart transplant recipients at Tufts Medical Center who&#xD;
      will receive letermovir in a dose of 480 mg daily for either 3 or 6 months depending on the&#xD;
      CMV risk category, and who will be followed for one year. Comparison will be made to a cohort&#xD;
      of heart transplant recipients as historical controls in a recently presented study (Chow, J,&#xD;
      et al ISHLT 2021). Standard follow up will be provided as if the patients were receiving&#xD;
      valgancilcovir prophylaxis. Post prophylaxis T cell immunity to all subjects enrolled will be&#xD;
      tested. Clinical outcomes are detailed below.&#xD;
