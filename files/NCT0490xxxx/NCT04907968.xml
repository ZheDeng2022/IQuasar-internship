      Phase 1/2 safety study of the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) XMT-1536 (upifitamab rilsodotin)&#xD;
      administered as an intravenous infusion once every four weeks in combination with other&#xD;
      agent(s) in participants with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC, including fallopian&#xD;
      tube and primary peritoneal cancer). This study has an umbrella design. The trial consists of&#xD;
      dose escalation (DES) and expansion (EXP) portions for specific combinations outlined in&#xD;
      various modules. In addition to safety assessments, the pharmacokinetics of the drug will be&#xD;
      assessed along with ADC activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is an open-label, multi-center Phase 1 study of upifitamab rilsodotin administered&#xD;
      as an intravenous infusion once every 28 days in combination with platinum-containing agents&#xD;
      in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC, including fallopian tube and&#xD;
      primary peritoneal cancer). This study has an umbrella design. The trial consists of dose&#xD;
      escalation (DES) and expansion (EXP) portions. The primary objective of the dose escalation&#xD;
      (DES) portion is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for upifitamab rilsodotin in&#xD;
      combination with other agent(s). In the EXP portion of the trial, participants will initiate&#xD;
      treatment at the MTD determined in the DES for the combination. The other agent(s) in this&#xD;
      first combination-specific module, Module A (UPGRADE-A) is carboplatin.&#xD;
