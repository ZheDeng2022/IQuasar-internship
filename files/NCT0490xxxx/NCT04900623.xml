      This research is being conducted to understand if treatment can be tailored for participants&#xD;
      with HPV-related oropharynx cancers using both clinical features (stage of the tumor, smoking&#xD;
      status) combined with an investigational HPV blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the test and treatments involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NavDx® HPV ctDNA testing (HPV blood test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;

      This research study involves HPV DNA testing (a blood test that measures the levels of DNA&#xD;
      from the human papillomavirus in the bloodstream which investigator think sheds from the&#xD;
      cancer itself), radiation therapy, and chemotherapy for some participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures includes: screening for eligibility, and study treatments&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the test and treatments involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NavDx® HPV ctDNA testing (HPV blood test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy alone or combined with chemotherapy is considered a&#xD;
           standard treatment for this disease. The investigators are researching the effectiveness&#xD;
           of reducing the radiation doses and, in some cases, also reducing the chemotherapy dose&#xD;
           for certain participants with favorable clinical characteristics and with certain HPV&#xD;
           blood test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy: Cisplatin, or Carboplatin and Paclitaxel (not all participants receive any&#xD;
           or all of these agents)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study treatment will for up to 7 weeks and participants will be followed for 5 years&#xD;
           from the beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that about 145 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HPV ctDNA levels will be measured using a blood test called NavDx®, which will be&#xD;
      provided free of charge from the company NAVERIS. ctDNA testing refers to circulating tumor&#xD;
      (ct)DNA or measuring DNA fragments floating in the bloodstream that are released from the&#xD;
      cancer cells. This testing has shown promise in early detection of cancer recurrence in&#xD;
      several solid tumor types (including colorectal, urothelial, and breast cancer).&#xD;
      Additionally, recent studies have shown a connection between baseline ctDNA levels and&#xD;
      disease risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved NavDx® as a method for guiding&#xD;
      treatment decision-making, but this is an important part of this research study. While the&#xD;
      NavDx® assay is investigational, it is performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement&#xD;
      Amendment (CLIA) certified clinical laboratory and is currently available as a clinical tool&#xD;
      for measuring HPV ctDNA levels in some cancer patients. CLIA regulations include federal&#xD;
      standards applicable to all United States facilities or sites that test human specimens for&#xD;
      health assessment or to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied. Radiation therapy alone or combined with chemotherapy is considered a standard&#xD;
      treatment for this disease. The investigators are researching the effectiveness of reducing&#xD;
      the radiation doses and, in some cases, also reducing the chemotherapy dose for certain&#xD;
      participants with favorable clinical characteristics and with certain HPV blood test results.&#xD;
