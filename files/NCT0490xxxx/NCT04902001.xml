  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While interdisciplinary weight loss intervention have been shown successful among adolescents&#xD;
      with obesity, a weight regain is most of the time observed within the following weeks or&#xD;
      months. The aim of the present project will be to better identify the independent role played&#xD;
      by both the metabolic and mechanical load and their modification during weight loss, on the&#xD;
      energy expenditure and energy metabolism of adolescents with obesity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 28 adolescents with obesity will be recruited from our local inpatient pediatric&#xD;
      obesity centers. Before their weight loss intervention the adolescents will complete two&#xD;
      experimental visits. During the first visit, anthropometric and body composition measurements&#xD;
      will be performed. Then the participants will be asked to complete a walking exercise on a&#xD;
      treadmill during the second visit. Their energy expenditure and substrate oxidation will be&#xD;
      assessed by indirect calorimetry. They will have to walk at 5 different walking speeds. Then,&#xD;
      they will follow a 12-week weight loss intervention. By the end of this intervention, their&#xD;
      body composition will be assessed and they will be asked to perform the same walking&#xD;
      exercise. On a separate occasion (randomly assigned) they will have to repeat this walking&#xD;
      exercise while carrying a load corresponding of their weight loss.&#xD;
