  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corona Virus Disease or COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. There have been reports of&#xD;
      serious COVID-19 illness in children. In addition it has been linked to clusters of children&#xD;
      presenting with high fevers and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis, also called blood poisoning, is an abnormal response of the body to some infections.&#xD;
      We aim to conduct research in children under 18 admitted to intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a systems approach towards mapping the body's immune and metabolic responses to&#xD;
      COVID-19 or related illnesses and compare with other sepsis like illnesses.&#xD;

      Corona Virus Disease or COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. There have been reports of&#xD;
      serious COVID-19 illness in children. In addition it has been linked to clusters of children&#xD;
      presenting with high fevers and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis, also called blood poisoning, is an abnormal response of the body to some infections.&#xD;
      We aim to conduct research in children under 18 admitted to intensive care unit and wards&#xD;
      using blood samples. Blood samples as small as a quarter of a teaspoon, will be collected&#xD;
      only alongside other routine blood tests. By analysing the blood samples, we aim to identify&#xD;
      unique signals of information from the child or young person's genetic code as well as other&#xD;
      chemical markers. This is to map the body's immune and metabolic response to COVID-19 or&#xD;
      related illness and compare with other illnesses like sepsis. It will help us better&#xD;
      understand COVID-19 illness and its association with the abnormal inflammatory response. The&#xD;
      research will not delay emergency treatment for children or young people. Appropriate&#xD;
      procedures for consent such as deferred consent will be used in children or young people with&#xD;
      serious illness. Young people of 16 and 17 years of age will be assessed for capacity to&#xD;
      consent. The study results will not influence the clinical care of patients. The research&#xD;
      would not be identifying any other genetic disorders. Even though the data obtained includes&#xD;
      some unique genetic information, the research only uses anonymised details from patients and&#xD;
      there is no risk to confidentiality. Remaining blood following analysis will be stored in&#xD;
      Biobank for an agreed duration. Specific consent will be obtained from parents or legal&#xD;
      guardians, or young people with capacity for analysis and collection of unique genetic data,&#xD;
      clinical information, sample storage and use of anonymous but unique genetic data for other&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
