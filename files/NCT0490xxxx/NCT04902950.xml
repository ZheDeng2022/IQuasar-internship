  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the use of a drug, tranexamic acid (TXA) to decrease&#xD;
      bleeding and fluid collections in patients undergoing excision of excess lower abdominal skin&#xD;
      and soft tissue, otherwise known as a panniculectomy. The use of TXA in this study is&#xD;
      experimental. TXA is a medication currently used in many surgical subspecialties to control&#xD;
      bleeding. TXA is approved by the FDA as a medication taken by mouth for the treatment of&#xD;
      heavy menstrual bleeding and as an injection in patients with hemophilia for short-term use&#xD;
      (two to eight days) to reduce or prevent hemorrhage and reduce the need for replacement&#xD;
      therapy during and following tooth extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of TXA in this study is experimental, which means it is not approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      topical use in decreasing bleeding during and after surgery. The results of this study will&#xD;
      help the researchers determine if TXA is effective in decreasing blood loss following&#xD;
      surgery. If effective, researchers hope this will result in earlier removal of post-operative&#xD;
      drains leading to faster return to work or social activities&#xD;

      Participants consented to take part in this study will be assigned by chance to receive&#xD;
      either placebo (Group 1) or TXA (Group 2) during the surgical procedure. This study will be&#xD;
      double-blinded, in that neither the patient nor the surgeon will know to which treatment,&#xD;
      (placebo vs. TXA) that the patient will receive. Participating patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive normal saline (control group) or tranexamic acid (study population) on the day of&#xD;
      surgery by the pharmacist. Normal saline is the current standard of care. Double blinding&#xD;
      ensures that the researcher or the patient's opinion does not influence study results,&#xD;
      however this information is available from the pharmacy in the event of any complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group will have 10 participants. The solution of either saline or TXA will be placed&#xD;
      into a sterile bowl in the operating area and three lap sponges will be placed in the&#xD;
      solution at the beginning of the procedure. Group 1 will undergo application of three normal&#xD;
      saline soaked lap sponges to the surgical site. Group 2 will undergo application of three TXA&#xD;
      soaked lap sponges to the surgical site. The lap sponges will be removed after three minutes&#xD;
      and measurements will be taken for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge, post-operative drain output will be monitored and recorded by the patient on&#xD;
      a provided drain documentation sheet. This does not differ from the current standard of care&#xD;
      regarding drain output recordings. All patients who receive a post-surgical drain are asked&#xD;
      to document output. All patients will be educated on routine drain care and recording drain&#xD;
      output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not need to undergo any extra medical tests, medical procedures or doctor&#xD;
      visits if they decide to join the study. Patient participation in the study begins upon&#xD;
      signature of the consent form and is expected to last no more than 8 weeks following the&#xD;
      patient's surgical procedure.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post surgical drain output</measure>
    <time_frame>up to eight weeks post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Patient recorded post operative drain output. Patients will track their 24-hour total drain output by recording the 24-hour total output at 10 am every day. If the output exceeds the drain capacity during the 24-hour interval but before the 10am empty time, the patient will empty the drain when full, record that output, allow the drain output to reaccumulate, and empty-record the drain output again at 10am or again when the output exceeds the drain capacity. The individual outputs recorded during the 24-hour interval will then be totaled to determine one output sum for the entire 24-hour time period between 10am time intervals. Each drain bulb will accommodate a maximum of 60cc of postoperative fluid. Drain removal will occur when output is less than 30 cc per drain in 24-hour period or eight weeks post-operatively.</description>

    <description>After the abdominal skin and subcutaneous tissue is raised, the area will be irrigated, and hemostasis achieved using electrocautery. These steps are currently preformed with every panniculectomy. The Tranexamic acid soaked lap sponges will be unfolded and placed beneath the two lateral portions as well as the central area of the flap for 3 minutes. The lap sponges will not be &quot;rung out&quot; prior to placement. The surface area under the flap will be measured from the xiphoid process to the pubis, from the Xiphoid process to each anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and across from one ASIS to the other. These measurements will be used to calculate the surface area under the flap. These measurements will only be used in data collection and do not affect the principle aim of the study. The remainder of the surgical procedure will be the same for each patient.</description>
