    <textblock>
      National multi-center non interventional study aiming at investigating the effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of the combination mifepristone-misoprostol prescribed in Canada to women for medical&#xD;
      termination of pregnancy at or before 63 days gestational age through a multi-center&#xD;
      prospective non interventional study design.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effectiveness of mifepristone-misoprostol for medical abortion at or prior to 63 days&#xD;
           gestational age, defined as complete abortion without further intervention within 14&#xD;
           days of mifepristone administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety of mifepristone-misoprostol for medical abortion at or prior to 63 days&#xD;
           gestational age, defined as the rate of significant Treatment Emergent Adverse Events&#xD;
           (TEAE) as a composite outcome of the following events: 1. Hospital Admission; 2.&#xD;
           Treatment in Emergency Room; 3. Blood Transfusion; 4. Infection requiring IV&#xD;
           Antibiotics, Admission, or Surgical debridement; 5. Death; 6. Ongoing intrauterine&#xD;
           pregnancy; 7. Ectopic pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the rate of ongoing pregnancy within 14 days after the administration of&#xD;
           mifepristone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the rate of surgical aspiration performed at the follow-up and time since&#xD;
           mifepristone administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the reasons for surgical aspiration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the follow-up rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the delay between the scheduled and actual treatment administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the overall safety profile of mifepristone-misoprostol combination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of the demographic characteristics (prescription site, region,&#xD;
           gestational age) on effectiveness and safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of gestational age on effectiveness and safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of treatment self-administration on effectiveness and safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of the method and timing of determining gestational age on&#xD;
           effectiveness and safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study performed on a stratified sample of sequential participants (n=3,000) who fulfill trial&#xD;
      selection criteria and provide informed consent across a range of clinical practices in&#xD;
      Canada (n=30)&#xD;
