  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a small pilot study of the fermented soybean extract MicrSoy-20(MS-20) to confirm its&#xD;
      ability to improve UC severity with the treatment of standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint, structural alteration of gut microbiota during the trial will be&#xD;
      analyzed. Secondary endpoints aim to observe the changes of partial Mayo score, patient&#xD;
      response of medication of UC treatments, biomarker changes in blood, and safety after taking&#xD;
      MS-20.&#xD;

    <description>Partial Mayo score consisted of 3 sub-scores: stool frequency, most severe rectal bleeding of the day, endoscopic findings and global assessment by physician, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9. Here, higher scores indicated more severe disease.</description>
