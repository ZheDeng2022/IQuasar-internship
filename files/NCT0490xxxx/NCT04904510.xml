  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The INDICAID™ Rapid Antigen Test was used in real-world outbreak testing. The antigen test&#xD;
      was used together with PCR testing. This study was designed to evaluate whether the addition&#xD;
      of a rapid antigen test decreased time to results in a real-world setting.&#xD;

      Description of the INDICAID™ COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test The INDICAID™ Rapid Test by PHASE&#xD;
      Scientific is a LFA designed for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein&#xD;
      in nasal swab samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection and procedure To collect a sample, a nasal swab sample is collected by&#xD;
      inserting the provided swab 1 inch into the nasal cavity. The swab is rubbed against the&#xD;
      inside walls of both nostrils 5 times in a large circular path. The swab is then dipped into&#xD;
      a buffer solution to elute the sample. Finally, three drops of the buffer solution-specimen&#xD;
      mix are applied to the LFA test device. After 20 minutes, the user observes the test device&#xD;
      for the presence or absence of a test line that indicates detection of the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      antigen. An Internal Quality Control line is included to indicate whether the test has been&#xD;
      performed correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 outbreak screening with the LFA In this Dual-Track testing approach, the LFA is used&#xD;
      to identify preliminary positives to trigger prioritization of sample processing for&#xD;
      subsequent RT-PCR confirmatory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outbreak testing population and locations Emergency outbreak testing centers were organized&#xD;
      at select locations in Hong Kong. The sites were made available for asymptomatic individuals&#xD;
      who perceived themselves as having a higher risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or who were under&#xD;
      compulsory testing requirements according to the guidelines from the Department of Health of&#xD;
      the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual-Track Testing Algorithms Two Dual-Track testing algorithms were implemented. In both&#xD;
      approaches, patient information is first collected at the registration station. Two nasal&#xD;
      swab specimens and one oropharyngeal swab specimen are then collected by a clinician. One&#xD;
      nasal swab specimen is used to perform the LFA immediately onsite. The additional nasal swab&#xD;
      and oropharyngeal swab specimens are combined and stored in a single collection device&#xD;
      containing viral transport medium (VTM) for subsequent RT-PCR testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Approach A, a preliminary positive result from the LFA would expedite the corresponding&#xD;
      patient VTM sample for laboratory-based RT-PCR. Expedited testing would obtain results. In&#xD;
      Approach B, a preliminary positive result from the LFA result would trigger the testing of&#xD;
      the corresponding patient VTM sample with an onsite rapid nucleic acid amplification test&#xD;
      (cobas® SARS-CoV-2 &amp; Influenza A/B Nucleic acid test on the cobas® Liat system, Roche&#xD;
      Molecular Diagnostics). In addition to the onsite rapid RT-PCR test, the corresponding&#xD;
      patient VTM sample was also sent for expedited laboratory-based RT-PCR testing. All samples&#xD;
      testing negative with the LFA were sent for RT-PCR testing.&#xD;

    <description>In Approach A, a preliminary positive result from the INDICAID™ Rapid Test would expedite the corresponding patient VTM sample for laboratory-based RT-PCR. Expedited testing would obtain results typically within an additional 8 hours compared to the standard approach requiring 48-hour government mandated turnaround time.</description>

In addition to the onsite rapid RT-PCR test, the corresponding patient VTM sample was also sent for expedited laboratory-based RT-PCR testing. All samples testing negative with the INDICAID™ Rapid Test were sent for RT-PCR testing with the standard approach by the ONCO Medical Laboratory in batches.</description>
