      In a prospective study, the influence of adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      non-metastatic breast carcinoma on the epithelial tumor cells (CETCs) circulating in the&#xD;
      blood and their immunohistochemical characteristics depending on age will be investigated. In&#xD;
      addition to a histopathological assignment of the CETCs as cells of the primary tumor, major&#xD;
      trigger points of the immune system will be exploratively analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, blood samples are taken from the patients at different time points after&#xD;
      tumor resection and during adjuvant radiotherapy. In addition to the detection, isolation and&#xD;
      genetic characterization of the CETCs, the determination of immunological biomarkers by&#xD;
      immunophenotyping, among other methods, is planned. Furthermore, analyses of tissue from the&#xD;
      primary tumor with respect to immunohistochemical features as well as tumor-infiltrating&#xD;
      lymphocytes (TILs) are planned. The results will be classified and correlated especially with&#xD;
      regard to patient age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there are insufficient data available for breast carcinoma regarding radiotherapeutic&#xD;
      effects on the immune system depending on patient age, it is of great interest to better&#xD;
      understand these molecular biological basics in order to identify potential prognostic&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this prospective-explorative phase 0 study is to investigate the influence&#xD;
      of adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer on the circulating&#xD;
      epithelial tumor cells (CETCs) in the peripheral blood and their immunohistochemical&#xD;
      characteristics in younger high risk (premenopausal) versus older low risk (postmenopausal)&#xD;
      patients. In addition, the immunophenotype will be determined using peripheral venous blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at different time points during the course of therapy and&#xD;
      correlated with the results of CETC analysis. The aim of the study is to identify prognostic&#xD;
      and predictive biomarkers for early stage breast cancer patients. No therapeutic consequences&#xD;
      will be derived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, the phenotype and molecular biological profile of CETC will be investigated&#xD;
      and compared with the corresponding characteristics of the primary tumor in order to assign&#xD;
      the tumor cells detected in the peripheral blood to the primary tumor. In this context, the&#xD;
      number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) will be correlated with circulating tumor&#xD;
      cells and immunophenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another goal is the characterization of individually isolated CETC by RT-PCR. The expression&#xD;
      of selected marker genes involved in metastatic processes will be investigated during the&#xD;
      course of therapy and compared with that of the primary tumor to identify therapy-associated&#xD;
      changes. The in vitro cultivation of so-called tumor spheres and their characterization as a&#xD;
      sign of a therapy-resistant phenotype is a secondary objective of the study.&#xD;
