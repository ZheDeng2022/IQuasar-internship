    <textblock>
      This phase II trial evaluates the effect of azacitidine or decitabine and venetoclax in&#xD;
      treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has not been treated before (treatment&#xD;
      naive) or has come back (relapsed). Chemotherapy drugs, such as azacitidine, decitabine, and&#xD;
      venetoclax, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To evaluate the efficacy of venetoclax plus alternative hypomethylating&#xD;
      agent (HMA), as defined by the primary endpoint of overall response rate, for patients with&#xD;
      treatment naive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) eligible for venetoclax plus HMA with prior HMA&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To further examine the efficacy of venetoclax plus alternative HMA for patients with&#xD;
      treatment naive AML eligible for venetoclax plus HMA with prior HMA failure using additional&#xD;
      efficacy endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To further evaluate the safety of venetoclax plus alternative HMA for patients with&#xD;
      treatment naive AML eligible for venetoclax plus HMA with prior HMA failure.&#xD;
