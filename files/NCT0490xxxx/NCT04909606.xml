  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long term corticosteroid therapy concerns 0.5 to 1% of the population and about 2.5% of&#xD;
      elderly subjects. It is currently used as a cornerstone therapy in a wide variety of clinical&#xD;
      contexts. The central problematic of prolonged corticosteroid therapy is the burden of&#xD;
      adverse events associated with its long term use, including bone, metabolic and infectious&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of patients for whom the prescription of long term corticosteroid therapy is&#xD;
      indicated should include an evaluation of the individual risk and implementation of the&#xD;
      appropriate preventive measures. Such an approach should particularly include cortisonic&#xD;
      osteoporosis prevention, infectious prevention including vaccination, prevention of adrenal&#xD;
      insufficiency, promotion of physical activity, as well as dietary management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, nurse-led prevention programs are highly developed for patients initiating&#xD;
      immunosuppressive targeted therapies. Conversely, there are no dedicated nurse-led programs&#xD;
      for patients starting prolonged corticosteroid therapy, for several historical and economical&#xD;
      reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of such programs is likely to be beneficial at different levels, including&#xD;
      the reduction of the number of adverse events and improvement of health-related quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to determine the long-term benefit of a nurse-led&#xD;
      prevention program among patients starting long-term corticosteroids therapy, compared to&#xD;
      routine care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a PROBE (Prospective Randomized Open trial with a Blind Evaluation) study, in which the&#xD;
      primary endpoint will be assessed at week-52 by an independent physician blinded to the&#xD;
      participant's allocation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population is adult patients initiating a first sequence of long term&#xD;
      corticosteroid therapy, to the exception of onco-hematological indications, severe chronic&#xD;
      renal failure and organ transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will have baseline and week-52 standardized visits including clinical&#xD;
      evaluation, routine biology, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and quality of life assessment&#xD;
      (SF-36). Corticosteroid consumption will be collected throughout the study using a dedicated&#xD;
      notebook. At the week-52 visit, the burden of adverse events related to the use of&#xD;
      corticosteroids will be assessed through the glucocorticoid toxicity index (GTI), completed&#xD;
      by the blinded physician.&#xD;
