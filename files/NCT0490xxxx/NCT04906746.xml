  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess toxicity with use of ruxolitinib in NSCLC cachexia patients; to associate levels of&#xD;
      JAK/STAT signaling in blood, adipose, and muscle pre- and post-ruxolitinib treatment with&#xD;
      changes in cachexia and anorexia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer patients on a whole, and a significant percentage of NSCLC patients in&#xD;
      particular, develop cancer cachexia. In fact, approximately 30-40% of all NSCLC patients will&#xD;
      develop cachexia in their disease course, with the highest percentages in stage IV patients.&#xD;
      One-third of these patients will die of cachexia-related morbidity. In these groups,&#xD;
      stage-matched NSCLC patients with cachexia will have poorer survival than those without&#xD;
      cachexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The JAK 1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has been used in many types of non-oncologic and oncologic&#xD;
      patients with a well-established toxicity profile. Ruxolitinib was created as an oral agent&#xD;
      with the capacity to antagonize JAK/STAT signaling across cell types. Based on the findings&#xD;
      of the REACH2 and REACH3 trials, a starting dose of 10 mg twice daily oral administration of&#xD;
      ruxolitinib was established for the latter patient population and is also a starting dose for&#xD;
      the polycythemia patients. Known but manageable side effects of ruxolitinib use include&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, risk of infection, among other conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ruxolitinib has not specifically been used in 1) cancer cachexia patient populations in an&#xD;
      evaluable trial or 2) in the setting of first line cancer therapies for solid tumors who are&#xD;
      receiving new standards of care including immunotherapy (IO). Therefore, in this trial,&#xD;
      investigators propose using ruxolitinib in an open-label approach to antagonize systemic and&#xD;
      tissue-specific, tumor-directed JAK/STAT signaling as a means curtailing cachexia progression&#xD;
      in stage IV NSCLC patients. This study will ensure an acceptable toxicity profile when&#xD;
      ruxolitinib is used in cancer cachexia patients&#xD;
