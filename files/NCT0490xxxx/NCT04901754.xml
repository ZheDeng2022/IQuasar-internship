    <textblock>
      This single-arm, Phase II study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      Camrelizumab (anti-programmed death-receptor 1 [PD-1] antibody) combination with Apatinib in&#xD;
      participants with ES-SCLC who was response or stable disease after firstline standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Participants will be receive camrelizumab +apatinib on 21-day cycles until&#xD;
      progressive disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
      in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Treatment can be continued until persistent&#xD;
      radiographic PD or symptomatic deterioration.&#xD;
