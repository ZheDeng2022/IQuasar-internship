    <textblock>
      Nano-based diagnostic tool can provide promising highly sensitive, specific biomarker for&#xD;
      early detection and treatment of salivary gland tumours compared to non-conjugated biomarkers&#xD;
      and in turn improves patient prognosis and outcome.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cancer stem cells form a small subset of highly tumorigenic cells within the bulk of the&#xD;
      tumours which mainly responsible for initiation, invasion, rapid growth, metastasis and&#xD;
      therapeutic resistance in different types of human cancers. Nowadays, nanotechnology has&#xD;
      increasing attention in multi-disciplinary research fields. Conjugated gold nanoparticles are&#xD;
      widely used as biomarkers and bio-delivery vehicles in the medicine as well as early and&#xD;
      advanced cancer detection and treatment. The current work aimed to introduce a novel&#xD;
      diagnostic and prognostic approach in early detection of cancer stem cells in salivary gland&#xD;
      tumours using gold nanoparticles conjugated to CD24 (CD24-Gold Nanocomposite).&#xD;

      Briefly, a portion of surgically resected salivary gland tumour specimens was immersed&#xD;
      immediately in liquid nitrogen, allowed to snap frozen and stored at -80 C (Frozen tissue)&#xD;
      while the other portion was fixed in 10% buffered formalin solution and embedded in paraffin&#xD;
