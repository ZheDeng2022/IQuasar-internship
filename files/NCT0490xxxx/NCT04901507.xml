  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the effectiveness of treating dry mouth through&#xD;
      water rehydration using this extra oral water pump/irrigation device.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry mouth causes difficulty with chewing, swallowing, speech, and increases the risk dental&#xD;
      cavities. It also can cause discomfort in the mouth, and a loss of general quality of life.&#xD;
      The oral irrigation device supplies a small amount of water to participant's mouth through a&#xD;
      small tube that is placed in the corner of the mouth throughout the time participants wear&#xD;
      it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants will be asked to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visit the dental school clinic two (2) times for study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Wear the oral irrigation device as directed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Keep notes at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Answer survey questions during both dental visits about dry mouth symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Give permission for the researchers to collect information about medications or health&#xD;
           conditions that contribute to dry mouth from participant's medical records.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 - 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OHRQoL will be assess using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). The OHIP-14 scores can range from 0 to 56 and are calculated by summing the ordinal values for the 14 items on the scale. Higher OHIP-14 scores indicate worse and lower scores indicate better OHRQol</description>

    <measure>Change in oral health related quality of life - dry mouth specific (OHRQoL-XI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 - 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OHRQoL-XI will be assessed using the Xerostomia Inventory (XI), an 11-item summated rating scale which combines the responses to 11 individual items into a single continuous scale score which represents the severity of chronic xerostomia. Scores range from 11 to 55 with higher scores represent more severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in oral dryness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 - 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Oral Dryness Score (CODS) conducted during the clinical exam assesses ten key features of dry mouth and allocates one point for each feature. The total score ranges from 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating more severe dry mouth.</description>

    <measure>Clinical changes in saliva flow</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 - 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Data on routine saliva testing as performed as standard of care for patients suspected to have reduced salivary flow will be compared before and after use of the device.</description>
