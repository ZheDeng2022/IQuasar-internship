  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised, assessor-blinded parallel-groups superiority clinical trial&#xD;
      fulfilling the CONSORT criteria for non-pharmacological treatment. A total of 256 patients&#xD;
      will be allocated to either Cognitive Behavioural Virtual Reality Therapy plus treatment as&#xD;
      usual, versus traditional CBT for psychosis plus treatment as usual. All participants will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline and 3- and 9 months post baseline. A stratified block-randomisation with&#xD;
      concealed randomisation sequence will be conducted. Independent assessors blinded to the&#xD;
      treatment will evaluate outcome. Analysis of outcome will be carried out with the intention&#xD;
      to treat principles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paranoid ideations and ideas of reference are among the most frequent symptoms in psychotic&#xD;
      disorders, and they hinder patients in conducting daily activities such as leaving the home&#xD;
      or using public transportation - as well as inflicting immensely on their quality of life.&#xD;
      The social avoidance caused by these symptoms does not improve with antipsychotic mediation.&#xD;
      Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for psychosis has demonstrated beneficial effect on&#xD;
      psychotic symptoms, but the average effect sizes are in the small to moderate range, and&#xD;
      training and resource requirements mean that, in practice, therapy is not delivered to all&#xD;
      those who might benefit. Hence, there is considerable interest in the development of novel&#xD;
      therapies that draw on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis, but&#xD;
      which are shorter, more effective, and are capable of being delivered by a wider workforce.&#xD;
      Augmenting CBT with virtual reality exposure has the possibility of creating artificial&#xD;
      experiences in real time, that make the user feel immersed and able to interact as if it was&#xD;
      the real world. Additionally, virtual reality therapy allows for personalization of the&#xD;
      therapy to match the specific social challenges of each patient. Preliminary findings suggest&#xD;
      virtual reality exposure to lead to faster symptom reduction than traditional therapy. While&#xD;
      the potential beneficial effects of virtual reality exposure to psychotic, and sub-threshold&#xD;
      psychotic symptoms, such as paranoid ideations and ideas of reference, are evident and&#xD;
      virtual reality therapies are promising in general, the research field is in an urgent need&#xD;
      of evidence on the effectiveness of virtual reality therapy in patients with schizophrenia&#xD;
      spectrum disorders. The proposed trial is hitherto the largest trial in the world to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural virtual reality therapy (CBT-VR) compared to&#xD;
      traditional CBT. The investigators expect to find CBT-VR to be more beneficial in reducing&#xD;
      paranoid ideations and ideas of reference in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators expect it to result in improved depressive, anxiety-, and&#xD;
      negative symptoms, as well as improved social cognition and psychosocial functioning and&#xD;
      quality of life in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The target group in the&#xD;
      trial also encompass patients with schizotypal disorder (often young adults), showing&#xD;
      subthreshold psychotic symptoms (e.g. ideas of reference), that are at increased risk of&#xD;
      developing manifest psychosis. The CBT-VR may show efficacy in preventing progression to an&#xD;
      overt psychotic state in these patients. Hence, there is a great potential for CBT-VR in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with psychosis and sub-threshold psychosis, but studies are needed to&#xD;
      establish evidence for the treatment. If the results of the current trial are positive, the&#xD;
      manualised treatment can easily be implemented in clinical practise.&#xD;

    <description>The CBT-VR consists of traditional CBT with the augmentation of virtual reality exposure. The virtual reality exposure comprises four virtual social environments (a bus, café, street, and supermarket). These are daily social situations that generally elicit paranoid thinking in patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. While virtually engaging in these distressing situations, the therapist will facilitate a CBT dialogue aimed at generating alternative (i.e. non-threatening) thinking, diminishing safety behaviours (e.g. social isolation), and building up new coping strategies. This is expected to alleviate distress, anxiety, and improve daily social functioning. Preliminary findings reveal this virtual reality program to be well-tolerated and highly effective in reducing paranoia and anxiety in psychosis. Patients will be offered 10 individual sessions.</description>

    <description>The treatment in the CBT group will follow the core principles of CBT used for psychotic disorders. The CBT treatment facilitates an individualised, problem-oriented approach, and uses key CBT techniques such as developing a problem and goal list, normalising psychotic-like experiences, evaluation of appraisals, and removing or diminishing safety behaviour. Patients will be offered 10 individual sessions.</description>
