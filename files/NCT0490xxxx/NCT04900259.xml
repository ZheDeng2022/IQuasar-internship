  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators aim to reveal how the COVID-19 pandemic process affects primary&#xD;
      bladder cancer presentations, tumor stages and degrees, the time elapsed between diagnosis&#xD;
      and intervention, tumor recurrence and progression, which are oncological results.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The rapid spread of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by a novel betacoronavirus&#xD;
      known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had dramatic&#xD;
      effects on individuals and health systems around the world. Beyond those infected with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, the intense demand for limited health system resources has led to reduced&#xD;
      capacity, rapid depletion of healthcare systems, and hospitals becoming a source of virus&#xD;
      transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urology associations and reference centers have issued recommendations to inform urology care&#xD;
      during the COVID-19 outbreak. It is essential that urologists give priority to patient&#xD;
      safety. Potential delays in the diagnosis and treatment of urological conditions and the&#xD;
      additional burden on healthcare resources must be balanced against the risks of exposure to&#xD;
      COVID-19. While this situation aims to conserve healthcare resources, it has created the risk&#xD;
      of delaying cancer treatment. As a result, the transformation of health services and the&#xD;
      increasing interest of the public in avoiding exposure to the disease has led to a decrease&#xD;
      in the number of hospital admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of the pandemic on patients with bladder cancer due to a decrease in emergency&#xD;
      room and urology clinic admissions are not clear. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the EAU&#xD;
      (European Association of Urology) panel of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer published an&#xD;
      evidence-based guideline. According to this guideline, four priority groups were formed and a&#xD;
      certain period of delaying treatment was defined for patients in each group according to&#xD;
      their priorities.&#xD;
