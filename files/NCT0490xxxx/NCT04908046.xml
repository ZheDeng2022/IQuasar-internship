  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK profile of&#xD;
      HMPL-295S1 and determine MTD and/or RP2D in patients with advanced malignant solid tumor. It&#xD;
      will be extended to enroll 10-15 patients at this dose after RP2D is determined, as to&#xD;
      further evaluate the safety of RP2D and the preliminary efficacy of HMPL-295S1. In addition,&#xD;
      an exploratory study on the pharmacokinetic biomarkers of HMPL-295S1 is planned in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is expected to enroll 52-87 patients, including 30-60 patients for dose&#xD;
      escalation, the enrollment will continue until about 12 patients in the dose group with&#xD;
      response, as to determine RP2D (assuming the two dose groups will continue enrollment to 12&#xD;
      patients), additional 10-15 patients will be enrolled at the dose level of determined RP2D.&#xD;
      The number of patients finally screened in the study will depend on the number of dose levels&#xD;
      evaluated, occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in each dose group and the failure rate&#xD;
      of screening.&#xD;
