  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard systemic treatment for ovarian cancer is platinum-based chemotherapy. However,&#xD;
      majority of patients relapse and eventually progress to platinum resistance. In patients with&#xD;
      platinum-resistant or refractory ovarian cancer, effective treatment options are limited and&#xD;
      the prognosis is very poor. Angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and metastasis, and&#xD;
      VEGF/VEGF receptor(VEGFR) signaling pathway is the most promising angiogenic target. This&#xD;
      study aim to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination BD0801 and chemotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer.&#xD;
