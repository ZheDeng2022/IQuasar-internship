  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have symptoms caused by hormonal&#xD;
      changes, like those that happen in women during menopause. These symptoms can include&#xD;
      vasomotor symptoms. Before a treatment can be approved for patients to take, researchers do&#xD;
      clinical studies to better understand its safety and what happens to the treatment in the&#xD;
      body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug, elinzanetant, was designed to treat vasomotor symptoms. The liver plays an&#xD;
      important role in removing elinzanetant from the body. Therefore, this study is done to find&#xD;
      out how reduced liver function influences the removal of elinzanetant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include male and female participants who are 18 to 75 years old. One part of&#xD;
      the participants will have mildly or moderately impaired hepatic function. For each group&#xD;
      with impaired hepatic function, a group with normal hepatic function will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples will be collected. The physician will also check the participants'&#xD;
      heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG). The participants will answer questions about&#xD;
      their well-being and taken medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will compare the blood levels of elinzanetant in the participants with&#xD;
      impaired hepatic function to those of the matched participants with normal hepatic function.&#xD;
      This way, they can see how blood levels of elinzanetant are influenced by liver function.&#xD;
      This information is important for giving recommendations on dosing in patients with impaired&#xD;
      hepatic function.&#xD;
