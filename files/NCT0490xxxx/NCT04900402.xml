      This study; It will be done in order to compare the quality of life and physical activity&#xD;
      levels of physically disabled individuals who continue and do not continue rehabilitation&#xD;
      during COVID-19. International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ) and The&#xD;
      Quality of Life Scale for Children (PedsQL) questionnaire will be applied.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Studies on COVID-19, which is spreading rapidly all over the world, show that the pediatric&#xD;
      population is less affected than the adult and elderly population. Respiratory complications&#xD;
      are the leading cause of death in the chronic neuropediatric population. During the pandemic,&#xD;
      rehabilitation staff such as physiotherapists are at risk of transmission and therefore their&#xD;
      activities should be suspended. For this reason, a 3-month quarantine was applied for&#xD;
      individuals who went to special education and rehabilitation in our country from March 2020&#xD;
      to June 2020, and face-to-face sessions could not be continued in rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The negative effects of social isolation in children and adolescents during the pandemic&#xD;
      affect mental and physical health. Studies show the importance of physical rehabilitation for&#xD;
      pediatric patients with chronic neurological disorders. Rehabilitation is not continuous; It&#xD;
      may cause soft tissue contractures, bone deformities, decline in motor functions, dysphagia&#xD;
      and respiratory difficulties, among other complications. Pediatric patients with neurological&#xD;
      disorders may also experience decline in motor function. Although it is known that&#xD;
      rehabilitation services have started again with the strict implementation of social distance&#xD;
      and hygiene rules in our country as of June 2020; while some of the physically disabled&#xD;
      individuals continue their rehabilitation, those who do not continue with rehabilitation are&#xD;
      at a considerable level. Therefore, our study; it will be made in order to compare the&#xD;
      quality of life and physical activity levels of physically disabled individuals who continue&#xD;
      and do not continue rehabilitation during COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the approval of the ethics committee, a questionnaire will be applied to 18&#xD;
      children with physical disabilities who continue rehabilitation and 18 children with physical&#xD;
      disabilities but who do not continue rehabilitation during COVID-19. The study will start&#xD;
      with the approval of the ethics committee and is planned to be completed in October 2021,&#xD;
      within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gross motor levels of the children who meet the inclusion criteria and whose families&#xD;
      voluntarily accept to participate in the study are determined according to KMFSS,&#xD;
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ) and Quality of Life Scale for&#xD;
      Children (PedsQL) questionnaires will be applied to both children who continue special&#xD;
      education and rehabilitation during COVID-19 and children who are not.&#xD;
