    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare two FDA approved medications (aripiprazole and risperidone) for&#xD;
      the treatment of behavioral dysregulation in children with autism spectrum disorders. This&#xD;
      trial, done in the context of routine clinical care, will seek to evaluate whether&#xD;
      aripiprazole or risperidone is associated with more weight gain in children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a developmental disability with increasing prevalence in our society. Currently one&#xD;
      out of fifty-nine children in the United States has this condition. Many children with autism&#xD;
      experience behavioral dysregulation such as irritability and aggression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are two FDA approved atypical antipsychotic medications that treat&#xD;
      irritability in children with autism. These are aripiprazole and risperidone. While it is&#xD;
      thought that aripiprazole may cause less weight gain than risperidone, clinically this has&#xD;
      not been proven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the relative risk of ATAP-induced weight gain that results from risperidone&#xD;
      versus aripiprazole in a real-world setting could help guide the choice of medical&#xD;
      intervention and reduce the cardiometabolic risks, and, most critically, address the&#xD;
      limitations of current studies, which have not been able to provide clear clinical insights&#xD;
      given the difficulty with having a representative and robust number of patients enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be enrolled in this study, participants must be younger than 18 years of age, on the&#xD;
      autism spectrum, have behavioral dysregulation, be naive to treatment with atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotics and be seen either in the Division of Developmental Medicine or Child and&#xD;
      Adolescent Psychiatry at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For enrolled patients, the ordering provider will see an order set, randomized to either&#xD;
      aripiprazole or risperidone. They will then choose the recommended antipsychotic that the&#xD;
      patient has been randomized to, or override the prompt. If the provider overrides the prompt,&#xD;
      they will be asked to provide a reason for not choosing the recommended option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measure for this study will be weight gain at a 3 month follow-up visit.&#xD;
