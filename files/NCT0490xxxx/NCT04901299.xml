  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 open label, multi-center non-randomized interventional study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining Neratinib plus Fulvestrant in previously&#xD;
      treated metastatic HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This research study involves the study drug Neratinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The standard of care drug Fulvestrant&#xD;

      -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment&#xD;
           including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  This research study involves the study drug Neratinib&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The standard of care drug Fulvestrant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that about 25 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the&#xD;
           safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in&#xD;
           treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Neratinib for this specific&#xD;
           disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The FDA has approved Fulvestrant as a treatment option for this disease. Fulvestrant is&#xD;
           a standard of care drug that will be administered.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Adult (â‰¥ 18 years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV (metastatic) breast cancer. PI&#xD;
             approval is needed for patients who do not have source documentation of histologically&#xD;
             confirmed stage IV (metastatic) breast cancer, but otherwise have known metastatic&#xD;
             breast cancer.&#xD;

          -  Participants must have biopsy proven HR+, i.e ER positive (ER+) and/or PR positive&#xD;
             (PR+), HER2 non-amplified (negative), invasive breast cancer. ER, PR, and HER2&#xD;
             positivity would be determined per institutional (local) testing, with HR+/HER2&#xD;
             nonamplified (negative) status for this trial determined as per 2020 ASCO/CAP&#xD;
             guidelines, in a biopsy/surgical specimen analyzed for ER/PR/HER2. Patients with &quot;ER&#xD;
             or PR low positive&quot; (&lt;10%) as per updated ASCO/CAP 2020 guidelines can be&#xD;
             considered.Confirmation of adequate (15-20 unstained slides cut at 5-10 Î¼m or 1 block)&#xD;
             archival tissue (primary or metastatic) required before study entry. If adequate&#xD;

             combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the safety of study medications is&#xD;

             contraception throughout the study and after study drug discontinuation (till seven&#xD;
             months in women and four months in males, post-study). Male patient should not donate&#xD;
             sperm while on treatment and up to 6 months after last dose. Women are considered&#xD;
             postmenopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural&#xD;
             (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate,&#xD;
             history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or&#xD;
             without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of&#xD;
             oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed&#xD;
             by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of childbearing potential.&#xD;
             Highly effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement&#xD;
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of&#xD;
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for&#xD;
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same&#xD;
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment. Note: While oral&#xD;
                  contraceptives are allowed, they should be used in conjunction with a barrier&#xD;
                  method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.&#xD;
