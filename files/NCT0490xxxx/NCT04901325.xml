  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study that will be open label and include a total of 20 patients who will&#xD;
      receive the investigational product. PG will be defined by the investigator and a second&#xD;
      reviewer on the basis of results from clinical, histological and laboratory assessments.&#xD;
      These patients will undergo 24 weeks of baricitinib dosed daily and stable dose of prednisone&#xD;
      dosed daily with follow-up until week 36.&#xD;
