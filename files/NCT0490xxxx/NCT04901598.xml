      The aim of the study is to investigate the physical activity level, aerobic capacity and&#xD;
      dietary habits among a cohort of females with premenstrual syndrome&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      premenstrual syndrome can be defined as a recurrent disorder that occurs every month in the&#xD;
      luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and subside with the onset of menstruation. It is&#xD;
      characterized by a complex set of symptoms, which include physical, psychological and&#xD;
      behavioral changes with varying severity. This can interfere with the lives of females.&#xD;
      Physical exercise improves PMS through rising endorphin levels, reducing adrenal cortisol&#xD;
      symptoms, leading to lesser anxiety, depression and greater pain tolerance, as previous&#xD;
      studies showed that it was effective in decreasing pain as well as mental and physical&#xD;
      symptoms of PMS. Recently, lifestyle changes have gained more importance than&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy. Lifestyle changes include many methods including diet regulation and&#xD;
      exercise. 30 minutes of aerobic exercise is recommended for at least 3 days per week to&#xD;
      contribute to the regulation of both body composition, mood and to improve physical symptoms.&#xD;
      Evidence suggests that it can be helpful in reducing symptoms.&#xD;
