  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Months after seemingly recovering from COVID-19, many patients continue to suffer from major&#xD;
      long-term effects. Interestingly, the existence of direct link between the severity of the&#xD;
      disease in its acute phase and the severity of the long-lasting symptoms is uncertain. We aim&#xD;
      at characterizing the long term outcomes in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 including&#xD;
      symptoms, medical history, persistent organ damage and neurological and behavioural sequelae.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The aims of this project are: 1) to estimate the degree of physical disability, including&#xD;
      psychological sequelae, in survivors of COVID-19 &gt;1-year post hospital discharge and how&#xD;
      these long term effect are related to COVID-19 or Sars-Cov-2 infection; 2) to assess if a&#xD;
      link between the severity or the treatment of the disease in its acute phase and the severity&#xD;
      of the long-lasting symptoms exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims will be accomplished by using data from the COVID-19 RISK and Treatments (CORIST)&#xD;
      Project (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04318418). The CORIST study included N=4,396 patients&#xD;
      hospitalized for SARS-Cov-2 infection in 35 hospitals across Italy, between February 2020 and&#xD;
      May 2020. Within each participating hospital, clinical data were abstracted from electronic&#xD;
      medical records. Collected data included patients' demographics, laboratory tests,&#xD;
      medications in use, history of disease and prescribed pharmacological therapy for COVID-19&#xD;
      treatment. Information on the most severe manifestation of COVID-19 occurred during&#xD;
      hospitalization was also captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All survivor patients previously recruited in the CORIST study (N=3,648), will be reached by&#xD;
      phone by the hospital in which they were healed for COVID-19, informed about the research&#xD;
      objectives and procedure and, if they will accept to participate, they will ask to sign an&#xD;
      institutional review board consent electronic form. Participants will be requested to return&#xD;
      a series of web-based, validated questionnaires aimed at evaluating: 1) occurrence of&#xD;
      COVID-19-related symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, etc.; 2) behavioural features and&#xD;
      modifications (e.g., disturbances in sleep, vision, hearing or olfaction); 3)&#xD;
      neuropsychological evaluation, regarding multiple cognitive domains (e.g. memory domain,&#xD;
      motivational factors, emotional state assessment, mood disturbance and quality of life); 4)&#xD;
      change in dietary habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 Each participant (&quot;case&quot;) will be asked to select two control subjects with the&#xD;
      following characteristics: control1) same sex, ±5 years, who had a positive diagnosis for&#xD;
      SARS-Cov-2 infection in the past (at least 6±2 months) and that was never hospitalised for&#xD;
      COVID-19 as he/she had not severe symptoms and control2) same sex, ±5 years, who was never&#xD;
      diagnosed for SARS-Cov-2 infection. Each accepting control will be asked to return similar&#xD;
      (appropriately modified) questionnaires as cases. Comparisons of cases with control1&#xD;
      individuals will offer evidence of long-term effects due to severity of COVID-19, whereas&#xD;
      contrasts of cases or control1 with control2 persons will give indication of long-term&#xD;
      effects due to SARS-Cov-2 infection, irrespective from COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 We expect that a large proportion of case patients has undergone a medical visit in the&#xD;
      months after recovering by COVID-19, in the same hospital in which they were healed. For&#xD;
      these patients, all available medical information (data on fibrosis, dyspnoea, thoracic pain,&#xD;
      respiratory, cardiac, neurological and psychiatric diseases) gathered at follow-up visit will&#xD;
      be collected. This bulk of information, together with that attained from questionnaires as&#xD;
      described in aim 1 will be related to data (already available to us) from CORIST project and&#xD;
      will allow test if a link between the severity or the management in hospital of the disease&#xD;
      in its acute phase and the severity of the long-lasting symptoms exists.&#xD;
