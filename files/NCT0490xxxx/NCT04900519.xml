      This is a first-in-human, phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study of STI-6643 administered&#xD;
      by intravenous infusion in subjects with a relapsed/refractory advanced solid tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will determine an MTD and RP2D using a conventional 3+3 study design with dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity evaluated over the initial 28 days of STI-6643 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The schedule of STI-6643 administration will be weekly for the initial 4 weeks of a 5-week&#xD;
      cycle and then every 2 weeks thereafter (i.e., starting with Cycle 2) of a 4-week cycle.&#xD;
      Subjects will continue to receive STI-6643 in the absence of progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Subjects with minimal toxicity will have the option of decreasing the frequency of&#xD;
      their clinic visits during later cycles.&#xD;
