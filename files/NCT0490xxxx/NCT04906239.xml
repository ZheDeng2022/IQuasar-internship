      Failure to adequately prevent pain after heart surgery increases morbidity and results in a&#xD;
      high incidence of persistent poststernotomy pain syndrome. Aim in this study is to&#xD;
      investigate analgesic consumption and postoperative pain effect in patients who underwent&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass with Erector Spinae Block, a new block.&#xD;

      Failure to adequately prevent pain after heart surgery increases morbidity and results in a&#xD;
      high incidence of persistent poststernotomy pain syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of special opioid-based analgesia causes adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      sedation, urinary retention, respiratory depression and delayed tracheal extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthesia techniques such as pectoralis nerve block and serratus anterior block&#xD;
      provide analgesia in the sternum and protection from pain in the lateral / posterior chest&#xD;
      wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine and a2 agonists were used for intravenous analgesia to reduce opioid consumption.&#xD;
      However, these drugs have potential side effects that limit their extensive clinical use as&#xD;
      analgesic agents. The use of regional anesthetic techniques, e.g. thoracic epidural and&#xD;
      thoracic paravertebral block, dural puncture, epidural hematoma, spinal cord injury,&#xD;
      hypotension, pneumothorax, epidural abscess, ipsilateral Horner's syndrome Their use has&#xD;
      declined due to the high failure rate of as much as 15% (especially for the thoracic&#xD;
      epidural) and the significant possibility of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erector spinae (ESP) block, a new method, provides a wide multi dermatomal sensory block. In&#xD;
      the T 4-5 spinous process, the bilateral ESP block provides analgesia from T2 to T9 sensory&#xD;
      level and results in both somatic and visceral analgesia by blocking both the dorsal and&#xD;
      ventral of the spinal nerves, including the sympathetic chain. This block can provide&#xD;
      sufficient analgesia for the median sternotomy because the main nerve supply to the sternal&#xD;
      region is from T2 to T6. Our aim in this study is to investigate analgesic consumption and&#xD;
      postoperative pain effect in patients who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass with Erector Spina&#xD;
      Block, a new block.&#xD;

    <description>While the patient is in a sitting position, A ultrasound probe covered with a sterile sheath will be placed approximately 2 cm to the right or left of the T 4-5 spinous process. After the T 4-5 transverse process and the erector spinae muscle above it are shown, a quincke-type needle will be inserted into the skin at an angle of approximately 30 degrees from cranial to caudal with the entrance made using the in-plane technique. When the transverse process is touched, the needle will be pulled out and a local anesthetic solution will be applied to the fascia beneath the erector spinae muscle. A 20 mL dose of 0.25% bupivacaine, which has been shown to spread both above and below the T 4-5 level, will be injected.The same procedure will be repeated on the contralateral side of the T5 spinous process and half of the remaining bupivacaine dose will be injected. The total volume of bupivacaine injected on both sides will be 20 mL.</description>

After extubation, 1mg / kg tramadol will be applied routinely to both groups, and PCA (Patient Control Analgesia) and morphine consumption and VAS (visual analog scale) pain scores of both groups will be evaluated and recorded at the 1st, 4th, 12th and 24th hour. When VAS is 3, patients will be advised to press the PCA device.</description>

    <description>A high-frequency ultrasound linear probe, covered with a sterile sheath, will be placed approximately 2 cm to the right or left of the T 4-5 spinous process. After showing the T 4-5 transverse process and the erector spinae muscle on top of it, a 22-gauge, 80 mm insulated quincke type needle will be inserted into the skin at an angle of approximately 30 degrees from cranial to caudal, using the in-plane technique. When the transverse process is touched, the needle will be pulled out and after a negative aspiration test with 0.5 mL of normal saline and after the demonstration of a hypo-echogenic image and hydro dissection, a local anesthetic solution will be applied to the fascia beneath the erector spinae muscle. A 20 mL dose of 0.25% bupivacaine, which has been shown to spread both above and below the T 4-5 level, will be injected.</description>
