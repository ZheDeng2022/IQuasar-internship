    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators proposed an artificial intelligence-based biliary stricture&#xD;
      navigation system in MRCP-based ERCP, which can instruct the direction of guide wire and the&#xD;
      position of stent placement in real time.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      585/5000 Biliary stricture can be divided into benign biliary stricture and malignant biliary&#xD;
      stricture, and malignant hilar biliary obstruction is the one of the common cause. Since&#xD;
      there is no specific early screening method for malignant hilar biliary obstruction at&#xD;
      present and most patients have no obvious clinical symptoms in the early stage, most patients&#xD;
      are already in the advanced stage when they are first diagnosed. Advanced malignant hilar&#xD;
      biliary obstruction cannot undergo resection surgery, whose first choice for the treatment is&#xD;
      palliative endoscopic biliary drainage.Biliary drainage can relieve jaundice, pruritus and&#xD;
      other symptoms due to cholestasis. However,before the narrow segment was placed the stent,&#xD;
      the contrast agent could not pass through the narrow segment and the bile duct above the&#xD;
      narrow segment could not be seen.So it was difficult for doctors to determine the direction&#xD;
      of the guide wire and the position of the stent. In addition, indiscriminate application of&#xD;
      the contrast agent may cause outflow obstruction leading to infection. However, there is no&#xD;
      relevant research to solve these problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRCP is the preferred examination method of pancreatic and bile duct diseases. Therefore,&#xD;
      MRCP should be routinely performed before patients are treated with ERCP. At present, MRCP is&#xD;
      in supine position, and ERCP is in prone position. Different positions lead to differences in&#xD;
      the morphology of MRCP and the bile duct on ERCP.So preoperative MRCP in supine position has&#xD;
      limited role in advising physicians on the morphology of the bile duct. Therefore, MRCP in&#xD;
      the prone position is more favorable for endoscopists to perform ERCP .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, deep learning algorithms have been continuously developed and increasingly&#xD;
      mature.They have been gradually applied to the medical field. Computer vision is a science&#xD;
      that studies how to make machines &quot;see&quot;. Through deep learning, camera and computer can&#xD;
      replace human eyes to carry out machine vision such as target recognition, tracking and&#xD;
      measurement.Interdisciplinary cooperation in the field of medical imaging and computer vision&#xD;
      is also one of the research hotspots in recent years. At present, it is mainly applied to the&#xD;
      automatic identification and detection of lesions and quality control, and has achieved good&#xD;
      results. It can assist doctors to find lesions, make disease diagnosis and standardize&#xD;
      doctors' operations, so as to improve the quality of doctors' operations.With mature&#xD;
      technical support, it has a good prospect and application value to develop endoscopic&#xD;
      operating system for lesion detection and quality control based on artificial intelligence&#xD;
      methods such as deep learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators proposed an artificial Intelligence-based Biliary Stricture&#xD;
      Navigation System in MRCP-based ERCP, which can instruct the direction of guide wire and the&#xD;
      position of stent placement in real time.&#xD;
