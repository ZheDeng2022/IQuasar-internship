      Usher syndrome (USH) causes extensive degeneration in the cochlear nerve (CN), especially in&#xD;
      CN fibers innervating the base of the cochlea. As the first step toward developing&#xD;
      evidence-based practice for managing implant patients with USH, this study evaluates local&#xD;
      neural health, as well as the neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN in&#xD;
      implanted patients with USH. Aim 1 will determine local CN health in patients with USH by&#xD;
      assessing the sensitivity of the electrically evoked compound action potential to changes in&#xD;
      interphase gap and pulse polarity. Aim 2 will determine group differences in neural encoding&#xD;
      of temporal and spectral cues at the CN between patients with USH and patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic hearing loss. Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning techniques to develop an&#xD;
      objective tool for assessing the electrode-neuron interface at individual electrode&#xD;
      locations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hearing loss, visual&#xD;
      impairment, and in some cases, vestibular dysfunction. It is the leading cause of hereditary&#xD;
      deaf-blindness in humans. USH causes extensive degeneration in the cochlear nerve (CN),&#xD;
      especially in CN fibers innervating the base of the cochlea. Whereas there is no treatment&#xD;
      for arresting this degenerative process or for restoring visual loss, the restoration of&#xD;
      auditory input is possible with cochlear implantation. Due to the progressive deterioration&#xD;
      in vision, using visual cues for communication will eventually become impossible. Therefore,&#xD;
      the importance of optimizing auditory inputs through cochlear implants (CIs) for patients&#xD;
      with USH is paramount. However, patients with USH have much higher rates of neurological,&#xD;
      mental, or behavioral disorders than the general CI patient population, which limits their&#xD;
      ability to provide reliable behavioral responses or sufficient verbal descriptions of their&#xD;
      auditory perception, especially for pediatric patients. In addition, optimal programming&#xD;
      parameters for CI users with CN damage differ from those used in typical CI users due to&#xD;
      declined CN responsiveness to electrical stimulation. As a result, the clinical programming&#xD;
      process in implanted patients with USH can be extremely challenging. To date, auditory neural&#xD;
      encoding of electrical stimulation in patients with USH has not been systematically&#xD;
      evaluated. Consequently, the field lacks evidence-based practice guidelines for managing&#xD;
      implanted patients with USH. For patients who cannot provide reliable feedback, clinicians&#xD;
      rely on a &quot;trial-and-error&quot; approach for adjusting CI programming settings, which ultimately&#xD;
      may not result in appropriate programming maps for individual patients. Therefore, there is&#xD;
      an urgent need to develop objective clinical tools for optimizing CI settings for these&#xD;
      patients. As the first step toward developing evidence-based practice for managing patients&#xD;
      with USH, this study evaluates local neural health, as well as the neural encoding of&#xD;
      temporal and spectral cues at the CN in implanted patients with USH. Aim 1 will determine&#xD;
      local CN health in patients with USH by assessing the sensitivity of the electrically evoked&#xD;
      compound action potential to changes in interphase gap and pulse polarity. Aim 2 will&#xD;
      determine group differences in neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN&#xD;
      between patients with USH and patients with idiopathic hearing loss. Aim 3 will use&#xD;
      supervised machine learning techniques to develop an objective tool for assessing the&#xD;
      electrode-neuron interface at individual electrode locations. Results of this study have high&#xD;
      scientific significance because they will establish how CN degeneration affects neural&#xD;
      encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, and identify tests that distinguish the&#xD;
      loss of spiral ganglion neurons from the loss of peripheral axons. Results of this study also&#xD;
      have high clinical significance because they will 1) lay the groundwork for developing&#xD;
      effective, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for managing patients with USH, and 2)&#xD;
      yield an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neuron interface in all CI&#xD;
      users, which is foundational for creating optimal programming maps for individual patients.&#xD;
