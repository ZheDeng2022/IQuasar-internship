      The investigators developed and implemented an eight-week multicomponent care management&#xD;
      intervention for non-cardiac chest pain. Team members including a cardiologist, nurse, and&#xD;
      psychiatrist. Impressions and recommendations were shared with the patient's primary care&#xD;
      physician. Measures of chest pain severity, frequency and impact and measures of&#xD;
      psychological health and health-related quality of life were completed at baseline and&#xD;
      intervention completion.&#xD;

      The investigators developed and implemented an eight-week multicomponent care management&#xD;
      intervention for non-cardiac chest pain. The care management team consisted of a nurse,&#xD;
      cardiologist, and psychiatrist. Following a one-time consultation visit with the cardiologist&#xD;
      and nurse, evaluation and treatment recommendations were conveyed to the participant's&#xD;
      primary care physician. Then, the nurse completed eight weekly phone calls with the&#xD;
      participant to provide support, introduce therapeutic principles, and assist with&#xD;
      coordination of care, under the supervision of a psychiatrist. Intervention feasibility was&#xD;
      assessed on several domains including adherence, recruitment, attrition, safety, and data&#xD;
      collection. To examine preliminary efficacy, participants completed Likert scales of chest&#xD;
      pain symptom severity, frequency and impact, and measures of psychological health (Patient&#xD;
      Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-15) and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (12-Item Short Form Survey) at baseline and intervention&#xD;
      completion.&#xD;
