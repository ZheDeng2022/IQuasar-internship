  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will determine whether a daily-caloric restriction-based weight loss&#xD;
      intervention can slow kidney growth in adults with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney&#xD;
      disease who are overweight or obese. The study will also evaluate changes in abdominal fat by&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging. Blood and fat samples will provide insight into biological&#xD;
      changes that may contribute to any observed benefits of the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by development and&#xD;
      continued growth of numerous fluid-filled renal cysts that ultimately result in renal&#xD;
      failure. Similar to the general population, the prevalence of overweight and obesity have&#xD;
      been rising in ADPKD patients, effecting about two-thirds of individuals. Adipocytes do not&#xD;
      simply act as a fat reservoir, but are active endocrine organs that promote release of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, and thus, may be a promising clinical target for ADPKD&#xD;
      management. Mounting evidence also suggests that a metabolic defect exists in ADPKD, which&#xD;
      likely contributes to cystic epithelial proliferation and subsequent cyst growth.&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators recently reported that overweight and obesity are strong&#xD;
      independent predictors of more rapid kidney growth. Collectively, these data suggest that&#xD;
      interventions to reduce abdominal adiposity may slow ADPKD progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial results from the investigators' R03-funded pilot and feasibility study support that a&#xD;
      12-month daily caloric restriction (DCR)-based behavioral weight loss intervention in adults&#xD;
      with ADPKD and overweight or obesity: 1) is feasible and acceptable; 2) slowed kidney growth&#xD;
      (annual %∆ in height-adjusted TKV [htTKV]), which was highly correlated with weight loss; 3)&#xD;
      reduced abdominal adiposity; and 4) altered pathways implicated in ADPKD progression and&#xD;
      metabolism. These initial results suggest that a DCR-based behavioral weight loss&#xD;
      intervention offers a promising strategy to slow ADPKD progression. However, the pilot and&#xD;
      feasibility study was limited by a small sample size, relatively short duration, and lack of&#xD;
      a control group. Thus, to translate these promising results of the pilot study towards&#xD;
      clinical practice, the investigators are conducting a randomized, controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      in a larger number of adults with ADPKD and overweight or obesity to directly compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of a DCR-based behavioral weight loss intervention compared to control for slowing&#xD;
      kidney growth (primary outcome) over a longer duration. Changes in abdominal adiposity will&#xD;
      serve as a secondary outcome and effects of weight loss on circulating and adipose markers of&#xD;
      biological pathways will provide mechanistic insight.&#xD;
