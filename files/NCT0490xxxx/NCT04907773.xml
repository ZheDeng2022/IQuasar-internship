  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, prospective, and interventional study investigating the potassium&#xD;
      measurement with the CardioRenal device in capillary blood. It will be conducted at one&#xD;
      investigational site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will have capillary blood collections. Additionally as a reference a venous&#xD;
      blood collection will be conducted&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiorenal is a company aiming to develop in-vitro diagnostic medical devices to measure the&#xD;
      potassium from a single drop of capillary blood to allow an everyday home monitoring of the&#xD;
      potassium value like with the diabetes patients who supervise their blood sugar level by&#xD;
      measurements with glucose-test stripe from a drop of capillary blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major problem for the blood potassium monitoring at clinical levels is caused by hemolysis&#xD;
      leading to the overestimation of potassium level. Hemolysis is the lysis of red blood cells&#xD;
      (RBC, erythrocytes) and the release of their contents into plasma. The hemolysis may occur&#xD;
      from in vivo or in vitro causes (milking, pressure…). It has also been reported that&#xD;
      capillary puncture may induce increased level of hemolysis compared to venous sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CardioRenal aims to limit those factors to guarantee an accurate measurement of potassium&#xD;
      concentration in a capillary sample by using a standardized method of capillary pricking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After clarification the approval the Informed Consent is signed and the inclusion as well as&#xD;
      exclusion criteria (incl. demography, concomitant medication and medical history) or vital&#xD;
      parameters (weight), are raised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With 40 healthy subjects capillary and venous blood is taken. Blood is taken from the subject&#xD;
      by trained specialist staff. The capillary blood sampling occurs in 400 µl Lithium-Heparin BD&#xD;
      vacutainer Microtainers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of &lt;1mL volume of capillary blood is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition 10 ml blood from the vein of a forearm is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With 30 hemodialysed subjects capillary and venous blood is taken before and/or after&#xD;
      dialysis session to extend the potassium concentration range. Blood is taken from the subject&#xD;
      by trained specialist staff. The capillary blood sampling occurs in 400 µl Lithium-Heparin BD&#xD;
      vacutainer Microtainers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening based on potassium measurement just before the capillary puncture is&#xD;
           performed to test the eligibility of the subject : a 2.5mL blood is taken from the&#xD;
           fistula or the central venous catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of &lt;1mL volume of capillary blood is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition 10 ml blood from the fistula or the central venous catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To guarantee a light blood decrease without strong mechanical pressure, the site for&#xD;
      capillary puncture are warmed up before the capillary sampling during 2 minutes before&#xD;
      puncture.&#xD;
