             generalized seizures according to the International League Against Epilepsy's (ILAE)&#xD;
             Classification of Epileptic Seizures). A diagnosis should have been established at&#xD;
             least 6 months prior to Visit 1 by clinical history and an electroencephalogram (EEG)&#xD;
             that is consistent with the diagnosis; normal interictal EEGs will be allows provided&#xD;
             that the participant meets the other diagnosis criterion (i.e., clinical history,&#xD;
             including a history of treatment failure with at least 2 AEDs)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female subjects, from age 2 to less than 18 years at the time of informed&#xD;
             consent&#xD;

             representative (LAR) prior to entering the study in accordance with the ICH GCP&#xD;
             guidelines. Age appropriate assent will be obtained for children and adolescents. If&#xD;
             the written informed consent is provided by the legal guardian or LAR because the&#xD;
             subject is unable to do so, a written or verbal assent from the subject must also be&#xD;
             obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Are currently being treated with stable doses of 1 to a maximum of 2 approved&#xD;
             antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Doses must be stable for at least 4 weeks before to Visit&#xD;
             1; in the case where a new AED regimen has been initiated for a participant, the dose&#xD;
             must be stable for at least 8 weeks prior to Visit 1. A vagal nerve stimulator (VNS)&#xD;
             will not be counted as one of the 2 allowable AEDs&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. In the Investigator's opinion, parents or caregivers must be able to report accurate&#xD;

             duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects following a ketogenic diet will be allowed as long as the diet has been&#xD;
             stable for at least 30 days prior to Visit 1 (Screening) and will remain stable for&#xD;
             the duration of the study&#xD;
