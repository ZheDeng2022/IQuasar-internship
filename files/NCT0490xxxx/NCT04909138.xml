    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate the use of intermittent dosing as an alternative paradigm&#xD;
      patients with DRG stimulation in place for at least 1 year who now endorse decreasing&#xD;
      efficacy of their system. Inclusion criteria require that patients endorse a VAS score of 6&#xD;
      or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be prospectively randomized to one of two stimulation paradigms both of which&#xD;
      involve intermittent dosing at 30 seconds ON and 90 seconds OFF. Group 1 will have their&#xD;
      frequency set at 20 Hz with amplitude set just below perception. Group 2 will have their&#xD;
      frequency set at 5 Hz with amplitude set just below perception. This study will be performed&#xD;
      in a crossover fashion, meaning patients will be changed to the alternate dosing regimen at&#xD;
      the 12-week time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen and evaluated prior to randomization and reprogramming, and thereafter&#xD;
      evaluated at 2, 4 and 6-weeks. At the 6-week time period, patients will be crossed over to&#xD;
      the other study arm and thereafter evaluated at 2, 4 and 6 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) is a novel target of neuromodulation that's use has grown as a&#xD;
      proven effective treatment in chronic painful conditions. Studies examining tonic,&#xD;
      paresthesia-based dorsal column stimulation have demonstrated plateauing or diminishing&#xD;
      effects after extended time periods. Although not yet studied in DRG stimulation due to its&#xD;
      relative infancy, the possibility of decreased pain relief over time very much exists. In&#xD;
      order to mitigate the potential for waning pain relief over time, other paradigms of&#xD;
      stimulation within the framework of DRG therapy must be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent dosing (ID) refers to the cycling of stimulation, in which there is a designated&#xD;
      time period of stimulation being active (ON) and inactive (OFF). Previous studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated the safe and effective use of intermittent dosing. In 2020, Deer et al. reported&#xD;
      the efficacy of intermittent dosing of Burst stimulation with settings ranging from 30&#xD;
      seconds ON and 90 seconds OFF, to 30 seconds ON and 360 seconds OFF.10 In this 50 subject&#xD;
      study, 45.8% of patients preferred stimulation with 30 seconds ON and 360 seconds OFF.&#xD;
      However, no studies have examined the use of ID in DRG stimulation. . Furthermore, a&#xD;
      pre-clinical study by Chao et al. 2020 showed that DRG field stimulation delivered at 20 Hz&#xD;
      continuously abated transmission of action potentials in most C-type fibers and 50% of Aδ&#xD;
      fibers. Conversely, DRG field stimulation delivered at 5 Hz consistently evoked action&#xD;
      potentials in Aβ, Aδ, and C type fibers, suggesting that this frequency may have greater&#xD;
      potential to mitigate pain11. Nevertheless, translation of these results to clinical practice&#xD;
      have yet to be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic pain secondary to CRPS or other chronic neuropathic who have responded&#xD;
      to DRG stimulation originally and have undergone permanent DRG stimulator implantation&#xD;
      delivered by the Abbott PROCLAIM Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurostimulator System, have had the&#xD;
      system in place for at least 1 year, utilizing continuous tonic therapy, and now endorsing&#xD;
      decreasing efficacy of continuous DRG stimulation therapy will be randomized to 1 of 2 study&#xD;
      arms, in a single-blinded, 1:1 fashion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. High ID Arm: DRG stimulation therapy at 20 Hz frequency for 30 seconds ON, 90 seconds&#xD;
           OFF&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Low ID Arm: DRG stimulation therapy at 5 Hz frequency for 30 seconds ON, 90 seconds OFF&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen and evaluated prior to randomization and reprogramming, and thereafter&#xD;
      evaluated at 4,8, and 12-weeks. At the 12-week time period, patients will be crossed over to&#xD;
      the other study arm and thereafter evaluated at 16, 20, and 24-weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As our primary endpoint, we hypothesize that intermittent dosing with either 20 Hz frequency&#xD;
      (high) or 5 Hz frequency (low) ID will provide superior pain relief as measured by VAS scores&#xD;
      when compared to continuous DRG stimulation therapy in this patient population. Other&#xD;
      endpoints include: EQ-5D scores of wellbeing; PROMIS score for physical function, pain&#xD;
      interference, sleep disturbance, and emotional distress; chronic pain acceptance&#xD;
      questionnaire 8 (CPAQ-8), patient satisfaction scores, and patient global impression of&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After evaluation, all eligible and consented subjects will be randomized into one of two&#xD;
      treatment groups. Randomization will be performed using a computer-generated random sequence&#xD;
      generator with equal selection probabilities to all groups. Subjects will be blinded to their&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, each consented subject will present to clinic at which time will first&#xD;
      be seen by a team of investigators, sub-investigators, and/or study staff. Patients will be&#xD;
      sent for x-ray at initial presentation to evaluate for real-time DRG lead position. Patient&#xD;
      will be excluded from study if there is significant migration, at the discretion of&#xD;
      clinician. Patients will have had at least one prior attempted reprogramming in standard&#xD;
      fashion (increasing amplitude firing in tonic stimulation to document stimulation is&#xD;
      targeting dermatome of initial placement) before enrollment in this study. Otherwise, after&#xD;
      evaluation and collection of baseline data, a clinical specialist for the Abbott PROCLAIM XR&#xD;
      Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurostimulator System will program the subject's DRG system according&#xD;
      to the treatment group to which they have been randomized, under direct physician supervision&#xD;
      and with use of the radiographic films.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be subsequently evaluated at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. At the 12-week time interval,&#xD;
      the patient will be crossed over to the alternative study arm. Thereafter, they will be&#xD;
      evaluated again at the 16-week, 20 week, and 24 week time interval. At each interval, the&#xD;
      patient will be evaluated by a team of investigators, sub-investigators, and/or study staff&#xD;
      to administer questionnaires and collect data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient specific data to be collected prior to first allocated burst stimulation mode will&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current daily morphine milligram equivalent usage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks of stimulation only:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PROMIS Health questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Global Health 10 item questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical Function 8b questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Emotional Distress-8a Anxiety questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sleep Disturbance 4a questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fatigue 8 item questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CPAQ-8 score (Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire 8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient Global Impression of Change (see fig. 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient Satisfaction Score (7-point Likert-type scale; see fig. 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected at each study visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NRS pain scores (22-point scale, 0-10 in 0.5 increments)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current dorsal root ganglion stimulation parameters (i.e. mode of stimulation-continuous&#xD;
           vs. ID, frequency, amplitude, pulse width)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Average charging frequency over last week (see fig. 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks &amp; Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with all clinical research, there exists a potential for loss of confidentiality. Measure&#xD;
      to protect the confidentiality of study participants will be implemented as described in the&#xD;
      Data Collection &amp; Management Section Below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further loss of therapeutic pain relief is another potential risk that could occur following&#xD;
      reprogramming to ID parameters. If at any point a subject reports diminishing pain relief and&#xD;
      wishes to return to baseline mode of stimulation, they will be allowed to do so and&#xD;
      considered a study failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may experience benefit in the form of pain relief and improved functionality&#xD;
      following reprogramming to ID parameters. However, if the patient chooses to no longer&#xD;
      participate in the study, they may still receive treatment from the treating physician, which&#xD;
      may include the ID parameters, administered separately, being investigated in this study.&#xD;
