  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive ventilation(IV) remains one key cornerstone to reduce neonatal mortality for preterm&#xD;
      infants with respiratory distress syndrome(RDS) and/or acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome(ARDS). However, it is also related to increased risks of ventilator-associated lung&#xD;
      injury and escalation of pulmonary inflammation, and which finally result in bronchopulmonary&#xD;
      dysplasia (BPD). Early weaning from IV in newborn infants with BPD is therefore a key&#xD;
      procedure to reduce these risks above.&#xD;

      Supplying with the combined advantages of NCPAP and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation&#xD;
      (HFOV) with high carbon dioxide(CO2) removal, no need for synchronisation, non-invasion, less&#xD;
      volume/barotraumas, and increased functional residual capacity, nasal HFOV(NHFOV) was&#xD;
      considered as a strengthened version of NCPAP. Furthermore, the superimposed oscillations of&#xD;
      NHFOV could avoid gas-trapping, and allowed to obviously up-regulate mean airway pressure&#xD;
      (MAP) more than NCPAP. Thus, NHFOV might be more beneficial as post-extubation respiratory&#xD;
      support strategy to avoid re-intubation and subsequent complications and/or sequelae as&#xD;
      compared with NCPAP in preterm infants. Nowadays, NHFOV was increasingly used in neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit (NICU) around the world due to its convenient operation. A retrospective&#xD;
      review has reported the beneficial effects of NHFOV in preterm infants as a remedial measure&#xD;
      after failing to other noninvasive modes, including reducing the number of apneas,&#xD;
      bradycardias or oxygen desaturations. However, there were rare randomized controlled studies&#xD;
      comparing NHFOV with NCPAP in preterm infants with BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have found that NHFOV is superior to NCPAP in avoiding re-intubation in very preterm&#xD;
      infants with the first extubation. The purpose of the present study was to compare NHFOV with&#xD;
      NCPAP as post-extubation respiratory support strategies on the need for endotracheal&#xD;
      ventilation, as well as pressure of CO2(PCO2) level in preterm infants with BPD.&#xD;
