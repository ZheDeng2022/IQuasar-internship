      Patients with digestive tract malignancy often experience severe and unremitting abdominal&#xD;
      pain that negatively affects physical, emotional, and social function, as well as health&#xD;
      related quality of life (HRQOL). Therapeutic virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a promising&#xD;
      and evidence-based treatment modality for cancer pain. Users of VR wear a pair of goggles&#xD;
      with a close-proximity screen in front of the eyes that creates a sensation of being&#xD;
      transported into lifelike, three-dimensional worlds. To date, VR has been limited to&#xD;
      short-term clinical trials for cancer pain. Moreover, limited research exists on theory-based&#xD;
      VR modalities beyond mere distraction, such as VR that employs acceptance and commitment&#xD;
      therapy (ACT) with components of biofeedback and mindfulness. To bridge these gaps, this&#xD;
      study seeks to: (1) assess the impact of immersive VR on patient-reported outcomes (PROs),&#xD;
      including pain, activity metrics, and opioid use among patients with visceral pain from a&#xD;
      digestive tract malignancy; (2) assess differences in PROs, activity metrics, and opioid use&#xD;
      between skills-based VR therapy vs. distraction VR therapy; and (3) determine patient-level&#xD;
      predictors of VR treatment response in visceral cancer pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these aims, the study will measure PROs and opioid use in 360 patients randomized&#xD;
      among 3 groups and follow them for 60 days after enrollment: (1) an enhanced VR group&#xD;
      receiving skills-based VR; (2) a distraction-based VR group receiving patient-selected VR&#xD;
      videos; and (3) a VR sham control group using a VR headset with 2-D content. The results will&#xD;
      inform best practices for the implementation of VR for visceral cancer pain management and&#xD;
      guide selection of patient-tailored experiences.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      GI caner pain is a prevalent and costly condition. Medical therapy is not always effective&#xD;
      for managing GI cancer pain; there is a need for drug-free alternative to complement or even&#xD;
      replace medical therapy, such as opioids. This study will evaluate a novel technology called&#xD;
      virtual reality (VR). Users of VR wear a pair of goggles with a three-dimensional screen that&#xD;
      creates a sensation of being transported into lifelike worlds. Evidence shows that VR can&#xD;
      reduce pain through many different mechanisms. Research shows that VR can also help train&#xD;
      people in new skills, such as to meditate, breathe deeply, and learn how to cope with pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients with GI cancer pain will be randomized into three groups of equal&#xD;
      size: (1) immersive skills-based VR therapy; (2) immersive distraction VR therapy; and (3)&#xD;
      non-immersive sham VR using 2D videos displayed in a VR headset. The skills-based treatment&#xD;
      will use virtual healing environments to teach patients about meditation, breathing&#xD;
      exercises, and pain management. The distraction treatment will use immersive videos that are&#xD;
      designed to take the mind off of pain. The sham VR will use VR goggles, but patients will&#xD;
      only watch a two-dimensional video rather than a 3D, immersive experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will have GI cancer pain, meaning belly pain at least 5 points above the&#xD;
      nationally average on the NIH PROMIS GI Scale as well as having a GI cancer diagnosis. . The&#xD;
      study will exclude people who are under 13 years of age, unable to understand the consent&#xD;
      form, expected to live less than 3 months, brain tumors not responding to treatment, or&#xD;
      injury that makes it difficult to wear something on their face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization between groups will occur using a computer program called REDCap and will be&#xD;
      performed at the time of obtaining patient consent for participating in the study. The VR&#xD;
      goggles will be provided to patients in all three groups at the time of their doctor visit at&#xD;
      Cedars-Sinai, along with instructions for use. Patients will then be asked to actively use&#xD;
      the headset for four weeks on a daily basis, following the specific instructions for their&#xD;
      assigned intervention. In addition, patients will wear a Fitbit watch on their wrist during&#xD;
      the study, as tolerated, to monitor step counts and sleep. Finally, participants will fill&#xD;
      out a set of questionnaires once a week by computer, or by paper survey if they do not have&#xD;
      access to a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to show a difference between the active VR treatments and the sham VR control&#xD;
      treatment, the investigator will recruit a minimum of 120 patients in each arm of the study.&#xD;
      This calculation is sufficient to demonstrate clinically meaningful differences in the&#xD;
      primary outcome, which is Gastrointestinal belly pain levels as measured by the NIH Patient&#xD;
      Reported Outcome Measurement Information System, or PROMISÂ® questionnaire. PROMIS is a&#xD;
      well-validated set of questionnaires that measure different aspects of quality of life; for&#xD;
      this study the investigator will focus on PROMIS Gastrointestinal belly pain, Global physical&#xD;
      and mental health, and Social isolation. Daily pain catastrophizing, Milligram morphine&#xD;
      equivalent daily dose, Simulator sickness, Pain treatment satisfaction, Pain self-efficacy&#xD;
      (PSEQ), baseline demographic information, Pain Diary, and Pain Behaviors will also be&#xD;
      measured. The investigator will compare the number of steps taken per day and sleep levels&#xD;
      among the three groups using statistical tests that account for potential difference among&#xD;
      the groups. Finally, the investigator will perform statistical analyses to identify whether&#xD;
      there are individual patient characteristics that predict response to VR therapy. The goal&#xD;
      will be to develop a mathematical algorithm that optimized patient selection to make more&#xD;
      precise treatment decisions with VR.&#xD;
