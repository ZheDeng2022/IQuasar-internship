  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coccygodynia is a disabling pain in the coccyx exacerbated by sitting or rising from sitting.&#xD;
      The pain is often pulling or lancinating in quality, may radiate to the sacrum or buttock,&#xD;
      and may coexist with lower back pain. Contributing of many physiologic and psychological&#xD;
      factors to its etiology, it may be traumatic or idiopathic in origin. Many risk factors are&#xD;
      known such as trauma, female gender and obesity. Despite the identification of chronic&#xD;
      coccygeal pain hundreds of years ago, its treatment can be difficult and sometimes&#xD;
      controversial because of the multifactorial nature of coccygeal pain. Most cases of&#xD;
      coccygodynia resolve within weeks to months with or without conservative treatment, but for a&#xD;
      few patients, the pain can become chronic and debilitating. First-line treatment options&#xD;
      include analgesic drugs, cushion, sit baths, and manuel therapy. Interventional procedures&#xD;
      for pain management can be applied to patients who have no response to other conservative&#xD;
      modalities. Ganglion impar block and caudal epidural steroid injection are two treatment&#xD;
      options for chronic coccygodynia and both of them can be applied by guidance of fluoroscopy&#xD;
      and ultrasonography. Radiofrequency ablation is the other option for treatment and&#xD;
      eventually, surgical intervention can be done for patients who have refractory pain despite&#xD;
      other treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although efficacy of two interventional procedure for chronic coccygodynia, ganglion impar&#xD;
      block and caudal epidural steroid injection, has been well known, no study is exist comparing&#xD;
      the efficacy of them. We aimed to compare the efficacy of ganglion impar block and caudal&#xD;
      epidural steroid injection in chronic coccygodynia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this prospective study is the compare the efficacy of fluoroscopy-guided&#xD;
      ganglion impar block and caudal epidural steroid injection in patients with chronic&#xD;
      coccygodynia. Patients with chronic coccygeal pain are randomly divided into two groups based&#xD;
      on the type of the interventional procedure: Group A, fluoroscopy-guided ganglion impar block&#xD;
      group and, group B, fluoroscopy-guided caudal epidural steroid injection group. The patients&#xD;
      who have chronic coccygeal pain not responding to other conservative treatments will be&#xD;
      recruited from physical medicine&amp;rehabilitation and pain medicine outpatient clinics.&#xD;
      Detailed information including all aspects of interventional procedures will be given to&#xD;
      patients, and inform consent will be obtained. Pain severity will be assessed using Numerical&#xD;
      Rating Scale (NRS) as primary outcome. Quality of life and neuropathic pain component will be&#xD;
      evaluated with Short Form-12 (SF-12) Questionnaire and Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic&#xD;
      Symptoms&amp;Signs Pain Scale (LANSS) as secondary outcomes, respectively. All assessments will&#xD;
      be done at pre-interventional period, three weeks and three months after the procedure, with&#xD;
      the exception of NRS, it will be also assessed at first hour post-procedure. All assessments&#xD;
      will be done by clinician blinding the treatment groups.&#xD;

    <description>Fluoroscopy guidance is used for correct visualization of injection site, and so obtained more successful results. Patients are placed in the prone position. Injection site is cleaned thrice with povidone iodine %10 solution and covered with sterile drapes. Being most commonly used technic, transsacrococcygeal technique, a 22-gauge, 1.5-inch spinal needle is advanced through the sacrococcygeal disk and positioned carefully anterior to the sacrococcygeal junction. Injection of contrast results in a classical comma sign. A mixture of steroid and local anesthetic is given.</description>

    <description>Fluoroscopy guidance is used for correct visualization of injection site, and so obtained more successful results. Patients are placed in the prone position. Injection site is cleaned thrice with povidone iodine %10 solution and covered with sterile drapes. An 18-gauge epidural needle (Tuohy) is advanced at an angle of 45Â° to the skin until a 'give-way' sensation is felt and position of the needle is confirmed by lateral and anteroposterior fluoroscopic images. Then 5 ml of iohexol solution is injected through it to confirm the position. A properly placed needle would produce a classical 'inverted fern tree' appearance in anteroposterior view after dye injection or a 'filling defect'. The needle is introduced up to S3 level for proper spread of the drug. A mixture of steroid and local anesthetics is given.</description>
