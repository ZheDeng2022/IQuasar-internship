  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the most important metabolic disease that can affect almost every&#xD;
      organ system in the body. Although diabetes causes many macrovascular and microvascular&#xD;
      complications, one of the rare microvascular complications is peripheral neuropathy. One of&#xD;
      the common complementary and integrative applications in the management of diabetic&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy is foot massage. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      self-foot massage on peripheral neuropathic pain, peripheral skin temperature and patient&#xD;
      comfort in individuals with diabetes. Individuals participating in the study will be divided&#xD;
      into intervention and control groups. The individuals in the foot massage group will be given&#xD;
      foot massage training by the researcher. Later, people with diabetes will be enabled to&#xD;
      continue self-massage at home. To encourage the continuation of the intervention, the&#xD;
      researcher will be called once a week by phone and her questions will be answered. There will&#xD;
      be no additional application other than routine to the control group, data collection forms&#xD;
      will be applied and recorded at the beginning of the study and at the end of four weeks. In&#xD;
      the collection of data, &quot;Individual Description Form, Visuel Analog Scale- (VAS), DN4 Pain&#xD;
      Questionnaire and General Comfort Questionnaire- Short form&quot; will be used. In addition,&#xD;
      peripheral skin temperature will be measured with a skin thermometer.&#xD;
