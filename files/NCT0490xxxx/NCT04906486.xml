  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor, sleep-related disorder characterized by&#xD;
      urgency to move the legs during inactivity or resting state. Although the exact mechanism is&#xD;
      not clearly understood, sleep disturbances and dopamine deficiency may regarded as a&#xD;
      potential contributing factor for autonomic dysfunction. The objective of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate autonomic functions and determine possible associations between autonomic&#xD;
      dysfunction with clinical factors in patients with RLS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Restless legs syndrome (RLS) also known as Willis- Ekbom disease, is a common sensorimotor,&#xD;
      sleep-related disorder characterized by an unpleasant feeling with urgency to move the legs&#xD;
      (or less commonly the arms) during inactivity or resting state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, the clinical importance of autonomic involvement in patients with restless legs&#xD;
      syndrome (RLS) remains incompletely understood, sleep disturbances and dopamine deficiency&#xD;
      may regarded as a potential contributing factor for autonomic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous reports have described autonomic impairment including changes in nocturnal blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate variability (HRV), gastrointestinal, urinary and sexual dysfunction&#xD;
      in patients with RLS. Despite many studies about electrophysiological autonomic changes in&#xD;
      RLS, number of studies exploring autonomic functions by using Scales for Outcomes in&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease-Autonomic questionnaire (SCOPA-AUT) are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators plan to compare the presence of autonomic symptoms by using&#xD;
      Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease-Autonomic (SCOPA-AUT) questionnaire in drug- naive&#xD;
      RLS patients to healthy controls. In addition, the investigators aim to evaluate possible&#xD;
      associations between autonomic dysfunction with clinical factors in patients with RLS.&#xD;
