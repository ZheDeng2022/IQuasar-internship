  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will analyze the safety and efficacy of the heterologous vaccination with&#xD;
      Vaxzevria followed by Comirnaty. As a control individuals will be vaccinated with Comirnaty&#xD;
      or Vaxzevria twice. Each arm will involve 1000 individuals. Endpoints will be the level of&#xD;
      antibody and T cell response as well as frequency of vaccine failures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The immune escape variants are spreading worldwide. Local transmission of the B.1.351 is&#xD;
      observed in several European regions while P1 cases are mostly still travel associated. In&#xD;
      Austria, there is local transmission of the Czech variant B.1.258 in several regions, while&#xD;
      the P1 variant from Brazil plays no role yet. However, B.1.351 local transmission is observed&#xD;
      in Tyrol, where 20-30% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were caused by this immune escape variant in&#xD;
      January/February 2021, but then controlled but not eliminated by intensive testing. In March&#xD;
      and April the largest world-wide outbreak of B.1.1.7 + E484K, also an immune escape variant,&#xD;
      was observed in Tyrol. Although, some of the diagnosed cases seemed to be false positive for&#xD;
      the E484K mutation, still several hundred have currently already been confirmed, a number&#xD;
      that is internationally still unprecedented. It is expected that until the winter infection&#xD;
      season, that is likely to hit Europe after a phase of low-level infections in summer, the&#xD;
      immune escape variants will make up a substantial portion of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the&#xD;
      countries with high seroprevalence after the vaccine campaigns such as Austria. Therefore,&#xD;
      the vaccine programs must build up an effective immunity against the wild-type virus as well&#xD;
      as the immune escape variants. ChAdOx1-S contributes considerably to the arsenal of vaccines&#xD;
      purchased by the European Community. The investigators propose to test whether this vaccine&#xD;
      could still be used to build up a cross-protective immunity in the population, when combined&#xD;
      with a heterologous boost with the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2. Heterologous prime - boost vaccine&#xD;
      regimen including vector vaccines have been broadly used and are generally more effective&#xD;
      than homologous vector prime-boost regimen. If ChAdOx1-S followed by BNT162b2 builds up the&#xD;
      same or even higher level of cross-neutralizing antibodies as BNT162b2 prime-boost, which is&#xD;
      highly likely, the vector vaccine could potentially be included in the program for building a&#xD;
      substantial level of cross-immunity against the immune escape variants in the population.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study compares the level of cross-neutralizing antibodies induced by&#xD;
      classical BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1-S vaccinations with the heterologous prime and boost with&#xD;
      ChAdOx1-S followed by BNT162b2, respectively&#xD;
