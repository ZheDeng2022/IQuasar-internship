  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This exploratory, prospective, controlled, multisite, open label, randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      with two treatment arms aims to compare favipiravir, a new treatment candidate for Lassa&#xD;
      fever (LF), with the current standard of care, ribavirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints of this research are (1) the description of classical pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters of favipiravir in comparison with ribavirin standard treatment in patients&#xD;
      suffering from LF and (2) the safety and tolerability of both study drugs in the investigated&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The currently used antiviral for the treatment of LF, which is also recommended by the World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) and the Nigeria Center for Disease Control, is ribavirin. However,&#xD;
      evidence for ribavirin efficacy in LF patients adds up to the results of a single study with&#xD;
      serious limitations. A promising new treatment candidate that showed efficacy against LF in&#xD;
      preclinical studies is Favipiravir. It has further been evaluated for the treatment of Ebola&#xD;
      Virus disease during the West-African Ebola outbreak and is approved for treatment of&#xD;
      pandemic influenza virus infections in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at two study sites in Nigeria: the Irrua Specialist Teaching&#xD;
      Hospital (ISTH) and the Federal Medical Center of Owo (FMCO). Lassa fever patients of 18&#xD;
      years and older with LF confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)&#xD;
      hospitalized at either ISTH or FMCO will be asked to participate in this study. A total of 40&#xD;
      evaluable participants will be randomized to two treatment arms (20 participants per arm):&#xD;
      intravenous ribavirin standard of care treatment (Irrua regimen), oral favipiravir. Patients&#xD;
      will be included in the study after giving written informed consent and if all inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and no exclusion criteria are met. Multiple blood draws with the purpose of&#xD;
      virologic, serologic and immunological analyses, hematological and biochemical analyses as&#xD;
      well as pharmacokinetic analyses will be performed throughout the study duration of ten days.&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and pregnancy will be captured, monitored&#xD;
      and followed-up. A medical monitor will be available for study investigators to assist with&#xD;
      any clinical and safety related questions. An external data safety monitoring board (DSMB)&#xD;
      will conduct periodic safety reviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be captured on source documents and electronic case report forms (eCRFs). Informed&#xD;
      consent forms will be stored in a lockable cabinet. Participants data will only be linked to&#xD;
      the unique identifier to ensure pseudonymity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of study endpoints and pharmacokinetic parameters will be performed&#xD;
      descriptively. Missing data will be treated as such, no imputation will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki, the&#xD;
      International Conference on Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) guideline and the&#xD;
      Nigerian National Code for Health Research Ethics, in particular concerning the submission to&#xD;
      the ethics committees and the protection of personal data as well as other national and&#xD;
      regulatory requirements.&#xD;
