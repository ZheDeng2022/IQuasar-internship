  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effect of body changes in pregnancy on&#xD;
      doravirine concentrations, to determine what dose of doravirine should be used. Study&#xD;
      participants will remain on their normal antiretroviral medications (ARVs) while&#xD;
      participating in this study as prescribed by their regular clinic provider. Study&#xD;
      participants will come to the research clinic for three sampling visits throughout their time&#xD;
      as a participant. Study participants will only take one dose of doravirine during each&#xD;
      sampling visit, which will occur during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, as well as after their&#xD;
      baby is delivered. This study was designed intentionally to not give a dose of doravirine in&#xD;
      the first trimester when there is the greatest chance for all drugs to potentially cause&#xD;
      injury to the baby. Study participants that choose to participate in this study may be&#xD;
      enrolled for up to 10 months depending on the length of their pregnancy and how the visits&#xD;
      are scheduled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral (ARV) medications are used to treat infection with human immunodeficiency&#xD;
      virus (HIV). During pregnancy, ARV therapy keeps women healthy and decreases the spread of&#xD;
      HIV to their babies (&lt;1-2%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many changes occur in the body during pregnancy, which can alter the concentrations of drug&#xD;
      in the body. Doravirine (DOR) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ARV, but the&#xD;
      extent to which the drug concentrations of doravirine change during pregnancy is unknown.&#xD;
      Because these changes are unknown, DOR has not been approved by the FDA for use among&#xD;
      pregnant women; however, the FDA has given the researchers permission to use it in this study&#xD;
      Pregnant women are often excluded from clinical trials, so it can take several years after a&#xD;
      drug gets approved before contemporary ARV is available to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effect of body changes in pregnancy on&#xD;
      doravirine concentrations, to determine what dose of doravirine should be used. Study&#xD;
      participants will remain on their normal antiretroviral medications (ARVs) while&#xD;
      participating in this study as prescribed by their regular clinic provider. Study&#xD;
