  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain management is complex, with healthcare providers historically relying on&#xD;
      prescribing opioid medications such as morphine. Although opioids may partially improve pain,&#xD;
      there are risks associated with them as well, including pain worsening, side effects,&#xD;
      addiction and overdose. It is now understood that the management of chronic pain is more&#xD;
      effective when multiple healthcare team members work together and incorporate multiple&#xD;
      strategies instead of focusing solely on medications. An example of an effective, non-drug&#xD;
      strategy for pain is a service offered by clinical psychologists called &quot;Acceptance and&#xD;
      Commitment Therapy&quot; - or ACT - which empowers individuals, to implement alternative ways of&#xD;
      thinking about and reacting to pain and its effect on their lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canada has responded to the opioid overdose crisis with new guidelines that encourage&#xD;
      physicians and those suffering from chronic pain to aim for lower opioid doses whenever&#xD;
      possible, a process often referred to as &quot;tapering.&quot; Unsurprisingly, tapering opioids is&#xD;
      often difficult for patients to consider, primarily due to misconceptions that it will cause&#xD;
      more harm than good.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to address these misconceptions by developing and offering an all-day&#xD;
      educational workshop for patients, co-presented by a healthcare team (clinical psychologists,&#xD;
      pharmacists and physicians), to provide in-depth information on opioid related risks and&#xD;
      misconceptions, as well as a large component focusing on ACT training. Investigators then&#xD;
      want to see if these sessions change individual attitudes towards opioid tapering and if it&#xD;
      improves willingness and ability to successfully reduce opioid doses to a safer level.&#xD;

      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the impact of a patient-centered, multidisciplinary opioid tapering program&#xD;
           on overall opioid consumption in individuals with chronic pain on long-term opioid&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To implement opioid patient education workshops to be used in conjunction with the&#xD;
           opioid tapering program and evaluate their preliminary feasibility and overall patient&#xD;
           acceptance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As Canada continues to witness a growing opioid crisis, the role of non-opioid medications&#xD;
      and non-pharmacological strategies for pain, including behavioral treatments, is becoming&#xD;
      more apparent. There is a great need to develop multidisciplinary clinical programs to assist&#xD;
      individuals on long term opioid therapy to safely and effectively taper to safer doses of&#xD;
      these potentially harmful medications. The use of nonpharmacological modalities will be&#xD;
      integral to this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled in this project will be given the opportunity to take part in an&#xD;
      informed and targeted multidisciplinary opioid tapering program (MTP). As well, half of the&#xD;
      study population will be randomly assigned to also take part in a comprehensive opioid&#xD;
      education and chronic pain workshop (Patient Education Workshop; PEW).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abbreviated Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals on LTOT at recruitment sites will be informed about the project by a member of&#xD;
      their care team and those who show interest will be contacted and screened based on&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Those who meet these criteria and consent to participate will&#xD;
      be randomized to either the PEW + MTP cohort or the MTP only cohort. Depending on&#xD;
      randomization, patients will then be invited to first attend a PEW or to attend a care visit&#xD;
      to begin their tapering program. Participants completing the workshop will then begin the&#xD;
      same tapering program at the MTP only cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multidisciplinary Tapering Program: Participants who have completed the Informed Consent Form&#xD;
      (&quot;MTP + PEW&quot; and &quot;MTP only&quot; cohorts) will be included in the MTP, which will be conducted in&#xD;
      collaboration with the patient's referring physician. All referring physicians from&#xD;
      recruitment sites will be made aware of their role requirements in this study should their&#xD;
      patients continue on to the MTP phase. Tapering programs will be individualized for all&#xD;
      patients based on their current dose of opioid and clinical picture, and tapering planning&#xD;
      will be co-managed by Drs. Amadeo and Turcotte, with the implementation and monitoring&#xD;
      assistance of Pain Clinic nurses and Karin Ens (Clinical Pharmacist - ACCESS Winnipeg West).&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to complete a battery of self-report measures of pain&#xD;
      disability, pain, depression, anxiety, quality of life, pain acceptance, and valued living&#xD;
      prior to the initiation of their tapering program (Baseline Visit) and again at 3-, 6-, and&#xD;
      12-month follow-up periods. Follow up has been identified as a crucial component of the MTP&#xD;
      and will be managed by the clinical study team and clearly outlined in the detailed taper&#xD;
      plan provided to referring physicians. Tapering plans and approaches may be changed (slowed,&#xD;
      increased, halted etc.) based on results of this follow up at the discretion of study&#xD;
      clinicians. Any changes/updates discussed with participants will be communicated to the&#xD;
      referring physician with updated prescription or schedule changes. Like the tapering plan,&#xD;
      the follow-up will be flexible and will depend on the patient's response to reductions and&#xD;
      subsequent rate of taper. Follow up will include a combination of in-person and phone visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Education Workshops: PEWs will be held as a full day session (approximately 9:30am to&#xD;
      3:30pm) and offerings will alternate between weekday and Saturday options to ensure&#xD;
      flexibility for participants. Sessions will be offered monthly, or more often if the demand&#xD;
      exists. The PEWs have been developed through a highly collaborative and interprofessional&#xD;
      process and include some adaptations of previous work (used with permission) in order to&#xD;
      create a session that is multidisciplinary, patient-centred and applicable to various forms&#xD;
      of CNCP. The comprehensive workshops will include a combination of didactic and interactive&#xD;
      content on general pain and opioid education (1 hour workshop session to be co-presented by&#xD;
      Drs Ryan Amadeo and Dana Turcotte, and Karin Ens) along with significant psychological&#xD;
      content (co-presented by Drs Brigitte Sabourin and Gregg Tkachuk) making up the remainder of&#xD;
      the day-long workshop. Content presented in PEWs will include opioid-related risks,&#xD;
      identifying motivation for (or barriers to) tapering, goal setting, pain self-management,&#xD;
      sleep hygiene and comprehensive focus on ACT and rethinking pain. During the&#xD;
      interprofessionally co-facilitated sessions, participants will be provided with workbooks&#xD;
      that will contain session specific content as well as take-home activities and information&#xD;
      for their own use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Significance: The project will develop educational material aimed at furthering the&#xD;
      understanding of both appropriate and inappropriate opioid prescribing in CNCP. This material&#xD;
      will be available for consumption, beyond the project, with the knowledge users described.&#xD;
      This will be undertaken at academic conferences, as well as at administrative gatherings in&#xD;
      both academic and clinical settings. The knowledge created from this project, both in the&#xD;
      program undertaken as well as in the collection and analysis of the endpoints outline, will&#xD;
      allow for improved dialogue at all levels of health care. Both in the care of individual&#xD;
      patients and in the public health approach to LTOT and opioid weaning, there will be improved&#xD;
      understanding and process that will be accessible in broader primary care environments.&#xD;

    <description>The MTP will begin with a Baseline Tapering Visit and will include the same baseline health and well-being questionnaires, a medication review, relevant pain history, relevant opioid use history, discussion re: patient-specific tapering and functional goals, taper start date, and determination if a different opioid formulation will be required for the taper. A detailed taper plan will be prepared and reviewed by the study clinician(s) and provided to the patient. In general, tapers will begin with a 10% reduction of dose every 2 weeks until ⅓ of the original dose is met, or until taper goal has been met. If further tapering is planned once the patient reaches ⅓ of their original dose, the taper will be reduced to half the volume and rate noted above in order to improve tapering success.&#xD;
Tapering plans and approaches may be changed (slowed, increased, halted etc.) based on follow up.</description>
