  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present pilot study is to evaluate the association between change in gait&#xD;
      related mobility in ambulatory male and female adult hemiparetic patients before and&#xD;
      4-6-weeks after Xeomin® injection into the upper limb, using two standardized tests of&#xD;
      physical function in outpatient rehabilitation that are widely used; the 10-meter walk test&#xD;
      and the timed 'up and go' test (TUG).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this pilot study, the investigators hypothesize that there will be durational&#xD;
      improvements in gait related mobility on the instrumented TUG and 10-meter walk tests&#xD;
      4-6-weeks post upper extremity Xeomin® injection. Physical function will be quantified as&#xD;
      time to complete the instrumented TUG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one-group pretest-post-test experimental design will be used. Participants will be tested&#xD;
      on the primary and secondary outcome measures before upper extremity injection with Xeomin®&#xD;
      and 4 to 6 weeks thereafter. Additionally, participants will be contacted for an end of study&#xD;
      visit via telephone approximately 12-weeks post Xeomin® injection to obtain information&#xD;
      regarding any adverse events and gain insight into the therapeutic duration of the Xeomin®.&#xD;
      The proposed duration of the study is 2 years to allow adequate time for screening,&#xD;
      recruitment and follow-up.&#xD;

    <masking>None (Open Label)</masking>
    <masking_description>To assess if Xeomin® injection into the hemiparetic arm is associated with changes in hemiparetic elbow range of motion, a blinded investigator will visually observe the position of the injected arm during their 10-meter walk test, using video tape sequences of the pre- and post-test gait analysis sessions.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Instrumented Timed Up and Go test time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4-6 weeks after Xeomin injection</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects arise from a chair, walk at their normal speed, turn around right after passing the tape at the end of the pathway, return to the chair, turn around and sit down. Subjects will be fitted with a , single Attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) sensor fixed on the manubrium inferior to the interclavicular notch in a chest-mounted pack. The AHRS is a wireless-telemetry, 10-parameter unit which includes a tri-axial accelerometer, a tri-axial gyroscope, a tri-axial magnetometer and an onboard temperature sensor.</description>

For the pain intensity portion of the assessment, scores range from 0-40, higher scores represent increased pain intensity. For the pain interference portion of the scale, scores range from 0-70, higher scores represent increased pain interference.</description>
