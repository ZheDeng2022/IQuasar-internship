  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to provide insights in the coordination between trunk, shoulder and upper&#xD;
      limb while reaching. Two main phases are present in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase A: the psychometric properties of two tests: Clinical Scapular protocol (ClinScaP)&#xD;
      in PwMS (Persons with Multiple Sclerosis) and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the test-retest reliability of the Clinical Scapular Protocol (ClinScaP)&#xD;
           and the Reaching Performance Scale (RPS) in PwMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the discriminative of the ClinScaP between PwMS and healthy controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate the discriminative of the RPS between PwMS and healthy controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To investigate the concurrent validity of ClinScaP and RPS in PwMS, compared with upper&#xD;
           limb dysfunction measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In phase B:&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To investigate the prevalence of trunk, scapula and upper limb impairments in PwMS and&#xD;
           stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To investigate the interaction between trunk, scapula and upper limb impairments in PwMS&#xD;
           and stroke patients.&#xD;

    <description>The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale is a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment.[1] The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0</description>
