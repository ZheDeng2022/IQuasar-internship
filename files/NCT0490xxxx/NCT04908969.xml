  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tic disorders, including Tourette's Disorder (TD) and Chronic Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder&#xD;
      (CTD), are neurodevelopmental motor disorders characterised by motor and/or vocal tics.&#xD;
      TD/CTD are impairing conditions with onset during childhood that often persist into&#xD;
      adulthood. Behaviour therapy (BT) is an effective treatment for TD/CTD and is recommended as&#xD;
      a first-line intervention in both in children and in adults. However, most adults with TD/CTD&#xD;
      do not have access to BT due to a lack of trained professionals and geographical barriers.&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to adapt and extend existing face-to-face BT treatment&#xD;
      protocols for adults with TD/CTD to an internet-delivered format and evaluate its feasibility&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy. A total of 30 adult TD/CTD adult patients deemed eligible for the&#xD;
      study through the recruitment process involving both psychologist and physician assessment&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the project. The 8-modues treatment program, mainly based on exposure&#xD;
      with response prevention with addition of other techniques will be made available for the&#xD;
      participants in a secure treatment platform. The participants will keep in touch with a&#xD;
      therapist using two-ways written communication in the same platform. The therapist's role&#xD;
      will be to introduce the treatment and its modules, give feedback on the homework assignments&#xD;
      and open the new modules as well as monitor the participants psychiatric symptoms and&#xD;
      activity in the plattform. The measures will include tic severity secifically and disease&#xD;
      severity in general, anxiety and depression symptoms, quality of life, treatment credibility&#xD;
      and therapeutic alliance. The measures will be administrated at baseline, min- and&#xD;
      post-tretment, as well at 3 and 12 months follow-up. Upon completion, this project will be&#xD;
      the first crucial step towards the implementation of internet-delivered behaviour therapy&#xD;
      (I-BT) for adults with TD/CTD in regular health care.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      TS (Tourette Syndrome) is characterized by multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics&#xD;
      that have persisted for at least one year since initial onset, whereas in Chronic Motor or&#xD;
      Vocal Tic Disorder (CTD) either motor or vocal tics are present, but not both, during at&#xD;
      least one year (1). It is a childhood-onset disorder that affects more boys than girls (4:1&#xD;
      ratio) with a prevalence of about 1% in children (2), of which a substantial proportion&#xD;
      continue to experience impairing tics into adulthood (3,4,5). TS/CTD are associated with&#xD;
      reduced quality of life (6), lower educational attainment (7), and increased risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular and metabolic disorders (8). Notably, individuals with TD/CTD have a four-fold&#xD;
      increased risk of death by suicide and the risk is highest for those whose tics persist into&#xD;
      adulthood (9). Thus, effective interventions and appropriate follow-up are crucial to prevent&#xD;
      undesirable health consequences and societal costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence-based treatments for Tourette's Disorder and Chronic Tic Disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, the most common treatment for TS/CTD has been pharmacotherapy, specifically&#xD;
      antipsychotics. However, pharmacological treatments are modestly efficacious in reducing tics&#xD;
      and often have undesirable side effects such as tiredness or long-term metabolic problems&#xD;
      (10). Non-drug treatments for TS/CTD are therefore attractive alternatives. Behavioural&#xD;
      treatments acknowledge that tics have a biological origin but that their expression is&#xD;
      influenced by contextual variables: feelings, sensations, situations or other triggers that&#xD;
      occur before tics. CBT focuses on modifying environmental factors that influence tic severity&#xD;
      and teaches patients specific skills they can use to better manage their tics (11). CBT for&#xD;
      tics generally includes two main elements. First, the patient learns how to detect their tics&#xD;
      on a daily basis. Secondly, the patient learns how to resist the tics. CBT for TS/CTD has&#xD;
      shown to be effective against waiting list (12) and against an active control group (13-16),&#xD;
      with sustained results up to one year after treatment completion (17, 18). Expert guidelines&#xD;
      in Europe and elsewhere recommend CBT as the first-line treatment for TS/CTD (17, 18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preferred treatments are not available&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys among young people with tics and their parents indicate that cognitive behavioural&#xD;
      therapy is their preferred treatment option (19). However, this intervention is not widely&#xD;
      available for TS/CTD (20). Thus, despite patient preferences and the problematic side effects&#xD;
      of drugs, the vast majority of TS/CTD patients in Sweden receive only medication to treat&#xD;
      their tics. Members of our team conducted an epidemiological study looking at all patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with TS or CTD (n=6,979) in Sweden and found that over 75% of them received at&#xD;
      least one drug, and over 70% were on at least two types of drugs. Moreover, prescription of&#xD;
      anxiolytics, hypnotics/sedatives, ADHD drugs, and atypical antipsychotics increased over the&#xD;
      8-year study period (21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sum, expert therapists trained to treat TS/CTD with CBT in Sweden are lacking. Even in&#xD;
      Stockholm County, it is our clinical experience that many adult patients with TS/CTD have&#xD;
      trouble finding the appropriate expertise when seeking treatment in primary care, neurology,&#xD;
      or psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A remote cognitive behavioural intervention for adults with Tourette Syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been an increase in uptake of information and communication technology within&#xD;
      health care in recent years. One such innovation is to provide the treatment online instead&#xD;
      of face-to-face. In internet-delivered psychological treatments, the treatment is provided in&#xD;
      the form of self-help texts, homework assignments, and worksheets for the patient to fill in&#xD;
      online. An identified therapist provides support and guidance throughout treatment via a&#xD;
      built-in messaging system. Internet-delivered treatments is a burgeoning research field where&#xD;
      Sweden is at the forefront of international development (22). Internet-delivered treatments&#xD;
      have been developed and evaluated by our research team for many psychiatric conditions,&#xD;
      including disorders related to TS/CTD, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and body&#xD;
      dysmorphic disorder (BDD) (23-26). Internet-delivered treatments have consistently shown&#xD;
      comparable effects to traditional face-to-face therapies (27) while requiring less therapist&#xD;
      time per patient and being delivered remotely, thus being cost-effective for health care and&#xD;
      accessible to patients (28). Preliminary results suggest that videoconferencing (29) and&#xD;
      I-CBT (30) are feasible options for children with TS/CTD, but there are no such treatments&#xD;
      available to adults with TS/CTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an urgent need to disseminate evidence-based treatments for adults with TS and CTD.&#xD;
      Internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) for TD/CTD will be a feasible,&#xD;
      acceptable, and safe method to deliver evidence-based treatment for adults with TS/CTD. We&#xD;
      also hypothesize that I-CBT will show preliminary efficacy in reducing tic severity in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project will be to carry out a pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, safety, and efficacy of the internet-delivered treatment for TS/CTD. We also&#xD;
      aim to further refine the treatment based on feedback from participants and therapists&#xD;
      involved in the trial. Furthermore, information obtained from this feasibility trial will&#xD;
      allow us to investigate key design and methodological issues to inform the protocol of a&#xD;
      subsequent full scale randomised controlled trial. Specifically, the generated within&#xD;
      participant data will be critical to perform a power analysis for a more definitive trial&#xD;
      (see power analysis section).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design and outcomes will be registered online at ClinicalTrials.gov prior to&#xD;
      inclusion of the first participant. We will also upload the scripts used for statistical&#xD;
      analyses to an online repository (such as the Open Science Framework or Github).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility measures: Feasibility will be assessed according to the RE-AIM framework (reach,&#xD;
      effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) (33). Reach will be measured by looking&#xD;
      at the percentage eligible/excluded, reasons for refusal or exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy measures: Unless specified otherwise, all outcome measures will be administered at&#xD;
      baseline, post-treatment (primary end-point), 3-month follow-up, 6-month follow-up, and&#xD;
      12-month follow-up. Primary outcome measure: YGTSS TTSS. Secondary disorder-specific&#xD;
      outcomes: YGTSS Impairment scale, Adult Tic Questionnaire (weekly). Functioning and quality&#xD;
      of life measures: The Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) and Clinical Global&#xD;
      Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) Scales will be used to assess overall clinical severity and&#xD;
      consequent treatment response (scores of &quot;very much improved&quot; (1) or &quot;much improved&quot; (2) will&#xD;
      define treatment response according to previous trials in tic disorders (14, 16). In&#xD;
      addition, Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), EuroQol&#xD;
      5-dimensions (EQ-5D), Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome Quality of Life Scale (QTS-QoL) will be&#xD;
      used to evaluate functioning and quality of life. Depressive symptoms: MADRS-S will be&#xD;
      administered weekly to follow depressive symptoms during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with TS/CTD will be recruited through our clinic (OCD-programmet) as well as through&#xD;
      self-referral. Information about the study will be communicated to patient associations (such&#xD;
      as OCD-förbundet and Attention), health centers, psychiatric outpatient clinics, internal&#xD;
      referral systems (remissportal) as well as advertised in the media and in social media.&#xD;
      Self-referral will be made available through an internet website constructed for the study.&#xD;
      The website will contain information about the study, the research group, and contact&#xD;
      information. Screening: Self-referred participants will go through a telephone screening&#xD;
      containing information about the study and an assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      If the presumptive participant is deemed fit for inclusion, they will be scheduled for a&#xD;
      visit with a study clinician. Patients that are recruited through internal referral systems&#xD;
      will not go through the screening procedure but will be scheduled for a visit with a study&#xD;
      clinician. Assessment: Potential participants will be assessed face to face at our clinic in&#xD;
      Stockholm for eligibility to participate (see inclusion and exclusion criteria above) by a&#xD;
      study clinician. The assessment includes an assessment if the participant fulfil the&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria of a TS/CTD diagnosis based on a review of medical history and the DSM-5&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria. The YGTSS will be administered to establish symptom severity. A&#xD;
      semi-structured clinical psychiatric interview (the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Interview; MINI), as well as the SCID-1 section for OCD and related disorders (OCD, BDD,&#xD;
      tricho- and dermatillomania, hoarding disorder) will be administered in order to assess&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidities. This routine corresponds to the regular diagnostic assessment at&#xD;
      the clinic. Patients suitable for study participation will be given information about the&#xD;
      study and asked to sign a form giving their informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Participants will initiate treatment within a week and begin by filling in self-report&#xD;
      measures on the internet (listed under Efficacy measures, above). Patients who decline&#xD;
      participation in the study will be offered regular treatment at the clinic or, depending on&#xD;
      the individual's needs, be referred to other clinical services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: As described above, the treatment protocol will be adapted from existing&#xD;
      validated protocols for face-to-face treatment and remote delivery (12-16, 30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be provided through a secure internet platform designed for&#xD;
      internet-administered treatments (BASS-4). The platform has been studied extensively and is&#xD;
      currently a part of the Swedish public health care services. In the treatment, the patient&#xD;
      works through modules of self-help material, each ending in a short quiz with questions about&#xD;
      the material. The treatment is supported by a therapist through text-based communication via&#xD;
      the platform as well as occasional phone calls when needed. The central component in the&#xD;
      treatment is exposure and response prevention (ERP). In ERP, the patient exposes her/himself&#xD;
      to situations that trigger premonitory urges (a type of bodily sensation that precede the&#xD;
      tic) while practicing to resist the tic. By doing this systematically and repeatedly, the&#xD;
      patient gradually learns how to tolerate the premonitory urges and increase the ability to&#xD;
      control and resist doing tics. Beyond ERP the treatment consists of other components such as&#xD;
      applied relaxation, counter-movements and interventions to decrease stressors in the&#xD;
      patient's everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapist training, supervision, and quality control&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapists will be licensed clinical psychologists, psychologists in training or fifth-year&#xD;
      clinical psychology students under supervision. As all communication with the patients is&#xD;
      stored in the platform, continuous monitoring and supervision is possible and will be&#xD;
      provided by the study coordinator to ensure adherence. All assessors will be trained on the&#xD;
      use of the primary outcome measure, the YGTSS (32) using case examples, and inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability scores will be obtained. The study is approves by the Ethical Review Authority.&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and results will&#xD;
      be reported in accordance with the CONSORT statement for non-pharmacological trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given a standardized (Cohen's d) within-group effect size of 0.5 to 1 in previous research of&#xD;
      remote therapy for TS/CTD (30), we aim to recruit 30 participants in order to be able to&#xD;
      detect an effect size of d = 0.7, allowing for a 20% dropout (90% power, alpha 0.05). The&#xD;
      primary outcome analysis will also inform the power analyses of a future large-scale&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial via the variance of intercept, fixed effects, random effects, and&#xD;
      residual variance for the YGTSS in the mixed effects model. These estimates will help us&#xD;
      select the appropriate number of participants to make the results from the randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial informative and useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary and secondary outcome measures will be evaluated using mixed-effects linear&#xD;
      regression models with a fixed effect of time, as well as random intercept and random slope&#xD;
      specifications for each individual. Within-group effect sizes will be calculated using&#xD;
      Cohen's d by dividing the mean change between the time-points by the pooled standard&#xD;
      deviation of that measure at pre-treatment. To maximize replicability and transparency, all&#xD;
      statistical code will be published in public repositories.&#xD;

    <description>The YGTSS is made up of a semi-structured interview, followed by a questionnaire where individuals are asked to rate the severity of their Tic symptoms (both motor and vocal) in domains such as: number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference. There is also an impairment scale, where the individual rates how the Tic impacts on their daily life and activities. The Total Tic Severity Score has a range of 0-50, and the Global Severity Score has a range of 0- 100. A higher score on all scales suggests a more severe Tic, or a greater impact the Tic has on the person's life. Only the total tic severity core will be used as the primary outcome.</description>
