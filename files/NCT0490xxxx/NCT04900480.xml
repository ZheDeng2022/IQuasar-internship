      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of publicly subsidized physiotherapy&#xD;
      for all patients receiving general treatment in physiotherapy clinics with an official&#xD;
      provider number. This study will evaluate effects on physical and mental health, number of&#xD;
      consultations in physiotherapy; number of contacts with general practitioner; referrals to&#xD;
      diagnostic imaging; number of contacts with specialists within rheumatology, neurology and&#xD;
      orthopedics and patient satisfaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Denmark, patients in physiotherapy with a referral from their general practitioner (GP)&#xD;
      get 40% of their expenses paid by public subsidy. This study aims to test the effects of&#xD;
      direct access to physiotherapy with public subsidy without a referral from the GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GPs are by default the gatekeeper to all public health care services in Denmark. However,&#xD;
      increasing demand in terms of task complexity and patient volume is putting pressure on GPs.&#xD;
      In this study, physiotherapists may become the first point of access for patients with&#xD;
      musculoskeletal problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is, that direct access may decrease use of health services and increase&#xD;
      patient satisfaction by shortening the time between occurrence of symptoms and beginning&#xD;
      treatment in physiotherapy a) by eliminating the time needed to get a referral from the GP&#xD;
      and b) by making access to physiotherapy easier, thus encouraging patients to seek and begin&#xD;
      treatment earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of direct access to physiotherapy with public subsidy will be tested in a&#xD;
      controlled design. Four similar municipalities located in the Capital Region of Denmark were&#xD;
      selected to participate in the study. The four municipalities have been grouped in pairs to&#xD;
      ensure similarity on size, health utilization, urbanization and commuting patterns. Two&#xD;
      grouped municipalities have been assigned to the intervention group by lottery; the matching&#xD;
      pair of municipalities have been assigned to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From November 2020 to November 2021, citizens living in the two intervention municipalities&#xD;
      can get public subsidy for general physiotherapy without a GP referral. For all citizens in&#xD;
      the control group access to physiotherapy is provided as usual; thus, public subsidy&#xD;
      physiotherapy is only provided for patients with a GP referral. The study includes all&#xD;
      physiotherapy clinics in all four municipalities. All included clinics must have an official&#xD;
      provider number, i.e. be approved to offer services with public subsidy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with residence within one of the four municipalities who seeks general treatment&#xD;
      in included physiotherapy clinics within their own municipality will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Both patients with and without a GP referral will be included.&#xD;
      Participation involves giving consent to providing data for the evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data in the study consists of health care contacts accessed through the Capital Region of&#xD;
      Denmark's own price mechanism registers logging all transactions between relevant service&#xD;
      providers and the Capital Region of Denmark. In addition, all patients are asked to fill in a&#xD;
      survey before their 1st diagnostic consultation with a physiotherapist and a follow up survey&#xD;
      at six weeks and six months. Finally, the study will collect data through interviews with&#xD;
      general practitioners and physiotherapists as well as their respective receptionists.&#xD;
