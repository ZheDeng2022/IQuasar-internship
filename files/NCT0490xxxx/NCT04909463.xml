  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use the Duracore splinting device to measure lung capacities&#xD;
      of patients with rib fractures in control and experimental groups to determine if lung&#xD;
      capacities improve with the splint.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use the Duracore patient operated torso splinting device for&#xD;
      patients with chest trauma, including rib fractures, to improve deep breathing and help with&#xD;
      reduced hospital length of stays (LOS). The hypothesis of this study is that the use of the&#xD;
      Duracore splinting device will reduce hospital length of stays and improve patient lung&#xD;
      capacities over the course of admission following chest trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a randomized-experimental design and will be randomized via envelope&#xD;
      randomization, with experimenters being blinded. A total of 104 patients, 26 in each group,&#xD;
      will undergo initial incentive spirometry and forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced&#xD;
      expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) tests. Number of subjects to be used are 150 to account&#xD;
      for withdrawals, incomplete data sets, extraneous results, etc. Groups will consist of a&#xD;
      control versus experimental group, stratified into bilateral and unilateral rib fractures.&#xD;
      Three days' worth of data will be collected for each of the tests and will also be collected&#xD;
      24 hours prior to discharge. Length of stays will be compared for experimental and control&#xD;
      groups, as well as time to ambulation (collected from the first physical therapy assessment).&#xD;
      Injury severity score will also be collected to determine any correlation by severity of&#xD;
      injury. Patient satisfaction surveys for the device will also be collected to determine if&#xD;
      the patients feel a difference with the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little research as been conducted to determine the significance of a splinting device used in&#xD;
      patients with chest trauma, and it is still uncertain whether these devices improve overall&#xD;
      patient outcomes. Contradicting studies with similar experimental designs show either some&#xD;
      significance (p-value) or insignificance in pulmonary function pre- and post-treatment. This&#xD;
      gap in current knowledge leaves room for concern in whether the patient truly benefits from a&#xD;
      splinting device in this type of injury. Changes in FVC/FEV1 ratio in this patient population&#xD;
      are not readily demonstrated in most of these studies, as well as differing length of stays.&#xD;
      This study will contribute to this base of knowledge by determining the effects of the&#xD;
      Duracore splinting device on this patient population using the objectives.&#xD;
