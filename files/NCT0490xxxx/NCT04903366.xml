  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Topical timolol has been used primarily as eye drops to treat glaucoma for many years. Recent&#xD;
      clinical experience has broadened its off-label use for a number of skin conditions,&#xD;
      including slow-healing wounds. While there have been extensive safety studies performed on&#xD;
      timolol administration to treat the eye, to date, no studies have documented absorption of&#xD;
      timolol after applied on chronic wounds. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      blood levels of timolol in patients after topical administration to a chronic wound, and&#xD;
      compare these levels with those of patients after administration of the same drug formulation&#xD;
      on the eye for the indication of glaucoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers and pressure ulcers are&#xD;
      serious problems in our health system, with limited therapeutic options available to improve&#xD;
      healing. Our laboratory and animal work has suggested that timolol, a safe medication,&#xD;
      currently used as an eye drop for treatment of glaucoma, can heal these ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timolol, is a nonselective, beta1/beta2 adrenergic receptor antagonist, widely used for the&#xD;
      management of ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. Most recently, there have been many&#xD;
      case reports published that suggest that timolol can be used topically to aid in the healing&#xD;
      of chronic, recalcitrant ulcers and wounds; however, concern over the medication's systemic&#xD;
      effects needs to be further explored and elucidated. The systemic absorption of timolol eye&#xD;
      drops and the medications systemic side effects have been well established; however, this has&#xD;
      not before been examined in patients receiving topical timolol for chronic wounds. Now that&#xD;
      this beta blocker has promising evidence for a role in the topical management of chronic&#xD;
      wounds, the safety of this drug in topical use is of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of this study is in the exploration of the safety of timolol in the topical&#xD;
      treatment of chronic wounds. If the systemic absorption from topical application to chronic&#xD;
      wounds is found to be equivalent or less than that from ophthalmic drops, then a strong&#xD;
      argument can be made regarding the relative safety of Timolol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the safety profile of topical timolol application, blood levels will be&#xD;
      measured to determine the systemic absorption of timolol. To do this, we proposed an&#xD;
      observational cross-sectional comparative study with two groups of patients: one group&#xD;
      receiving topical timolol for chronic wounds and the other receiving ophthalmic timolol for&#xD;
      the management of glaucoma. Serum levels of timolol will be quantified using high performance&#xD;
      liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the levels between the two groups will be compared.&#xD;
