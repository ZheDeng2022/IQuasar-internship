  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates an investigational vaccine that is designed to protect humans against&#xD;
      infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and is administered as a nasal spray.&#xD;
      Specifically, the study analyzes the safety of, and the immune response to, the vaccine when&#xD;
      administered to healthy children between the ages of 6 and 24 months who are seronegative to&#xD;
      RSV.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The first 5 enrolled participants will be assigned to Dosage Group 1 and be randomly allocated to receive either investigational vaccine at Dosage 1 or placebo. The Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will subsequently review Dosage Group 1 safety data through Day 14, to allow dosage escalation. The next 10 enrolled participants will be assigned to Dosage Group 2 and be randomly allocated to receive either investigational vaccine at Dosage 2 or placebo. The SMC will subsequently review Dosage Group 2 safety data through Day 14, to allow dosage escalation. The final 30 enrolled participants will be assigned to Dosage Group 3 and be randomly allocated to receive investigational vaccine at Dosage 3 or placebo; of these 30, up to 15 participants, upon meeting prespecified criteria, will receive a second, identical dose of investigational vaccine or placebo 28 days after the initial dose.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Solicited adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-vaccination period</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of solicited AEs will be measured, categorized by severity. Solicited AEs are predefined AEs that may occur after investigational vaccine administration</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Unsolicited AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-vaccination period</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of unsolicited AEs will be measured, categorized by severity. Unsolicited AEs are any untoward medical occurrences in a participant administered the investigational vaccine, regardless of causal relationship to the investigational vaccine. Unsolicited AEs can include unfavorable and unintended signs (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptoms, or diseases temporally associated with the use of the investigational vaccine.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Serious adverse events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Full study duration, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of SAEs will be measured, categorized by vaccine-relatedness . SAEs are AEs, whether considered causally related to the investigational vaccine or not, that threaten life or result in any of the following: death, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Medically attended adverse events (MAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Full study duration, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of MAEs will be measured, categorized by vaccine-relatedness. MAEs are AEs, whether considered causally related to the investigational vaccine or not, with unscheduled medically attended visits, such as urgent care visits, acute primary care visits, emergency department visits, or other previously unplanned visits to a medical provider. Scheduled medical visits such as routine physicals, wellness checks, 'check-ups', and vaccinations, are not considered MAEs.</description>
