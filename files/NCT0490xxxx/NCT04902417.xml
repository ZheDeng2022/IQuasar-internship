  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether 6-weeks of increased dairy consumption can&#xD;
      reduce inflammation and other markers of chronic disease while fasted or following a high-fat&#xD;
      meal.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Following the acquisition of informed consent, eligibility to participate in the study will&#xD;
      be determined using questionnaires, and certain parameters determined from a finger-prick&#xD;
      blood sample. Eligible participants will be assigned to complete two 6-week dietary&#xD;
      interventions in random order, with at least a 4 week &quot;wash out&quot; period (i.e. their habitual&#xD;
      eating) in between. The two dietary interventions are: 1) Participants normal, low-dairy&#xD;
      diet; and 2) A higher dairy diet where 3 servings per day of dairy foods are provided. Prior&#xD;
      to beginning either 6-week diet intervention, participants will be asked to attend the&#xD;
      laboratory at York University after an overnight fast to undergo baseline testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following baseline testing, participants will meet with a registered dietitian (RD) to&#xD;
      discuss each diet arm. Specifically, if they are on the dairy diet, participants will receive&#xD;
      advice on how to incorporate these dairy foods into their diet by replacing other foods of&#xD;
      similar energy content so as to not increase their total energy intake and body weight. They&#xD;
      will meet with the RD at several other times throughout the study. During each 6-week diet&#xD;
      period, they will be asked to keep their physical activity levels constant and to not adopt&#xD;
      any other major dietary changes during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each 6-week intervention period, participants will be asked to return to York&#xD;
      University to repeat the initial set of tests performed at baseline. In addition to the&#xD;
      fasted tests, a number of tests will be performed after asking participants to consume a&#xD;
      high-fat test meal (i.e. a fast-food breakfast). Various measurements will continue to be&#xD;
      taken for around 6 hours after this meal is consumed.&#xD;
