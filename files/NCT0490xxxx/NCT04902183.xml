  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II randomized, single-blind dose study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      exosomes overexpressing CD24 of two doses, Dose 1 - 10^9 exosome particles (per dose) versus&#xD;
      Dose 2 - 10^10 exosome particles (per dose), to prevent clinical deterioration in patients&#xD;
      with Moderate or Severe COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will include patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 and laboratory&#xD;
      markers predictive of the cytokine storm, who have provided an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      90 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 109 exosome particles (45&#xD;
      patients) or 1010 exosome particles (45 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exosomes will be diluted in normal saline for inhalation via mouthpiece nebulization,&#xD;
      administered once daily (QD) for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatments will be given as an add-on to the standard of care. Following the 5 days of&#xD;
      treatment, patients will remain in follow-up for 23 additional days. In case of hospital&#xD;
      discharge before the full follow-up planned, the patient will be required to return to the&#xD;
      site for completion of all study assessments.&#xD;
