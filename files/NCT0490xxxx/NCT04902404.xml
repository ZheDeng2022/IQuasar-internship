  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children's brains develop quickly in the first three years of life and are particularly&#xD;
      sensitive to their environment. Adverse experiences, such as exposure to abuse and neglect,&#xD;
      can increase children's risk for behavioral, mental health (e.g., depression, anxiety), and&#xD;
      developmental struggles. Fortunately, supportive, nurturing parents can help protect children&#xD;
      from these poor health and developmental outcomes. In-person parenting programs have been&#xD;
      shown to improve parents' interactions with their children. However, many parents struggle to&#xD;
      access these programs due to competing life demands and accessibility barriers (e.g., lack of&#xD;
      transportation and childcare). The First Pathways Game is a free, online tool that was&#xD;
      created by an expert in brain development to provide parents with games and activities for&#xD;
      playtime with their child, based on their child's age. The investigators plan to study the&#xD;
      impact of the First Pathways Game on parent-child interactions and development of children&#xD;
      aged 3-36 months. The investigators will recruit families in Calgary that are experiencing&#xD;
      adversity, such as poverty and homelessness. Parent-child pairs will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      the (1) First Pathways group that is reminded to play the First Pathways Game daily for a&#xD;
      month or (2) wait-list control group, to allow for comparisons. Before, immediately after,&#xD;
      and 2 months after the month-long program, the investigators will collect information on&#xD;
      parent-child interactions and children's development with reliable and valid tools to examine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the First Pathways Game. This free, online tool has the potential to&#xD;
      empower parents in supporting their children's health and development and could be ideal for&#xD;
      families experiencing vulnerability, due to its accessibility. If found effective, this tool&#xD;
      could improve both short- and long-term health outcomes for children with experiences of&#xD;
      adversity.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale: Exposure to early adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), such as&#xD;
      abuse and neglect, increase children's risk for detrimental health (e.g., physical, mental,&#xD;
      behavioral) and developmental (e.g., milestones, academic) consequences. Since children's&#xD;
      brains develop rapidly within the first few years of life, they are remarkably sensitive to&#xD;
      ACEs, yet positive parent-child interactions can buffer the impacts of early adversities.&#xD;
      Although numerous, efficacious in-person parenting interventions are available, barriers&#xD;
      (e.g., transportation, childcare) limit accessibility. Recent research has shown that&#xD;
      families are interested in accessing parenting and child development information online, and&#xD;
      over 80% of low-income families have internet access and internet-enabled devices.&#xD;
      Furthermore, online interventions are of particular importance during the novel coronavirus&#xD;
      (COVID-19) pandemic when limited in-person resources are available. The First Pathways Game&#xD;
      (www.firstpathwaysgame.com) is a free online tool aimed at improving parent-child&#xD;
      interactions and children's development by providing parents with age-appropriate,&#xD;
      interactive activities. The First Pathways Game was developed by neuroscientist Dr. Judy&#xD;
      Cameron to promote parent-child interactions and children's development by sharing&#xD;
      neuroscience knowledge and age-appropriate game ideas for parents and children to play&#xD;
      together. A pilot study of 16 low-income families in Pittsburgh showed improved parent-child&#xD;
      interaction scores for children at the highest risk, offering evidence of promise as a&#xD;
      feasible intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The investigators will examine the effect of the First Pathways Game on&#xD;
      parent-child interactions and children's developmental milestones for disadvantaged (e.g.,&#xD;
      low-income) families with children aged 3-36 months in Calgary, Alberta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will conduct a multi-center, two-arm, parallel-group, superiority&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Parent-child pairs will be recruited&#xD;
      from Calgary agencies that provide services for families facing adversity, such as families&#xD;
      who have experienced domestic violence and low-income families. Data collection will be&#xD;
      facilitated by REDCap with integrated computer-aided block randomization. Both groups will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline, and one and two months later with observational and parent-reported&#xD;
      questionnaire measures. Participants will be randomized to the First Pathways group or&#xD;
      wait-list control group after the baseline data assessment is complete. Parents in the First&#xD;
      Pathways group will receive their choice of daily reminders (e.g., phone call, email, text&#xD;
      message) to access the First Pathways website daily for the first month and their game&#xD;
      utilization will be tracked by their device (phone, tablet, computer) for the two-month study&#xD;
      duration. Parent-child pairs in the wait-list control group will receive access to the First&#xD;
      Pathways website after the final two-month assessment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Parent-child interactions will be measured with the Parent-Child Interaction Teaching Scale at baseline and one and two months post randomization to assess change in parent-child interaction scores over time.</time_frame>
    <description>The observational Parent-Child Interaction Teaching Scale will be utilized to measure parent-child interaction quality. Parent-child interactions are assessed while parents teach their child a new skill, with 73 binary (yes, no) observational measures. The Parent-Child Interaction Teaching scale provides total scores for parent (i.e., sensitivity to cues, responsiveness to distress, social-emotional growth fostering, cognitive growth fostering) and child (i.e., clarity of cues, responsiveness to parent) behaviors. Parental scores range from 0-50, and child behaviors range from 0-23; high scores represent optimal parent-child interactions.</description>

    <time_frame>Parent-child interactions will be measured with the Simple Interactions tool at baseline and one and two months post randomization to assess change in parent-child interaction scores over time.</time_frame>
    <description>The Simple Interactions tool will be utilized as a second observational measure of parent-child interactions, and data from this research will inform the convergent validity between the Simple Interactions and Parent-Child Interaction Teaching Scale. Parent-child pairs are evaluated on three outcomes: (1) parent-child mutual social and emotional connection; (2) balanced back and forth interactions called reciprocity; and (3) parental willingness to offer appropriate challenges to their child to provide them with an opportunity to grow. Parent-child pairs can receive scores ranging from 100-500 for each outcome (i.e., connection, reciprocity, opportunity to grow), with a score of 500 indicating high optimal parent-child interactions. Additionally, an overall composite score is created by averaging the connection, reciprocity, and opportunity to grow scores.</description>

    <time_frame>The Ages and Stages Questionnaire Third edition will be administered at baseline and one and two months post randomization to determine if children's gross motor, fine motor, communication, personal-social, and problem-solving skills change over time.</time_frame>
    <description>The Ages and Stages Questionnaires Third Edition will be utilized to measure children's gross and fine motor, communication, personal-social, and problem-solving skills. This parent-reported screening tool is comprised of 21 questionnaires for children aged 1-66 months. Each developmental domain (i.e., communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem-solving, personal-social) is comprised of six questions and scores range from 0-60; children who score below an age-determined threshold for each developmental domain are considered to have a developmental concern.</description>

    <measure>Children's social-emotional development</measure>
    <time_frame>The Ages and Stages Questionnaire Social-Emotional Second Edition will be administered at baseline and one and two months post randomization to determine if children's social-emotional development changes over time.</time_frame>
    <description>The parent-reported Ages and Stages Questionnaire Social-Emotional Second edition will be utilized to measure children's social-emotional development; this tool is employed for children aged 1-72 months and is comprised of 9 questionnaires. Score ranges differ per age group as the number of items varies between questionnaires. For example, the 6-month questionnaire includes 23 items and the 18-month questionnaire includes 31 items. Per item, scores range from 0-15, with lower scores indicative of more optimal social-emotional development. Children who score above an age-specific cut-off are considered to have a social-emotional developmental concern.</description>
