    <textblock>
      Hirschsprung's Disease (HD) and anorectal malformations (ARM) are both paediatric diseases of&#xD;
      the colon and rectum. Both of these conditions require surgery in order to correct them,&#xD;
      frequently needing sections of the bowel to be removed. Some complications of removing parts&#xD;
      of the bowel include forming a stricture (a narrowing of the place where the bowel is&#xD;
      reattached), and leak from the join. These can be devastating complications, and can&#xD;
      significantly impact a patient's quality of life. Indocyanine green (ICG) is a medication&#xD;
      that binds to blood vessels and can be visualized using special cameras in the operating&#xD;
      room. Once it binds, it &quot;lights up&quot; green on this equipment. This lends the advantage of&#xD;
      being able to better see which parts of the bowel get good blood flow. The theory is that&#xD;
      good blood flow can reduce the risks of previously mentioned complications. This has been&#xD;
      shown to be true in a variety of bowel surgeries in adults. ICG has also been shown to be&#xD;
      safe in children. Given that HD and ARM are both relatively rare conditions (~1/5000 live&#xD;
      births), research in this area needs to be strategic. The investigators want to ensure that&#xD;
      the investigators can recruit enough patients to the study using this protocol such that if&#xD;
      this were to be scaled up to a multi-centre trial in the future, the investigators could&#xD;
      demonstrate feasibility. The investigators will collect data both on the feasibility of&#xD;
      recruitment as the primary outcome and secondary outcomes including stricture, leak, length&#xD;
      of stay in hospital, and return to hospital.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pediatric colorectal conditions, such as Hirschsprung's disease (HD) and anorectal&#xD;
      malformations (ARM), result in significant disease burden in pediatric populations in Canada.&#xD;
      Both conditions are present in approximately 1 in 5000 live births. Surgical correction of&#xD;
      these anomalies is typically performed in Children's Hospitals in Canada. Postoperative&#xD;
      complications, such as anal stricture and anal stenosis, have been reported to occur in 2-35%&#xD;
      and 2-10%, after posterior-sagittal anorectoplasty (PSARP) and laparoscopic-assisted pull&#xD;
      through for ARM and HD, respectively. In addition, anastomotic leaks and dehiscence are&#xD;
      life-threatening, and should be avoided at all costs. The literature estimates the rate of&#xD;
      anastamotic leak in HD to be approximately 2%, but have been reported in as high as 10% in&#xD;
      neonatal patients. Wound dehiscence post ARM repair has been estimated as high as 30-40%. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that the above post-operative complications occur due to compromised vascular&#xD;
      supply to the bowel undergoing coloanal anastomosis at the time of pull-through.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, surgeons evaluate bowel viability with tactile and visual means, including&#xD;
      discoloration, bleeding from the cut edge, and peristalsis after resection. With the push&#xD;
      towards minimally invasive surgeries over recent decades, the adoption of surgical technology&#xD;
      which can replace open or tactile assessments is necessary. One such example is the use of&#xD;
      indocyanine green (ICG) for assessing bowel perfusion in laparoscopic surgery. ICG is a&#xD;
      nontoxic, nonimmunogenic, water-soluble intravascular imagine agent. It has a short half-life&#xD;
      (approximately 3-5 minutes) and when injected intravenously, it binds to plasma proteins and&#xD;
      proteins in the lymph fluid keeping it in the intravascular compartment. ICG absorbs light in&#xD;
      the near-infrared region (806 nm) and emits fluorescent light at 830 nm. ICG was approved by&#xD;
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA, NDA 211580 505(b)(2) via fda.gov) for use in adults in&#xD;
      the late 1950s and has since been approved for use in adults by Health Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review article published in 2012 identified over 200 manuscripts describing safe and&#xD;
      reliable use of ICG in surgical procedures in adults. More specifically, qualitative analysis&#xD;
      of bowel perfusion enhanced by ICG in colorectal cancer patients has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      rates of anastomotic leak by approximately 4%. Practically speaking, the use of ICG&#xD;
      florescence technique can be useful in identifying clinical vascular anatomy in colorectal&#xD;
      surgery, both via open and laparoscopic approaches, allowing surgeons to better preserve&#xD;
      important structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that ICG is safe among pediatric populations, with utility&#xD;
      demonstrated in cases of difficult cholecystectomy, hydrocele repairs, and localizing&#xD;
      metastatic disease. As such, the FDA has approved the use of ICG in paediatric patients.&#xD;
      Research studies from the US, have examined the intravenous application of ICG for more than&#xD;
      60 years in adults and children with few reported adverse effects. However, Health Canada has&#xD;
      not reported on the safety and efficacy of ICG and does not authorize an indication for its&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there have only been two studies that have looked at intraoperative ICG to&#xD;
      visualize intestinal perfusion for primary pull-through in Hirschsprung Disease and anorectal&#xD;
      malformation repair patients and both were retrospective studies. A previous study included&#xD;
      eight patients, diagnosed with HD undergoing transanal, open or laparoscopically-assisted&#xD;
      pull-through procedures after biopsy confirmation of aganglionosis. Patients were given a&#xD;
      dose of 1.25mg (&lt;2 mg/kg) of ICG intraoperatively in the operating room. In five of the eight&#xD;
      patients, the level of the bowel transection was changed based on the ICG visualization. In&#xD;
      the other three patients, ICG confirmed the surgeon's assessment of where the resection&#xD;
      should occur. There were no intraoperative complications or complications noted at two-week,&#xD;
      one-month, and three-month follow-up visits. Further no leaks, incontinence, or strictures&#xD;
      were noted at any of these follow-up visits. Another study 16 included 13 patients in total,&#xD;
      nine undergoing cloacal reconstruction, four with HD and one with an ARM. ICG was used to&#xD;
      predict the vascular supply during the reconstruction procedure and patients were given an&#xD;
      intravenous dose of ICG between 0.1 to 0.3mg/kg in the operating room. There were no&#xD;
      intraoperative adverse events or side effects from the ICG. ICG changed the operative plan in&#xD;
      four out of 13 cases (31%), one of those four cases being a pull-through for HD. For this HD&#xD;
      case, ICG resulted in the detection of 10cm of non-viable colon which may not have previously&#xD;
      been detected. Although the level of evidence is limited by study design and small sample&#xD;
      sizes, these studies help to provide rationale for the continued study of ICG use in&#xD;
      paediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the results from these studies, future work is needed before he investigators can&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of ICG in reducing rates of post PSARP and pull-through&#xD;
      complications. Practically speaking, the main inhibitors to widespread adoption of ICG in&#xD;
      these surgeries is the cost of the technology, and lack of data to support that it truly&#xD;
      reduces the rates of complications associated with these surgeries. Our research team, looks&#xD;
      to be the first group to explore the feasibility of using ICG in a paediatric population with&#xD;
      Hirschsprung's Disease and anorectal malformations. The investigators hope that the results&#xD;
      from the study will help to initiate future multicenter, randomized controlled trials to&#xD;
      provide high level evidence to support the use of ICG in colorectal surgeries in paediatric&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
