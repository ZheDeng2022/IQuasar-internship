  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In general, central sleep apnea is not as common as obstructive sleep apnea but it is common&#xD;
      in patients with heart failure. It has been repeatedly shown that central sleep apnea worsens&#xD;
      the prognosis of heart failure. The current concept in the development of CSA is hypocapnia&#xD;
      which causes temporary cessation of respiratory neural output. Different methods for&#xD;
      supplement of CO2 have been used to eliminate CSA. However, variation of CO2 concentration&#xD;
      during overnight treatment and tight-fitting mask made the treatment uncomfortable. It is&#xD;
      important to develop a device with a comfortable mask to supply constant low dose CO2 without&#xD;
      breathing difficulty. We recently developed a device for treatment of CSA.&#xD;

      Objective: To determine whether the device could improve sleep quality while eliminating CSA&#xD;
      during the overnight study. Methods: Patients with central sleep apnea diagnosed by diaphragm&#xD;
      EMG will be recruited in this study. CO2 concentration for treatment would be manually&#xD;
      titrated during overnight PSG. Patients were then treated with an effective lowest&#xD;
      concentration of CO2 derived from titration under PSG on the third night. The sleep apnea&#xD;
      hypopnea index (AHI), central sleep apnea index (CHI), arousal index (ArI), Oxygen&#xD;
      desaturation index (ODI), sleep structure, blood pressure, heart rate, diaphragm EMG,&#xD;
      treatment side effects and treatment preference were to be observed.&#xD;
