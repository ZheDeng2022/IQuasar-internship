  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study proposes to determine how well tolerated and effective lower and upper&#xD;
      oral dental devices are at reducing snoring. The device is designed to move the genioglossus&#xD;
      muscle forward, with interior attachment to maintain forward placement of of he tongue on the&#xD;
      bottom of the mouth.&#xD;

      This study proposed to determine if the use of an oral device which causes forward&#xD;
      positioning of the tongue will decrease the intensity and frequency of snoring as measured by&#xD;
      the SnoreLab phone app, evaluate the level of snoring as measured by the bed partner,&#xD;
      evaluate tolerance and comfort of the device and evaluate the quality of sleep of the subject&#xD;
      by the bed partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will sleep at home using the SnoreLab app to record snoring for five nights and fill&#xD;
      out the Snore Outcomes Survey. They will then utilize the lower dental device for five nights&#xD;
      recording their snoring. At the end of the five nights of using the lower dental device, the&#xD;
      subjects will fill out the comfort and difficulties form with the bed partner completing the&#xD;
      Snore Outcomes Survey. If the lower device is tolerated, the process is repeated with the&#xD;
      upper device added to the lower device.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects in this single arm study serve as their own control by recording snoring on the SnoreLab device for five days and completing the Snore Outcomes survey. After five nights with now device, the lower dental device is used for five nights and snoring is recorded in the SnoreLab app. At the end of the five nights the subjects complete the Comfort and Difficulties Form and the bed partner completes the Snore Outcomes Survey. If the lower device was tolerated well, the process is repeated with the upper dental device used with the lower device.</description>

    <intervention_name>Delta Dental Oral Device</intervention_name>
    <description>The oral device is designed to move the genioglossus forward, with interior attachments to maintain the placement of the tongue on the floor of the mouth forward. In addition, bite plates made of the Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) plastic were fabricated and embedded with the mouthpiece to encourage subjects to bite down and push the tongue under the interior lower attachment. The upper plate is made of the same material and slightly opens the bite to improve oral air flow further. The primary component of the mouthpiece is fabricated with Vistamaxx material, which is semi-crystalline 2mm co-polymer that can be molded by the user with Nurse assistance to provide a custom fit.&#xD;
The subject will be fitted by moistening and heating in a microwave. Tthe research staff member will assist to ensure proper fit with both the lower and upper dental devices.&#xD;
The subject then completes the data collection portion regarding using the SnoreLab app and survey completion as previously described.</description>
