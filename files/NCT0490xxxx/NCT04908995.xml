  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to provide safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and food&#xD;
      effects data of a single 8 mg oral dose of EC5026 in healthy subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1a single dose study&#xD;
      fed-fasted study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and food effects of a&#xD;
      single 8 mg oral dose of EC5026 in healthy male and female subjects. EC5026 is an inhibitor&#xD;
      of the soluble Epoxide Hydrolase (sEH) enzyme developed as a first-in-class analgesic for the&#xD;
      treatment of pain. This study will help refine the dosing strategy for subsequent&#xD;
      multiple-dose studies in healthy subjects and for future clinical trials in patients with&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sEH is an enzyme that is downstream in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathway of the arachidonic&#xD;
      acid (AA) cascade. The sEH enzyme is responsible of metabolizing a class of epoxy-fatty acids&#xD;
      known as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which are potent, naturally occurring analgesics.&#xD;
      EETs are produced at high concentrations in areas of tissue damage and inflammation, but are&#xD;
      rapidly metabolized by the sEH enzyme into inactive compounds. Effective inhibition of sEH&#xD;
      activity prolongs the ability of EETs to exert their analgesic activity.&#xD;

             diastolic blood pressure 50-90 mm Hg) and heart rate (resting heart rate 45-90 beats&#xD;
             per minute) without medication. Blood pressure and heart rate may be repeated at the&#xD;
             discretion of the investigator. If the value continues to be out of range but not&#xD;

             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects must have a clinical chemistry profile, including electrolytes, alkaline&#xD;
             phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), creatinine,&#xD;
             and urea, within the normal range without medication at screening. Subjects who have&#xD;
             mildly out of range laboratory results that are not considered clinically significant&#xD;
             by the investigator can be included in the study.&#xD;

             contraception during the study period and for 2 months after clinic discharge or to&#xD;
             provide proof of postmenopausal state (minimum 1 year) or surgical sterility. Surgical&#xD;
             sterility will be defined as proof of female sterilization (via tubal ligation,&#xD;
             bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or hysterectomy) or male sterilization (vasectomy,&#xD;
             with laboratory proof of postvasectomy sterilization assessed at least 16 weeks&#xD;
             postprocedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Male subjects must not donate sperm during the study and for 12 months after receiving&#xD;
             the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Female subjects must be nonpregnant, nonlactating, and either postmenopausal for at&#xD;
             least 1 year, or surgically sterile for at least 3 months, or they must agree to use&#xD;
             double barrier contraception from 28 days and/or their last confirmed menstrual period&#xD;
             prior to study enrollment (whichever is longer) until 2 months after clinic discharge.&#xD;
             Double-barrier contraception may include, but is not limited to, nonhormonal&#xD;
             intrauterine device with spermicide, female condom with spermicide, diaphragm with&#xD;
             spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide; having a male sexual partner who agrees to&#xD;
             use a male condom with spermicide; or having a sterile sexual partner. Females on&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptives ( including hormonal intrauterine device or oral&#xD;
             contraceptives) will be excluded from the study. For all females of childbearing&#xD;
             potential, the pregnancy test result must be negative at screening and prestudy&#xD;
             baseline (Day -1).&#xD;

&#xD;
        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with any abnormalities in any of the following: liver function tests, CPK, or&#xD;
             urinalysis results. Liver function tests, CPK, or urinalysis tests may be repeated at&#xD;
