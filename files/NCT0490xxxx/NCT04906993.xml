    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, open-label, controlled, multi-center Phase III clinical study,&#xD;
      aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab combined with famitinib malate&#xD;
      versus platinum-based chemotherapy in the treatment of recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer.&#xD;
      All enrolled patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups and continuously treated until&#xD;
      any event that meets the criteria for end of the clinical trial.&#xD;
