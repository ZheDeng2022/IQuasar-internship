  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study. A total of&#xD;
      40 patients who develop distributive shock, intra-operatively or post-operatively within 48&#xD;
      hours of heart transplant or left ventricular assist device placement will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to Angiotensin II (Giapreza) vs. placebo plus standard of&#xD;
      care, as a first line agent for vasoplegia. Two groups of patients will be enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: Heart Transplant (10 control, 10 treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: LVAD implant (10 control, 10 treatment)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing implantation of a durable left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) or a&#xD;
      heart transplantation are at increased risk for cardiac vasoplegia. Vasoplegia, during or&#xD;
      following cardiac surgery, is a life-threatening condition that is characterized by poor&#xD;
      organ perfusion and may progress to multi-organ failure. The prognosis is especially poor for&#xD;
      patients with refractory hypotension, despite high doses of vasopressors. Existing data point&#xD;
      to total catecholamine dose, cumulative time spent with hypotension, volume overload, need&#xD;
      for blood transfusion as contributing factors. Catecholamine vasopressors and vasopressin,&#xD;
      which are often used as first line vasopressor therapy, are also independent risk factors for&#xD;
      end organ dysfunction. Data comparing mortality with the use of different classes of&#xD;
      vasopressors, in various types of shock, have been equivocal to date. In addition, data&#xD;
      comparing the use of different classes of vasopressors for vasoplegia during or after heart&#xD;
      transplantation and LVAD implantation are lacking. In patients with distributive shock in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit, angiotensin II has been shown to reduce total catecholamine dose over 24&#xD;
      hours and the cumulative time spent with hypotension. This study will evaluate, as the&#xD;
      primary endpoint, whether first line use of angiotensin II affects total catecholamine&#xD;
      vasopressor dose in the first 24 hours after vasoplegia is first. Secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      cumulative time spent with mean arterial pressure &lt; 70 mmHg within the first 24 hours after&#xD;
      distributive shock is first diagnosed, need for vasoplegia rescue therapies (methylene blue,&#xD;
      vitamin B12, Vitamin C, steroids), incidence of acute kidney injury and stroke, time to&#xD;
      extubation, incidence of new tachyarrhythmias, need for blood transfusion and fluid overload&#xD;
      within the first 24 hours, ICU and hospital length of stay, 30-day mortality and allograft&#xD;
      rejection (for heart transplant recipients).&#xD;
