  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the CROP study is to investigate the potential to cultivate psychological&#xD;
      resources and resilience in childhood cancer patients and their family members using a mobile&#xD;
      phone-based intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility study aims to evaluate the implementation and participant experience of the&#xD;
      digital intervention and register psychological outcome measures preliminary evidence for its&#xD;
      acceptability, feasibility, and potential beneficial effects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The feasibility study (CROP) will recruit 20 youths with newly diagnosed cancer (10-18 y) and&#xD;
      family members for participation in a 12-week digital intervention to cultivate psychological&#xD;
      resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will recruit an equal number of pediatric patients with other chronic&#xD;
      conditions to an observational comparison group to indicate the influences on participation&#xD;
      and outcome from the oncology care context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will obtain informed consent from all participants. Upon inclusion in the&#xD;
      study, participants will start getting a text message every day for 12 consecutive weeks. The&#xD;
      texts will contain links to a digital platform on which participants will complete an&#xD;
      exercise in either self-reflection or guided mindfulness meditation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychological training program is based on 12 modules with evidence-based treatments in&#xD;
      other medical contexts and age groups. The practices are based on acceptance, commitment,&#xD;
      re-appraisal, meaning and purpose, expressive writing, narrative processes, mindfulness,&#xD;
      compassion, equanimity, and gratitude. The combination of practices and the implementation in&#xD;
      pediatric oncology has not been studied earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cancer patients will be recruited during the first month after diagnosis, meet with an&#xD;
      instructor during 2-4 start-up meetings, and thereafter practice on their own or with&#xD;
      participating family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pediatric patients with chronic diseases will be recruited during a follow-up visit to an&#xD;
      out-patient clinic and meet with an instructor during 2-4 start-up meetings, and thereafter&#xD;
      practice on their own or together with participating family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will address the primary research question of the feasibility of the&#xD;
      intervention by investigating participant activity data, written evaluations of the&#xD;
      experience of participation, and through phone interviews of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research questions, such as preliminary data on changes in mental health and&#xD;
      psychological distress, will be investigated with self-report questionnaires.&#xD;
