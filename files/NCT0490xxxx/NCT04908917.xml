  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fine particulate matter &lt;2.5 μm (PM2.5) air pollution is the fifth leading risk factor for&#xD;
      global mortality. Mitigating the clinically significant blood pressure (BP) elevation from&#xD;
      air pollution by reducing PM2.5 exposure will likely contribute to the reduction in&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease-related mortality. Twin epidemics of air pollution and high BP&#xD;
      converge in underserved urban communities (i.e., Detroit) and warrant immediate attention.&#xD;
      Prior studies with short duration (a few days) showed indoor portable air cleaners (PACs) are&#xD;
      a novel approach to reduce the health burden of both high BP and PM2.5. Trials over several&#xD;
      weeks employing remote technologies with a large sample size of patients residing in their&#xD;
      own homes in vulnerable urban communities are needed to demonstrate if the BP-reduction from&#xD;
      PAC usage is sustainable in real-world settings. The investigators' specific aims are to 1)&#xD;
      determine if compared to sham, active PAC use during 3 weeks can provide sustained reductions&#xD;
      in home BP levels by reducing personal-level PM2.5 air pollution exposures in patients with&#xD;
      mild high BP residing in vulnerable disadvantaged communities across Detroit and 2) explore&#xD;
      clinical markers (e.g., age, sex, body mass index) that predict BP-responses to PAC&#xD;
      intervention to better target at-risk populations in larger-scale trials and future&#xD;
      real-world clinical settings. A randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled parallel limb trial&#xD;
      of overnight bedroom PAC use versus sham with 200 Detroit community individuals with mild&#xD;
      high BP will be conducted. Continuous bedroom PM2.5 levels and home BP will be measured&#xD;
      throughout 28 days. PAC will be used in the bedroom before bedtime on the 7th day&#xD;
      continuously for 21 days. The reduction of systolic BP (SBP) will be calculated for both the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups and the significance will be compared using mixed-effects&#xD;
      modeling with repeated measurements of SBP as the dependent variable and group (active vs&#xD;
      sham PAC use) as the independent variable with a fixed-effect. Linear multiple regression&#xD;
      modeling with SBP as the dependent variable and participant-level characteristics including&#xD;
      body mass index, waist circumference, race, ethnicity, or sex as predictors will be explored.&#xD;
      This study is expected to demonstrate a significant sustainable reduction in home SBP for&#xD;
      active PAC vs sham use in this population with mildly high BP.&#xD;

      1. Air pollution caused by fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter &lt;2.5 μm&#xD;
           (PM2.5) is the fifth leading risk factor for global mortality,1,2 predominantly due to&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease (CVD).3-5 While several mechanisms are responsible,4,6&#xD;
           PM2.5-induced elevations in blood pressure (BP) was identified as a key pathway.7-10&#xD;
           Short term (hours-days) PM2.5 exposures increase systolic BP (SBP) by 2-10 mmHg in a&#xD;
           dose-dependent manner while longer term exposures (months-to-years) promote the onset of&#xD;
           hypertension (HTN).7,11,12 Relevant mechanisms include systemic inflammation, autonomic&#xD;
           and vascular dysfunction, and activation of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system&#xD;
           (RAAS).4,5,7 Recent estimates of annual PM2.5 mortality are 8.9 million globally, due in&#xD;
           part to PM2.5-mediated HTN.1,13 Exposure to current levels of ambient PM2.5 in the U.S.&#xD;
           is associated with elevated BP, increased CVD risk and an estimated 213,000 deaths&#xD;
           annually.1 Given the billions of people impacted, PM2.5 is an independent (modifiable)&#xD;
           HTN risk factor of global public health importance. Therefore, mitigating the clinically&#xD;
           significant BP elevation from air pollution by reducing PM2.5 exposure will likely&#xD;
           contribute to the reduction in CVD-related mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HTN is the leading risk factor for global morbidity and mortality and a major cause of&#xD;
           health disparities. Nearly 50% of US adults meet criteria (≥130/80 mm Hg) for HTN.14&#xD;
           Serious disparities persist such that underserved communities, including Detroit, have&#xD;
           the highest prevalence of HTN and the poorest treatment success. Mounting evidence&#xD;
           indicates that PM2.5 contributes to this epidemic of HTN,7-11 and that individuals in&#xD;
           disadvantaged urban environments (e.g., Detroit) face higher concentrations of air&#xD;
           pollutants.15-17 Low socioeconomic status communities are especially &quot;vulnerable&quot; (i.e.,&#xD;
           highly exposed) and &quot;susceptible&quot; (i.e., higher risk for adverse health effects) to air&#xD;
           pollution.15,17,18 In Detroit, CV mortality has been shown to be jointly impacted by&#xD;
           high PM2.5 levels and vulnerability to exposures in communities of color and lower&#xD;
           socioeconomic status. The investigators' studies have shown that air pollutants in the&#xD;
           city of Detroit are responsible for increasing BP. Hence, addressing the co-epidemics of&#xD;
           PM2.5 exposure and cardiometabolic illnesses is not only an issue of public health&#xD;
           importance but also of environmental justice for urban settings such as Detroit. Thus,&#xD;
           the twin epidemics of air pollution and HTN converge in underserved urban communities&#xD;
           (i.e., Detroit) and warrant immediate attention. The novel recruitment strategy using&#xD;
           the Wayne State University (WSU) mobile health units (MHUs) directly reaches out to&#xD;
           disadvantaged communities across Detroit so those disproportionally affected by PM2.5&#xD;
           and high BP can be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Indoor portable air cleaners (PACs) are a novel approach to reduce the health burden of&#xD;
           both HTN and PM2.5. In a meta-analysis of 10 PAC trials (n=604), it was shown that a&#xD;
           ≈30-60% reduction in PM2.5 lowered SBP by ≈4 mm Hg over ≈13 days.19 In the&#xD;
           investigators' trial of 40 nonsmokers living in urban senior housing,20 PACs lowered&#xD;
           personal PM2.5 by ≈40% and morning SBP by 3.2 mmHg over 3 days, with greater reductions&#xD;
           (≈8 mm Hg) in obese individuals. Emerging evidence shows that obesity and underlying&#xD;
           cardiometabolic abnormalities play a mechanistic role in PM2.5-induced BP elevations and&#xD;
           may underlie their susceptibility to PM2.5 and heightened BP-lowering responsiveness to&#xD;
           PACs. This supports that populations commonly suffering from obesity, including African&#xD;
           American hypertensives, may gain especially potent benefits from PACs. Trials over&#xD;
           several weeks employing remote technologies with a large sample size of patients&#xD;
           residing in their own homes in vulnerable urban communities are needed to demonstrate if&#xD;
           the BP-reduction from PAC usage is sustainable in real-world settings. These are the&#xD;
           features and innovations of the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies in air pollution exposure intervention all have used physical contact methods&#xD;
      with participants to assess exposure and measure BP. However, such direct contact and home&#xD;
      visit methods to collect data during this COVID-19 pandemic becomes a challenge and unsafe&#xD;
      for both investigators and study participants. Additionally, it costs more manpower and&#xD;
      resources. Modern monitoring techniques, equipment and communication technologies provide&#xD;
      data collection using a &quot;low touch&quot; method of remote monitoring of PM-reduction and home BP&#xD;
      (HBP) lowering which is important in COVID era as well as to reduce patient burden and reduce&#xD;
      patient follow-up. This will lend itself to be potentially greatly upscaled if patients can&#xD;
      do all endpoints via remote technology. This study will be the first to test this technology&#xD;
      as it applies to epidemiologic studies. This has never been tested before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, studies in past used mixed populations with different BP levels and disease&#xD;
      status. It is not known if reducing BP by reducing PM2.5 exposure using PACs also will work&#xD;
      on people with mild HTN. In this study, the investigators' will focus specifically on people&#xD;
      with mild HTN -the patients who actually need BP-lowering intervention for early treatment.&#xD;
      This has not been looked at in this mild HTN population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will serve as a pivotal trial to demonstrate that PACs are: 1) an effective method&#xD;
      to lower PM2.5 exposure and SBP; and 2) a novel intervention to treat mild high BP and&#xD;
      potentially reduce the cardiovascular effects of PM2.5. 3) The investigators' aim to show&#xD;
      that novel low-touch remote methods are acceptable and reliable for assessing the benefits of&#xD;
      air pollution interventions and that they could be expanded to thousand participants and&#xD;
      benefit large number of vulnerable community members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study has several key innovations and contributions. This will be the first PAC&#xD;
      trial to: 1) Persist longer than a few days in intervention duration, allowing us to&#xD;
      determine if BP reduction with PAC use is sustainable over a clinically relevant duration of&#xD;
      21 days of active use. 2) This trial is ≈ 5-fold larger than the earlier trial in Detroit in&#xD;
      order to provide the most definitive evidence (&quot;pivotal trial&quot;) and allow for testing of&#xD;
      effect modifiers (e.g., obesity) in medium-risk populations with mild high BP most likely to&#xD;
      benefit from a novel BP lowering intervention. 3) Leverage existing WSU MHUs to address&#xD;
      environmental inequities for urban patients with high BP. 4) Employ mobile technologies and&#xD;
      remote monitoring to capture home BP and PM2.5 levels via &quot;low-touch&quot; methods in a real-world&#xD;
      community setting in patients vulnerable to the health effects of high BP and PM2.5&#xD;
      exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that 1) PAC use will reduce indoor exposure to PM2.5 which will&#xD;
      subsequently reduce SBP. 2) This reduction in home BP will be sustainable over several weeks&#xD;
      in people with mildly high BP. 3) The study can be conducted via &quot;low touch&quot; remote&#xD;
      technology (using home BP and PM monitors). 4) This remote technology will be employable and&#xD;
      acceptable to vulnerable members of disadvantaged communities across Detroit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: To determine if compared to sham, active PAC use during clinically relevant&#xD;
      periods can provide sustained reductions in HBP levels (over 21 days) by reducing&#xD;
      personal-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution exposures in patients with&#xD;
      mildly high BP residing in vulnerable disadvantaged communities across Detroit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: To explore clinical biomarkers (age, sex, body mass index) that predict the&#xD;
      BP-lowering response to PAC intervention to target at-risk populations in larger-scale&#xD;
      interventions and future real-world clinical settings and future real-world clinical&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
