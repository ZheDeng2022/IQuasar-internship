      This is a Phase 2 multicenter (United States and Mexico) study to assess the safety and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of COVI-MSC in the setting of current standard of care in hospitalized&#xD;
      subjects with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection and acute respiratory stress&#xD;
      (ARD) / acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 COVI-MSC to placebo. COVI-MSC or placebo will be administered&#xD;
      intravenously on Day 0, Day 2, and Day 4.&#xD;
