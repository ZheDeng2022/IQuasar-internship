      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric patients are exposed to procedures that can result in pain and anxiety. The&#xD;
      International Association Study of Pain 2011 defines pain as an unpleasant sensory and&#xD;
      emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage. Pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions have been used but consequences of this therapy, specifically opioids, are of&#xD;
      concern. Distraction techniques have been implemented recently but there is a significant&#xD;
      range of these techniques such as breathing, music, and play therapy, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies indicate child preferences and temperament can optimize outcomes in regards to&#xD;
      therapy. Non-pharmacological analgesics have been shown to benefit patients overall. Watching&#xD;
      videos, biofeedback, mental imagery, and hypnosis have all been reported to have analgesic&#xD;
      effects in the literature. Additionally cognitive behavioral strategies particularly&#xD;
      distraction have been shown to reduce pain reports as high as 85% of patients. The most&#xD;
      recent emerging technique is virtual reality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality creates the illusion that user is immersed in another environment. A three&#xD;
      dimensional world is seen through the eyepieces, and the user can interact with the world in&#xD;
      several ways: by moving their head and neck to look around the environment and a hand held&#xD;
      trigger allows you to shoot at objects within the environment. Because this is a more&#xD;
      interactive environment and more attention capturing than simple distractions, VR is thought&#xD;
      to be more beneficial than basic distraction techniques. Additionally, using a head-mounted&#xD;
      display (HMD) prevents visual perception of the real world, decreasing the chance of&#xD;
      distraction. Previous uses of distraction show that children only pay attention to the&#xD;
      distraction for 2/3 of the procedure, but virtual reality prevents the distraction of the&#xD;
      procedure's visual stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will attempt to determine the benefit of using virtual&#xD;
      reality distraction techniques with a head-mounted display in standard orthopedic&#xD;
      consultations that involve pain. The literature review indicates that excepting burns, this&#xD;
      study has not been performed previously. Additionally heart rate monitoring has not been&#xD;
      previously been included in the analysis of pain reduction. The investigators will assess&#xD;
      pain reduction using patient feedback and pain scales, but also heart rate monitoring&#xD;
      pre-procedure, during procedure, and post-procedure. In this study, the only procedure will&#xD;
      be cast removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prospectively determine if pediatric patients undergoing orthopedic procedures can benefit&#xD;
      from employing virtual reality for pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify any benefits from virtual reality use as pain management in the pediatric&#xD;
      population by means of patient feedback and by heart rate monitoring during orthopedic care.&#xD;
      By doing this we can determine if virtual reality should become a standard of care in pain&#xD;
      management for the pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE AND SIGNIFICANCE Post-surgical pain has been reported to be difficult to manage and&#xD;
      can potentially limit outcomes in the pediatric population. Pharmacologic management is not&#xD;
      ideal and intolerable for some patients. In 2009, a study of 182 children in the burns and&#xD;
      orthopedic department at Royal Children's Hospital, Brisbane, Australia, found that&#xD;
      multimodal distraction devices (MMD) reduced pain and anxiety significantly as well as&#xD;
      reduced future procedural pain. Multimodal devices are interactive devices that prepare the&#xD;
      child for a procedure and uses developmentally appropriate distraction stories and games to&#xD;
      alleviate the pain. Virtual reality provides an alternative method with high rewards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a case study of post-surgical twice-daily physiotherapy regimen, using a subjective pain&#xD;
      scale, it was found to reduce pain by 41.2% compared to the control patients. Studies looking&#xD;
      at IV placement with VR in children suggest satisfaction for children, parents, and nurses.&#xD;
      That study suggested analyzing affective pain, anxiety, overall satisfaction, and pain&#xD;
      intensity. A literature review from 2008-2013 also found that distraction techniques would be&#xD;
      a simple and efficient non-pharmacological acute pain relief strategy and should be&#xD;
      implemented in pediatric care settings. It suggested further exploring the use of virtual&#xD;
      reality, which was emerging at the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality distraction has also been used in chemotherapy, during burn wound care,&#xD;
      intravenous port access in pediatric patients, to reduce pain and anxiety for invasive&#xD;
      medical procedures, to help adolescents with cerebral palsy endure physiotherapy, and to&#xD;
      reduce preoperative anxiety. Another study of VR during routine blood draw, found that VR was&#xD;
      more effective than the standard of care for reducing pain and anxiety. They determined VR&#xD;
      has the capacity to act as a preventive intervention transforming the blood draw experience&#xD;
      into a potentially pain-free routine medical procedure particularly for patients with high&#xD;
      anxiety. VR has the potential to both reduce outcomes for children but also reduce distress&#xD;
      in their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uncontrolled pain is thought to have serious psychological and physiological consequences,&#xD;
      including an increased risk of morbidity and even mortality in children. Recent estimates&#xD;
      have shown that around 27% of children experience moderate to severe pain in the hospital;&#xD;
      teenagers and infants experience higher amounts of 38% and 32% respectively. Pediatric&#xD;
      patients with untreated pain are more susceptible to developing sensitization, hyperalgesia,&#xD;
      chronic pain, and allodynia. Long-term effects can include alterations in circuitry that&#xD;
      impact pain processing in the future which predispose to decreased sensitivity or&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to painful stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS/PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who present to have a cast removed, percutaneous bone pin removed, or cast applied&#xD;
      will undergo heart rate monitoring via a pulse oximeter and give feedback post-procedure.&#xD;
      Patients will be selected if they are between the ages of 5 and 18 years of age, have no&#xD;
      significant co-morbidities, and are not undergoing an emergent procedure. Approximately 100&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in the study, with 50 participants in each of two groups. The two&#xD;
      groups will be the intervention group- those with the VR headset, and a control group- those&#xD;
      without a VR headset. The groups will be randomized, and demographic data including age and&#xD;
      sex will be obtained. Patients who qualify for the study will be consented by a member of the&#xD;
      study team during the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups will be randomized via GraphPad software through&#xD;
      https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize2/. The website will randomly assign 50 subjects&#xD;
      each to two groups, for a total of 100 subjects. The results will be copied into a secure&#xD;
      computer database to keep track of the assigned groups. Patients will be assigned a study&#xD;
      number from 001 through 100, according to the chronological order in which they are&#xD;
      consented. From there, the investigators will match up the patient's study number with the&#xD;
      results from GraphPad and determine the patient's group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be located at the Ochsner Medical Center, New Orleans, Louisiana.&#xD;
      There will be no charges to the patient and no reduction of patient care. If the patient&#xD;
      requires admission for management of their pain, they will be admitted to the inpatient unit&#xD;
      and followed by the team. Patients will undergo heart rate monitoring before, during, and&#xD;
      after the cast removal procedure. All patient data collected will be de-identified and stored&#xD;
      on a secured database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will analyze our data with T-tests with 2-tailed and 2-sample unequal variance as the&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve patients in the pediatric orthopedic setting at Ochsner Medical&#xD;
      Center in New Orleans, Louisiana. This will be a prospective consecutive case series to&#xD;
      evaluate the severity and reduction of pain in the pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of study groups will be performed prior to any patient enrollment. There will&#xD;
      be two study groups with approximately 50 subjects in each group. Participants in group 'A'&#xD;
      will be fitted with the VR headset during their procedure. Participants in group 'B' will not&#xD;
      be fitted with the VR headset and they will act as the control group. Prior to enrollment in&#xD;
      this study, all patients will be properly informed and consented about the requirements,&#xD;
      risks, benefits, and other relevant information of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will experience the standard of care and any abnormalities or distress will be&#xD;
      addressed. If the patients require admission for pain management, they will be admitted to&#xD;
      Ochsner Medical Center. Patients will continue to be monitored for the utmost patient care.&#xD;
      The anticipated number of participants in the study is about 100 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All factors between the groups will be kept as similar as possible with any changes being&#xD;
      formally documented. Patients will be given follow-up instructions that are consistent with&#xD;
      the standard of care for cast removal. It is our goal to determine if virtual reality should&#xD;
      become a standard of care in the pediatric population in regard to orthopedic procedures.&#xD;
