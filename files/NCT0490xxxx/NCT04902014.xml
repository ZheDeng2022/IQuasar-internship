  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, physical activity (PA) engagement levels&#xD;
      declined worldwide. Despite the overwhelming adoption of wearable fitness tracker (WFT)&#xD;
      devices, it continues to be unclear as to their effect on PA engagement or PA motivation.&#xD;
      Building on past research, we hypothesized that combining a WFT with a known impactful&#xD;
      intervention, motivational interviewing (MI) would positively influence both&#xD;
      self-determination theory (SDT) motivation and PA during an unprecedented global emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A four-group randomized controlled study was conducted amongst 40 inactive adults over a&#xD;
      12-week period during the COVID-19 pandemic. One group (WFT, n = 10) received a wearable&#xD;
      fitness tracker, a second (MI, n=10) received bi-weekly MI sessions, a third (WFT+, n=10)&#xD;
      received both, and a fourth (Education, n=10) received basic PA education. Outcome measures&#xD;
      for motivation and PA were measured though an online survey before and after the 12-week&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the WFT+ and MI group saw improvements in autonomous forms of motivation and decreases&#xD;
      in controlled forms. No changes were detected in the WFT group. No between-group differences&#xD;
      were detected post-intervention. No within-group changes were detected for PA, nor were there&#xD;
      between-group differences post-intervention. Across all conditions, the lowest baseline PA&#xD;
      levels predicted greater PA improvements. A significant interaction effect of baseline&#xD;
      motivation and group was revealed for the WFT and WFT+ group. High autonomous motivation at&#xD;
      baseline predicted high steps per day in the WFT+ group but not in the WFT group. Low&#xD;
      autonomous motivation at baseline predicted high steps per day post-intervention for the WFT&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study suggests that MI alone or with a WFT can impact autonomous forms of motivation for&#xD;
      PA, but not PA behavior itself. A WFT alone may undermine autonomous motivation for PA, but a&#xD;
      WFT combined with MI may reinforce it. Further, a WFT alone may positively impact PA, but&#xD;
      only in people with low autonomous motivation.&#xD;

    <description>The individuals will be scheduled for and participate in six biweekly in person SDT based MI sessions. These sessions will take place in the HPCRL at CSU. The MI sessions will be conducted by a PhD student who has been trained by a MI practitioner. Participants will be provided a log book and will be asked to log their PA, with the goal of completing at least 150 minutes of PA per week. They will set biweekly PA goals, which will be discussed in the MI sessions. These participants will also receive general physical activity guidelines education and information on strategies to reach the recommended amount of activity per week during the initial baseline assessment meeting.</description>

    <description>Individuals assigned to this experimental condition will be given a wrist-worn WFT and will be instructed to wear it for the duration of the study. They will also download the corresponding mobile application on their smartphones. They will be trained by a member of our team on how to utilize the WFT and mobile application. The intended WFT tracks daily steps, miles traveled, kcals expended, and daily activity time. This device provides these data to the wearer via a small screen. Participants will be instructed to aim to complete at least 150 minutes of PA per week. Researchers will have the capability to track participant daily PA via the WFT and associated API. These individuals will be asked to set biweekly PA goals. These participants will also receive general physical activity guidelines education and information on strategies to reach the recommended amount of activity per week during the initial baseline assessment meeting.</description>
