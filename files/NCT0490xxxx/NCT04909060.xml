    <textblock>
      An investigation to find out if Newborn Infant Parasympathetic Evaluation (NIPE) index&#xD;
      predicts postsurgical pain in children, since NIPE is thought to may be of guide to the&#xD;
      appropriate therapy in a timely and objective manner, thereby improving patient safety,&#xD;
      parental satisfaction, and reducing healthcare costs. We think that, validating the utility&#xD;
      of NIPE in children under 3 years of age will allow the implementation of a novel pain&#xD;
      assessment tool to our current practice of anesthetic care. This will improve the&#xD;
      perioperative pain management, in particular for patients who are unable to communicate pain,&#xD;
      with the potential to reduce detrimental consequences of postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And also determining the relationship between the NIPE scores and validated FLACC scale for&#xD;
      post-operative pain and PAED scale during the recovery from anesthesia and also to determine&#xD;
      whether NIPE values at extubation correlates with the incidence of moderate and/or severe&#xD;
      pain in PACU.&#xD;

      Pain represents a sensorial experience in response to tissue damage, that does not only&#xD;
      affects the emotional and functional domains of an individual, but also leads to multiple&#xD;
      detrimental, unanticipated and long-lasting consequences. In fact, pain has been associated&#xD;
      with cognitive disturbances, increase in cancer recurrence, impairment in brain development&#xD;
      and impairment of the immune system. Pain associated with surgical stress delays&#xD;
      postoperative ambulation and discharge, promotes the development of chronic postoperative&#xD;
      pain, and increases morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the advancement in analgesics and pain control modalities, severe postoperative pain&#xD;
      is present in up to 40% of patients. Improved pain management based on an accurate assessment&#xD;
      of patients' pain intensity has been associated with better patient outcomes. As a&#xD;
      consequence, standardized, validated instruments to facilitate pain evaluation have been&#xD;
      recommended by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Task Force on Acute Pain&#xD;
      Management. Self-report scales, behavioral scales and physiological measures have been&#xD;
      developed to assess pain after surgery. These tools, however, are applicable only in awake,&#xD;
      cooperative patients and have limited value in uncooperative and non-verbal patients, such as&#xD;
      young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, investigations have focused on parasympathetic tone activity as an indirect&#xD;
      assessment of the level of pain. While heart rate variability (HRV) is affected by the&#xD;
      balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, the high frequency changes of HRV is&#xD;
      primarily mediated by and specific to the parasympathetic nervous system. The phenomena of&#xD;
      pain, fear, anxiety and intraoperative nociception have proven to be accompanied by changes&#xD;
      in HRV. In pediatric patients, HRV analysis correlates with prolonged pain and newborn&#xD;
      comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The newborn infant parasympathetic evaluation (NIPE) is a non-invasive, standardized&#xD;
      continuous measurement of HRV. The cardiac signal is extrapolated from the electrocardiogram&#xD;
      and respiratory rate (RR) series are computed between two heart beats, resampled at 8 Hz,&#xD;
      mean centered and normalized over a 64-second moving window. A wavelet based high pass filter&#xD;
      over 0.15 Hz is applied in order to keep parasympathetic related variations only, which are&#xD;
      mainly influenced by the respiratory cycle. The NIPE monitor displays two averaged&#xD;
      measurements: the average NIPE (NIPEa) results from the average of NIPE measured over the&#xD;
      previous 20 minutes, and current NIPE (NIPEc) results from the average of NIPE measured over&#xD;
      the previous 64 seconds. A non-disclosed algorithm derived from the high frequency changes of&#xD;
      the HRV calculates a score between 0 and 100, where a score of 0 indicates minimal&#xD;
      parasympathetic tone and maximal nociception and a score of 100 indicates maximal&#xD;
      parasympathetic tone and minimal nociception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NIPE index is a modification of Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) and was developed for&#xD;
      infants and young children who have higher baseline HR resulting in a lower possible&#xD;
      variability. The ANI has shown a good performance in predicting intraoperative nociceptive&#xD;
      stimuli in animals, adults7, and older children. In adults, ANI was able to predict the&#xD;
      incidence of moderate/severe pain postoperatively and in critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, NIPE has shown promising results in the assessment of intraoperative and procedural&#xD;
      pain, and neonatal comfort. On the contrary, there is a paucity of literature examining the&#xD;
      usefulness of NIPE in guiding postoperative pain management in young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care relies on scales incorporating various behavioural parameters to&#xD;
      evaluate the likelihood of pain and the need for analgesic medication. The most commonly used&#xD;
      scales in preschool children, who are not able to complete self-assessments, are the&#xD;
      Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS), the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and&#xD;
      Consolability Scale (FLACC), and the Children and Infants' Postoperative Pain Scale (CHIPPS).&#xD;
      These scales are limited in their dependence on examiner's ability to use the tool and&#xD;
      training. Recently, the Pediatric Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (P-CPOT) has been&#xD;
      validated in critically ill children, but no data on postsurgical pediatric patients has been&#xD;
      published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative pain assessment in small children may be confused with Emergence Delirium&#xD;
      (ED), an anesthesia related complication that affects 25% children undergoing surgery. ED is&#xD;
      associated with significant adverse effects including injury to the patient and personnel,&#xD;
      damage to incision sites, exacerbated parental anxiety, and increased nursing requirements,&#xD;
      further resulting in an increased burden and cost to the healthcare system. Once ED occurs,&#xD;
      extra nursing care may be necessary, as well as supplemental sedative and/or analgesic&#xD;
      medications, which may delay patient discharge. Children showing ED after anaesthesia are&#xD;
      seven times more likely to have new-onset separation anxiety, apathy, eating and sleeping&#xD;
      problems. To date, only the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale has been&#xD;
      validated in the pediatric population, but its capability to discriminate between ED and pain&#xD;
      has been recently questioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of appropriate diagnostic tools, the management of pain or emergence delirium&#xD;
      may be delayed while attempting to treat the other possible confounding conditions that may&#xD;
      similarly occur in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children between 1 and 3 years old, scheduled for elective adeno-tonsillectomy,&#xD;
             tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy. Only patients whose parents are fluent in French of&#xD;
             English will be enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with neurological or cardiac congenital deficits, with cardiac arrythmias&#xD;
             (non-sinus rhythm), implanted pacemakers, with a history of prolonged resuscitation at&#xD;
             birth, on chronic therapy with drugs that have known effects on sympathetic and&#xD;
             parasympathetic activity (antimuscarinics, beta 2 adrenergic agonists, alpha&#xD;
             1-adrenergic antagonists or antiarrhythmic agents, tricyclic antidepressants), ASA&#xD;
             physical status III or higher and parent/guardian refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients be scheduled for surgery without an appointment at the Montreal Children's&#xD;
        Hospital (MCH) Preoperative Clinic, or with a surgery appointment within 24 hours of&#xD;
        surgery, will not be enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        As this study will be conducted with only one NIPE monitor, and it will be devoted to the&#xD;
        patient for about 1.5 hours, two consecutive patients cannot be enrolled in the study. In&#xD;
        this case, the second patient will be considered eligible but excluded, and data will not&#xD;
        be collected.&#xD;
