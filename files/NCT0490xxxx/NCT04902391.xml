      The investigators will determine, in an 8-site, hybrid Type 1 cluster randomized&#xD;
      effectiveness implementation trial, if an acute mental health care bundle, compared to&#xD;
      standard care, improves wellbeing at 30 days in children and youth seeking emergency&#xD;
      department care for mental health and substance use concerns.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators we co-designed, with parents and youth, an acute mental health care&#xD;
      bundle-a set of evidence informed practices collectively used to improve the quality of care.&#xD;
      The bundle of care includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Triage-based evaluation of risk for suicide [Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ) and&#xD;
           HEADS-ED, an assessment mnemonic (Home; Education &amp; Employment; Activities &amp; Peers;&#xD;
           Drugs &amp; Alcohol; Suicidality; Emotions &amp; Behaviours; Discharge or Current Resources]&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Focused mental health team psychosocial evaluation to guide decision-making&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Choice And Partnership Approach (CAPA) to care&#xD;
&#xD;
      This bundle of care also strives to remove the ED physician as the gatekeeper to mental&#xD;
      health care and will facilitate, ideally, 24-48 hour urgent mental health follow-up (booked&#xD;
      before the child/family leave the ED), with up to 96 hours to coordinate follow-up for&#xD;
      patients attending the ED on weekends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Research Objective: To determine, in an 8-site, hybrid Type I cluster randomized&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation trial, if an acute mental health care bundle, compared to&#xD;
      standard care, improves wellbeing at 30 days in children and youth seeking ED care for mental&#xD;
      health and substance use concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Research Objectives: (1) To determine if the bundle improves wellbeing,&#xD;
      satisfaction with care, family functioning, and health care delivery; (2) To identify&#xD;
      modifiable barriers, constraints, and enablers of bundle implementation fidelity and&#xD;
      effectiveness; (3) To test if trial intervention effects are moderated by sociodemographic&#xD;
      characteristics (sex, gender, ethnicity, culture, education, and socioeconomic status); and&#xD;
      (4) To assess the cost-effectiveness of the approach.&#xD;

    <measure>Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale 30 days after the index ED visit</measure>

    <description>Measured in survey completed by the participant using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) for patients ≥13 years&#xD;
Each item is scored on a range from 1 to 5. The total score will be between 14 and 70, with lower scores indicating poor wellbeing, and higher scores indicating greater wellbeing. Very low wellbeing is defined as a score of ≤ 45. A substantial decrease in wellbeing is a decrease by 5 or more points.</description>

    <description>Measured in survey completed by the participant using the Stirling Children's Wellbeing Scale (SCWBS) for patients &lt;13 years.&#xD;
Each item is scored on a range from 1 to 5. The total score will be between 12 and 60, with lower scores indicating poor wellbeing, and higher scores indicating greater wellbeing. Very low wellbeing is defined as a score of ≤ 30. A substantial decrease in wellbeing is a decrease by 5 or more points.&#xD;
As these scales used for the primary outcomes measure the same construct, data will be standardized and combined across age groups to derive a single measure of wellbeing.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction with acute mental health care services as measured by the Service Satisfaction Scale 10</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours after the index ED visit</time_frame>
    <description>Measured in survey completed by the participant using the Service Satisfaction Scale 10 (SSS-10). The scale consists of 12 items (parent version) or 10 items (youth version). Items are scored on a 5-point response scale with a total possible score of 60 (parent) or 50 (youth). Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction.</description>

    <description>We developed an evidence-based bundle of care to address current gaps in care. The bundle: 1) brings together multiple evidence-based assessment tools (ASQ, HEADS-ED) to ensure efficient, high-value ED-based care; 2) removes barriers to assessment and builds connections to care: Assessments are conducted by a mental health care provider and families have access to urgent follow-up care; and 3) prioritizes family engagement: A shared decision-making framework (Choice and Partnership) is used to promote children and youth as stewards of their care and support partnership between EDs and follow-up services with the duration of care determined collaboratively by the patient and their provider.</description>

    <description>Local standards of ED-based mental health care will be delivered at control sites. Site leads have determined that this care does not involve the 3 specific core innovations in the bundle. Local care standards are similar across study sites and include use of CTAS score at triage (but no mental health risk assessment tool), ED physician medical clearance and assessment of consultation need, and no consistent mental health follow-up plan. Sites that are randomized to the control arm will not adopt core bundle elements.</description>
