      This clinical trial is looking at two new vaccines called ChAdOx1-MAGEA3-NYESO and MVA-MAGEA3&#xD;
      given with patients' standard of care treatment (chemotherapy and an immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will be entered into the trial as this&#xD;
      tumour type is commonly known to have MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1 proteins on their cancer cells.&#xD;
      The vaccines contain harmless parts of these proteins allowing them to show these proteins to&#xD;
      the immune system. It is expected the immune system will 'learn' that these proteins are&#xD;
      foreign to the body. The immune system should then attack the proteins on the cancer cells,&#xD;
      killing them. It is expected the vaccines will help the chemotherapy and immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor to work better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a first-in-human clinical trial which has two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 'safety run in' stage where three evaluable patients will receive the trial vaccines&#xD;
           with standard of care treatment to confirm they are safe before opening the next stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 'rolling recruitment' stage where approximately 80 patients will be randomly allocated&#xD;
           by computer (randomised) to one of two groups (arms). Patients in Arm A will receive the&#xD;
           vaccines with their standard of care treatment and patients in Arm B will continue with&#xD;
           their standard or care treatment alone. There is a 1 in 2 chance patients will receive&#xD;
           the vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of the trial are to find out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More about potential side effect of the vaccine and how they can be managed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether the vaccines with standard of care treatment are better at shrinking cancer than&#xD;
           just the standard of care treatment alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What happens to the vaccines inside the body.&#xD;

             years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or&#xD;
             physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency)&#xD;
             is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.&#xD;

             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;

             or interventional clinical trial which does not involve administration of an IMP and&#xD;
             which would not place an unacceptable burden on the patient in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator and Medical Advisor would be acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Any other condition, which in the Investigator's opinion, would not make the patient a&#xD;
             good candidate for the clinical trial.&#xD;
