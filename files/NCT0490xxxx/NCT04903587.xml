    <textblock>
      To detect the prevalence of gonadal changes by US among the patients with CAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess the patients' radiological findings in relation to their hormonal profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  early management and prevention of complications resulting from possible gonadal&#xD;
           dysfunction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several factors contribute to the impaired fertility in CAH patients, such as androgen&#xD;
      excess, adrenal progesterone hypersecretion and adrenal rest tumours (ARTs). ARTs are derived&#xD;
      from ectopic adrenal cells that migrated to the gonads in foetal life, and their growth is&#xD;
      under control of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and angiotensin II .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The common cause of infertility in males with CAH is testicular adrenal rest tumours (TARTs)&#xD;
      , which have been well documented in CAH male patients, with an incidence up to 94%. They&#xD;
      could be easily imaged by US and MRI studies. TARTs are associated with the risk of seminal&#xD;
      duct obstruction, leading to azoospermia and permanent damage of the surrounding testicular&#xD;
      tissue. TARTs can present as single nodules , and as multiple nodules in 16% of patients.&#xD;
      Increasing the dosage of hormone therapy can cause early TARTs lesions to shrink or&#xD;
      completely resolve, while advanced lesions may require surgical removal .&#xD;
&#xD;
      High prevalence of impaired fertility is not restricted to men; as it was reported also in&#xD;
      women with CAH. Androgen excess is usually implicated in girls and women with CAH for whom&#xD;
      medical treatment is unavailable or who are noncompliant with their therapy . Adrenal&#xD;
      androgens act either directly or through the dysfunction caused at the hypothalamic pituitary&#xD;
      axis. Interestingly, ovarian hyperandrogenism could occur even when CAH is well controlled on&#xD;
      glucocorticoid therapy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Females with CAH may become infertile for several reasons, such as chronic anovulation, which&#xD;
      was demonstrated in up to 50% of the patients with non-classic CAH . Bilateral enlarged&#xD;
      ovaries, bilateral ovarian cysts, and ovarian adrenal rest tumour (OART) may also occur and&#xD;
      can be detected by US. OART impairs ovarian function in CAH females by displacing normal&#xD;
      ovarian tissue and by locally producing steroids, which interfere with normal ovarian&#xD;
      function. It should be considered when ovarian masses are detected. If detected early enough&#xD;
      and glucocorticoid therapy is received, it is possible that it will decrease in size&#xD;
      following suppression of ACTH levels. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is another common&#xD;
      condition associated with hyperandrogenism. The prevalence of PCOS is increased in women with&#xD;
      both classical and non-classical CAH. The association of CAH with ultrasonically detected&#xD;
      PCOS was confirmed in 83%, 40% and 3% of the adult patients, postpubertal girls and pre and&#xD;
      peripubertal girls respectively .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under treatment of ARTs, PCOS and other gonadal comorbidities negatively influences the&#xD;
      quality of life as well as sexual outcomes in patients with CAH. Besides, recognizing these&#xD;
      conditions and identifying characteristic US features of gonadal dysfunction is important, so&#xD;
      as to avoid misdiagnosing them as malignancies, which can lead to unnecessary interventions.&#xD;
