  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop and test social media interventions to help young&#xD;
      people increase well-being and reduce risky behaviors. The study will help us learn about&#xD;
      ways to deliver wellness information in a way that is appealing and helpful to young people&#xD;
      that use social media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be enrolled after baseline survey is completed. Participants will&#xD;
      be involved with the secret social media group they are assigned to for 8 weeks. In addition,&#xD;
      surveys will be completed at various times during and after the 8 week social media group.&#xD;
