      An interventional, open label, randomized design will be used to test safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of EHP-101 in 50 patients ≥ 18 and ≤ 55 years of&#xD;
      age with documented RMS. There will be a screening period of up to 28 days, 168 days&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study will initially be conducted with 2 treatment arms starting in parallel. Patients will initially receive a 25 mg OD or a 25 mg BID dose. After 28 days, each patient will increase to a 50 mg OD or 50mg BID dose level, respectively, if deemed to be safe by the investigator.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>168 days (24 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The MSFC consists of three assessments of walking speed, processing speed and finger dexterity. The scores are combined to provide a Z-score (number of standard deviations away from mean of a normal population) with lower scores representing greater abnormality</description>

    <measure>Disease progression measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>168 days (24 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS is an ordinal scale used for assessing neurological impairment of MS based on a neurological examination. It consists of scores in each of seven functional systems (FS) and an ambulation score that are then combined to determine the EDSS [ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS)]. The FSs are the Visual, Brain Stem, Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Sensory, Bowel &amp; Bladder, and Cerebral functions. The FSs and EDSS steps will be assessed in a standardized manner</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease progression measured by Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>168 days (24 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The SDMT measures the time to pair abstract symbols with specific numbers. The test requires elements of attention, visuoperceptual processing, working memory, and psychomotor speed. The score is the number of correctly coded items from 0-110 in 90 seconds. The total score provides a measure of the speed and accuracy of symbol-digit substitution</description>
