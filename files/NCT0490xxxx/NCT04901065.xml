  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) have been&#xD;
      recommended to detect the virus. This procedure has been reported to be painful by 85% of&#xD;
      children The aim of the study was to assess whether pretreatment with topical lidocaine&#xD;
      reduces the discomfort experienced by children during a nasopharyngeal swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a RCT among children aged 8-17 years old who need a NPS. The primary outcome was&#xD;
      pain intensity as measured by the Visual Analog Scale .&#xD;
