      Clinical epidemiological investigation and modern statistics will be used. Syndrome was&#xD;
      quantified by TCM syndrome score scale. Metabonomics, proteomics, transcriptomics,&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, xanthine oxidation method and thiobarbital method will be&#xD;
      used to detect the relevant indicators in serum, urine and tongue coating, and &quot;disease&#xD;
      syndrome cell model&quot; will be constructed to detect the relevant indicators. Objective to&#xD;
      clarify the epigenetic basis, molecular biological regulation mechanism and core function&#xD;
      characteristics of phgdh expression decline caused by PDR and SKYD of dyslipidemia, analyze&#xD;
      the correlation between phgdh, serine metabolic pathway product concentration and oxidative&#xD;
      stress level, and reveal the scientific connotation of the disease syndrome.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. inclusion criteria of dyslipidemia with SKYD and PDR. (1) subjects with dyslipidemia&#xD;
             in accordance with the diagnostic standards and TCM syndrome diagnostic standards, (2)&#xD;
             ranged in age from 20 to 80, (3) who signed the informed consent, and (4) without&#xD;
             lipid-lowering medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. inclusion criteria of NC. (1) healthy subjects, (2) ranged in age from 20 to 80, (3)&#xD;
             who signed the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria of dyslipidemia with SKYD and PDR. The exclusion criteria were composed&#xD;
        of four criteria and a patient was excluded if they fails on any of the criteria. Mentioned&#xD;
        criteria were: (1) secondary dyslipidemia (causes of dyslipidemia include but not limited&#xD;
        to hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, chronic renal failure, liver diseases, diseases of&#xD;
        the hematopoietic system, adrenal-corticosteroid or contraceptive-drug induced&#xD;
        dyslipidemia); (2) aphasias, and patients had difficulties to speak or unable to extend&#xD;
        tongue for tongue observation; (3) patients with psychosis or unable to answer questions&#xD;
        properly; (4) patients with acute infectious diseases or in the acute disease states (such&#xD;
        as acute myocardial infarction, acute cerebrovascular disease, etc.), as well as pregnant&#xD;
        women.&#xD;
