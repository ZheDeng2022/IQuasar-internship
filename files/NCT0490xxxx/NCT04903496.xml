  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the clinical characteristics, treatment, and economic burden of&#xD;
      disease of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic patients with/without established cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), or at high cardiovascular risk, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objectives: describe the proportion of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic patients&#xD;
           with established cardiovascular disease, CKD, or at high cardiovascular risk including&#xD;
           hypertension and hyperlipidemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives: describe the demographic characteristics of the last visit for all&#xD;
           patients, and the demographic characteristics of inpatients over time; investigate the&#xD;
           clinical characteristic for all patients&#xD;
