      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of n-acetylcysteine as add-on therapy with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors in&#xD;
      moderate to severe Obsessive Compulsive Disorder patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effects of the addition of n-acetylcysteine with SSRIs on the severity of&#xD;
      symptoms in obsessive-compulsive disorder patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is the fourth most common mental disorder in Bangladesh&#xD;
      and around the world. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly&#xD;
      administered drugs for treating children and adolescents with OCD. The treatment of this&#xD;
      condition has remained unsatisfactory, only 40-60% of patients with OCD respond to SSRIs, and&#xD;
      about 40 to 60% of patients with OCD do not completely respond to this drug. Researchers&#xD;
      throughout the world are involved to obtain new pharmacotherapy for the treatment of OCD. A&#xD;
      good number of evidences have proved that glutamate plays a significant role in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of OCD.N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an amino acid derivative, is a health&#xD;
      supplement, and has neuroprotective effects that target the glutamatergic system. Some recent&#xD;
      trials attempted to assess the effect of n-acetylcysteine as an add-on therapy with SSRIs to&#xD;
      improve symptoms in OCD patients. Aim: This proposed study is therefore an effort whether&#xD;
      there is any role of n-acetylcysteine adjuncts with SSRI produce better improvement than SSRI&#xD;
      alone in OCD patients. Method: This study will be a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled multicenter trial that will be conducted in the department of&#xD;
      pharmacology, BSMMU in collaboration with the department of psychiatry, BSMMU, and Combined&#xD;
      Military Hospital (CMH), Dhaka from the day of approval by the IRB to January 2022. A total&#xD;
      of 56 patients suffering from OCD will be selected according to inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. The diagnosis of patients suffering from OCD and the selection of drug and dosage&#xD;
      would be performed by a senior professor of the psychiatry department. After completing the&#xD;
      necessary formalities including informed consent of the patients, the patient would undergo a&#xD;
      selected questionnaire Yale-Brown Obsessive Scale (Y-BOCS-10) to assess the severity of the&#xD;
      disease. The patients would be randomly allocated into two arms: control and intervention.&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention arm would consist of 30 patients who will receive SSRIs plus&#xD;
      NAC. NAC was titrated from 600mg/day and doubling weekly to reach a maximum dose of&#xD;
      2400mg/day (at week-3) for the remaining 7 weeks. On the other hand, the control arm would&#xD;
      consist of 30 patients who will receive SSRIs plus a placebo for 10 weeks. The severity of&#xD;
      symptoms will be assessed after 4 weeks and 10 weeks follow-up. The brain glutamate level,&#xD;
      ALT, AST, serum creatinine, and ECG will be measured at baseline and after 10 weeks. The&#xD;
      regularity of medicine intake will be ensured over the telephone, pill count, and from the&#xD;
      patient's compliance sheet. Statistical analysis will be obtained by SPSS (statistical&#xD;
      package for social science) version 24. Paire't' test will be done to compare between two&#xD;
      means of before and after the intervention. Proportion test 'Z' will be done to compare the&#xD;
      proportion between the intervention group and the placebo group. The calculated 'p' value may&#xD;
      suggest the level of significance (significant at p&lt;0.05). Ethical consideration: After&#xD;
      approval from IRB every eligible patient will be informed about the intervention and the&#xD;
      study objectives. Patients will also be informed that they can participate or to withdraw at&#xD;
      any time without compromising their medical care. Patient confidentiality will be strictly&#xD;
      maintained. Patient's personal data regarding the name, age, sex, and other information will&#xD;
      not be disclosed anywhere and will be used only for research purposes.&#xD;
