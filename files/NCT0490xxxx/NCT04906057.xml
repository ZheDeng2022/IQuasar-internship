  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will investigate the feasibility and initial efficacy of two aerobic exercise&#xD;
      training approaches, forced and voluntary, to improve motor function in persons with multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS). We hypothesize that intensive aerobic exercise training elicits a&#xD;
      neurorepairative and neurorestorative response on the central nervous system, which may&#xD;
      improve motor function as it relates to gait and mobility. Should aerobic cycling, forced or&#xD;
      voluntary, improve gait and functional mobility in persons with MS, it would serve as a new&#xD;
      model to restoring function, rather than current models that focus on compensation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the&#xD;
      central nervous system characterized by progressive loss of motor function, cognitive&#xD;
      function, in addition to symptoms of fatigue and depression. These motor and non-motor&#xD;
      symptoms negatively affect the individuals' walking ability, functional mobility, quality of&#xD;
      life, ability to maintain gainful employment, and social engagement. Identifying&#xD;
      rehabilitation approaches that may delay disease progression or restore lost neurologic&#xD;
      function would have considerable impact in the field. The goal of this project is to&#xD;
      investigate the feasibility and initial efficacy of forced or voluntary aerobic exercise&#xD;
      training to improve gait, functional mobility, fatigue and quality of life in persons with&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Current rehabilitative approaches for PwMS focus on training&#xD;
      compensatory strategies rather than restoring neurological function. Substantial evidence&#xD;
      indicates that aerobic exercise (AE) training has the potential to enhance neurological&#xD;
      function by restoring and repairing damaged cells, leading to improvements in gait, balance,&#xD;
      and cognitive function in PwMS. Despite evidence of the potential disease-modifying&#xD;
      properties of AE, numerous physical, behavioral, and logistical barriers prevent PwMS from&#xD;
      achieving and maintaining AE of sufficient intensity and duration to capitalize on the&#xD;
      neurophysiologic benefits of training. Forced exercise (FE) is a novel approach to AE&#xD;
      training that has been successfully applied to individuals with Parkinson's disease and&#xD;
      stroke, in which the voluntary efforts of the individual are augmented, allowing for&#xD;
      disease-altering effects of intensive exercise training. During FE, pedaling cadence on a&#xD;
      stationary cycle is augmented by a motor to assist, but not replace, the voluntary efforts of&#xD;
      the individual. It is hypothesized that PwMS cannot sustain high rates of voluntary exercise&#xD;
      necessary to elicit neural repair; therefore, FE is necessary to overcome physical,&#xD;
      behavioral and logistical barriers to enhance neuroplasticity to improve gait, QOL, and the&#xD;
      ability to participate in life activities. Positive results from our FE trials in Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease and stroke have guided us in designing the scientific methodology for the proposed&#xD;
      trial in PwMS. Twenty adults with relapsing-remitting MS and mild to moderate gait impairment&#xD;
      will be randomized to undergo 1) FE or 2) voluntary aerobic exercise (VE). Both groups will&#xD;
      attend 2X/week for 12 weeks. Exercise variables will be collected for each session as a&#xD;
      measure of feasibility to determine how PwMS respond to each exercise approach. Clinical,&#xD;
      biomechanical, and self-reported outcomes will be gathered prior to, after, and 4-weeks after&#xD;
      the intervention to determine the effects of both modes of exercise on spatiotemporal and&#xD;
      kinematic characteristics of gait, functional mobility, balance, fatigue, physical activity&#xD;
      levels, and quality of life. Should our findings confirm our hypothesis that intensive&#xD;
      exercise training can have disease-altering effects, a new direction for MS rehabilitation&#xD;
      approaches would ensue, empowering PwMS to take control of their disease to improve function&#xD;
      and reduce disability.&#xD;
